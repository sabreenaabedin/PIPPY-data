The lemon juice will help in lightening the color of your facial hair. These three ingredients effectively remove hair on your face as well as other parts of your body. It is advisable not to use these ingredients on sensitive parts. Ingredients: • 2 tablespoons of sugar • 10 tablespoons of water • 2 teaspoons of lemon juice Method: • Mix sugar and water in a small bowl. • Once the sugar solution is ready, add lemon juice into the bowl and mix well. • Now apply this sugar and lemon mixture on your face in the direction of hair growth on the face. • Allow this mixture to rest on your face for 15 to 20 minutes. • Wash it off with water after 20 minutes, by rubbing the mixture gently with your hands. • Repeat this process two to three times a week to see a reduction in facial hair.

It offers least skin damage and is very easy to use.

When you rip it off, it will pluck hairs with all the ruthless efficiency of store-bought wax! Apply the paste to your face, and let it sit for a few minutes--until dry. The paste will harden into a thick mask, which you can literally grab and RIP off.

In theory, a liposome can carry active ingredients (in its the interior) to the cells and then release them by merging with cell membrane. As a result liposomes have been promoted as a delivery system in skin care. The eveidence so far shows that liposomes do not enhance the delivery of oil-soluble ingredients (e.g. retinol, lipoic acid, vitamin E, etc.) and only marginally improve the delivery of small water-soluble molecules (such as vitamin C). Even for vitamin C, liposomes are not useful, since high concentrations of vitamin C required for effectiveness destabilize liposomes. The main promise of liposomes remains in the delivery of large molecules, such as elastin or growth factor proteins. However, no commercial liposome delivery system has been clearly proven to markedly enhance protein delivery deep enouph into the skin to be useful. A variant of liposomes called transferosomes seems promising in this regard but is still experimental. Also, keep in mind that enhancing protein penetration into skin may lead to higher risk of allergic or other immune reactions. In short, most liposome delivery systems on the market do more for promotion than for enhanced delivery.

(Nasdaq: PMTI - News), a leading researcher and developer of light-based systems for cosmetic treatments, today announced that it has become the first company to receive a 510(k) over-the-counter (OTC) clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a new, patented, home use, laser device for the treatment of periorbital wrinkles. OTC clearance allows the device to be marketed and sold directly to consumers without a prescription. This consumer device was developed by Palomar and completed together with Johnson and Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc., under a previously announced agreement to develop light-based anti-aging devices. Designed specifically for use in the home and based on years of research and clinical testing, this consumer device represents a major breakthrough in the aesthetic device industry. Commenting on the achievement, Palomar Chief Executive Officer Joseph P. Caruso said, "This FDA clearance for a laser to treat wrinkles in the home opens up a tremendous opportunity to tap into the multi-billion dollar consumer skin care market with our patented technology. The professional treatment of fine lines and wrinkles using lasers has been well established and proven to be safe and effective for years in the doctors' office using large and expensive lasers. With this breakthrough, consumers will be able to use similar technology in the privacy of their own home for a fraction of the cost. This latest clearance further validates Palomar's investment in research and development in the field of light-based anti-aging treatments and adds to the list of distinctions for Palomar as a technology leader in our industry." Mr. Caruso continued, "Years ago, we believed that light-based anti-aging applications could be brought to the home. We invested significant resources in research, development, clinical testing, and patent protection to make this a reality and ensure that Palomar would be the leader with this innovative technology. We envision a strong market for this OTC device and an increase in consumer awareness to help drive growth in our professional business."

Look, of course it won't a hand held CO2 laser, and the only people who would be naive enough to believe it could erase wrinkles would be some gullible housewives. Palomar and Johnson &amp; Johnson are not some fly-by-night companies looking to make a quick buck. I'm sure they've spent millions of dollars developing and testing this product, so it will definitely have some clinical effect. It may not erase wrinkles but it will certainly boost collagen, and that means it will find an important place in the anti-aging armory, especially if it's non-invase and non-irritating.

The only difference between these and the usual cheap LED's is that the light is coherent vs. incoherent something that your skin does not care about at all. Of course calling it the fancy term "laser" instantly grabs the attention of people without sufficient background which think they will get at least partially the benefits of a CO2 skin resurfacing in their own kitchens. This is one of the gazillion similar devices cleared by FDA in the past neither of which caused a revolition in skin rejuvenation. FDA will approve anything that is not harmfull they simply do not want to styfle the market - no wonder the USA market is full of gadgets that simply don't work ...

Ahhh the cynicism. Palomar has made a home device that will soften fine lines, so as to tap into the "multi-billion dollar consumer skin care market". It will be used as an adjunct to in-office laser/light procedures, so it won't threaten their physician based products.

On the other hand reviews that Retin-A erased faint lines are not lacking at all .... Moreover, the Palomar home gadget (which is just 1000th gadget with same characteristics that passed FDA) will have at most 1/10th of the intensity of Omnilux devices, good luck achieving even the mediocre Omnilux results with that.

This would include laser, microcurrent, High Frequency, Radio Frequency, Dot Matrix..Led etc.. They can reduce sag and lift loose skin, diminish entirely or soften lines, even skin tone and texture, reduce the appearance of large pores and scars, alleviate hyperpigmentation and discolorations. They may not be as strong as those at the Drs or a Salon but they can be used more frequently and a lot of money can be saved by DIY. Are the results permanent? No. Neither are they at a Drs office or the salon. Return visits are always a part of the plan. Everything must be maintained. You don't wash your hair once or clean your house and never have to do it again, do you? You don't work out for a few months and expect the results to last forever.. And don't forget that any anti aging is not only reversing past damage but fighting future damage. That's quite a struggle. But these days it can be done.

That is why you need to make some simple changes on your habits to prevent further fine lines, wrinkles and dry skin as well as getting rid of those which are already present on your skin. Drink plenty of water, eat foods that contain anti-aging properties, get enough sleep, manage stress, don't smoke, use beauty products with care and always protect your skin from the sun.

If you can't do it yourself Timeless is a reasonably priced serum with fresh Vit c that stays stable for roughly 3 months. Also Niacinamide (B3) and N-Acetyl Glucosamine are very good. You don't always find them together easily in a ready made serum but they work well together especially on sunspots and skin discolorations. Plus they're good for your skin in general. You can buy them in powder form quite cheaply (amazon, ebay, skinactives etc) and need to do your own research on how to use them together.

This website here is a good place to start as it has studies of what has proven to work, what may work and what has not yet been proven but has potential. There is a lot of things for you to work through. To start I'd advise a good retinol product (or Retin-A if your skin can adapt) and a good Vitamin C serum..These are pretty much accepted as the gold standard in anti aging. AHA's are also considered beneficial. There are also antioxidents, peptides, green tea, hyaluronic Acid and ..well, many other things you might want to read up on. There are other devices and DIY procedures like dermarollers, microcurrent, radio frequency, Laser, massage and face exercises to consider. There's a lot more available to do to oneself these days then there use to be and a lot more things that actually work. Educating yourself is the best way to go.

UVA is almost entirely responsible for the wrinkles and other effects of ageing on our skin. (Getty) While UVB is busy mutating DNA and setting off sunburn in the epidermis, UVA can penetrate more deeply into the dermis (the second layer of skin cells) where it converts firm, youthful skin to something that looks like mine. Anyone who's spent more than $10 on a beauty product knows the key to firm skin is a protein called collagen. It comes in long fibres that form a mesh, giving structure to our flesh. UVA doesn't directly attack the collagen, it's sneakier than that. UVA activates receptors that produce the enemy of firm skin: matrix metalloproteinases. These enzymes have one job and they do it beautifully: breaking down collagen. And it doesn't take much UV at all to get this going, so even without sunburn any parts of your skin that are exposed to the sun will age. As if the collagen attack wasn't insult enough, UV radiation also interferes with the production of Vitamin A receptors on our skin cells. Vitamin A is critical for cell growth in our skin, but without functioning receptors for the vitamin to activate, our skin ends up thinning, and that's something no amount of carrots can fix. I was curious if these receptors can reactivate after sun-damage has been done ?! do they resetore themselves naturally ? I haven't found out yet, that's why I need your help to do this collaborative online research and many we can put a light upon the key to keep and maintaing healthy-young skin. Wikipedia says that Quote: Retinoid receptors are nuclear receptors (a class of proteins) that bind to retinoids. When bound to a retinoid, they act as transcription factors, altering the expression of genes with corresponding response elements. Significant age-related declines in the levels of retinoid receptors in the forebrains of rats have been reversed by supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which can restore neurogenesis.[1] neurogenesis = rebirth of neurons / receptors study : sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/03/990331063314.htm please read the full study and post your opinion, can the skin be resetored fastly by supplementation of omega 3 fatty acids EPA + DHA ? Excuse my non-perfect english but I am from Bulgaria The best regards !</string></value><value><string>It it just one study but, if confirmed, would be an interesting finding. Most likely the levels of retinoic acid receptors would bounce back after UVA exposure, for the most part, but it may take hours or even days.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>drtodorov</string></value><value><string>axel13</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>b622ef99b2307d30ae9da0a0d670769aae275cd8</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>BHAs</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6953&amp;view=previous</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>BHA's don't seem to have been studied much lately.

It seemed that you last addressed the topic sometime around 2006, and I wondered if new studies had been done since, as from what I can tell on the internet, BHAs and AHAs target two different areas, with BHAs exfoliating deep within the pore, and AHAs only being on the surface. As well as BHAs having an anti-inflammitory effect, helping redness, bumps, and also increasing collagen. i.e. BHAs may not simply be for if you only have acne.

I'm 21 years old, 22 in August. Since I was around 16/17, I've had smile line. And I'm not just talking about the fold you get while you're smiling.. I have lines that look like a wrinkle, and get worse over the course of a day if I smile a lot. If I don't smile or don't smile much, they are there but not as noticeable. I'm really depressed over this and would like advice. My 2 older sisters have them as well, so maybe it's just genetic. But I'd like to know for sure. None of us ever drink water, maybe 2 times a week and barely any. Other than that all we drink is diet soda, which we are trying to fix. I see some people say genetics and others say it could be severe dehydration. Please please help me 😢 I don't even like to smile anymore because I know how it'll look.

None of this is surprising, considering that excess cortisol breaks down tissue throughout your body. And that includes the collagen in your skin, making you more prone to wrinkles. People with low cortisol levels have younger looking face for longer The less cortisol there is in your body, the younger people are likely to guess you are, researchers at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands discovered. People with relatively low levels of cortisol can look up to four years younger than people with high cortisol levels. By the way, in people who have special longevity genes cortisol does not speed up the aging of the face. These people are in some way protected against the pro-aging effect of cortisol. Study The publication that this posting is about dates from 2012 and it discusses data collected in the Leiden Longevity Study. In that project gerontologists at the University of Leiden studied a group of several hundred Dutch people, all born in families in which unusually large numbers of people lived to an unusually old age. For the 2012 study, the researchers showed photos of the faces of the participants in the Longevity Study to a panel who had to guess the age of the people in the photos. The researchers measured the amount of cortisol those same participants had in their blood in the morning. Results After the researchers had filtered out factors such as chronological age, sex, bodyweight, smoking and medicine use, they saw that participants' age was estimated to be older the higher their morning cortisol level was. For every 0.1 micromole per litre more cortisol they looked 0.42 years older. The Dutch researchers then looked at the participants with long-lived family members, who probably carried a number of longevity genes, and the participants in the control group, who probably had an average gene package. Cortisol The researchers discovered that the cortisol level speeded up aging in the face of those in the control group only. For every 0.1 micromole per litre more cortisol they looked 0.81 years older. The figure below shows the relationship between perceived age and cortisol level in the control group. The researchers filtered out factors like chronological age, sex, bodyweight and medicine use, and divided the participants into three equal-sized groups according to their cortisol levels. The participants with low cortisol levels looked almost four years younger than the participants with high cortisol levels. Conclusion "The main conclusions of the current study are twofold", the researchers wrote in their concluding paragraph. "First, higher levels of serum morning cortisol levels associated with a higher perceived age." "Second, although the controls with high cortisol levels looked significantly older than those with lower levels, such a relationship was not seen in the offspring, suggesting these offspring have a more stress-resistant phenotype." "Additional rhythmic cortisol studies will provide greater sensitivity for confirming the relationship between cortisol levels, perceived age and familial longevity in the future."

It is made up of the outer epidermis &amp; inner dermis. The epidermis has a number of layers of cells called keratinocytes &amp; pigment cells called melanocytes. The dermis contains blood vessels, sebaceous or oil glands, sweat glands, nerves; all of which are bound together by elastin &amp; collagen fibres. The skin protects the underlying structures from outer environmental pollutants by forming a barrier layer. It helps us perceive stimuli such as touch, heat, cold, pain. It regulates temperature &amp; also helps in the metabolism of vitamin D. Factors like pollution, sun rays, stress, irregular food habits, inadequate sleep etc contribute to skin damage &amp; premature aging of skin. Thus, it is necessary to take basic minimal care of one’s skin. Basic skin care does not involve use of expensive cosmetics &amp; toiletries. One has to follow a very simple regime for skin care Diet: A well-balanced, regular diet along with adequate amount of water is all that you need. One must avoid the so-called junk food, too much of starvation in the form of dieting &amp; eating at odd irregular hours. Exercise: About 30 minutes of aerobics, walking, jogging or cycling at least five times a week is essential for a healthy skin. Sun Protection: UVA &amp; UVB rays could be harsh on the skin &amp; cause photo damage in the form of increased pigmentation, freckles, premature aging &amp; even skin cancers. Those with normal to dry skin can use a sunscreen with an SPF of 15 at least 20 minutes before sun exposure. People with oily skin should use an umbrella or a wide brimmed hat for sun protection. Local skin care: The surface of the skin contains oil, dead cells, sweat, grime, dirt, grease &amp; pollutants. If this is not removed, the skin looks dull &amp; flaky. Cleansing is an important part of skin care &amp; can be done with simple soaps or cleansers. The skin should be washed at least twice a day with soap &amp; warm water. Deodorant soaps with antiseptic agents are good for oily skin. Super fatted soaps or glycerin-based soaps are good for dry &amp; normal skin. For the skin to look healthy &amp; glowing, its uppermost layer called stratum corneum should contain more than 10% of the total water content of the body. Thus, comes the role of a moisturizer. People with dry to normal skin should use a moisturizer twice a day after cleansing. Those with oily skin should be careful &amp; use an oil free moisturizer only once a day.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>jaysam</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>acbc8e885a5ae8a2c5e55b978a626047eec20bca</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Too much cortisol in your body?

And that includes the collagen in your skin. In fact, I've read that excess cortisol breaks down collagen in your skin 10 times faster than it does any other type of tissue in your body. So while German researchers found that Vitamin C supplements can prevent cortisol levels from rising too high,when humans are subjected to stress, Japanese researchers found that the same is true for Vitamin E. Although the Japanese researchers used rats, not humans. Here's an article from ergo-log about that: Too much cortisol in your body? Vitamin E may help When you're subjected to physical and psychological stress your body produces extra cortisol, which does more harm than good. We're telling you nothing new here. According to a Japanese animal study, published in the Journal of Clinical Biochemistry, and figures from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), there's a way to reduce your cortisol level. Simply by upping your intake of vitamin E. Study The Japanese did experiments with rats. Some of the rats were young; others were of an advanced age. Some rats were given food containing very little vitamin E, and some rats were put in a cage where the air was made up entirely of oxygen. Advanced age, a vitamin-E shortage and an oxygen-rich atmosphere are three factors that boost the activity of free radicals: aggressive molecules that cause damage to cells. In this post we consider the effect of a vitamin-E shortage. Results In the young rats that were subjected to a vitamin-E [D] deficiency, after a few weeks their hypothalamus started to produce more CRH, the pituitary more ACT and the adrenals more cortisol than those of the young rats that were given a normal and balanced diet [A]. Mechanism A shortage of vitamin E increased the concentration of TBARS and other markers of free radical activity in the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenals of the rats. Apparently the activity of oxidants boosts the production of cortisol. Relevant for humans The Japanese animal study is relevant for humans, and particularly for women. According to figures gathered by RIVM on food intake, about 50-60 percent of Dutch women and 20-30 percent of Dutch men consume less vitamin E than the amount they need. Adults need about 10 mg vitamin E daily. This amount is found in a generous handful of almonds. One avocado or a portion of cooked spinach contains 4 mg vitamin E. A kiwi contains 1 mg vitamin E. Conclusion "These findings obtained in this study suggest that oxidative stress [...] induces oxidative damage in the hippocampus, [...] resulting in the hyper secretion of corticosteroid," the Japanese wrote. "It is also clear that vitamin E prevents these phenomena through its antioxidant properties." Source: J Clin Biochem Nutr. 2009 Sep;45(2):207-13.

Aside from the conversion issues of flax discussed in the previous "fish oil dilemma" thread, the milligram amounts of the omega-3's in the flax seed capsules are unlikely to provide you with the robust health benefits afforded to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.

The danger I think is in actually eating the kinds of fish that might be high in those contaminants (i.e. tuna, salmon). And of those fish, farm raised are generally found to have higher mercury concentrations. If you're looking for a good source of Omega 3 fish oil supplements, I would guess that any company (provided they don't manufacture their products with fillers and other junk) is a decent choice. If you're looking to actually buy and cook fish rich in Omega 3 fatty acids, I really like wild alaskan sockeye. They have very little (undetectable) amounts of mercury in them, they're highly sustainable, and best of all they have among the highest concentration of Omega 3's. I usually buy sockeye from a supermarket, but VitalChoice sells them too (but at a VERY high price): vitalchoice.com/product/wild-salmon/alaska-sockeye-salmon/skinless-boneless-portions I'm currently taking "Kyolic-EPA" from Wakunaga wakunaga.com/html/products/kyolic/kyolicepa.htm and VitalChoice also sells Omega 3 supplements, but also pretty expensive: vitalchoice.com/category/omega-3-salmon-oil Back to top bazmanblue Joined: 25 Feb 2008 Posts: 1 Posted: Mon Feb 25, 2008 4:42 pm Post subject: taking to much vitamin e can be very dangerouse according to recent research Back to top blit10</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>d22e45e434f87ad059073e61fe4b590c2d778146</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin and Nutrition</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Cinnamon: can it rejuvenate your skin?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=22004&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>6d8c67029aa6647c2f87e7230c4298843dafef81</string></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin and Nutrition</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>vertm Joined: 11 Jan 2006 Posts: 19 Posted: Wed Apr 05, 2006 2:41 pm Post subject: whey protein isolate Dr Todorov , I was taking 1 tsp of CFM whey protein isolate in a morning shake .

The result came in with Hemoglobin 15.4 High ( 11-15) Hematocrit 44.5 High ( 34-44) . I am guessing that the whey protein isolate is the reason for the high result.

Back to top drtodorov Site Admin Joined: 10 Dec 2004 Posts: 3254 Posted: Wed Apr 05, 2006 6:38 pm Post subject: I am not a clinician. It is plausible that since lactoferrin is an iron transport protein, it might be related to your elevated Hb and HCT). But there could be other causes. In any case, discontinuing whey protein supplements makes sense. Ideally, you may want to try getting your protein from real food. But if you insist on powder supplement, egg white powder sounds reasonable. It is also easier to digest than casein.

I really like the website btw, very informative. Anyway I was browsing Dr. Perricone's supplements, and saw that his Astaxanthin is made by a company called AstaREAL. In an interview, I remembered him saying that it was 500 times more powerful than Vitamin E, and if taken internally, one would see "diminished lines in about 8 weeks." So if this is true, what about an Astaxanthin topical cream?? I looked through his website for a while and didn't find any Astaxanthin specific cream, so I did a search on google for the company that makes AstaREAL and found that they make also make something called AstaTROL, which is "specifically designed for personal care and cosmetic products." So my question is, what might be the benefit (if any) to making a cream with Astaxanthin instead of E? Would making it be very different than the E cream? and also, why hasn't Dr. Perricone made an astaxanthin cream if the same company he gets AstaREAL from makes a topical variation of it? Thanks! EDIT: Upon further observation, I found two studies on the AstaREAL website relating to the effects of astaxanthin on the skin when taken as a supplement. astareal.com/m6_2.html also, I just realized that the very topical I'm using now has astaxanthin and pycnogenol in it! I have dry skin and bought the cream to see if it would help. So far it has been okay, but I feel my skin burning from time to time, and I'm not sure if its from the cream or from too much washing. In addition, I tried a PubMed search for either one of the two studies, and unless I'm doing something wrong, I just couldn't find them =\... So either they weren't published on there, or they never existed!

BIOTIN - WHICH BRAND AND DOSAGE' 2 . MSM - WHICH BRAND AND DOSAGE 3. FISH OILS - AM PLANNING TO BUY NORDIC NATURALS. 4. GLUCOSAMINE - FOR JOINT PAINS ? ALSO WHERE CAN I GET IT FROM? The first thing you have to realize is that there are no controlled trials with any of these supplements that has measure the effect on hair/skin quality; the evidence is all anecdotal. There are certainly some theoretical grounds for these recommendations but again, it’s untested. That being said, these supplements appear to be safe at usually recommended dosages. Now as to the dosage, well like I said, these supplements are untested for skin and hair health so we can only estimate the dosage needed from clinical trials of these compounds for other uses. Whether you need more or less of these supplements to affect hair growth, if they work in that regard at all, is unknown. Biotin has been used in the range of 1,000 mcg to 5,000 mcg, although some people have reported using 200 mg (200,000 mcg) a day without apparent toxicity. Animal studies show a prominent lack of toxicity. If you are using large dosages, I would take it over 2 or 3 doses as larger doses are positively correlated with increased renal excretion. MSM has very few studies (human or animal) and a large majority of its purported health claims originate from Dr. Stanly Jacobs who utilizes MSM in his practice. However there have been a few human studies sowing beneficial affects on osteoarthritis and seasonal allergies and they used dosages from 1,500 per day to 6,000 per day. Dr. Jacobs typically recommends higher dosages for pain relief. (Side note: although I think Dr. Jacobs’s objectivity is highly suspect, I do thick that MSM in the right dosages does help pain somewhat). The toxicity is very low but a large amount crosses the blood brain barrier. Fish oils are probably the most incorrectly-dosed supplement. The daily dosage is based upon the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, EPA and DHA. Fish oil products always list the amount of EPA and DHA per softgel and again, the dosage is based upon this amount, not the amount of the softgel. You may be surprised at how much confusion that causes. The efficacious daily dose used in most clinical trials is 1,000 mg to 3,000 of combined EPA and DHA per day. That is NOT 1,000 mg to 3,000 mg per day of fish oil though. Most el cheapo fish oil pills are 1,000 mg per softgel and each softgel contains a total of 300 mg of EPA and DHA (usually 180 EPA and 120 DHA). To get 3,000 mg per day you would take 10 capsules which equals out to 10,000 mg of fish oil per day or 3,000 mg of EPA and DHA. Some companies sell more purified fish oil softgels that contain 500 mg to 600 mg of EPA and DHA per softgel, but they are much more expensive than their 300 mg a day counterparts (however there is one exception, see below). Now is there anything wrong taking 10 pills per day of the el cheapo Wal-Mart or Costco brands? Probably not. The toxicity issue is way over blown (in my opinion, someone here disagrees though) as ConsumerLabs has yet again randomly tested several manufactures of the low grade fish oil softgels and has found them all free of pcb’s, lipid peroxides, etc. But these low grade fish oil softgels can make you burp up a disgusting fish taste and sometimes can make you smell like a fish. If you can handle those two “side effects” plus the cumbersome use of up to 10 giant softgels a day you’ll be fine. Also some people chose to use cod liver oil as a source of epa and dha so they can get the higher amounts of EPA and DHA (most cod liver oil has 800 mg to 1,000 mg of EPA and DHA per teaspoon) more easily. However (and this is also debatable) I do feel that if you opt for cod liver oil you should use a brand that is purified, such as Nordic Natural or Carlson’s). I personally think Carlson’s cod liver oil tastes better. Another liquid option would be to use liquid fish oil. Carlson and NSI make excellent liquid fish oil (which looks the same as cod liver oil but is more potent) that have around 1,300 mg of EPA and DHA per teaspoon. The toxicity of EPA and DHA is low, however your dosage shouldn’t exceed 5,000 mg a day as it may impair certain immune functions. Glucosamine studies almost always use 1,500 mg per serving is the sulphate form. It appears to be very safe. Where to buy. I almost exclusively buy my products from VitaCost Their house brand, NSI, almost always is the least expensive option and will blow away retail prices every time. The NSI brand always lab tests pure and they do not source their raw materials from unrepeatable suppliers. However, while the purity is still excellent, I do think some of their NSI formulated products are not formulated very well, thus I would never make a broad sweeping recommendation to take NSI products exclusively. Their single ingredient products are all pure and usually the cheapest on the market. Here are some links if you want to check out their products (note to webmaster, these links have a referral i.d., so if this violates the t.o.s. please delete the post or let me know and I’ll modify it). Biotin (1,000 mcg to 5,000 mcg per day) Here is the Vitacost link This can be picked up rather cheaply from most stores but the link does have an excellent price. MSM (2,000mg to 6,000 mg per day) Here is the Vitacost link The purity of MSM *may* be an issue so many companies source their msm from OptiMSM. Wal-mart has pretty cheap retail prices but if you buy the Jarrow, Source Naturals, or other well known brands from a health food store you are paying way too much, IMO. Vitacost has 1,000 mg 240 capsules for $9.99 Fish Oil (1,000 mg to 3,000 mg of EPA and DHA per day) Here is the Vitacost link The el cheapo fish oil capsules are fine so long as you take the right dosage and can tolerate the fish burp and smell (this doesn’t happen to everyone though). You can find the low grade fish oil very affordably from Wal-Mart or other stores. If you wanted a purified fish oil softgel you could try NSI’s product, which has 600 mg of EPA and DHA and it’s the cheapest option (even cheaper than cod liver oil) at only 15.2 cents per gram of EPA and DHA. Most retail low grade fish oil softgels are right around that amount but you have to take twice as many pills (i.e. 3,000 mg of EPA and DHA from low grade fish oil softgels would be 10 pills whereas the same amount from NSI’s product is only 5 pill). You said that you were considering using the Nordic Natural brand. While they do purify their fish oil, as I said before the benefit of this is debatable (although like I said for cod liver oil it is a good thing to purify). Also Nordic Naturals is very expensive. The retail cost of their low grade fish oil softgels is 74.8 cents per gram of EPA and DHA. The Retail cost of their high grade fish oil (550 mg of EPA and DHA per softgel) is 74.1 cents per gram of EPA and DHA. That’s ridiculous. Granted they have one of the few ultra purified low grade fish oil’s on the market but still. Seeing that cheap low grade fish oil softgels tests free of peroxides and pcb’s and cost around 15 cents per gram, to me that’s a non brainer. Finally, the retail cost of Nordic Naturals cod liver oil is 32.5 cents per 1,000 mg of EPA and DHA. This is why I like the high grade NSI product; it’s only 15.2 cents per gram and I get no fishy burp or smell. Also, I would stay away from flax seed oil (although you could make an argument for the flax lignans being beneficial for skin health) and those ridiculous omega 3-6-9 products. Glucosamine (1,500 mg a day) You can find glucosamine w/ chondroitin pretty cheap at Wal-Mart or Costco. Vitacost has a really good deal on it as well. While the evidence for glucosamine’s effectiveness is equivocal, (the recent NIH study didn’t turn out so well but the very high placebo response rate limited the statistic power in ascertaining glucosamine and chondroitin’s effectiveness) I still think it’s “worth-a-shot” for a few months. If you have joint pain issues, the combination of high dose fish oil, msm and glucosamine and chondroitin will probably afford moderate pain relief after a few months of regular use. However, I’m not sure whether glucosamine and chondroitin will help as they do not work as an anti inflammatory. There are some other potentially beneficial supplements for joint pain as well (5-lox inhibitors, Celadrin, etc). Finally, although this is completely anecdotal, many people have reported that colloidal mineral has improved hair health. Now I don’t believe all that b.s. from the popular MLM colloidal minerals product, and the tape they polluted us with called “dead doctors don’t lie, but it is quit possible that trace minerals have important biological function in the body and we are not getting enough in out diets anymore due to farming practices. I’m not saying they will cure heart disease and cancer, I’m just saying many people have reported increased hair thickness from using colloidal minerals. NOW has a decent trace mineral product that is cheap and low in aluminum. I hope this info help you out. Take care. -Chris Back to top cjdavis Joined: 24 Jan 2005 Posts: 196 Location: Atlanta Posted: Mon Jan 22, 2007 11:19 am Post subject: Re: okay here is the plan Quote: My physician always says 1000 mcg of any supplements. 1 mg? Even if he meant 1,000 mg that's still way to general to be safe or effective. I would think a physician would understand that. But then again even prominent physicians and "supplement experts" like Ray Sahelian apparently do not understand pharmacology when it is applied to supplements. His recommendations in terms of dosage are surprisingly low and not in line with the published research (sorry for the mini-rant =) Quote: Yes, I am officially 30 now and I want to prevent hair loss , since i have hair thinning since last 2 years especially in the frontal . I want to stimulate hair growth and grow hair VERY VERY FAST naturally Then those supplements you asked about may thicken hair but will not slow MPB or stimulate new hair growth to any appreciable degree. The best way to halt hair loss is to use an oral 5-alpha reducates inhibitor such as finasteride. That will lower DHT is the scalp but also in most every part of the body, which may not be desirable. For this reason, some people rely on topical creams and lotions that inhibit 5-alpha reductase or block the effects of DHT in the scalp. The effectiveness of this route has not been studied but topical formulations such as spironolactone and azelaic acid inhibit DHT formation or block the receptors for DHT in vitro so they may be effective topically. I still think the oral route of using finasteride with a combination of spiro and AA works the best. Now for hair growth. While the aforementioned products will help grow some hair, to really get things going you need to use minoxidil. The OTC stuff goes as high as 5% and the equate brand is really cheap over the Rogain version and works the same. However, many people feel that minoxidil follows a dose-response correlation. In other words, the higher percentage you use, the more hair you will grow. That being said the strongest OTC version is 5%. Also worth noting is that the published clinical trials have only studied 2% and 5%. There is a website called www.minoxidil.com that sells a product called Xandox 15. Xandrox 15 is a topical liquid that contains 15% minoxidil with 5% Azelaic acid and penetration enhancers. While 15% minoxidil has never been studies I call tell you with relative certainty that the 15% minoxidil solution works much better than the 5% version. Whether the addition of AA results in significant anti DHT effects is unknown but it's a nice addition for the price. That site also has topical ODERLESS spironolactone. If you ever smelled spiro, then you'll appreciate that product. Now I want to give you a heads up, if you go to www.minoxidil.com you will think that it is some scam website because it is poorly set up and looks generic. However I can personally attest to the quality of the products there and Dr. Lee (a physician and owner of the site) is a genuinely nice guy and very informative. Email him a question and you'll see what I mean. He's worked with a pharmacologist to compound the 15% minoxidil (the only 15% on the market) and his quality standards are fantastic, the site just looks stupid, lol. anyway if you wanted a purely topical regiment, I will guarantee that if you go to that site and order Xandrox 15 and topical spiro and use as directed, you WILL see good results depending on the severity of your MPB. The Xandrox 15 and the spiro cream are the only products I would order there (he has a few different concentrations) save perhaps topical retinoic acid. One studied showed retinoic acid blocked the binding of DHT for the androgen receptor thus it may be effective for MPB.

It will not have any effect on a receding hairline. There are different types of male pattern baldness, and if you don't have hair loss in the crown area, minoxidil will be of no value to you. If you want to find out the latest up to date info in male pattern baldness and hair loss, consult the book "The Bald Truth" by Spencer David Kobren. The author also has his own website pertaining to hair loss. As far as supplements used to improve the quality of hair and skin goes, there are actually very few good human studies that have verified the value of supplements in this regard. So much of the evidence is anecdotal, but to ignore anecdotal evidence(especially when there's a lot of it, as in the case of MSMs effect on hair, skin and nails) is actually very "unscientific" in itself. Try to remember that hypothesizing is part of the scientific method, and if humans didn't make observations and hypothesize, there would be no science at all as we know it. Be aware of the fact that Retin-A was originally used to treat acne, and it's effects on wrinkle was originally purely anecdotal. That doesn't mean that it didn't work though. I've used MSM with great success and I know many others who have, but as I stated elsewhere, it will not effect male pattern baldness, or I've never heard that it will. But it should make your nails, skin and hair stronger if you take the right amount in capsule or powder form, not hard tablets.

Do you find the 15% composition irritable, is there a version without azeleic acid? I've always had a "horseshoe" shape hairline but it filled it in about a full inch in the corners. At first it just grew out the tiny blond peach fuzz hairs and after a year or so those hairs became brown. I did have some regrowth in the bald area w/o peach fuzz but it took over a year to sprout new hairs; the frontal hair line really seems resistant to growth. When I used the 15% w/ propylene glycol, it did irritate my skin. He now has a 15% that does not have propylene glycol but it does have azeleic acid. However, he did just come out with a 12.5% minoxidil solution w/o azeleic acid, but it does contain 50% ethyl alcohol and propylene glycol. Apparently when compounding high percentage minoxidil solutions you need ethyl alcohol and PG as stabilizers and absorption enhancers.

We also have to prevent collagen (and elastin) from glycation, otherwise the skin (even with increased amounts of collagen) will become hard, tough and inelastic, due to crosslinking of protein molecules with sugar molecules in the collagen and the elastin. He mentions,of course, carnosine for preventing glycation. The question I have is this: is there reason to believe that carnosine supplements actually increase carnosine levels in the body? My understanding is that carnosine is a dipeptide made up of the amino acids histidine and alanine, and when taken internally,the carnosine molecule is broken down into those molecules, which then can be used to make carnosine in the body. But would the body actually make more carnosine when taking carnosine supplements than it would if it just relied on the histidine and alanine normally found in the blood? This might also depend on whether one eats a vegetarian diet or not. I read that vegetarians have higher levels of AGEs (Advanced Glycation Endproducts) in the body maybe due to lower levels of carnosine, which is found in meat. Maybe this is why Dr. Perricone claims that vegetarians age faster, or so he believes, but I don't know if it's true that vegeterians age faster. I guess it depends too on how you define aging.</string></value><value><string>Ingested carnosine gets broken down by carnosinase enzyme. However, some believe that if the ingested amount is large enough, some of it escapes breakdown and remains active in the tissues and circulation. I am not aware of any studies that convincingly prove (or disprove) that long-term use of carnosine supplements leads to sustained decline in AGE. Another theoretically useful but unproven supplement that might help in this regard is benfothiamine. Still, at present, if you want to reduce AGE, your best best is to improve carb metabolism. Check your glycated heboglobin level (Hb A1c). If it is in the bottom half of normal range, your are likely to be in a good shape as far as glycation goes. If it is elevetad or even hi-normal, reducing it may be the best thing you can do as far as current anti-aging goes.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>drtodorov</string></value><value><string>jamesherried</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>3ce127203bb055a402605f790890a88e2106f05a</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Retinoids / Vitamin A</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Tretinoin outside the fridge</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=11277&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>d58dc4cacbd801a9d28aeaa00c7eeed10c21afa8</string></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Confused, please help!

The Skinceuticals products that I am interested in are the C+AHA serum, Retinol 1%, or just the Vitamin C serum at 20%. I read that the C serum loses effectiveness. I am so confused.

I would recommend their C + E + Ferulic Acid Serum. It's better than there other C serums (or other brands of L-Ascorbic Acid serums) because the Ferulic Acid (a.k.a. cinnamic acid...it comes from cinnamon oil) is supposed to help stablilize the Vitamin C and prevent it from oxidizing. This would be good because if you buy the Vitamin C serums without Ferulic Acid, you'll have to throw the serum out after it's been opened for two weeks, because it will turn brown due to oxidation, even though you pay for a one month supply. So even though the C+E+Ferulic is more expensive ($125) , it's actually cheaper than the others because you get a month's supply and you can keep it and use the entire amount for a month. It's also good because it has Vitamin E in addition to C, and the two vitamins work synergistically as antioxidants. Vitamin C's main role as an antioxidant is to protect and recylce Vitamin E, according to Dr. Lester Packer. Another option would be to take the DIY approach and make your own Vitamin C serum.

Of course, the product you plan to buy also has Vitamin E added, but you can easily make your own Vitamin E cream (with the right form of Vitamin E, which most likely that product you plan to buy does not have), and after applying the Vitamin C serum and giving it enough time to absorb, then just apply the Vitamin E cream over it.

Ferulic acid is not cinnamic acid. However, here's the Wikipedia definition of ferulic acid, which is "4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid": Ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid or, in IUPAC nomenclature, 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)prop-2-enoic acid) is a highly abundant phenolic phytochemical which is present in plant cell walls. It may have significant health benefits through its antioxidant and anti-cancer activity, and may also serve as a precursor in the manufacturing of useful aromatic compounds. Ferulic acid is found in seeds of plants such as in brown rice, whole wheat and oats, as well as in coffee, apple, artichoke, peanut, orange and pineapple. Its CAS number is [1135-24-6] [1] and its SMILES structure is OC(/C=C/c1cc(OC)c(O)cc1)=O.. Its chemical formula is C10H10O4, and its molecular weight is 194 amu. Biosynthesis of ferulic acid is done by enzymatic oxidation of coniferyl alcohol.

You should be able to make a DIY Vitamin C serum more effective by using it in combination with Pycnogenol (patented product that contains French maritime pine bark extract), or just pine bark extract (available through www.bulkactives.com) or grape seed extract. The bioflavonoids in Pycnogenol and grape seed extract are know to enhance the effectiveness of Vitamin C. At this point, I prefer to use Pycnogenol (even though it's more expensive), because pine bark extract is much more soluble in water than grape seed extract is. One book I have(by Carol Demas) says that you need propylene glycol to completely dissolve grape seed extract(another source says you can use ethanol), but pine bark extract is 99% soluble in water, just like Vitamin C. And I'm still not sure if the generic brands of pine bark extract are as effective as Pycnogenol. If they are that would be good because they're cheaper. But my understanding is that Pycnogenol has undergone at least 36 double-blind, controlled scientific studies to ascertain it's effectiveness (although not all in regards to skin care), so at this point I opt for Pycnogenol. Also, you have to know that Vitamin C serum will not work overnite and give you instant results. Even Retin-A won't give you overnite results. The only thing that will do that is a moisturizer, but the effects are short-lived, and moisturizers wont' repair or rebuild collagen or provide antioxidant properties. To see results with Vitamin C serum , you need several to many weeks or a few to several months, depending on the individual. My guess is that some older people(with severely depleted collagen levles) might even take two years to see results, but that's just a guess.

In the past two months however, I feel like I have aged 15-20 years! I have not been very good in regards to sun protection in the past though never enjoyed being out in the sun anyway, but am determined to stick to a routine now. The speed and severity of my new wrinkles/facial change has been quite worrying. The main area that's seen the most change has been lines/creases developing on either side of my mouth (coming from the nose). Smile lines, somewhat. I also can detect a lack of collegen/skin elasticity. I've been researching like crazy but I need some feedback. Firstly, in regards to sunscreen -- are zinc oxide/titanium oxide-based sunscreens enough to prevent aging UVA rays? And can these produce the same exceleration of free radicals (from chemicals) as with other sunscreens? Meaning, do you need to constantly reapply to stop the chemicals producing more free radicals? Second, which treatment or combination of treatments have people found to be the most effective in terms of specifically placed movement wrinkles? The worry that my face is now stuck like this forever is adding to the stress and causing more wrinkles! Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks.

Has there been any change in your diet or are you taking any medications that might be contributing to your sudden increase in wrinkles? I get severe migraines and I have found that when i take pain medication, it really dries out my entire system and I can tell now, by the way my face looks when I wake up in the morning, the difference between days I've taken it and days I haven't. Yah, those nasolabial folds bug me too. But I try to rent movies with Jennifer Aniston and notice how beautiful she is and she has pretty dark creases from her nose to the corners of her mouth. Sometimes in either photos or movies they do more to cover them, but she'd definitely got them and I don't think they detract from her looks. So try to remember these things - how we can be so hard on ourselves. Stay hydrated. And both oral and topical vitamin C can work wonders. Personally I think a do it yourself vatamin C cream is your best bet to get your money's worth and to know you have something that is active and stable. Dr. Todorov sells instructions in his e-text and bulkactives.com sells the active ingredients and also has a recipe on the website.

But then you should know that it supposedly makes your skin more sensitive to the sun, so you would have top protect you r skin from the sun if you use it. You also have to know that wrinkles can be caused by different things. Some wrinkles (dynamic wrinkles) are caused by repeated facial motions, such as squinting. You might also want to take EFA supplements to make your skin more oily. I've often read and heard that people with naturally oily skin have a lower tendency to wrinkle than other skin types, so maybe one solution is to make your skin more oily by taking the EFA supplements (flax seed oil, evening primrose oil, hemp oil, etc.). Then of course there's fish oil, which is very good for your skin, if you can find a good brand that's free of pollutants. My understanding too is that the essential oils can help make you more resistant to the damaging effects of the sun.

I honestly do believe it's had a very negative effect on my skin. Especially in terms of elasticity and general fat loss, which of course exacerbates the problem. As I'm not living in my home country these days, I have to wait another couple of weeks to see my dermatologist, but I definitely want to try topical vitamin C and possibly microdermabrasion if they would help.

Flax oil is better as a source of Omega-3 fatty acids, whereas borage oil and evening primrose oil are mainly used as a source of Omega-6 fatty acids and GLA (gamma linolenic acid). If you take fish oil, it should be purified to remove toxins(pharmaceutical grade) and always contain Vitamin E in the form of mixed tocopherols (not just alpha tocopherol), otherwise the fish oil will become rancid. Alpha tocopherol alone can be a pro-oxidant if not used in conjunction with the other tocopherols. The problem is that most fish oils that do contain Vitamin E have only alpha tocopherol, which is why even they turn rancid. A good brand of fish oil is that available online through the Life Extension Foundation (LEF), and it contains mixed tocopherols, just as vegetable oils do (which protects them from oxidation). The LEF brand is more expensive, but consuming rancid fish oil is worse than not consuming it at all.

I don't know about taking it internally, but based upon the good things I've read about it, I plan on getting some and using it as a base for fat soluble ingredients such as alpha lipoic acid, CoQ10, Vitamin A, Vtamin E and lycopene, although the oil is already rich in Vitamin E and lycopene, which may be one reason why it's been found to benefit the skin even when used alone.

I think the person who posted was older, so maybe not. My OBGYN recommended taking the pill throughout my childbearing years unless I decide to become pregnant. You know, age 25 is the age where the average person begins to notice a loss of collagen in the skin. Of course you still look great and have great skin, but you are supposed to notice differences at this age. When I was 25, I didn't, but I also use sunscreen religiously and use retin-A, which is supposed to help prevent fine lines. I would definately start on retin-A at a lower dose. I have read that a higher dose of retin-A does not mean more results - just more sun sensitivity. Dr. Todorov talked about it here too I believe. Nasolabial lines...eh...I actually have an appointment with a very well-revered dermatologist next week to discuss my skin concerns - one of those being the beginnings of nasolabial lines. I think I sort of exaggerate mine - I'm just noticing mild changes in my skin. But I want to prevent them if I can since I'll have them eventually! I agree with jorena that they can be quite beautiful on some people. Your facial structure determines to what degree you will get them. I have very high cheekbones, and so does my mother. I think I am more likely to get them than someone with a rounder face. Look at Angelina Jolie - one of the most beautiful women on the face of the planet! She has them, and I think they enhance her beauty honestly. Jessica Alba is my age and she has them way worse than I do - they airbrush them away. Petra Nemkova (sp?) is a year older than me and she has them too. They are totally normal; we are just used to seeing them airbrushed. I was at the drugstore today and noticed a L'Oreal ad in the makeup section where they left some wrinkles around her nose and mouth. I was pretty surprised actually. Anyways...I just turned 27, live a pretty high stress life, and worry about my skin, and worry about worrying! We can work at preventing aging, but we are all going to age! Some of my friends have forehead wrinkles while I have none, some have really deep nasolabial lines and no lines around their eyes. We all will age differently in a way that suits us - just like Jennifer Aniston - a great example. So I say all this because I notice changes myself and don't like some of them and like some of them. I personally take marine collagen supplements and add ester C to that. Maybe borage AND flaxseed is a good idea. I don't know where you live, but at the Whole Foods store here, we have safe fish oil capsules to choose from. Women of childbearing years and teens should only eat fish twice a week. So the safe fish oil is a good idea. I have a flaxseed/borage oil combination that I drizzle on foods. I try to get my other vitamins from food sources. I also have shared the feeling of my face being "stuck like this." But I just don't look like a teenager anymore, you know? I teach, and college students think I am their age often, which is always flattering! I went out to dinner with my parents last week and was carded - hey - it isn't all that bad being 27! I think I look better as I've grown older - and I'm still young! Trying to reduce stress and be happy makes a huge difference. Err...note to Jessica!

Hi all... I'm about to turn 27 this month, and I have always taken really good care of my skin since I was a teen, starting with sunscreen. I have been on various medications that have made my metabolism very slow for the past 8 or 9 years. This year, I have been off the medications. I am 5'9" and was usually hovering in between 140-150, but with certain medications got up to 171 (I think that was my highest) making me overweight for my height and frame. So I have been off all medication for almost a year now and lost almost 50 pounds this year just getting off the medication. The weight just sort of came off without much effort, and now I am down to 124 pounds, which is the weight I was in high school! I don't diet or anything, but I do have a problem dealing with stress. Okay, so obviously I look a lot different than I did before. My face was fuller, and my face is thinner now. I was wondering about the effect of body fat in aging overall, and what opinions Dr. Todorov and others have. Now please be gentle - losing all this weight has been actually sort of traumatic for me. I had always been naturally thin and tall, and it isn't easy for me to gain weight. self-created stress from my profession probably does not help. If this is my natural body type, and I'm not trying to alter my body to be this thin through deprivation of food, does the body compensate when someone is naturally thin? I try to eat healthy and eat good fats. Any suggestions of supplements or foods I should be eating? I don't exercise because, well, I have no incentive to now. I suppose I need to find one! Anyone have any encouraging words, suggestions, or wisdom? I suppose turning 27 probably has a little to do about it as well! I look at pictures from a couple years ago and my face just looks fuller. I don't have any real lines, but I can't tell if I have aged or if it is just the fact that my face is thinner now. i use an antioxidant and sunscreen by day, and low dose retin a and a moisturizer by night. should i be thinking of antiaging cream for night? I know, I know...I expanded the subject a bit...but any suggestions and opinions would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance!

In the first study of its kind, a team of researchers led by Prof Aedin Cassidy at the University of East Anglia and Dr Paul Kroon at the Institute of Food Research, will explore whether the skin's condition is improved by a compound which gives berries their vibrant colour (called 'anthocyanin'). In a 12-week trial starting in September, post-menopausal women will consume either extracts from elderberries or placebo capsules, and will have their skin's structure and appearance measured with state-of-the-art equipment used by experts in skin science. At the same time, researchers will also test whether the elderberry extract can reduce risk factors for heart disease. "We already know that a healthy diet can help protect against heart disease and skin damage, and that a mixture of similar food components have been shown to improve the skin's structure. There is also evidence that the active components have anti-inflammatory properties, which may be important in helping people stay healthy," said UEA's Dr Peter Curtis who is leading the project. "If the results of our study are positive, it may lead to innovations in skin health products and may also give us vital information about diets which promote healthier hearts."

In addition to kale and spinach, avocadoes are one of the best sources of lutein. Goji berries also contain both lutein and zeaxanthin. Maybe sea buckthorn oil does also since it's high in carotenoids, but I have to check into that. What You Eat Can Protect Your Skin from the Sun By: Barbara Levine, R.D., Ph.D. (ARA) - By now you probably think you've heard all of the health reasons there are for eating your vegetables. But, just in time for summer, researchers from Harvard University have announced that lutein -- a potent antioxidant found in such dark green, leafy vegetables as spinach and kale -- may protect the skin from sun damage. "Lutein has been widely recognized for its eye health benefits for several years. But, our data is the first of its kind to suggest that lutein may have the potential to act as a preventative agent against UVB-induced skin cancer," said Salvador Gonzalez, M.D., Ph.D., leader of the Harvard research team. "In addition, these data suggest that lutein protects the skin against damage caused by exposure to UVB light, further validating our position that lutein is a critical component to overall skin health."</string></value><value><string>Based upon the following study and the one from Harvard, it might be a good idea to include lutein and zeaxanthin in the DIY formulas, maybe mixed into the lycopene-Vitamin E cream. Then too, consume more foods rich in these cartotenoids. One women I know swears that taking a mixed carotenoid supplement actually prevents her from burning when she goes out in the sun. Skin Care and Lutein Highlights from a new clinical study presented today at the "Beyond Beauty Paris" conference in France provide compelling evidence that lutein, a dietary nutrient available as a supplement and long-known for its effectiveness in promoting eye health, also provides specific skin health benefits. These include increasing the hydration, elasticity and superficial lipids of the skin, while decreasing the oxidation - a process that causes degradation - of those beneficial skin lipids. Topline results of the study, presented by Dr. Pierfrancesco Morganti, professor of applied cosmetic dermatology at the University of Naples, on behalf of the research team, indicated that lutein and its associated molecule zeaxanthin, when taken daily as a 10 mg oral lutein supplement, increased skin hydration by 38 percent, skin elasticity by 8 percent and the level of superficial lipids present in the skin by 33 percent after adjustments for placebo. Results also showed that lutein decreased oxidation of those beneficial lipids by 55 percent after adjustment for placebo. The study further demonstrated that the combination of oral and topical administration of lutein/zeaxanthin provided even more powerful improvements, increasing skin hydration by 60 percent, skin elasticity by 20 percent and the amount of superficial lipids present in the skin by 50 percent after adjustment for placebo, all while decreasing the oxidation of those beneficial lipids by 64 percent. Lutein, a nutrient naturally found in dark green leafy vegetables like spinach, kale and collard greens, as well as broccoli, corn and egg yolks, is present in tissues in the eye, blood serum, skin, cervix, brain and breast. It is not produced by the human body and thus must be ingested daily through food or taken as a supplement. The study, entitled "Clinical Evidence for Lutein and Zeaxanthin in Skin Health, Part 1: Comparison of Placebo, Oral, Topical and Combined Oral/Topical Xanthophyll Treatments," was conducted in Italy on female subjects, age 25-50, over a 12-week period. The test product utilized in the study contained FloraGLO® Lutein, manufactured by Kemin Health, L.C., of Des Moines Iowa. It was administered daily at 10 mg (oral supplementation) and 50 ppm (topical formulation) to subjects in the study's different test groups. "This is the first study to determine the impact of lutein/zeaxanthin alone on the human skin," said Richard L. ("Dick") Roberts, Ph.D., senior manager of scientific affairs for Kemin Health, the leading manufacturer of lutein. "It provides strong new evidence of lutein's positive role in promoting skin health and appearance by increasing hydration, elasticity and lipid content." "This research underscores the importance of thinking about skin health and beauty from the 'inside out,'" said Bruce Katz, M.D., a dermatologist and director of the JUVA Skin &amp; Laser Center in New York, who is working with Kemin to educate consumers on the role of nutrition as part of a total skin health and beauty regimen. "The benefits of taking lutein daily will be of great interest to people who are looking for new ways to improve the hydration and elasticity of their skin and help reduce the appearance of premature aging." The new study adds to an existing body of research that suggests lutein, when taken on a daily basis, may help bolster the skin's natural antioxidant defense system, helping to protect skin from potentially damaging effects of sun and artificial light exposure. A nutritional ingredient manufacturer, Kemin is committed to improving the nutrition of the world with functional products that deliver maximum efficacy through superior chemistry.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>jamesherried</string></value><value><string>jamesherried</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>b12a24d3a24e61f9d7f6c5a9c8575a9458591292</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>formulas with Argireline - copper</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=11378&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>I'm 45 years old and i'm looking for a skin care treatment plan that will help preserve my skin.

It was Dr.Pickart's 2nd generation which has not been studied much in terms of wrinkle reduction. I use Iamin myself and like it :) HTH Monica aaaskindoctor.com/skinrejuv2.html GHK Copper Peptides Studies are compelling regarding the effectiveness of copper when combined with a GHK protein peptide (GHK-CU). A study performed upon 20 volunteers showed that after 30 days, the formation of ProCollagen, a precursor of Collagen, increased 70% (shown by skin biopsy) compared with 50% formation from Vitamin C and 40% due to Tretinoin, respectively. This means that GHK Copper Peptides are highly effective in the skin rejuvenation process. A peptide naturally found in human skin and tissue, GHK (glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine), binds copper molecules, allowing them to arrive in an active state where needed. This peptide is now chemically synthesized in the laboratory. Known as Prezatide Copper Acetate (Neova), it is capable of being used by the skin. Three interesting studies performed by James Leyden, M.D. of the University of Pennsylvania (and sponsored by Neutrogena) were presented at the March 2002 American Academy Meeting which determined the effectiveness and benefits that GHK Copper Peptides provided in skin rejuvenation. One also compared the GHK Copper Peptide to retinol while another compared it to Vitamin K (for eye region). The GHK Copper Peptide gave impressive results in both studies with little irritation. Many have asked what the difference is between Prezatide Copper Acetate (Neova) and Copper Tripeptide (Neutrogena Visibly Firm). Both are effective GHK Copper Peptides. The Copper Tripeptide (Neutrogena) is a 1:1 ratio of the GHK molecule to copper and the Prezatide Copper Acetate (Neova) is a 2:1 ratio of GHK to copper, binding more charged sites on the copper molecule making it more protected for active transport. With this double protection, Neova should theoretically be more resilient to use in medically directed skin care regimens where a patient may be using more aggressive products (low pH AHA’s or other compounds) where the chemical structure of the complimentary product would try to split off the protective carrier and leave the copper without the GHK. Even with this added boost to try to prevent neutralization of the copper, I would not directly layer it with an acidic product but use them at different times of the day.

I was going to get some of this since it seems cheap and to have the right ratio. I wanted to look for non comedogenic products bc my face also breaks out easily, and I ran across the skinbiology site . I was checking the ingredients in the Iamin, and noticed the following on the skinbiology site I don't know whether it's opinion or scientific fact: "Benzoyl alcohol should never be used as a preservative for wound healing products, since it inhibits the replication of wound fibroblasts. " from this page: .skinbiology.com/copperpeptideregeneration.html#reversal under subheading- Importance of Careful Formulation of Copper Peptide Complexes -it's more than 3/4 down the page if anyone is interested....

The problem is that there aren't (as far as I know) any good comparative studies of different formulation of CP for wrinkles.

I'm using Tretinoin Cream every other night, and I switch it with Neutrogena Visibly Firm Serum, which I heard doesn't contain very much GHK-Cu....I know you don't usually recommend any brand name products since you don't want to be affiliated with any one company, but is there anybody out there that can tell me what Copper Peptides to look out for that are also affordable?

There's not enough data to definitively determine optimal concentrations and vehicles for topical anti-wrinkle use. Various companies have their own proprietary research on that, but it is not peer reviewed, not generally available and may be biased.

I think some of the supplements Renay Bishop named sound good. Omega 3's in Flaxseed Oil is a good idea. I also take marine collagen with ester c. I am bad about being consistent with it (I hate swallowing supplements!) but I know people who swear by it, and I notice a difference in my skin when I am consistent. I ordered mine off ebay from the UK (I'm in the U.S.). It is difficult to find marine collagen in the U.S. A sunscreen is a must! If you don't want to reapply constantly, best to stick with physical blockers. B.E. makeup uses physical blockers. A moisturizer/ sunscreen with a physical blocker and mineral makeup sound like a good bet. DON'T TAN!!! (obviously) My advice would be to generally eat a well-rounded diet that includes plenty of good fats. Try to stay away from processed foods and sugary foods. Try to focus on getting all your nutritional value from the foods you eat rather than supplements or a multivitamin. This way you are eating healthy - vitamins from food sources assure greater absorption of vitamins and minerals. Minimize stress in your life, get adequate sleep, and exercise (need to tell myself this more!). Renova is good. I use Retin A and only a couple years older than you. I do glycolic peels occasionally to help with my skin texture, but I don't overdo it. Your skin is still young, so you should focus on a healthy lifestyle more than anything else. I think that is far more important than wrinkle creams and other expensive measures. I'm sure you already know this, but sunscreen is a must if you use a retinoid. I know this is all common sense, but it works! Good luck!

I had no irritation at all, and after a year I happened to notice that my skin looked so good, such an even complexion. I remembered the remark of my derm and googled for tretinoin. That's how I found this forum and that's where I found out about the benefits of tretinoin for anti-aging. So I asked my derm for 0,02% in order to slowly increase the strength. After another half year I changed to 0,03% and that's where I still am. I don't want to go any higher, I have read studies that proved 0,025% is as effective for anti-aging as a higher strength with less irritation. And my skin looks better than 10 years ago (I'm 43 now)!! I am convinced that irritation accellerates aging. So try NOT to use any topical products with alcohol, try to find the mildest cleanser and tonic possible. Use regular peelings, but also the mildest ones! Just DON'T irritate your skin!! Good luck!

My understanding of the 'do no harm' concept is that ,when considering the use of topicals, if they cause chronic low level irritation, it is better to do nothing. What can we do though? is some irritaiton ok if the retin a powerfully gets collagen going? . I have very very fair skin with some wrinkles and crepeyness, even though I am 27. I have been very good for 10 years, but did get a lot of sun as a child. I really, really desperately want to turn around these mild wrinkles, and use retinoids to retard further breakdown and got a retin a micro presciption but even this is irritating my skin, even at once a week. It is a bit red but mostly just slightly flaky and a rough texture. I feel like I have created the gentlest regime possible, with cetaphil in the morning, purpose at night. I cannot do any less, and it is much worse now with the winter weather. I do moisturize and sunscreen with neutrogena. I have backed off of the retin a, in order to 'do no harm ' but i really need to reverse damage what can i do? Also, to complicate matters, I have acne , not too frequent, but does get cystic, and this is technically what the retin a was prescribed for. I dont trust my derm and am looking for another. She wants my skin to get very bad and peel and be dry, and is convinced this will help me. She has damaged looking skin anyway. And, I saw a girl about my age in the office who had clearly suffered from acne and she had the worst wrinkles so Im afraid aggressive treatment aged her and would age me. Would differin be worth a shot? does retin a micro once a week or less even work ? What would my anti aging options be ? Also, if AHA cause peeling, and irritation, then why are they ok for anti aging? Is it because the irritation is temporary? Then, coudl I use retin a infrequently, let my skin get irritated say, twice a month while it adjusts? Would an antioxidant lotion reduce irritation? please opine :) I will post pics when i get a chance Back to top drtodorov Site Admin Joined: 10 Dec 2004 Posts: 3254 Posted: Mon Nov 19, 2007 2:50 pm Post subject: Most people can use tretinoin without irriation, if they start with very low strength/frequency and slowly build up from there.

I use M.A.C. cleansing oil which doesn't irritate at all. For some people, skin will never adjust to acids or retinoids. Try lower level vit A/retinol cream (suggestions: Neutrogena or Affirm 1X) which is a milder retinoid then go to retin-A if your skin adjusts. For the cystic acne, low doses accutane 10-20mg/day will resolve the problem and it doesn't irritate skin. The anti-aging benefit of it is not clear or studied.

Dr. Todorov I am trying to apply your tips re:frequency and strength 1)strength - I use retin a micro 04% - i think it's the lowest strength available. I used to try NON micro retin a, .025% , but that was too irritating, so I think that I'm using the least irritating strenght. Please correct me if I'm wrong 2)frequency - I've been using retin a micro 04% once a week for about two months. The irritation is tolerable at once a week, but present. I tried to build up to twice a week but get a lot more redness, flaking, burning should I just stay at once a week for longer? I must be getting benefit if I have side effects, right? 3)So, my question is, is ANY irritation too much, or is some ok.

The work could one day be useful in helping older people heal from an injury as quickly as they did when they were younger, said senior author Howard Chang, MD, PhD, assistant professor of dermatology. However, Chang and his colleagues warned their finding will likely be useful in short-term therapies in older people but not as a potential fountain of youth. The work backs up the theory that aging is the result of specific genetic changes rather than accumulated wear and tear, Chang said. What's more, those genetic changes can be reversed even late in life. "The implication is that the aging process is plastic and potentially amenable to intervention," Chang said. The results will be published in the Dec. 15 issue of the journal Genes and Development. The work came about thanks to existing data from experiments using microarrays, which detect the activity of all genes in a cell. In past experiments, researchers have found a large number of diverse genes that become either more active or less active in older people. Chang and graduate student Adam Adler, the study's first author, searched through this existing data to see if those age-related genes had anything in common. It turned out that their activity gets dialed up or down with the help of the protein called NF-kappa-B. Chang said people had long known that NF-kappa-B winds its way into a cell's nucleus to control which genes were active. What they didn't know is that many of those genes regulated by the protein have a role in aging. Chang and Adler tested whether blocking the activity of NF-kappa-B in the skin of older mice for two weeks had a youthful effect. "We found a pretty striking reversal to that of the young skin," Chang said. First they looked at the genetic changes resulting from blocking NF-kappa-B. After two weeks, the skin of 2-year-old mice had the same genes active as cells in the skin of newborn mice-a striking difference when compared with the skin of a normal 2-year-old mouse. The skin looked more youthful too. It was thicker and more cells appeared to be dividing, much like the skin of a younger mouse. Chang and Adler caution that their findings aren't likely to be the source of the long-sought fountain of youth. That's because they don't know if the rejuvenating effects of NF-kappa-B are long-lasting. Also, the protein has roles in cancer, the immune system and a range of other functions throughout the body. Suppressing the protein on a long-term basis could very well result in cancers or other diseases that undermine its otherwise youthful effect. "You might get a longer lifespan but at the expense of something else," Chang said. Instead, the researchers believe their work could point to a way of helping older people heal more quickly after surgery or boost organ function during illness. These short-term applications aren't as likely to risk side effects that could accompany blocking such a critical protein. The work was supported by grants from the American Cancer Society, the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute and the California Breast Cancer Research Program. Other Stanford researchers who participated in the work are graduate student Tiara Kawahara and Jennifer Zhang, PhD, who was a postdoctoral scholar.

This finding sets the stage for the development of future genetic age-intervention therapies. “Here we show that aging in mouse skin can be reversed by blocking a single gene... These findings suggest that aging is not just a result of wear and tear, but is also the consequence of a continually active genetic program that might be blocked for improving human health,” states Dr. Chang. Using large-scale genomic microarray screens, Dr. Chang and colleagues identified NF-êB as a master regulator of aging-associated gene expression programs in humans and mice – effectively demonstrating that an increase in NF-êB target gene expression is a common theme of aging in mammals. The researchers then used a transgenic mouse model to test the effect of specifically inhibiting NF-êB in the basal layer of the mouse epidermis. Their results showed a striking outcome: After two weeks of NF-êB inhibition, both the global gene expression profile and the tissue characteristics of the aged skin reverted to that of a young animal. Thus, while NF-êB activity normally increases as mammals age, the targeted blockage of NF-êB in the skin effectively rejuvenates the tissue. “The finding that aged skin can be "rejuvenated" by a genetic intervention late in life implies that the aging program is plastic, and therefore can be potentially manipulated to decrease the deleterious effects of aging,” explains Dr. Chang Back to top rosef Joined: 16 Aug 2007 Posts: 197 Posted: Thu Nov 29, 2007 6:38 pm Post subject: This study suggests that aging is more intrinsic than one may have suspected, does it not?

I don't understand how the production of DNA dimers and advanced glycation end products - stuff we normally associate with UV exposure - can be reversed by turning off some sort of gene transcription.

Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing small molecule drugs to treat diseases of aging, announced today that findings in the journal Nature demonstrate that Sirtris has developed novel drug candidates that offer a promising, new approach to treating diseases of aging, including Type 2 Diabetes, by targeting SIRT1, a gene that controls the aging process. In November 2006, Sirtris scientists and Sirtris co-founder, Prof. David Sinclair from Harvard Medical School, published consecutive papers in the journals Cell and Nature showing that resveratrol, a SIRT1 activator found in red wine, could reduce the impact of a high fat diet, increase stamina two fold and significantly extend lifespan of mice. Unfortunately, it was estimated that a person would need to drink 1000 bottles of red wine to obtain an equivalent dose of resveratrol. Now, scientists at Sirtris have developed SIRT1 activating molecules that are chemically distinct from resveratrol and are 1000 times more potent. "The new drug candidates represent a significant milestone because they are the first molecules that have been designed to act on genes that control the aging process. For this reason, we feel they have considerable potential to treat diseases of aging such as Type 2 Diabetes," said Christoph Westphal, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals. "The breakthrough in potency we have achieved with the novel chemical entities (NCEs) means that we can obtain the health benefits of resveratrol with a considerably lower dose." The Nature paper from Sirtris shows that in diet-induced obese and genetically obese mice, Sirtris’ small molecule NCEs improve insulin sensitivity, lower plasma glucose levels and increase the function of mitochondria (the powerhouses of all cells). In another well-established preclinical model of Type 2 Diabetes and insulin resistance (Zucker fa/fa rats), these SIRT1 activators improved whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. These rodent models of diabetes are considered highly predictive of efficacy in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that Type 2 Diabetes (formerly called adult-onset diabetes) results from the body’s ineffective use of insulin. Type 2 Diabetes accounts for 90% of diabetes around the world, and is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity. WHO estimates that more than 180 million people worldwide have diabetes and this number is likely to more than double by 2030. Furthermore, WHO projects that deaths due to diabetes will increase by more than 50% in the next 10 years. Activating SIRT 1 appears to mimic the beneficial effects of calorie restriction on mitochondrial and metabolic function in mammals in vivo and holds promise for treating diseases of aging, such as Type 2 Diabetes. "We are very excited about these findings, which expand on the breakthrough data published in 2006 in the journals Nature and Cell, which demonstrated that SIRT1 activators mimic calorie restriction and extend lifespan. For the first time, the article published today shows that the novel drug candidates we have identified are the most potent SIRT1 activators ever to be published -- 1,000 times more potent than resveratrol -- and can potentially unlock a whole new approach to treating Type 2 Diabetes," stated Jill C. Milne, Ph.D., lead author of the Nature study and Senior Director of Biology at Sirtris. Westphal added, “Now we have an even more potent way of eliciting the beneficial effects observed in earlier research with resveratrol. The NCEs characterized in this study are significantly more potent than and structurally unrelated to resveratrol. These findings highlight the tremendous potential of our NCE program to treat diseases of aging, and we look forward to advancing one of these promising new compounds into human clinical studies in the first half of 2008.” Sirtuins are a recently-discovered family of enzymes that promote the body's natural defense against disease. There are seven human sirtuins (SIRT1-7). Sirtuins are attractive drug targets because some have a specialized function in mitochondrial activity which may be therapeutically beneficial for metabolic and other diseases of aging. Sirtuin therapeutics offer the potential for a novel class of drugs that can treat diseases of aging in a new way.

In his new book (on AGEs), Dr. Perricone says that research shows that oral consumption of Pycnogenol (in sufficient amounts) can protect collagen and elastin from the damaging effects of the MMP enzymes, and it does this by binding to the collagen and elastin. He says that research shows that Pycnogenol's effects go far beyond that of an antioxidant. It even increases insulin sensitivity in diabetics, for example. Inhibition of NF-κB activation and MMP-9 secretion by plasma of human volunteers after ingestion of maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) Tanja Grimm,1 Zuzana Chovanová,2 Jana Muchová,2 Katarína Sumegová,2 Anna Liptáková,2 Zdeňka Ďuračková,2 and Petra Högger1 1Institut für Pharmazie und Lebensmittelchemie, Bayerische Julius-Maximilians-Universität, Würzburg, Germany 2Department of Medical Chemistry, Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovak Republic Received November 5, 2005; Accepted January 27, 2006. This article has been cited by other articles in PMC. French maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol®) displays a variety of anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. Aim of this study was to determine whether human plasma after oral intake of Pycnogenol contains sufficient concentrations of active principles to inhibit key mediators of inflammation. Blood samples from seven healthy volunteers were obtained before and after five days administration of 200 mg Pycnogenol per day. Plasma samples statistically significantly inhibited matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) release from human monocytes and NF-κB activation. Thus, we provide evidence that bioavailable active principles of Pycnogenol exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibition of proinflammatory gene expression which is consistent with documented clinical observations. We suggest that our ex vivo method is suitable to substantiate molecular pharmacological mechanisms of complex plant extracts in a more focussed and rational way compared to in vitro studies by taking into account the processes of absorption and metabolism.

Help! I just had my hormone levels tested and I apparently have estrogen dominance, which is really common in women. You all may already know, but in case you are not familiar, you can have really low estrogen levels, but even lower progesterone and have e.d. You can also have really high estrogen levels, and low or normal progesterone levels. It is the ratio between the two hormone levels that creates the imbalance. I personally have normal estrogen levels and low progesterone. At age 27, my progesterone is supposed to be in the 300 range and it is in the mid 100's. I have a progesterone cream with dhea and some other things that was specially made for me considering my results. The thing that worries me is the age acceleration thing - ugh! Why does that have to be a side effect!? I was wondering if Dr. Todorov or someone here could explain how this affects skin aging. Apparently I have most likely had this problem for 10 years! I have the cream, but I am sort of afraid to use it, since I heard it can make you feel sort of batty. Other side effects of e.d. are depression and anxiety, which i have had major problems with for that's right - 10 years! So...I was just wondering if anyone else has come through this and used progesterone cream and what they experienced. Or if anyone can talk about the aging acceleration thing. I still look younger than my age, want to get my body into balance. Hopefully I will feel better. But this progesterone cream has been sitting around because I am afraid (may sound silly, but I really hate trying new medications or even taking tylenol!). They also said to use it places where I have fat. I'm very thin, and I only have fat on my chest and the lower regions. I hope it's enough. I also have stretch marks on my chest (ugh!) and they said the thinner the skin is, the better the absorption. Will using the progesterone cream worsen my stretch marks or thin my skin further? What will the effect be? Thanks in advance.

(It turned out they had just tested me too early in my cycle, before it had kicked in.) It is very important that they test you mid-to-late cycle. Anyway, I also read-up on hormones, and nowhere did I read that either Progesterone or DHEA will make you "batty"! I didn't notice any mood changes (good or bad) during the time I was using the cream. The only side-effect I had was ance, but I think that was only because I hadn't really needed it in the first place, so I ended up with too much Progesterone. The instructions I got, were to apply the cream in areas with good blood flow. Mainly, the face, neck, upper-chest, and inner-arms.

I read somewhere that Skinceuticals only really lasts for a month and then begins to oxidize -- is that true? does it become harmful? is that also true for cellex-c? I have tried the DIY but really didn't like the monistat as a base -- are there any other suggestions? Also, I find it a little disconcerting to buy these bulk products for DIY and get them in the mail - is bulkactives reputable -- so I know what I am getting? (I hope I don't sound paranoid -- it's just new to me...) thanks!!

Make sure you check the date of manufacture when you purchase. As far as becoming harmful, I read a study (sry don't have the link) about oxidized Vit C being harmful for your skin, but I don't think that's going to be a problem with the Skinceuticals serum unless it's very old or has been kept in warm, light environments with a lot of oxygen. I tried the Monistat base too and didn't like the way it made my skin look like a corpse's. I'm now using the base cream from garden of wisdon and just got through my first weekly batch (about 1/2 oz) of 10% Vit C + 1% E. This week will be trying 15% C + 2% E + CoQ10. I apply every morning and keep the mix in the fridge. I purchased my current vit C and tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate from bulkactives and haven't heard any negatives about them yet. They get their products from China, don't know if that's a problem with the product being influenced by long delivery times to their center here, but I'm sure they know what they're doing. Other sources you can look in to are gardenofwisdom.com, theherbarie.com, skinactives.com.

The UVA factor will be 10-15 which is adequate. ZnO has very broad and flat spectrum of UV suppression. The problems with the physical sunscreens are usually whiteness (even with micronized versions), collection in pores and around flakes and hairs (of beard) creating 'powdery' look, possible uneven protection if the layer on skin is not even enough and most importantly they can't achieve UVA factor higher than 10-15. UVA factor of 10 means that it blocks 1-1/10 = 0.9 = 90 % of UVA radiation.

The zinc oxide particles are micronized so that, despite the high concentration, the product applies very cleanly and smoothly on the skin. It will make you look a bit greasy, but it leaves none of the white residue I've seen in other zinc forumulations. It is also loaded with grapeseed and gren tea extract, which should provide good antioxidant protection. I was wondering whether it was wise to apply an SPF 15 moisturizer with absorbable sunscreens (oxybenzone, homosalate, octinoxate, octisalate, etc.) below the zinc sunscreen. From my understanding, you seem to be saying that the ZO alone is enough for broad spectrum protection, even though it is an occulsive and not an absorabable cream.

Dr. Orit Bossi, doing doctoral research at Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of Zecharia Madar at the Hebrew University and Shlomo Grossman of Bar-Ilan University say a problem with many of the commercial antioxidants currently found in stores that are said to retard the aging process is that they oxidize quickly and therefore their efficiency declines with time, "The antioxidant which I used in my research is able to withstand high temperatures, is soluble in water and does not oxidize easily and thus remains effective over time," Bossi said in a statement. However, Bossi did not reveal the plant source she used to derive the anti-oxidant, since the research is in the process of being patented. Bossi said an excess of free radicals, from aging or ultraviolet radiation from the sun, breaks down of the collagen and elastin fibers in the skin creating wrinkles.

Mandelic acid is really the least irritable exfoliator I know. I've found that if I use it twice per day my skin gets tight (that's dead epidermis) and starts to peel and flake. The manifacturer claims that if you continue with application the peeling and flaking will stop but my experience doesn't show that. The most I can use it is once per day. It controls pimples but not at 100% level. The Nucelle serum has a nice base which is partially silicones and have a very nice matte look when it dries out. Some people claimed that Mandelic acid helps with enlarged pores, acne scarring and spider veins. My observations (a few months experience) shows there isn't such a thing ... It is just the nice base of the serum covers skin defects like that ... The Vivant formulation is 15% as far as I remember and supposedly 'cleaner' than Nucelle although I never had problems with Nucelle - it didnt break me out. The price of Vivant though is inflated compared to Nucelle. These are simple exfoliators and should cost at most $5/oz if you ask me...

I agree that these things shouldn't cost much, but even nucell costs more than $5 per oz and it seems to have a lot of unecessary stuff in it. You say you actually get flaking with mandelic? Is that only when used 2x per day or 1x a day as well? Do you take breaks from using it? Have you tried the 15% version as well? Sorry for so many questions!

I haven't tried the 15% first cause it will be too strong for my skin, and second it's overpriced.

This is a copy and paste: "Rumors on Amatokin: a skin stem cell wrinkle cream? September 27th, 2006 Is Amatokin the first product to harness the potential of your own stem cells to reduce serious wrinkles? From Businesswire: This “super-secret” wrinkle cream, called Amatokin, is not really a cream at all, but a “highly efficient ‘barrier-neutral’ emulsion” containing a unique polypeptide compound (known in official circles as polypeptide #153). This meta-peptide was developed 62 miles north of St. Petersburg, Russia in a high-security lab . The original goal was to find a better way to help burn victims heal, but the real money is in harnessing the power of stem cells to renew old skin and make it young. … Amatokin is the most controversial anti-aging skin cream in more than three decades. …While the public debate rages about the use of stem cells from fertilized human eggs, most people don’t realize that human skin is the largest repository of stem cells in the body. …If Voss Laboratories succeeds in bringing Amatokin to the American market for a price of under $200 for a 30-day supply, industry sources say Amatokin could be the most sought-after formula to ever hit the “anti-wrinkle, anti-aging market.” Bottom line: The ability of Amatokin and stem-cell science to deliver wrinkle-free skin remains mostly rumor – but a very persistent one. 'Plazan did it long before amatokin . Research-and-production enterprise “Plazan” has worked in the market of cosmetics and medicines since 1991 and is a group of highly skilled experts. They are doctors and candidates of medical, pharmacological, and biological sciences. Many of These specialists have been working for numerous years in structures at the academy of sciences for the Russian Federation. From as far back as 1986 some employees of the company had been engaged in the development and study of placental cell preparations. In 1989 at The Russian Academy of sciences “Plazan” won a grant for innovative activity for research of biologically active placental cell extracts, and in 1991 the placental cell preparations developed by the company where entered into clinical tests by the health authorities. Since 1998 “Plazan” is the only company officially recognized as the developer of placental cell preparations by the Ministry of Health for Russia. ——————————————————————————– Plazan preparations created by the company’s scientists have passed the closing stages of clinical tests by the Pharmacological committee for The Russian Ministry of Health. At present, its activity is used in the Plazan cosmetic series. (Creams for skin care, hair care, and face masks preparations). The approach to cosmetics from a medical point of view has enabled them to create highly effective skin care products. The latest development of the Plazan series is the professionally hand picked set of natural components, which corresponds to your type of skin, allowing you to feel attractive and self-assured. The company has its own research laboratory, which is engaged in a system of allocation for the stabilization of placental components, it creates new medicinal forms that act as a base for the Plazan cosmetic range. After 15 years of experience in laboratory, testing “Plazan” has developed a comprehensive quality control system for raw materials. Beginning at the source, every donors’ tissue (placenta) goes through a virological, microbiological and histological control. Once in the laboratory, the active ingredients are extracted and the material undergoes a second viral and microbiological test. A further independent analysis is carried out on samples at the Ministry of Health, and finally, product samples are tested at the State Sanitary Control agency before being issued a Quality Conformity certificate. Only after this final check is approved that our products are authorized for distribution and sale. This four-stage control system assures that Plazan cosmeceuticals are manufactured at the highest quality levels in accordance with World Health Organization requirements. ——————————————————————————– Quality control and credibility is unquestionable. Firstly, the aspect of Plazan beauty products reflects their stated ingredients. Secondly, the active ingredients undergo rigorous quality testing from source to product in full compliance with the requirements of the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health. Thirdly, Plazan beauty products are developed without chemical, physical or electromagnetic intervention, thus guaranteeing the efficacy of their active ingredients. Plazan openly state all product ingredients and active components and explain the reason for each of them and the benefit gained by their use. Plazan natural skin care products are made with all-natural, compatible components that provide real benefits without negative secondary effects and this enables us to be totally honest in all aspects of product ingredients, processing, manufacturing and behavior. Plazan openness policy is the best guarantee our customers have of product quality and efficiency, and a clear demonstration of the confidence we have in Plazan cosmeceuticals. 'Plazan” is a dynamically developing company, which leads in both science, and the manufacturing industry. The quality of our products set them apart from other brands, allowing the consumer to estimate it at its true worth.' ” I think it also stated that products with this ingredient would be available in the U.S. by summer of 2007....I'll go back and double check that. alarson Back to top alarson Joined: 05 May 2005 Posts: 26 Posted: Thu Jan 04, 2007 12:57 pm Post subject: Here's some more info on it: Is Amatokin the first product to harness the potential of your own stem cells to reduce serious wrinkles? Rumor Source - Times Online A new anti-ageing face cream, called Amatokin, is based on a peptide discovered accidentally by Russian scientists investigating cures for hepatitis C, Aids and HIV. The cream has been tested on burns victims and surgery patients, and is said to produce astounding results. It should reach the UK in about a year. News - Medcompare Source: Voss Laboratories Should Stem Cell Technology Be Used To Make People Look Younger? Voss Laboratories™ Responds To Controversy Over 'Underground' Skin Cream, Amatokin™ In reply to the heated debate over the controversial wrinkle cream, Amatokin, and the use of stem cell technology to make you look younger, Voss Laboratories once again issued what's become its patented response ... "No Comment." Kerry Pack, spokesperson for Voss (the exclusive distributor of Amatokin) added, "We simply do not want to be part of this growing debate between the medical establishment and the cosmetic industry about the appropriate use of stem cell research. We are perfectly happy to allow Amatokin to remain the 'underground' cult phenomenon it has become. Our selective clientele know how to get their Amatokin when they want it." The Amatokin Story ... So Far Rumors linking some of the most famous faces in Hollywood (both male and female superstars) to a high-tech "mystery" cream have been vehemently denied. Noted Park Avenue cosmetic dermatologist, Deborah Sarnoff MD, says only "My lips are sealed." A trip to the official web site (www.Amatokin.com) yields no information (but you can leave a message). Attempts to find a tube, a jar, a bottle ... or whatever else it may come in ... have ended in frustration. Yet the buzz gets louder ... the rumors persist. Does this underground, stem cell-based, anti-aging, wrinkle cream really exist? Well, the answer is yes ... and ... no. This "super-secret" wrinkle cream, called Amatokin (pronounced am-a-toke-in), is not really a cream at all, but a "highly efficient 'barrier-neutral' emulsion" containing a unique polypeptide compound (known in official circles as polypeptide #153). This meta-peptide was developed 62 miles north of St. Petersburg, Russia in a high-security lab (complete with razor wire and machine-gun-toting armed guards ... no kidding). According to researchers who have seen the original in vitro data, the results were stunning. If Amatokin works as advertised it will be the first product to harness the potential of your own stem cells to reduce serious wrinkles. Finally, a real, non-invasive breakthrough in skin care that doesn't involve needles, injections, peels or a visit to the doctor's office. Amatokin could really be "a miracle in a bottle." Simply put, Amatokin may be the first and only topical compound shown to highlight the expression of stem cell markers in skin tissue. And if so, Amatokin is the most profound advancement in the skin-care sciences in more than three decades. So why isn't everyone using Amatokin? Two reasons. First, it isn't commercially available in the United States. "Rumor has it that a major French cosmetic retailer has a limited supply of Amatokin at its flagship Champs-Elysees facility," said a source that has asked not to be identified. "But you won't find it on any shelf. I understand they keep Amatokin behind the counter and you'll have to ask for it by name ... and if you're not a 'preferred' customer you won't stand a chance in hell of getting a bottle." Second, in the United States people are bidding exorbitant amounts of money on places like eBay for a product that is selling for approximately $200 per ounce in Europe. Nevertheless, cosmetic industry insiders familiar with Amatokin research are convinced that consumers will pay just about any price for results this spectacular. If Voss Laboratories succeeds in bringing Amatokin to the American market for a price of under $200 for a 30-day supply, industry sources say Amatokin could be the most sought-after formula to ever hit the "anti-wrinkle, anti-aging market."

What you have described is true of many $10 drugstore brand face creams. Many creams feel good on the skin, or optically lessen dark under eye circles with reflective particles, or absorb into skin well. What makes this product better or special given the placentall cells in it? Has Plazan firmed sagging skin? Has it alleviated any wrinkles, scars or indentations on the skin? Reduced redness?? Or, is it just a nice feeling moisturizer?

I don't know about scars etc, But yes the plazan collagen cream has helped reduce wrinkles considerably. I am also attracted to the placental cell theory , putting cells back into your body that are identical to your own skin cells . as they say .. your skin is not made up from plant, fish , animal, or whatever cells. so how do you expect your body to accept or harmonize with products produced from the above..

I agree that it is most appropriate to use human-sourced cells (or human-sourced growth factors, etc.) as opposed to animal cells or plant cells, but I am NOT at all certain that topical application of cells, human or otherwise, has any positive affect on the skin whatsoever. It seems to me that if Plazan had products that made actually remarkable improvements in the skin, it would be much more popular and wellknown by now. It's not that new of a product line. Just a thought.

I have tried so many cleansers for oily skin, and they all work for the first hour, then my skin gets very greasy and shiney. I'm using an oil free day time lotion, and at night I'm using Retin-A. I know that using a cleanser that strips away all my oils just makes my skin create more oil in the end, so I have tried to use a cleanser without any irritants or sodium laureth sulphate and without any drying soaps, but it still gets very greasy an hour after I wash and apply my oil free face lotion. Are there any cleansers there that help to heal my skin so that it won't produce so much oil after it's been washed? Right after I wash my face, my face looks so perfect!! Even right after I apply my lotion, but an hour later.....I look so creepy! and my pores look huge and i look all greasy and sweaty, even though I'm not sweating! Again, I don't use any irritating cleansers, my cleanser doesn't even foam up since it doesn't contain any soaps or sodium laureth sulphate. Ive tried all types of cleansers....Even Dove Soap for Sensitive Skin....

Whether it produces more oil when 'stripped' with the cleanser is a matter of debate. I personally was never able to confirm it beyond doubt. Not irritating your skin is a good idea but not because of the oil. You have two options: 1. Use mattifiers like Monistat powder gel or anything that contains Vinyl Dimethicone, silica powder, talk etc 2. Regulate the oil production with low doses Accutane (5-10mg/day depending how oily you are or how hot the weather is) or if you are female, some antiadrogens (Spironolactone) will help regulate the oil too.

I've heard some people tell me that they have used "cold creams" to wash their faces and it has worked really well. My mom has always used Nivea cream to wash her face and remove make-up. She is 56 and looks amazing! Anyway, I'm a guy, and I was thinking of using Aveeno's Creamy Moisturizing Oil which contains Sesame Seed Oil, Oat Kernel Oil, and Sweed Almond Oil. I've also been thinking of washing my face with Emu Oil. I'm currently using biofermented sea kelp gel to wash my face and see how the results will be this week. So far I have used products such as Cliniderm's Gentle Non-irritating Cleanser with no sodium laureth sulphates, Spectro Jel, and Dove Soap Sensitive Skin (as Dr. Todorov has recommended on this site). None of them help with my skin at all....Especially the Dove soap makes my skin VERY ichy afterwards. I use Monistat Chafing Relief Jel too, and I have noticed that it only keeps me looking matte for an hour or two, then it gets all oily again. And I have to keep applying it all during the day. And the problem is not that I use too little either...I use quite a lot as if I were applying a cream on my face. I just feel so hopeless and worrying that I'm damaging my skin further. I already have a visible wrinkle all across my forehead... I'm using Retin-A at night every other day to see how that will help will the oil regulation. During the day time I use Complex 15 Daily Face Cream which seems to be most watery face lotion I can find on the market. But it still leaves me greasy an hour later... Anything I put on my face leaves me greasy within an hour, including Aloe Vera Gel, which leads me to think it's not the creams, but it must be the way I'm washing my face, or some hormonal inbalance I have. Complex 15 contains: Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, PEG-40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Glycol Stearate, Myristyl Myrisate, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Magnesium Aluminum Silicatge, Diazolidinyl Urea, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA. I've never heard of Accutane. Is it a medication I can take in a pill form, or an ance cream?? Any help would be a godsend!!!!

I seem to have all the symptoms that a lot of people who use it have as well. I DO have acne on my shoulders and upper arms, and these little white bumps that grow underneath my skin on my shoulders, and the skin on my shoulders is oily too. I guess this leads me to think that my oily skin on my face must be treated with this drug. So you say I should start on the doses you recommended?? Is it ok to use Retin-A while on Accutane? I'm sorry to ask so much, but I'm getting really excited to have found a possible solution to my problem I have suffered from since a teenager!

Their action is different because Accutane enters the blood stream and can regulate whatever organ/process it wants like a hormone, retinA does not lead to systemic concetrations of the active and acts locally on the skin. Illustration of that is that accutane reduces sebum production while retinA doesn't. Low dose Accutane is 10mg/day. Use vaseline on lips every night. The sebum production cuts down at the end of the second week. It's best not to use retinA or other anti-acne ingredients while on Accutane cause it makes skin more sensitive and it will be too much. For more info on lower doses accutane read the blog forum.rosaceagroup.org/viewtopic.php?t=7125&amp;start=0 The thing is that Accutane has to be taken forever to keep the oil down. Some people told me that a maintenance dose of like 20 mg / twice per week works well. If you stop Accutane completely, the sebum will come back.

This is just not enough to produce phenotypic feminizing effects. Even if it did compete for estrogen receptors, your body would simply downregulate its estrogen production. James is right about the resveratrol doses. David Sinclair gives his rats higher doses per body weight than you would find in any of the resveratrol supplements on the market, although I believe he himself only takes 5mg. Not to mention, the molecule is so unstable that unless you're getting pharmaceutical grade then I wouldn't even bother.

Importantly, sirtuins, endogenous enzymes, induce autophagy which is the metabolic process whereby damaged cellular components are recycled. This is supposedly similar to what happens in calorically restricted animals. So, it is claimed that resveratrol (and its analogs which are being developed) is actually a caloric restriction mimetic. This has obvious appeal since people might presumably be able to reap the benefits of CR without changing their diet. From my readings, 250mg or more per day is necessary to induce this effect. Which I find remarkable since this is hundreds of times more than you would find in a glass of red wine. But wasn't it originally those healthy people drinking only a few glasses of wine a day who inspired this analysis? Interesting how resveratrol has shown a much deeper connection to "anti-aging". Some people may be getting certain side effects from particular resveratrol formulations due to high amounts of emodin, a compound which is derived from the Japanese knotweed from which resveratrol is simultaneously extracted. Often these extracts contain 50% or less resveratrol. Anyone who is taking high doses of resveratrol should consider using a higher purity. 98% supplements are out there. Perhaps they would have fewer side effects. At the very least, one would be able to judge whether it was the resveratrol and not something else that was the problem.

What do do about nasolabial folds? 1. What you are doing with topicals as long as you've done research on the products. Film forming products like elastin (or collagen) topicals don't produce elastin or collagen in the skin, but act as "anti gravity" agents by holding the skin up 2.Electro stimilation of the muscle will also help in keeping the muscles tight which in turn slow the malar fat pads from dropping further faster. They will drop eventually anyway while gravity does it's inevitable thing. 3. Manual stimulation. Massaging the fat pads back into place so to speak or doing face excercises. Not obsessivly of course. 4. Oral Supplementation. Digesting supplements which aid in the production and repair of muscle and skin tissue. 5.

Does anyone have any suggestions, because so far I have only found one product that looks promising? I am looking for a product that has elastin. The product that I have been using is Elastin &amp; DMAE Nightcream.I had no idea what DMAE was, so I looked it up online and found out that it stimulates acetylcholine, which improves muscle tone. It does make sense that in order to have good elasticity in your skin you must have good muscle tone as well to support it. Muscle tone reduces as you get older, which I did not know. This night cream combines elastin (skin’s elastic fibres), which enhances your skins elasticity, and DMAE. So the combination of both is supposed to give you better results and firmer skin. I only just started using it, so I have not seen any long-term results.

I also have some spots on side of cheeks, not on cheek bone but below the cheeck bone. They do get darker in the summer time. One spot is on bridge of nose and it is white in center with a darker coller around the edge of it. My spots are not dark brown, they seem more tan. I would say my complexion is light to medium, honestly i have no idea I always have tanned, yes I know bad, bad bad. I would say I am lighter complected. I have blue eyes, brown hair. I am afraid this is melasma as I also have vascular rosacea so this will be very hard to treat. I want/need to get IPL for rosacea but am afraid now since I probably have melasma which IPL will make it worse.

Hi, Are you talking pimples? You also said dark spots so I'm guessing also from pimples. One thing I read that really works for me is to use baby powder on your bottom. The article I read said that lots of folks break out there because of the extra moisture. I used to break out too, but not anymore. It totally helped. When I get out of the shower, I put on a lotion with alpha hydroxy acids in it to even skin tone and smooth. When that's all soaked in, I use Johnson's Lavendar and Chamomile Baby Powder.

I started researching and found out it blocks estrogen, which I take as part of my HRT. If you are a male it probably won't affect you that way, but females should be careful. I am now back on my lower dose. There have been many reports of high doses causing joint pain in males and females. It doesn't seem to affect everyone that way though.

This was the first one I came across. It's actually supposed to help prevent breast cancer due to this effect. I guess it doesn't actually block estrogen but it blocks some of the effects estrogen has on the body. I even read in one scientific forum that menustruating women might not want to take it because of this. I know from my experience of upping the dose considerably that I started to have side effects. On a lower dose I'm fine. Back to top drtodorov Site Admin Joined: 10 Dec 2004 Posts: 3254 Posted: Tue Mar 31, 2009 3:01 pm Post subject: Have you come across references/abstracts the actual studies?

The symptoms you mentioned are not particularly consistent with estrogen blockade or low estrogen. Resveratol may have produced the side effects you felt via another mechanism. Back to top delta Joined: 22 Feb 2008 Posts: 29 Posted: Wed Apr 01, 2009 10:12 am Post subject: Night sweats and hot flashes are definitely caused from low estrogen. Whenever I get those I know my estrogen levels have fallen too low. This improved after dropping back to the lower dose. I don't think low estrogen caused the aching joints, but that got better also on the lower dose. From what I've read, the affect on estrogen that resveratrol has is a good one in its ability to possibly help prevent breast cancer. One just has to find a dose that doesn't cause unbearable side effects.

He says that #1 is Resveratrol Ultra, listed below, and you can get a free trial. One main concern I have is this: even though they claim it reduces wrinkles, if this product is so good at causing you to lose weight (i.e. excess fat), will it also cause you to lose volume (e.g. fat) in your face? If so, that may not be a good thing, especially for some people who don't need to lose fat. If anyone has any experience with this product, or any resveratrol product, please share your experience in this regard. Does resveratrol (taken in this high of a dose) cause loss of volume in the face? This product is hands down the best Resveratrol product that we have tested. This is the same Resveratrol ingredients featured on Oprah and 60 Minutes. The free trial arrived just a few days after ordering and all of our reviewers started seeing results within the first week. Reviewers had reduced appetites and wrinkles as well as increased energy levels. Every single reviewer had at least some weight loss, with one person losing almost four pounds the first week. Resveratrol Ultra is the best product we've reviewed and a great choice for anyone looking to add Resveratrol into their diet. They have a free trial available as well. The results from this product exceeded our expectations 100% which is probably the reason why Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Aniston have reported using this great product.

There are a number of stable forms of Vitamin C out there. From what I have read, although this form is stable, there seems to be question as to whether or not it can penetrate the skin at all, and it is said, it does not convert to L-ascorbic acid in the skin. That’s just what I have read. It is, though, considered an antioxidant. It goes by the name of Ascorbyl Methylsilanol Pectinate. I am not a chemist, nor by any means, an expert in chemicals and chemistry. Part of the structure of this form of Vitamin C, is a polymer, which may be the reason why it does not penetrate the skin. Instead, it sits on the surface and simply provides the skin some protection. The DCL C Scape Serum, you have mentioned, to me, is not that impressive. My concern is the amount of alcohol in it. Wow, right up there at the top. My skin is wrinkling as I type this response. SD Alcohol is a popular and inexpensive solvent. The company needs that much alcohol in their serum to break down the molecular structure of the Ascorbyl Methylsilanol so as to aid in its “absorbability”. That much alcohol could cause great sensitivities and, long-term use of a product with that much alcohol in it, seems “skin wrecking” to me. The formulation also does not contain anything in it to really counteract the drying side effects of the alcohol. Not worth the money; there are far better Vitamin C products out there. Definitely go with Dr. T’s recommendation of a Vitamin C serum, and use a form, such as Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, that has been show to be effective. :)</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>smurfette</string></value><value><string>pizzatheorem</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>f36414417d0d65f87a563db5cf661537d3628dec</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Sea Buckthorn question</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4989&amp;view=next</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>I am considering using Sea Buckthorn in my daily skincare routine and would like to know if it would be ok for daily skincare.

I read on the smartskincare site that acne products that contain benzoyl peroxide may accelerate skin aging. The Proactiv skincare line contains benzoyl peroxide. Any comments on how much of an issue this can be on my skin? I've been using proactiv for a couple years now, about once a day. I continue to use it because I occasionally have minor breakouts. However, breakouts have been less and less over the years, and I have mainly been using Proactiv as a security issue to prevent future breakouts. I tried to stop use of Proactiv, but I felt that my face was getting a bit more oily than usual and feared bad breakouts so I kept using Proactiv. My main question is, should I be trying to stop the use of acne products that contain benzoyl peroxide? Thanks in advance.

Benzoyl peroxide is a flammable bleaching agent (used in flours, waxes and other items) that is also used in anti-acne items. Just on this information alone, it sounds that it could be rather harsh on skin. The Smart Skin Care website suggests washing with a product that contains salicylic acid, a beta-hydroxy acid that reduces sebum production (sebum being the oil secretion from the sebateous glands that is intended to keep your face moist ). I'd suggest you check the ingredient information on the product you are currently using to see if it contains salicylic acid. I cannot speak towards other brand name products, but can tell you this: I know that Arbonne's Clear Advantage product line does NOT contain benzoyl peroxide and DOES contain salicylic acid. The below is straight from the product information sheet: • Formulated with Salicylic Acid (acne wash and acne lotion) • Fights bacteria that is trapped in clogged pores • Fights excess oil produced by the sebaceous glands due to hormonal changes and genetics • Fights excessive build-up of cells trapped deep in hair follicles You, of course, have to use what works for you. Arbonne's products are botanical-based and vegan (no animal products or by-products). It's worth looking into. They also offer a 45-day money back guarantee - so your risk is minimal in terms of trying the product. If you are interested in trying it out, feel free to contact me or just visit my website below. I'd be more than happy to send you information sheets with ingredient listings on Arbonne's Clear Advantage products.

I have very sensitive skin (and Rosacea). It seems to react to the Aveeno I've been using. I noticed the Aveeno has Alcohol in it which might be the problem. Can I use Aloe as a moisturizer ???

The irritable alcohol is 'SD alcohol' which means denaturated ethyl alcohol. The other alcohols like 'Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol' are just waxes and very benign and non comedogenic in general. Yes you can use Aloe very gel if you want for moisturizer but using moisturizers with too much water is not advisable in winter cold weather. Many people with rosacea, including me (mild rosacea) use petrolatum based moisturizers. Petrolatum/vaseline is NOT comedogenic despite the bad reputation (I've tested it myself). The only problem is most moisturizers with petrolatum are too shiny. Not too shiny are Vanicream Skin Cream and Petroleum Jelly Cream. Both are very cheap and a good choice for winter.

We didn't vaccinate our children. They don't go to public school. We don't let them drink their weight in soda. And we make them eat their sunscreen. Before you report me to Child Protective Services, let me assure you that I'm not talking about the conventional, synthetic sun block that is loaded with poisons. I'm talking about edible sun block in the form of carotenoids. Carotenoids are members of a family of nutrients that protect plants and animals from excess sunshine. Just like melanin, they are colorful molecules that reflect UV rays. About 700 different types of carotenoids have been identified. Each of the pigments functions as Mother Nature's sunblock. When humans ingest carotenoids, they are deposited into the skin to prevent sunburn and (ultimately) oxidative stress, which can lead to cancer. Leading sources of carotenoids are eggs, spirulina, chlorella, dark-green leafy vegetables (kale, collards, and spinach), and yellow-orange fruits and vegetables (apricots, cantaloupe, carrots, sweet potatoes, yams, and squash). The recommended daily intake of carotenoids is 100 to 200 grams per day of these foods. The most potent carotenoid is a red pigment found in algae, salmon, trout, shrimp, and lobsters. It is known as astaxanthin. The algae are normally green. But when subjected to sunshine, they produce the red pigment naturally. Once ingested, astaxanthin is 1,000 times more effective at protecting skin from UV damage than other carotenoids. Edible sunblock is your first line of defense against sunburn, cancer, and prematurely aging skin. So make sure you pack plenty of carotenoids in your kids' lunchboxes this summer.

As soon as you wash off the eggs, the skin is back its previous state cause theres nothing to pull on it.

Vitamin c overdose is not a risk because it is water soluble and excreted rapidly by the kidneys. Vit. E, on the other hand, ius lipid soluble and can cause you problems if you ingest too much, such as severe diarhhea. In addition, recent stuidies suggest that it may worsen the prognosis of heart disease (even though it was tested intially to reverse plaque and calicification). Be wise.

Lager strains are a hybrid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ale strains) and Saccharomyces bayanus (wine strains) and are often referred to as bottom fermenting. In contrast, ale strains are referred to as top fermenting strains, reflecting their separation characteristics in open square fermenters. Although the two species differ in a number of ways including their response to temperature, sugar transport and utilisation, the Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae species are closely related within the Saccharomyces genus."

Just go to a health food store and look for Brewer's Yeast powder (not flakes). Twin Labs has a good product. Nutritional yeast does not have the same nutrional content as Brewer's yeast. For example, Brewer's Yeast is probably the best dietary source of chromium (60 mcg in one tblsp of Twin Labs product), but I called one company that made a "nutritional" yeast product, and they said that the product was not a good source of chromium, not enough to list it on the label. There are other differences too, so I would definitely use Brewer's yeast, esp since Brewer's yeast is what was used in the original recipe anyway.

It would be very difficult to create the feel without both the trisiloxane and the cyclomethicone. When I said there were many "dimethicones" under the same name and CAS# I was careful to state that the "dimethicone" name only applies to those silicone oils with viscocity equal to or above 3 centastrokes. The larger family that includes all these dimethicones is the polydimethylsiloxanes. The only molecular variation between the dimethicones is linear chain length from 3 to 2,500,000 cst. The result of lenghtening the chain is increasing the viscocity and lowering the volitility with each addition. Below 3 csts. there are 4 additional members of the polydimethylsiloxane family that are not named "dimethicone" that I'm aware of. (note below 3 cst. there may be side chains which is probably why they are not named "dimethicone") They are hexamethyldisiloxane (.65 csts), octamethytrisiloxane (1 csts) which is our trisiloxane in monostat that is to volitile to use without special equipment and training, decamethyltetrasiloxane (1.5 csts) and dodecamethylpentasiloxane (2csts). These are known collectively as "volatile polydimethylethylsiloxanes" and are the only polydimethylethylsiloxanes that are not correctly called "dimethicones. The breakoff point between the two is where there is little volitility at room temperature at standard pressure. As you know the volitilty (evaporation) of the cyclomethicone (D5) contributes enormously to the feel of cosmetics. I suppose I enjoy the feel and your interest is visual. So my point is that using the 61 compound without adding a volitile cyclomethicone or one of these decendingly increasingly dangerous non-dimethicone polydimethylpentasiloxanes, would not feel anything like monistat absent some nonsilicone substance with this effect. I have actually made this in the past and it was typically heavy in feel (depending on ratios of the other ingredients). We could pour some D5 into the 61 mixture which I prefer. Or we could just accept the level of D5 in 51. I've put pure 51 on one side of my face and pure 61 on the other. They are, of course, quite different in feel, but I liked neither. Thats because I'm a volitility freak. I love that feel. As an interesting sidenote, the lowest viscocity silicone oil polydimethylpentasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane at .65 cst., has a boiling point (evaporation phase change from liquid to gas) of one degree below freezing point (f). The flashpoint is extremely low and the rate of thermal expansion is significantly greater that all the silicone compounds I'm aware of. In other words it can go boom very easily with much force. I had a half a kg of a specialized version of it that was premixed with trisiloxane (1 cst.) and the least amount of other nonvolitile dimethicones to just make it useably safe. I had to dispose of it (properly) as a hurricane approached. It was an expensive loss. The flashpoint of the 1 cst. trisiloxane is much higher that the .65 1 degree below threshhold, but still very dangerous at points that are less than room temperature. I've read that when combining it it is done under pressure. Why don't you try creating several versions of the compound you mentioned? I don't know how the silica spheres would work though I have a huge bag of the new ultrafine cosmetic stuff. I forgot I had it. I've always used liquid silica. I'll have to try it sometime. Its been a pleasure. I've been away from silicones for awhile. There's a very good tech article by Dow that goes into the four different directions of "feel" and how various silicones can create each one. This area is quite a specialty.

They talk about elasomer spheres (of vinyl dimethicone) coated with small silica particles. The spheres are about 10 microns and the particles are much smaller - there is a pic in the pdf file.

I am interested to know what you have tried with regard to the ascorbic,map,tetra, what has been most effective and in what medium.

I would like to try the 1% ferulic with the ascorbic, but then that study that dr. toradov spoke of with the anhydrous ascorbic and tetra sounds very interesting.

These are suspended in a specialized silicone gel matrix that acts in a similar fashion as a transdermal patch. The Vitamin C remains resident on the skin until it is absorbed into the skin over time by diffusion. This is as much as we can divulge. I hope this helps answer your question”" It appears they use some form of specially manufactured silicone that overcomes the skin penetration issue and that product or process is proprietary. I am reluctant to attempt to mix up my own anhydrous Vitamin C serum because there is no publicly available method for ensuring that the ascorbic acid will be absorbed. If I am missing something, please feel free to clue me in. Interesting thread.

However, loving all the info, and just made my first anhydrous C gel. Then I ran across this article in the MUA boards, goldportbeauty.com/faq.htm and wondered how this could be combined with C or derivatives so as to be useful, since it says: "Camellia oil is an excellent transdermal carrier of bioactive compounds, meaning it will transport the ingredients of other skin care products deeper through multiple layers of your skin to the Dermis which may not otherwise be possible." If this is true, it would obviously be a great combo with some form of C,but since C is not lipid-soluble, it seems we'd be stuck with a derivative to add instead. I'd love to know what you think. Sorry if this comes across as a bit uneducated; I'm still learning.

An excellent sunscreen/sunblock is one that is broad spectrum, giving great protection from both UVA and UVB rays, one that is non-sensitizing “to you”, one that is right for your skin type. Do you want one that is a moisturizer and sunscreen all in one? That is also a consideration, especially if you wear makeup. If you do not care whether or not it is chemical based or not, you have a plethora to chose from, since you are fortunate to not have the sensitivity problems many have and, if finances are an issue, drug store brands will fit your budget well. So, it really depends on what you want to use, ultimately. Do you want a chemical sunscreen, a physical sunscreen/block, or one that is a bit of both - chemical and physical. As the other posters have suggested, Neutrogena makes a number of broad-spectrum sunscreens and they get good reviews. (Drugstore.com has lots and lots of sunscreens and sunblocks with reviews of them). If you don't mind spending a bit more on a "good" sunscreen/block, there are more choices for you. Any sunscreen or sunblock with zinc oxide, or better, transparent micronized zinc oxide, will be good. I prefer the miconized zinc oxide to prevent or minimize the white cast, and because I prefer to use zinc oxide for protection. Here are a few more options, all in different price ranges, that have good reviews from others that use them. Many contain an additional active sunscreen ingredient; I only listed ZO and TD: * EltaMD UV Daily SPF 40 - 9% Z-cote * EltaMD UV Physical SPF 41 – physical sunblock - 9.0% Zinc Oxide 7.0% Titanium Dioxide * EltaMD UV Shield SPF 45 - Oil-Free - 9% Z-Cote * Z-Silc Plus SPF 30+, pricey, Zinc Oxide (9%) * Fallene Cotz SPF 58+, physical sunblock, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide (Z-Cote) * Solbar Zinc SPF 38, inexpensive, Zinc Oxide (Z-Cote) 7.5% * Skinceuticals Daily Sun Defense SPF 20 - 5% transparent zinc oxide (Z-Cote) * EltaMD UV Facial SPF 30+, moisturizing, with Zinc Oxide 4.5 % * Vanicream Sensitive Skin Sunscreen SPF 30, inexpensive, physical sunblock, standard Zinc Oxide 5%, Titanium Dioxide 5% There are many, many more. If zinc oxide is the way you want to go, doing an Internet search for “micronized zinc oxide” “transparent zinc oxide”, or “Z-Cote”, will pull up many more options for you. Make sure to read the labels so you know what you are getting.

I have a question: Why does Retin A peel the areas where one commonly finds "marionette lines" -- the nasolabial fold - or the crease which runs from the side of the nose to the corner of the mouth, and wrapping partially around the base of the mouth as well. Especially, I get it around the area between the mouth and chin, just under the corners of the mouth. I don't even apply it there, since I don't really have marionette lines, and don't want it to get all red and flakey. By contrast, I apply my .1% cream on my forehead every night, sometimes I don't even wait the prescribed 20 minutes, but do it right away and STILL no peeling up there whatsoever. Why is this??? The nasolabial fold is always sort of red a peely and I have to put concealer on it every day so it doesn't look like I have this horrible red ring around my nose and mouth.

The product insert says one should wait at least 20 minutes so that the skin is thoroughly dry before applying in order to minimize irritation. But WHY does it have to be "thoroughly dry"??? How does that minimize irritation?? I ask because, for one - my skin feels much more dry on the surface right after washing than it does 20 minutes later, when the oil has had time to make it to the surface. And for two, in 20 minutes my skin looks like it's lost the plumpness from water deeper in the dermis and applying retin a then just makes it feel deeply dehydrated and crappy.

Thus a layer of water covering moist skin can, at least in theory, reduce penetration of tretinoin. Whether it actually does so is unclear.

In terms of tetinoin penetration, if you have dry and hence probably rather sensitive skin you may need lower dosages anyway. Perhaps you could dry your skin with a towel and/or absrbent tissue and then apply tretinoin almost right away (e.g. wait a minute or two). That could be good enough. Also, if you have dry skin but also acne, see if switching to non-comedogenic moisturizers would help (e.g. you can try Sodium PCA spray for moisturizing, for example).

Sodium PCA holds WATER in the skin, not oil. This is where it gets so confusing! I need dry skin to make the Retin A penetrate, in order to fight wrinkles, but dehydrating my skin also encourages wrinkles! What to do??? By the way, sorry that I keep asking questions! I know your time is very valuable doctor, and I really really appreciate it, and realize it is a rather undeserved gift! Thank you.

By using it daily, is vitamin C making u hitting faster Hayflick limit (given point 1 is not true)? 3) Last on Hayflick: if you costantly weight train your muscles as I do since I was 16 (now 38), and what happens is that your broken fibers in the muscles regenaretes and get stronger etc etc... again, how is it possible that the process is limited to Hayflick limit?

Dr Todorov, what kind of exfoliation can cause a chronic damage to the dermis? Well, apart from deep acid and laser peelings, which is taken for granted? 1. I have been peeling my face on a 2-3 times per week basis for a few years with facial exfoliators (like Neutrogena) and scrubbing gloves - would that damage the dermis? I certainly have damaged the stratum corneum as my skin is dull, and dry, and worn-looking now, but that seems to be a more or less reversible damage, right? 2. I am having a tretinoin (0,05% Retin-A evening + 8% AHA morning) treatment right now, trying to reverse some of the sun damage I've done to my skin through my thoughtless suntanning - my skin was irritated for a while, the first 3-4 weeks but now it is just fine, like it would be regular night/day creams. Would this treatment cause dermis damage? 3. Also, I do not understand the mechanism of Hayflick limit very well. Someone on your forum compared it to a mankind, where each person has a lifespan of about 80 years and by reproducing creates other persons with the same lifespan. Hence, the mankind is virtually "immortal". So, do I get it right that the actual mechanism of Hayflick limit (and the error of this analogy) is that actually each person with an 80-year lifespan reproduces persons with, say, a 60-year lifespan (due to telomer shortening), who, in turn, reproduce persons with a 40-year lifespan, etc. till the "mankind" gets extinct (senescent for cells)? 4. In this case, how often do dermis fibroblasts divide? And does that actually mean that the use of whatever skincare products that boast "increase in collagene and elastine reproduction" means I am wearing out my fibroblasts and therefore making their senescence - and my old-looking skin - approach? I failed to find info on this (( I know this thread has been lifeless in a while, so I hope you see my post and reply it.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>drtodorov</string></value><value><string>freckleface</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>395ab07260343f47e11db2fb3eb4bf15c22c1733</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Copper Peptides</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Copper Peptide concentrations</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=18164&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>PattiK</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>1c617d8b867e570ae8aee3904c18617cb9f8e7c8</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Astringents and skin penetration of actives</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=17598&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>I sometimes use witch hazel as an astringent to clean my heavy "out in the sun" SPF 45 sunscreen off my face .

Although they have not all ben clearly elcudidated, it is almost indisputable that it extends life. Those who pratice CR have more favorable lipid profiles, circulating insulin and glucose levels, and are less prone to chronic diseases. They also are resistant to age-related sarcopenia and osteoporosis. This leads me to wonder what effects CR, at least from a theoretical pespective, may have on the skin. I'd imagine that CR slows aging globally throughout the body, which includes the skin. This really propels us into territory that many may consider extreme. Just how far are we willing to go to delay the aging process, and by extension, maintain healthy looking skin?

It does work in mice and rats and some other animals. But human metabolism is much more complex than that of a rat or a mouse. So, at this point, nobody knows if it works in humans to extend life, because in order to determine that, you would have to do a controlled study with humans, and as far as determining it's effects on longevity, that would not be feasible with humans. Actually calorie restriction has been occurring in the human species for hundreds, even thousands of years. Just look at all of the third world countries where people have less than optimal (by developed nations' standards) amounts of food to eat. Those people practice calorie restriction (I'm not talking about starvation either), and they've done so for many years, and it doesn't seem to have had any effect on boosting their longevity...at least not to the 100-120 year level. Of course, that wouldn't be a controlled study, becuase there could be other important factors at play. Now in regards to calorie restriction's effects on your skin, I doubt very much that it would work to make for better-looking, more youthful skin. Most of the people I've known (or have known about) who have practiced calorie restriction have a gaunt, drawn look to their faces, and dry skin and hair. And one of the biggest complaints made by people who put themselves through the rigors of calorie restriction is a low libido. In fact, I read about one report stating that Brazilian scientists found that calorie restriction lowered the testosterone levels of rats and mice. That's rather confusing though, since calore resistriction is supposed to make those animals more youthful. So put all of that together so far: a low libido, dry skin and hair, a sagging, drawn, gaunt look to the face. Doesn't sound very youthful does it? Now it could be that calorie restriction works for some people but not for others. For example, people with a slow metabolism who put on fat easily would probably benefit from calorie restriction in terms of keeping the weight down. But will it make those people live 120 years or cause them to age more slowly? Nobody knows. And should people who have fast metabolisms and want to gain weight put themselves through calorie restriction, even if they're physically active? Would they lose weight? Probably, making them underweight. Will they live to be 120 or look or act younger? Again, nobody knows about the longevity part, but I doubt that they will look or act younger, for the reasons above. Just remember that a calorie resistriction diet would have to be a low-fat diet in order to get all of the nutrients you can for any given calorie. And anyone on a low fat diet will probably have dry skin, dry hair and a low libido. So to remedy that, if I were to go on such a diet, I would definitely take some EFA supplements. The late Dr. Roy Walford (gerontologist at UCLA) had more to say about calore restriction than anyone, and he was one of it's biggest promoters. He wrote at least two books on it ("The 120 Year Diet" and "Beyond the 120 Year Diet"). He practiced calorie restriction religiously for the last 35 years of his life. He died recently at age 76 from Lou Gehrig's disease. Also, he did not look young for his years, nor did he have very youthful-looking skin. Of course, that doesn't mean that calorie restriction won't work in humans, since one is not a good statistical number. In any case, if anyone on this forum has had any success at using calorie restriction to make themslves feel or look younger (including your skin), please share your info.

That is, it is highly unlikely that people who are starving today or who have starved in the past are/were recieving adequate nutrition, whereas well-off calorie restricters take care to make sure they are getting proper nutrients. Calorie restriction doesn't simply mean eating less of everything. It means eating optimally - that is, getting all the essential vitamins and macronutrients - while keeping calories to a bare minimum, whatever is necessary to get around (and to have sex, maybe). I don't think historical examples of people living through famine make very good models for us to study because all too often these people had nutritional deficiencies. Calories restricters have to go through a delicate balancing act at every meal. They want something that packs the most nutrition with the least calories. I myself have never been on such a diet but would consider it if I had a competent nutritionist to help me along. I think it can be very dangerous unless you know what you're doing.

Also, due to similarities among mammals and the fact that, say, SIR-2 group of genes are found in both humans and mice, it is likely that CR diet in humans is likely to provide some health and longevity benefits. However, the effect is likely to be far less dramatic than in mice for various reasons, including differences in basal levels of oxidative stress, fidelity of repair systems and so forth. If I had to guess, CR in humans is likely to produce about 10-20% of increase in average lifespan (assuming you use individuals with normal rather than excessive BMI as a baseline) and 5-10% increase in maximal lifespan. Also, neolithic hunter-gatherers who lived on lean meat of wild animals and things like nuts, mushrooms and berries, are likely to have had a pretty balanced diet, yet were calorie restricted most of the time. Unfortunately, they rarely if ever died of old age and didn't keep mortality statistics...

It could very well be that their skin has been preserved while the underlying fat has wasted. What a trade-off! I don't believe that either I or Dr. Todorov are overlooking the difference between third world nations who are starving and people who practice "controlled calorie restriction". There are many different factors at play here, so all we can do is speculate. And what is the difference between "controlled calorie restriction" and just eating far fewer calories on a regular basis, as some people do in third world countries? Well, I 'll get to that in a minute. And again, I'm not talking about starvation, because not everyone in the third-world countries is starving. And I'm not talking about just third world countries either. I'm talking about consuming far fewer calories on a daily basis than the average American consumes, so that your calorie consumption is about that recommended in the calorie-restriction models put forth by researchers such as Dr. Roy Walford. And almost certainly, there are many people in the world who already follow such diets, and there have been for centuries. But how many of those people have lived to be 120, or even 100? And what is your definition of "controlled calorie restriction" ? My guess is that it means "calorie restriction with optimal nutrition", and although that makes sense theoretically, that's not the way calorie restriction was originally done in the animal studies that showed it to be successful at increasing longevity. As far any ongoing studies with humans are concerned, I'm not aware of any "good" studies (involving enough people, not just a few) that have been done for long enough to give calorie restriction the ok with humans. Also remember that calorie restriction does suppress the libido, and that's not a sign of youthfulness. And as even Dr. Walford acknowledged in his books, we won't know if calorie restriction works to increase longevity in humans until the people who have chosen to adopt this method have lived out most of their lives. And that won't be for a very long time. So even though calorie restriction may or may not make you live longer, it will certainly seem like a long time, due to the lower quality of life you may experience. And as far as the effects on your skin goes, if you do go on a calorie resistriction diet, you probably will lose volume in your face(especially if you have a fast metabolism), which will affect the appearance of your skin, because a loss of volume in the face inevitably means saggier-looking, less-tight appearing skin. Also, as I stated earlier, a calorie restriction diet is a very low fat diet. And show me someone on a low fat diet, and I'll show you someone with dry skin and dry hair, plus a sagging libido most likely. Of course you could try to counter that by taking EFA supplements, even though that was never done with the animal studies. Another problem with calorie restriction is that you put yourself at risk for nutritional deficiencies. Dr. Walford acknowledged this fact in his books, so he came up with a method called CRON (calorie resistriction with optimal nutrition), where you take enough of the right supplements to offset any deficiencies that might occur due to eating far less food. Also part of the CRON approach is to focus only on those foods that have "the highest nutritional value per calorie", such as brewer's yeast, again to help avoid any nutrient deficiencies and get the most you can for each calorie you ingest. Although this seems to make sense theoretically, it is not the way calorie resistriction was done in the studies with lab animals. If we were to practice calorie resistriction the way it was successfully done with lab animals, we would not take supplements, nor would we focus only on those foods that gives us the greatest nutrional value per calorie. And as result, we would risk having nutritional deficiencies. So at this point, we don't yet know if calorie restriction works to increase the human life span, and we probably won't know for a long time. But if you want to see what short term effects calorie restriction will have on your skin, overall health and physical well-being. I suggest that you read Dr. Walford's books, go by his advice(since he was one of the leading researchers on the topic) and try it for yourself. If you do, let us know about the results.

Generally, even if calorie restriction turns out to work in humans well enough to be worth the trouble, it may still not be practicable for most people. Selective stimulation of gene groups involved in the effects of caloric restriction (most notably SIR-2 genes, which express sirtuins) by drugs is likely to be a more realistic approach.

I think it's safe to say that your hormone levels can have a significant effect on the condition of your skin. I mentioned already that I read of a study saying that Brazilian scientists found that calorie restriction lowers testosterone levels in rats. This surprised me, because I thought that calorie restriction was supposed to make the rats more youthful, and low testosterone levels in adults are not a sign of youthfulness. And if CR also lowers testosterone levels in humans, that might explain why CR in humans is often accompanied by a loss of libido. Also, I've often read and heard that low testosterone levels may have a negative impact on your skin.

Other readers were more enthusiastic about the book , but I don't know how many have actually put the diet into practice, adhered to it and have benefited in any way. In any case, it's good to be aware of this before you make the decision to follow the CR diet of Dr. Walford,or any CR diet. And this brings up another question: is calorie restriction safe for growing children, or teenagers? Probably not, I would guess. But maybe it works if you use it only once you're fully grown. And if so, at what age exactly do you have to start using the diet to get any possible longevity benefits? Unfortunately, we just dont know yet. "First of all, let's clear up the meaning of "average age": The average age of death is inclusive of -all- deaths, from infancy on, divided by the number of deaths. This has two important aspects:1/If adults who are already living into their senior years live longer, it will barely move the average age a notch up. Average age figures are moved by factors that affect the general population, such improved sanitation on the good side, or the 1918 influenza on the bad. 2/Every year you live past infancy statistically increases your chances to make it past average. If you make to the middle years, when you're most likely to be interested in this system, and are still healthy, you already have a great chance to make past 90 anyway!) Is longevity an experiment to play "rat" for? Have you seen the followers? 1/They look bad, wasting away. 2/They're weak: Their 'tissue-protecting' workouts uses weights an eight-year-old could lift. Muscular strength is a buffer against many dangers; not for these people. 3/They admit to constant hunger.4/Unless you begin this experiment from -birth-, you aren't even -attempting- to replicate the original experiment on rats. Accounting for the likely differences in the species, and the tendency to start the experiment in middle-age, paltry results should be expected, at best.5/ Caged rats will grossly overeat if food is present This is not a comparison of healthy natural eating to undereating. 6/ Which diseases will this protect us from? Advocates claim that we shouldn't expect Walford's disease-related death to be prevented because it's "not a product of 'natural aging' ". If you get sick on the program, is it officially not 'natural aging'? 7/The results take -too long-: Do you want to be on your death-bed at 70, bemoaning 30 years of a failed experiment on yourself?....Real life is more complicated than science. Go on a program to get healthy -now-, not one that make you too weak for life's bumps, and always hungry."

Now you know one of the big problems with following a CR diet, not just for a while, but following it for your entire life: if you have consumed your daily quota of calories, you cannot eat any more that day, no matter how hungry you get. Even if it means going to bed with an empty stomach.

Some people claim that you can make up for the low bioavailability of resveratrol by taking larger amounts of it. One person I read about (I think he was a pharmacologist or a doctor) claims he takes 780 mg a day, and he believes that it keeps him going 24/7 and accounts for the fact that he looks younger than his chronological age. Another author says you need to take about 1500 mg daily to make up for the compound's low bioavailability.</string></value><value><string>Are there any toxicity data on such doses in humans?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>drtodorov</string></value><value><string>rosef</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>e7d43c7ff3057769a4c2539fd0caadb5c64141ba</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Basic Skin Care / Skin Health Maintenance</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>rajan Joined: 20 Jan 2009 Posts: 5 Posted: Tue Jan 20, 2009 11:39 am Post subject: Eye cream suggestions Hi, I am almost 50 and need an eye cream for fine lines.

My questions are: 1) I drench my skin using a cotton ball with the toner, is this as good and effective at getting the ingrdients into my skin as a cream? I have a oil based cream so all the other ingredients (herbs) I pack into my toner and use and let it soak in before I put on the cream. I am hoping I am getting equal benefit from herbal actives in the toner as well as the cream. I just don't have them mixed together. 2) When is a serum considered a serum? Could my toner I described above be considered a "SERUM"? It is only herbs and water. I make it every few days.

Can you tell me which seems the best to use as a base cream for water souluble actives (grape seed)? base cream #1 purified water organic virgin coconut oil organic jojoba emulsifying wax (plant based,no soy) grapefruit seed extract virgin palm oil base cream #2 coconut fatty acid cream base white camelia oil sunflower oil macadamia nut oil citrus seed extract I think base cream#1 has oils that seem a little more stable, tell me what you think.

Venus Naturals has a number of creams that would do well for a base cream that is natural enough to make "PICKY" me happy. One is the rose cream. I would like to add some actives to it. For emulsifiers and preservatives this company goes with the safest natural ones they could find. I figure I could try to find a company that uses no preservatives, and i have found some, BUT........... it's better to have the safest natural preservative than none at all. I thought about it and it's not worth getting little nasties in the cream because of no preservatives, this is not good for skin either. Herbal Choice Mari has day cream that would also be a good base cream. Spezia Organics also has a nourishing moisturizer that would make a good base cream. Hope this helps and i am not in violation of the forum rules for any info. i gave.

The thing about the up and down skin is generally a nonsense. Skin is 'lax' not because of pulling but because of genetic factors and the lack of fat below to fill it in.

Keep in mind that some people start accumulating fat below chin with aging. With running, this fat deposit decreases and some people may actually look younger but after certain point in the weight loss, when its too much, everybody looks too gaunt and older. Plastic surgeons usually give the best opinions but they don't know everything. Skin care is not really understood or developed very well.

(I carefully, yet diligently focused on the area around my eyes and I did see improvement--although the improvement in texture and tone was the most dramatic improvement. This lessened my eye-wrinkle crisis mode. :) See it here: mdskincare.com/productdetails.cfm?SKU=MD031000 + Clarisonic Cleansing Brush used with SkinplicitySkin Purifying Wake Up Cleanser: Both the brush and cleanser helped with texture and resurfacing the skin. The kit came with it's own cleanser but I REALLY like SkinplicitySkin's Cleaser so I used that instead and I think that made a huge difference. The brush is amazing it really makes skin look firmer and more radiant. See Brush here: sephora.com/browse/brand_hierarchy.jhtml?brandId=Clarisonic&amp;categoryId=B60 See Cleanser here: skinplicityskin.com/index.php/products/purifying-wake-up-cleanser + Roc Retinol Correxion: This worked the best on improving the specific wrinkles around my eyes, although it did take longer to see result than any of the other products. The retinol in this cream also caused irritation and dryness with daily use so I had to adjust my usage, but overall I was really happy with it. See it here: rocskincare.com/retinol-correxion.jsp#c + SkinplicitySkin Ultra-Firming Anti-Puff Lotion: This was the quickest fix for my eye area. It tightens instantly, reduces puffiness and hydrates. Using this and Roc together are the most direct crows feet offense. See it here: skinplicityskin.com/index.php/products/ultra-firming-anti-puff-lotion Also for a quick DIY eye refresher, put two caffeinated tea bags in the fridge for 10 minutes and then let them rest over your closed eyelids for a quick 15 minute snooze! This is one of my pre-special occasion routines. I hope some of that information is helpful! Good luck!

Hi everyone, I've been using a 5% benzoyl peroxide facial wash in the last few months to get rid of acne. I rarely have any breakouts now, but the downside is that the treatment is drying out my already relatively fair and sensitive skin. I've been looking for a long-lasting and oil-free moisturizer to use after the facial wash that would accommodate the dryness while not bringing back the acne. Does such a thing exist? Or should I think about finding an alternative to benzoyl peroxide? Thanks for your time!

The tricky thing is products that claim to be natural are usually using synthetic versions of proteins and minerals found in nature. So you might be wondering that it’s a daunting task to really find out what product line is natural. 3 ways to determine: 1. Keep in mind that the best way to always find out about any product is to go to the manufacturers website. Honest products will usually have a clear list of ingredients, thus explaining what the active ingredients are and how they will benefit you. If you see any alcohols or perfumes, or funny names that appear incredibly far from nature, then you should be cautious and do further research if purchasing the product at all. An often obvious indication of alcohols in skincare ingredients is if you feel your skin drying out or becoming slightly irritated. This can be usually experienced in acne products that are alcohol based and typically not healthy in the longterm for your skin. Furthermore, perfumes are also chemically based and some (believe it or not) can have ingredients that can be toxic in large heaping doses. So with this in mind, also be aware that anything that you put onto your skin is absorbed into the bloodstream, where if too toxic can eventually lead to havoc in your overall system. Breaking out into a rash or a contact dermatitis reaction can be another (if late) indication of overuse of synthetic ingredients such as fragrances that may deeply irritate the skin, especially with massage creams or scrubs which are made to deeply penetrate pores. 2.) If the company’s website doesn’t answer your question partially or fully, then you can still find out if the products truly all-natural. What you want to do is call the customer service number listed on the product packaging. Companies like Biore, Oil of Olay, or Jergens (reputable companies) will have someone available to answer and/or address any concerns you might have at the time. If this doesn’t work either, try doing a Internet search through Google, Bing, or Yahoo to search for any unsure of ingredients 3.) Getting specific. The tricky part, however, can be with certain proteins such as Keratin…an ingredient on natural skincare products. Many companies can be; in a way, ripping you off, by using a man-made version of keratin. While both Keratins are similar in structure, the man-made one is unrecognizable to the skin, therefore, useless in producing real results…the reason you bought the product for. Always be on the lookout for a patented version of Functional Keratin known as CynergyTK, it uses a method of rendering the Kertain into a version much like human skin, so its close enough to be able to achieve results through reducing wrinkles and promoting skin elasticity and firmness. This might sound like a lot of work, but rest assured it’s not. Any research, whether by phone, or Internet, can be done at home, and once you find a natural skincare line that you firmly believe in, and shows effective &amp; documented results then in essence the work is over. Bonus Tip: 2 awesome tips for skincare foods are Egg Whites, and Plain Yogurt. Egg Whites help combat under-eye darkness. Crack an egg into a bowl, and scoop out its yolk (save for later or throw out), store the egg whites into a ziplock bag or a container of your choosing. Afterwards, apply with a cotton swab or your finger a small amount of egg whites on the dark under eye areas overnight or twice a day. For the plain yogurt, wash your face and apply a small amount of yogurt, let it dry for 10-15 minutes, wash with warm water, and continue to use a sunscreen or other natural products.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>reform@nite</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>0140c8b60be74d17e17f5b6d8ac930e023a8c14a</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Basic Skin Care / Skin Health Maintenance</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Aveeno Original Formula</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5723&amp;view=next</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>No, I was looking for a simple, but effective moisturiser.

Anti-aging properties of resveratrol: review and report of a potent new antioxidant skin care formulation. J Cosmet Dermatol. 2008 Mar;7(1):2-7. PMID: 18254804 Abstract Summary Resveratrol, an antioxidant polyphenol from red wine, has been the subject of intense interest in recent years due to a range of unique anti-aging properties. These include cardiovascular benefits via increased nitric oxide production, down-regulation of vasoactive peptides, lowered levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, and cyclooxygenase inhibition; possible benefits on Alzheimer's disease by breakdown of beta-amyloid and direct effects on neural tissues; phytohormonal actions; anticancer properties via modulation of signal transduction, which translates into anti-initiation, antipromotion, and antiprogression effects; antimicrobial effects; and sirtuin activation, which is believed to be involved in the caloric restriction-longevity effect. Here we report a resveratrol-based skin care formulation, with 17 times greater antioxidant activity than idebenone. The role of resveratrol in prevention of photoaging is reviewed and compared with other antioxidants used in skin care products. Introduction The ideal anti-aging intervention should be applicable for both cosmetic maintenance of an age-appropriate healthful appearance, stemming the development of degenerative diseases, optimizing the function of the aging brain and other tissues, and acting on biologic systems known to prolong lifespan. Although there is continuing debate about defining anti-aging, and whether there is indeed any true anti-aging intervention, 1,2 there is more of a consensus about what factors contribute to biologic aging. The oxidative theory 3 has gained scientific acceptance and considerable traction in the public's mind, and antioxidants are a popular ingredient in dietary and skin care products. Genetic factors play another important but not overriding role, 4 and modulation of genetic expression is another front in the anti-aging battle. 5 Caloric restriction remains the only proven means of lifespan extension in the animal model and is believed to occur via up-regulation of an evolutionarily conserved class of enzymes known as sirtuins, 6 involved in mitochondrial metabolism. Reports in recent years that the caloric restriction effect could be elicited in progressively complex organisms via sirtuin activation by the polyphenolic phytoalexin resveratrol 7-9 has generated considerable interest. Resveratrol has been the subject of intensive investigation in recent years (Fig. 1) and is reported to be an extremely potent antioxidant, a modulator of genetic expression via signal transduction, an inhibitor of inflammatory mediators, and to have other actions including phyto-hormonal effects. This combination of biological properties and cosmetic effects makes resveratrol a unique candidate anti-aging agent. Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring molecule found in high concentrations in many red wines and is a member of a family of compounds known as wine polyphenols, which also includes flavonoids. 10 Other sources of resveratrol include some colored berries and the nonedible parts of the peanut plant. Of the two isoforms, the trans-resveratrol isomer is more stable and biologically active than the cis-resveratrol isomer. 11 Resveratrol has been reported to be a strong inhibitor of NADPH- and adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)-Fe+-lipid peroxidation and ultraviolet (UV) light-induced lipid peroxidation, and an efficient scavenger of 2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane)-dihydrochloride peroxyl radicals. 12 Several studies have evaluated the structure-activity relationship of resveratrol and other stilbene derivatives. Olas and Wachowicz 13 evaluated the activities of resveratrol in platelets and determined that the hydroxyl group in ring B was important in the inhibition of the production of reactive oxygen species, reduction of lipid peroxidation, and protection against peroxynitrate-induced platelet lipid and protein oxidation. Stojanovic et al. 14 also found resveratrol to be an extremely efficient free radical scavenger in a model employing gamma-irradiation of liposomes, with the para-hydroxyl configuration the most effective. Resveratrol was 95% efficient at preventing lipid peroxidation, compared with ~65% for vitamin E and ~37% for vitamin C. Flavonoid polyphenols are more ubiquitous. Silymarin, derived from the milk thistle plant, has been found to share some properties with resveratrol, including an antiapoptotic effect following UV radiation, modulation of signal transduction, and sirtuin activation. 15 Topical and systemic administration of silymarin was shown to attenuate burn-induced oxidative tissue injury in rats 16 and is being evaluated for chemoprevention of prostate and skin cancers. 17 Direct comparisons of silymarin's antioxidant capacity with other polyphenols has not been reported, however, and this compound has not been extensively studied. Cardiovascular The inverse relationship between wine consumption and heart disease ('French paradox') has been known for some time and well documented. 18-20 Resveratrol and other wine phenolics are believed to be largely responsible for this correlation via increased nitric oxide production, 21 down-regulation of vasoactive peptides known as endothelins, 22 reduction of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, 23 and anti-inflammatory effects via cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and down-regulation of eicosanoid synthesis. 24 Brain function Population studies reveal a consistent inverse relationship of moderate wine consumption and Alzheimer's/senile dementia as well as overall better maintenance of cognitive ability with advancing age. 25 Resveratrol has been shown to facilitate the breakdown of beta-amyloid, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease, via specific mechanisms unrelated to antioxidant effects, 26 and to protect against beta-amyloid toxicity in vitro. 27 Mitogen-activated protein enzymes (MAP kinases), which are active in learning and memory centers of the brain, are up-regulated by resveratrol in neural tissues. 28 Neuronal AMP kinases are also activated by resveratrol. 29 Resveratrol has also been shown to protect the brain against the effects of traumatic injury in a rat model. 30 In a gerbil stroke model, resveratrol administered either during or after carotid artery occlusion significantly decreased cerebral ischemic injury. 31 This same study documented the ability of resveratrol to traverse the blood-brain barrier. Phyto-hormonal effects Resveratrol is known to bind the estrogen receptor, 32 and evidence suggests that regular wine consumption attenuates perimenopausal symptoms 33 and protects against osteoporosis. A report from China Medical University in Taiwan 34 concluded that resveratrol's bone-protective effects were similar to hormone replacement therapy (HRT), without increased risk of breast cancer, via signal-transduction mediated effects resulting in activation of forkhead proteins, which were also involved in anticancer effects. Given current controversies about HRT following the Women's Health Initiative report, 35 this may prove extremely valuable, but remains to be clinically documented in prospective trials. Phytoestrogens are being investigated as possible selective cytoplasmic and membrane surface estrogen receptor agonists to slow skin aging without the potential risks of estrogen. 36 Estrogen is known to enhance dermal water-holding capacity, increase glycosaminoglycan content, maintain skin elasticity and collagen content, and diminish wrinkling, although specific data on stilbene phytestrogens such as resveratrol are lacking. 37 Antioxidant Wine polyphenols as a class are the most potent dietary antioxidants, generally many times greater than vitamins A, C, and E. Large trials of vitamin supplementation have consistently found no reduction in the incidence of degenerative diseases. 38-40 Dietary intervention studies have documented a reduction of serum oxidative damage markers to a greater degree with the addition of red wine compared with vegetables rich in antioxidant vitamins. A representative study from the Catholic University of Chile in Santiago compared total plasma antioxidant capacity, levels of leukocyte DNA 8-OHdeoxyguanosine (8OHdG, a marker for DNA oxidation), and plasma 7C-hydroxycholesterol, in groups of volunteers given an occidental (high-fat) diet, a Mediterranean diet, or a Mediterranean diet supplemented isocalorically with either red wine or additional fruits and vegetables, for 3 months. 41 The wine-supplemented diet was more than twice as effective at reducing serum markers of oxidative stress than the vegetable added diet. A consensus is emerging that polyphenols, rather than antioxidant vitamins alone, are responsible for the anti-aging benefits of the Mediterranean diet. Polyphenols from tea, primarily catechins and theaflavins, are also known to be potent antioxidants, although comparison data are sparse. A few in vivo studies document direct antioxidant activity through free radical scavenging and chelation of redox-active transition metal ions, and indirect actions including induction of the phase II antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutases and glutathione S-transferases. 42 Photoprotection has also been seen with topical application or oral ingestion of the tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, with inhibition of carcinogen chemical- or UV radiation-induced skin carcinogenesis in various in vivo models. 43 Catechins, epicatechins, and gallic acids also occur in substantial amounts in red wine, along with ellagic acid, the primary antioxidant polyphenol in pomegranates. Peroxyl radical scavenging activities of these various compounds have been compared, with results in decreasing order found to be resveratrol > catechin > epicatechin = gallocatechin > gallic acid = ellagic acid. 44 The synthetic coenzyme Q analog idebenone has been reported to be the strongest topical antioxidant. 45 Although all antioxidants ultimately function by scavenging reactive oxygen species, a variety of tests are employed including direct chemical measurements of free radical neutralization and biological in vitro and in vivo assays. A new product with 1% resveratrol (FAMAR, Athens, Greece) developed for Calidora Skin Clinics (Seattle, WA) was tested against 1% idebenone (Prevage MD, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA) using the ORAC test (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity, Brunswick Laboratories, Norton, MA), an industry standard for cosmetics and nutrition. The resveratrol product yielded 4845 ?mole VE/g (vitamin E equivalent per gram) compared with 279 for the 1% idebenone, approximately a 17-fold increase in antioxidant potency. Clinical testing is underway for this promising formulation.

The use of resveratrol and other botanical antioxidants has been reviewed by Afaq and Mukhtar 46 and Baliga and Katiyar. 47 Resveratrol has been demonstrated to act on cellular signaling mechanisms related to UV-mediated photoaging, including MAP kinases, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa-B), and matrix metalloproteinases. Topical application of resveratrol in a SKH-1 hairless mouse model prior to UV-B radiation results in significant inhibition of cellular proliferation, mRNA survivin expression, and survivin phosphorylation. Resveratrol lowers levels of reactive oxygen species in UVA-exposed HaCaT keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and electron microscopy confirmed that ultrastructural changes could be prevented. 48 Anticancer Several lines of evidence point to a role for resveratrol and other wine phenolics in chemoprevention of cancer as well as possible therapeutic roles. 49,50 Mechanisms at each step in carcinogenesis have been mapped in detail, with resveratrol acting as an anti-initiation, antipromotion, and antiprogression agent. 51 At the initiation level, antioxidant capabilities are believed to be important, whereas induction of apoptosis, decreased expression of antiapoptotic proteins, and down-regulation of cell activation pathways are involved in antipromotion effects. Antiprogression actions include suppression of growth factor signaling pathways, suppression of cancer cell growth, and inhibition of angiogenesis. 52 Direct suppression of breast cancer cells, 53 melanoma, 54 and many others by resveratrol has been reported. These effects are mediated through up-regulation of p12Cip1/WAF1, p53, and Bax; down-regulation of survivin, cyclin E, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and clAPS; activation of caspases; and suppression of transcription factors including NF-kappa-B, AP-1, and Egr-1, and JAK-STAT. 55 Inhibition of several protein kinases and COX-2 is also believed to be important. Resveratrol has also been demonstrated to enhance the effectiveness of cisplatin and doxorubicin in human ovarian (OVCAR-3) and uterine (Ishikawa) cancer cell lines, attenuating the cardiotoxic effects in rodent ventricular myocytes. 56 Resveratrol and other wine polyphenols act as chemosensitizers and radiosensitizers by blocking pathways that lead to treatment resistance. 57 Infectious diseases Resveratrol is produced in the skin of wine grapes in response to environmental stress, and is known to have antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. 58 Influenza virus replication has been shown to be inhibited by resveratrol 59 via blockade of the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of viral proteins, most likely related to protein kinase C activity, and mice infected with the influenza virus showed significantly better survival when treated with resveratrol. Antimicrobial effects on dermatophytes and bacterial pathogens of the skin have also been documented. 60 Resveratrol as a sirtuin mimetic Caloric restriction promotes longevity through activation of histone deacetylase enzymes known as sirtuins, 6 a phenomenon documented across animal species from simple organisms to vertebrates. 7,8 It is believed to be based upon a survival response to nutritional or other environmental stress, with altered mitochondrial metabolism, increased insulin sensitivity, lowered levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, increased AMP-activated protein kinase, and other downstream effects. Wine polyphenols are the only known sirtuin mimetics capable of replicating the calorie restriction effect by up-regulating sirtuin activity. The adverse effects of a high-calorie diet on mice were reversed with resveratrol, 9 and studies in primates are ongoing. The effects in humans have not yet been reported, though at least two biotechnology companies are developing resveratrol formulations for prescription use in diabetes and degenerative diseases. Outlook for clinical use Pending reports of prospective clinical trials in humans for specific conditions, the benefits of oral supplementation of resveratrol remain speculative. Questions about bioavailability, metabolism, and dosing remain largely unanswered as yet. Resveratrol seems to be rapidly absorbed after oral ingestion but quickly conjugated by glucuronic acid, although it may accumulate in epithelial tissues. 61,62 In pigs, resveratrol has been demonstrated to absorb well through the stratum corneum though not as well as a phosphorylated conjugate. 63 Topical use therefore seems to pose little theoretical risk and potentially large benefits. Synthetic resveratrol derivatives may allow for more targeted applications, although the native form is many times more potent in free radical absorption capacity than antioxidant vitamins and derivatives currently in use.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>rosef</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>61e3980b39377184254b26f1b12d416734e1f102</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Basic Skin Care / Skin Health Maintenance</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>LoveBuzz Joined: 13 May 2014 Posts: 140 Posted: Mon May 19, 2014 10:36 pm Post subject: Good Moisturiser and Cleanser.

How do you really know? Also, can you reverse such skin condition? Back to top Guest Posted: Thu Jan 13, 2005 12:57 am Post subject: Infrequent peels are probably relatively safe. Exfoliating too much can, in theory, push you closer to the Hayflick limit. But nobody knows for sure how much closer since this phenomenon has been studied in the tissue culture, not in living humans. Once the Hayflick limit has been reaced, it cannot be fully reversed without genetic manipulations. However, some signs of senescent phenotype can be reduced (at least in tissue culture) by carnosine and possibly other chemicals.

Wow even a biology 101 student knows that. I've studied apotosis in cancer cells (those things just keep dividing and dividing) but I really don't know too much about teleomeres.

However, a fibroblast is a somatic terminally differentiated cell which produces collagen. In contrast, all tissues which make extensive use of fibroblasts, including skin, bone, etc., are also well well supplied with fibrocytes. Fibrocytes are undifferentiated stem cell versions of fibroblasts. They are not yet functioning to produce anything. When you were young, they continually produced replacement skin cells for no other reason other than the fact that they could. But, with increasing age, fibrocytes, and other stem cells become more and more likely to just sit there, waiting, in your skin, and elsewhere. Sometimes they may wait for many years, until some kind of serious damage is perceived by the body. This might include peeling by acids, lasers or otherwise. In the face of massive injury, the fully differentiated fibroblasts generate large numbers of signalling molecules, chemicals such as cytokines, which tell the fibrocytes "It is time to come out of slumber. You need to make new fibroblasts." Generally, the fibrocyte will then divide, producing one fibroblast destined copy, and one fibrocyte to replace itself. Depending on how bad the damage is, and how persistently the existing fibroblasts call for help, this same process may repeat itself, over and over again, until many eventual fibroblasts may be produced by one fibrocyte. But, always, one replacement fibrocyte will remain. Like all stem cells, fibrocytes produce a certain amount of telomerase, and we are able to measure this in skin, after injury. Telomerase is an enzyme that acts to elongate the chromosomal "caps" called telomeres/ In mitosis, other enzymes, which stimulate division and duplication of the chromosomes, bind to each chromosome by holding it at the telomere. As a result, the particular nucleotides are blocked, and they cannot be copied. This results in a progressive shortening of the telomere caps. Thankfully, there is a lot of telomere, at least to begin with. And, furthermore, the telomeres don't code for any needed proteins. So, losing a bit of nucleotide sequence is not devastating to the cell. However, the telomeres are essential for chromosomal stability. A measurable length of telomeric nucleotides are sacrificed with each population doubling. The telomere eventually becomes so short there is barely anything left for the mitosis enzymes to latch onto, and the cell stops dividing. That is called senescence, and the maximum number of times that a fibroblast can divide is called the "Hayflick Limit. Fibro cytes , however, unlike fibroblasts, produce a sub-optimal amount of telomerase. This enzyme functions to add back sections to the telomere after mitosis, restoring the chromosomes to the pristine state it once enjoyed, prior to the time that the cell divided itself. I say sub-optimal because adult stem cells do not produce enough telomerase to quite equal the rate of telomere shortening. Unlike embryonic stem cells, therefore, adult stem cells do, eventually, become senescent. The time it takes for that to happen, however, is so far beyond the so-called "Hayflick Limit", that an adult stem cell is essentially "immortal," when we are talking about people who currently live to a maximum life span of about 120 years. We have enough skin stem cells, producing enough telomerase, to last a lifetime of well over 1,000 years. How can this be? Well, as stated, your existing stock of stem cell fibrocytes are sufficient to regenerate your skin for 1,000 years. Indeed, if you believe the quasi-historical accounts in the Bible, people, like Methuselah, once did live that long. We could, potentially, even lengthen stem cell productivity far beyond that. All you would need to do is, somehow, figure out how to upregulate the production of telomerase in adult stem cells. If you did that, successfully, you would have the potential of eternal life, and eternally renewing skin. You could do as much peeling as you wanted, and never ruin your skin. We actually have some idea on how to upregulate the transcription of telomerase, in individual cells. It has been done in the laboratory, most recently by the Geron Corporation. The most important hurdle to achieving eternal life is not in upregulating telomerase. What we don't understand is how, why, and what signaling mechanisms are involved in causing the normally quesient stem cells to activate to the point where they replace worn out somatic cells, as they do when we are young. It has been shown that blood, from a young animal, transfused into an older animal, stimulates stem cell activity, and replacement of somatic cells, especially in areas of the body that have been injured. Scientists have shown that the healing response, of old animals, can be restored to the level of youth, simply by transfusing young blood into them. Conversely, by transfusing old blood into younger animals, healing can be retarded. All of this takes us back to the Bible, once again. In Genesis, God says that "the life is in the blood." Well, now, we know that this is true. The problem, as always, is that we don't know why or how. It is abundantly obvious that there is an unknown substance, in the blood of younger animals which is in much shorter supply, in older blood. This unknown chemical(s) stimulates mobilization of stem cells. Mobilization of stem cells, in turn, acts to maintain the organism in a youthful state. Stem cells are stimulated, to regularly replace worn out somatic cells (such as fibroblasts, in the skin). Such microscopic activity can be seen, macroscopically, by the increased turnover of skin cells and healthier looking skin of the young, compared to the aged. In a very primitive way, by utilizing techniques that burn off the outer layer of skin with acid, lasers, etc., we are trying to stimulate some of the chemicals of youth. Beyond all this, we just learned, about 2 years ago, in addition to normal stem cells, our skin, and that of all other animals, also has abundant reserves of an unusual type of stem cell, dubbed "spore-like" stem cells. We call them spore-like because, like the spores from fungus or bacteria, these mammalian spores are very basic packages of DNA, and lack most of the baggage of full developed stem cells and somatic cells. From their structure, spore-like stem cells probably should function like a sort of emergency "backup" DVD. If the computer fails, you put this backup in, to restore the system. Similarly, if the stem cells fail, the spore like stem cells can take their place. These cells have all the same basic DNA codes of normal cells, but the DNA is tightly wound, the tiny amount of cytoplasm surrounding the DNA has a very limited number of mitochrondria, and they are coated with tough membranes, designed to withstand great stress. If called into action (and we don't know how to do that yet) spore-like stem cells can quickly absorb nutrients from the surrounding serum, multiply mitochondria to full numbers, activate their nuclei, and convert themselves from "compressed archives" into full fledged stem cells. These can then further differentiate, like any other stem cell, into terminal somatic cells, repairing damaged tissues. Spore-like stem cells are highly resistent to heat. acids, radiation, etc. If we knew more about stimulating them, we could, potentially, use one single spore-like stem cell to reconstitute the entire organism. For unknown reasons, at the present time, not only are spore-like stem cells "disabled", but normal stem cells stop replacing worn out parts, for unknown reasons, simply because we reach a certain age. And, humans are not the only animals that suffer from aging. All mammals, and almost all (but not quite all) other species, do, also. Theoretically, aging is an aberration that the living organisms should not be subject to. We can see, in experiment after experiment, that the human body can and should be fully capable of maintaining itself for a 1,000 years, or more, even without direct genetic tampering. Yet, this does not happen. It seems as if some very knowlegeable person (God?) has deliberately turned off the backup systems, forcing aging and death. All the talk about anti-oxidants only addresses the issue of prolonging the life of somatic cells. Stem cells, with limited exceptions, are not susceptible to being worn out by oxidation. Perhaps, "God" has ceased to exist, or is preoccupied with other things. Or, maybe, a genetic error randomly occured billions of years ago, in an early organism, which, over time, transformed itself in most of the current forms of life we see on earth. Whatever the reason, our job, as scientists, is to learn how to switch these backup systems back "on" again. If and when we do, it will no longer be necessary to worry about anti-oxidants and similar treatments to keep worn-out somatic cells running as long as possible.

The approach to address that may be either to not let fibroblasts get senescent by [reversibly] inducing telomerase, or by inducing apoptosis [programmed cell death] of senescent cells. At this point, there is a long way to go before practical implementation of either.

The existing group of somatic fibroblasts have been subject to oxidative damage for many years. If we suddenly turned on telomerase production, we risk runaway cancerous growths, due to damaged mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. The key, I think, is mobilization of stem cells to react and regularly replace worn out somatic cells, as they once did, when we were young. Studies have shown that the fibrocytes of elderly persons, when appropriately stimulated, are just as capable of producing healthy fibroblasts which are, in turn, just as capable of producing healthy collagen and elastin, as those derived from much younger people. The key is getting them to do something more than simply sitting there, without having to indiscriminately destroy the outer surface of the skin, like in lasering, peeling, etc. I suspect that inducing apoptosis, might work very well, if we knew how to do it in a controlled manner. In a sense, we induce apoptosis when we use lasers, glycolic peels, etc. Okay, it isn't apoptosis, but it is cell destruction. The problem is that these methods are crude, and destroy many healthy cells, both somatic and stem. The biggest problem with selectively inducing apoptosis is 1) figuring out how to do it selectively, and 2) making sure that the "apopped" cells send out the appropriate cytokines, to mobilize the stem cells to replace them. In the absence of the massive tissue destruction that arises out of lasering or peeling, there is no indication that this occurs in aged skin. For example, much of the reason that elderly skin is so seemingly lax, and nonresilient, is that many of the somatic cells have, in fact, apopped. That is the basis for the business of companies, like Isolagen, who promise to reinject newly created cells, into the skin, to rejuvenate it, in the face of massive apoptosis of the worn out cells of middle aged and elderly adults. If we don't learn how to stimulate stem cell utilization, first, we'd have a situation where the skin function might end up severely impaired, with large sections becoming semi-necrotic, as is the case with the very old. We need to figure out what series of biochemicals, exists in young blood, that are deficient in old blood - and it isn't melatonin, DHEA or any other known substances. Once we figure that out, it should be possible not only to improve the skin, but to rejuvenate every part of the aging human body, generally. Identifying the responsible proteins, lipids, lipoprotein, cytokines, etc., is a significant undertaking, and might take years of research, but it is not impossible. The way to do it is to fractionate a sample of young blood, down to a macro-molecular level, and try each component, one by one, and in combination, to see which stimulates mobilization of stem cells. This may have to be done many times before an answer is obtained. If we figure out what biochemicals are stimulated by ingestion of large quantities of curcumin, we'll have a head start. There is experimental evidence that curcumin stimulates mobilization of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) in aging rats. Although there is no evidence that this substance lengthens lifespan in any significant way, curcumin treated old rats are able to repair injured muscles as if they were young rats. Unfortunately, curcumin has little known effect on mobilization of skin stem cells. That being said, assuming that slightly different biochemicals are required for different types of stem cells, if one of the mobilization signalling molecules is identified, it will be much easier to identify the rest.

There's an array of home microdermabrasion kit available in the market. I have read on the product reviews in this webpage. But is it really effective? What sort of features should I look for in a home microdermabrasion kit? And what to avoid? Back to top Guest Posted: Wed May 04, 2005 9:31 pm Post subject: I have had alot of experience with microdermabrasion. I used to have it every 2-4 weeks at a plastic surgeon's office. I did this for a couple of years and loved the results. I decided that it really was not that complicated of a procedure and wondered if I could just do it to myself. I ordered aluminum oxide crystals from the internet and started the experiment. I take the crystals (dry) and basically simulate the motion that the aetheticians made. Then, if needed, I do extractions. I then use a Vitamin C product and then use a mask on top of the C. I remove the mask after 20 or so minutes and then treat with an epithelial growth factor cream and then sunscreen. I have to tell you that I get almost the same result as the aethetician. I think that the only difference is that I do not get the suction provided by the microderm machine. In my opinion, the only thing that that does is cause swelling which makes the skin appear plumper. This is very temporary though. Just thought I would share my experience.

Back to top Guest Posted: Mon May 09, 2005 7:24 am Post subject: I ordered the aluminum oxide crystals from dermabrasion-crystals.com. I have also ordered them from ebay and they good as well. I am not sure which ones are cheaper. Anyways, I take approximately 1/3 of a tsp of the crystals in one hand. I hold my face over the sink looking into the sink so that the crystals do not get in my eyes. I take a small portion of those and run across skin in lines appx 3 inches long. I would say to start with lighter pressure and see how your skin reacts and then gradually increase pressure as tolerated in subsequent sessions. I do this in an organized fashion starting at my forehead and working my way down my face. From time to time I rub the crystals in a circular motion to further smooth the skin. I do go around the eye area, but with much less pressure. Also, I have a couple of areas that tend to get hyperpigmented, so I am a little more aggressive in these areas. I also suggest taking it down the neck and also the chest but you should probably stand in a tub or shower for this. I try to make the procedure last 10-15 minutes because that is how long it took the aesthetician to do the actual microderm part. As far as treatments after are concerned, I would say that you need to do what is best for your skin type. I feel that the skin is very soft and receptive after the microderm and that it is the best time to apply Vitamin C, kojic acid or whatever to achieve the best absorbtion. The other thing is that it is important to apply something that builds the skin back up like EGF cream and then really important for a sunscreen. I would avoid any direct sunlight for a couple of days after doing this. Hope this helps.

I respect your do it yourself attitude! I just starting looking through ALL the myriad of home kits out there and taught myself a thing or two about the whole microdermabrasion "trend" and treatment- One thing to keep in mind is, that if you decide not to make one yourself just realize that the FDA HAS NOT REGULATED THE TERM MICRODERMABRASION so this means, you have to read the ingredients to find out if it is legitimate rather than trusting that this "whatever in a tube" is actually microdermabrasion... What you want is Fused, Medical grade, corundum crystal, (sometimes called aluminum oxide crystal) but you should know that there are different grades and you need to be aware of which "grade"you are buying. After I tried probably 6!! different home "microdermabrasion" treatments, I found one that had the proper crystals and also was choked full of nutrients, botanicals vitamins and had no petrol chemical additives (which was the hardest part to find!) and it has helped me TREMENDOUSLY-with mild acne scarring, fine lines, large pores and stuff like that. So now I'm getting 12-15 treatments for less than the price I was paying for ONE! They've post my before and after pics on the web site where I get it...you can see them and others pics too at: http://www.getskinappeal.com/htmlfolder/beforeafter.html Anyway, whether you make your own or buy it already made just educate yourself and question everything!

Well, it's clearly not for me. I tried on recommendatin of a friend who had great results from the Neutrogena home system. Each time I attempted a course of treatment, I could not get through the first week without breaking out in a type of a pimple which took a long time to go away and have left marks. I got my money back from the product after the third attempt to start up the regimen, also ended in a third mark/cut/what have you. My skin has never been sensitive to soaps or reacted in any way to massages/facials, so I was surprised.

In my church, my first hand experience overrides anything claimed by somebody else, even medical articles and especially amateur dermatologists that have proven to me 10000 times they have no clue of anything related to skin. In order for an oil to 'clog pores' it has to solidify, no such thing with mineral oil. Getting a pimple or two when you use vaseline, doesn't prove vaseline caused it. It can be your hormones, your regular breakout or whatever. Now if you NEVER ever have breakouts and then you breakout from product containing mineral oil, then you can say SOMETHING in the product breaks you out but it's not necessarily the mineral oil. People usually say 'the mineral oil did it' simply because of its bad publicity. Analogously, people blame accutane for anything imaginable due to bad publicity. Contrary to that, my first hand experience was all positive with low doses accutane. There was even one study where they told the patients they were given accuten, when actually it was placebo. Needless to say, most patients 'observed' that bad negative effects expected from accutane. What more can I say about human objectivity? So negative reports of a product have to be properly analyzed taking into account that most everyday people are not properly trained to observe and analyze. I usually I take the raw information in the report but reject the interpretation unless the person really shows analytical skills. 2. Paula Begoun has a diatribe about the supposedly bad mineral oil and gives references to medical articles, which I havent read : cosmeticscop.com/learn/art.asp?ID=178 3. Reviews on makeupalley give petroleum jelly pretty high rating for a product, 4.4 out of 5 with 88% will buy it again.

Be sure to add a sun-block of at least 15%-30% spf and it MUST be worn daily to help prevent future signs of aging. It has to contain zinc oxide (better for sensitive skin) or avobenzone. If you're skin is beginning to show age, a mild retin-a, retinoid product at night would also be a great addition. You can research the proved results of this ingredient on this web site.

Helioplex uses Avobenzone and Oxybenzone for protection against UVA and UVB, respectively. Both of these substances are proven to be effective. Especially in the case of avobenzone - the effectiveness has been substantiated by independant labs, the FDA, and has been scrutinized by peer review. We know this works. Mexoryl, on the other hand, is not so cut and dry. Most of the info we have is made available by L'Oreal internal research - hardly independant and peer reviewed. What's more, L'Oreal is the Mexoryl patent holder. While I think the substance is promising based off of anecdotal evidence, I won't trust my health to just that. Until the FDA fully scrutinizes mexoryl, my money is on Helioplex. Incidentally - Zinc Oxide is still the number one protector - you just have to accept the white coating. :) Back to top sdxl Joined: 24 Jun 2006 Posts: 28 Posted: Thu Jul 20, 2006 9:02 am Post subject: The Mexoryls used in L'Oréal's sunscreens are not some untested ingredients! The FDA is just very slow approving new UV absorbers. For example avobenzone was approved in Europe in 1978. It took the FDA 19 years to approve it. L'Oréal was the first company that stabilized avobenzone. Helioplex is basically stabilized avobenzone. Most of the L'Oréal sunscreen have that along with one or two Mexoryls. Most of them also have Tinosorb S and other UV absorbers increasing their UVA protective properties even more. Making them far more protective than any US sunscreen.

The protocol is quite strict with regards to independant testing and peer review. It takes so long specifically because of extensive testing. I would love to see some of the gov't waste and red-tape be cut in favor of making various approvals faster - it shouldn't take so long. That being said, it's all we have to go on. For example, non-regulated supplements can be extremely low quality in some cases - even when europeans claim to have had great results for decades. Unless someone can provide an independant, substantiated (duplicate test results), peer reviewed case...it just doesn't seem prudent to accept something until it is shown, in the manner stated above, to be safe and effective (in that order). Interesting topic... Back to top sdxl Joined: 24 Jun 2006 Posts: 28 Posted: Thu Aug 03, 2006 3:34 am Post subject: FYI the FDA did approve a Mexoryl SX formula. Many people have used other UV absorbers that are not FDA approved without any or little side effects for many years. L'Oréal is not just some cosmetic company. It owns part of Galderma and probably has more patents on sun protection than any company in the world. They would be cutting themselves in the fingers if their UV absorbers didn't work. Comparing a UV absorber to a low quality supplement doesn't make sense, since the newer UV absorbers are proprietary and only come from one manufacturer. I wouldn't trust the FDA. After all they did approve a lot of drugs they later pulled off the market.

On the other hand, topical C has been clinically shown to improve fine lines and wrinkles. There is no need to use topical C all of the time, just do periodic courses, so, even it depresses the production of elastin, you'll give elastin levels time to recover. That said, elastin is important and steps to boost it make sense regardless of whether you are periodically using topical C or not.

In comparasion to some of the other "stabelized" vitamin c from other companies, it is moderatley priced. I did want to commet on the coment made by jands. Im not sure what product you were refering to, but in all c-vit products, all ingredients are listed, atleast on the manufacture website anyway (sesderma).

I know that both MAP and Grape Seed are good antioxidants, but does MAP do more for your skin in other ways than Grape Seed? Or, if in fact, Vit. C does inhibit elastin, might Grape Seed be the better choice? I doubt that there are any side-by-side sudies, but I would be very interested in hearing Dr. Todorov's opinion?

I read that L-ascorbic acid is the best form of vit.c you can use. I noticed that almost all vit.C powders are packed in clear, plastic bags. Can vitamin C oxidize when it is still in a powder form or it begins to oxidize whe we mix it with other ingredients?

However, sometimes people imprecisely say or write "ascrobic acid" when refrerring to just L-ascorbic acid, which is vitmain C. There would be some relatively slow oxidation of dry C powder exposed to sunlight and air. However, oxidation is much faster if there is water present.

Will the MAP conflict with the green tea ? 3)Rose hip fruit oil is also the 6th ingredient in this sunscreen and it has small amounts of naturally occurring retinoids in it. Do you think it is to insignificant of an amount to even worry about? Back to top drtodorov Site Admin Joined: 10 Dec 2004 Posts: 3254 Posted: Thu Apr 24, 2014 1:44 pm Post subject: #1 It really depends on how much juice they use and how much glucose is in the juice as it varies with the type of grape. But it is conceivable that this might contribute to glycation. #2 MAP should likely be compatible with green tea extract at neutral pH (assuming appropriate base it used) #3 Pure rose hip oil can reportedly contain up to 0.03% of retinoic acid (but sometimes contains far less). Whether the amount in your cream is physiologically significant depends on how much retinoic acid the breed of rose hip they use contains and how much of that oil exactly they use. Say, if they use 10% of rose hip oil with 0.03% of retinoic acid, your cream will have 0.003%, with is about 10 times less concentrated than typical prescription retinoic acid creams -- but could still have some effect in sensitive people.

The only company that is doing that is a multi-billion dollar corporation in the U.K. The thread was immediately deleted. Perhaps the argument is I am spaming on behalf of this multi-billion dollar company who quite obviously couldn't care less about the opinions of a few hundred people on this site. Or perhaps more likely, if Dr. T can't profit from it, she doesn't want you knowing about it. I find this behavior nothing short than absolutely disgusting. A forum on skin care should be about helping people not banning helpful information so you can funnel people into buying your products. Very, very lowly behavior.

I was wondering if there is any negative impact in including this ingredient in a cream. From what I read, I am affraid that it may affect the skin absorption of the primary ingredient. Thanks!

In this way my skin is protected from direct contact with the sunscreen. Works really well and the silicone layer below helps a little to mattify the sunscreen and doesn't let oil get through from the skin below.

If ok, how much time in between. Also, If ok, what order, and I plan to top it off with a La Roche Posay Anthelios 50+ sunblock. I do not think they have hydroquonine as they are from Europe and it is banned. I am using them now with the Mela-D as the first layer and the other as second, and so far seems to be ok and looks lighter already in one week.

The exfoliating component present in the cream accelerates the lightening process and allows lightening substances to penetrate more deeply and effectively. Albucin Maxima contains carefully selected ingredients: - papain - which accelerates the shedding of external, discolored layers of the epidermis, - a concentrated dose of arbutin - an active, natural, botanical substance which inhibits excessive melanin synthesis - vitamin E - which protects the skin against premature aging Directions: Apply to discolored skin 2-4 times per day. The lightening effect should be visible after 4-8 weeks. CAUTION: Avoid long-term sun exposure while using this cream, and for ten weeks after completing the treatment. For preventative care use Pharmaceris W Photoprotective cream SPF 30+, UVA PF 8,7.

I'd like an answer to this too! It doesn't scare me, if anything I'm sold, but is it strong enough to numb your fingers (slightly even). When it is applied how long does this effect work? And how long does each tube really last for you? Do you apply it to your laugh lines also or just your eye area?

But, since it is NOT the exact word that describes the feeling, I had to put it in quotes. If you know anything about how certain ingredients work, if nothing else then from reading all the posts on this board, you should know by now that peptides do NOT have a crazy huge effect, like botox or real snake venom (which is a coctail of chemicals actually). Botox is a drug, and drugs will always be more powerful... At least for the forseeable future. I'm not delusional... skin care, no matter how scientific of an ingredient it contains, will not produce the same effect... for now. And even if some lab comes up with a substance that DOES produce the same, powerful effect that drugs do, they would not be able to claim drug like action, because of the FDA regulation. They might be able to carefully, and creatively word a skin care ingredient's effect, to avoid the wrath of the FDA, but they would still not be able to call it a drug, or claim to cure or treat a condition (like wrinkles). So, to answer your fears... NO, viprodex does NOT paralyze anything (face or fingers, or butts, or breasts, nor thighs). The only way I can describe what it does is how I described it before. When I put it on, I feel a tightening, and I also feel a slight relaxing, or (wait for it ;)) "numbing" effect. I don't know how else to describe it. Nothing is drooping, nothing is getting paralyzed. All I know and see is that the wrinkles became much less noticable when I used it, and that "numbing" kind of effect seems to last most of the day... FOR ME! I can still feel it in the afternoon, even though I put it on in the morning. I started out with putting it all over my face, but then later I sort of caught myself putting it mostly on my forehed, and around my eyes (even though they say on their website to avoid the eye area). I think that THAT is mostly because of the high concentration of vitamin C and because of some of the fruit and lactic acids they have in viprodex... But, this is just my guess.

'Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Lotion' has A, C (the MAP form) and E and I bet is much cheaper than ROC. You can use it on face - the only thing I don't like is the petrolatum in it. If your skin is oily you will need mattifier on top cause that lotion cant absorb/mask oil. The product itself does not look oily, it is wax based - wax is not comedogenic. You have to know by now that high price does NOT mean high performance and in the cosmetics industry cheap moisturizers do exactly the same job as the astronomically overpriced. Another possible route is to find a good base cream your face likes and just to add up ingredients in it. It will be much cheaper that way but don't expect miraculous results - topicals can't shrink pores, shut down broken capillaries or reverse facial sag.

I have done much study in many years on muscles and the way the body works and I have no doubt that temporarily stopping or easing muscle contactions in the face will reduce the amount of lines -- ie botox or back in the old days (even now) Frownies. Anything that reduces expression will reduce lines. Duh. I was also one of the first people to ever get Botox in the U.S. back in 1990. I was part of a group study of 200 people. I'm not going to go into a whole rave about what dormant or unexcercised mucles become because it's been well documented. Perhaps by many here. I am a firm believer of NO BOTOX or ANY muscle relaxing agent under the eyebrow area. From first hand experience as well as living in los Angeles and seeing what has been happening to people who've had too much botox and are now injecting their face until they look just plain stupid and obvious. Use it on your forhead and glabella region (botox is probably quicker and cheaper in the long run) but be careful. Botox works great on eye wrinkles. Then go look at yourself when it wears off. Your wrinkles will be twice as bad. It's happened to everyone I know who gets botox under the eyebrow area. Including the one time I did it there myself. Think about the phyical science of muscles. If you don't work out your butt, it will sag. If you don't work out your triceps, they will sag. If you don't work out your abdomen, it will sag. Not exactly sure why people think not working out their face muscles won't make them sag. Why can you numb the muscles above the eyebrows and not below? Because there is very little fat in that area to sag the skin. You can read what DR T says about argireline which pretty much sums it up. http://www.smartskincare.com/treatments/topical/acetylhexapeptide.html Quote: There is one more concern worth mentioning. Botox injections target specific muscles, whereas Argireline (if it indeed works) is likely to relax most of your face. And while Argireline may reduce wrinkles, it may also, in theory, increase facial sag because the neurotransmitters whose release Argireline inhibits, help maintain facial firmness.

I went without putting on viprodex for several days before (just simply forgot, or other times I wanted to see if this sagging scare is real) and I saw no sign of it. Maybe the people at Idori figured it out, or added certain additional ingredients into it that helps counter those kinds of effects... I don't know. All I can say, is that in MY EXPERIENCE viprodex does not cause sagging. Maybe other products do, but not this one...

All I can say, is that in MY EXPERIENCE viprodex does not cause sagging. Maybe other products do, but not this one... You've only been using it a short time. The sagging part doesn't start until probably 2-3 -5-10 years down the line. When you excercise muscles they respond quickly at first then very slowly. When you atrophy muscles, the signs of sagging don't come until much later. I'll i'm trying to convey is, think and read and learn about muscle physiology before making a conscious decision as to whether you want to stop a muscle from working and the affect it can have long term. You don't want your muscles to go into atrophy. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003188.htm So we've gone from muscle stimulators in the 80's to muscle relaxants in the 90's. Interesting. Maybe a combo of both? Neuologically relaxing the muscles through botox or whatever, as well as artificially excercising the muscles at the same time is an answer?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>claudek</string></value><value><string>blueyes Joined: 05 Aug 2006 Posts: 76 Location: USA Posted: Tue Dec 05, 2006 10:55 pm Post subject: Surprise-surprise...

Seriously, you shouldn't believe everything you read on the internet. It's a topical muscle relaxer. big deal. Not as good as botox. And if you start relaxing the all the muscles on your face you're going to end up looking like this in about 2 years.

I would put viprodex's quality as a moisturizer on par with Shiseido's Bio-performance cream. It has very similar properties, that are almost identical. But, with Viprodex I get a slight tightening feeling and that "numbing" that I described in my review of it. Bio-performance does not do that. Now, I believe I was very conservative with my review of Viprodex and no one can accuse me of hype. But, if someone wants to believe that I'm lying... let them - I can care less... It's their problem. :) I wouldn't expect Botox from viprodex either, but it does work, it works well, and I like what I see. When I use it it gives results, and when I forget to put it on (which happens from time to time) I see the lines coming back. Is Viprodex a miracle in a tube? Of course not. But, out of everything I've tried this is the closest thing... FOR ME.

Creams at most can exfoliate epidermis making it look nicer, removing faint lines, or prevent pimple formation if you are not sensitive to acids. If you have sagging, enlarged pores, loss of fat or collagen, deep wrinkling, broken capillaries, dark circles - forget about the topicals. Cheap moisturizers will do exactly the same job as the ones that are $100/oz. Yes cosmetics is a rip-off industry supported by the stupidity of its consumers. It is enough to read most consumer reviews online to see that the negative or neutral reviews may contain some usefull information while the ones of type 'it works wonderfully for me' are pure gibberish. Even the 'medical' articles often have ridiculously biased methods of evaluation, not to speak of the manifacturers articles that often contain 'doctored' results.

But studies show that some topicals can make a difference. So, the trick is to either find creams that are as close as possible to what is proven in clinical research, or DIY. Furthermore, while consumer report is more objective than commercials, they don't really perform properly designed reliable clinical trials, do they? Look at the research, especially from peer reviewed journal and not paid for by the industry. Is is not abundant but it exists. See http://www.smartskincare.com/resabstracts/ Biology is messy. I wish it were like classical physics where you can predict the bahavior of a simle system thru a few equasions that always work. But, alais, living sytems are complicated, diverse and confusing.

Why for example, would a company use "before and after" photos of a person who's actually had a deep peel done, if not to lead you on to believe that the results were due entirely to their skin product alone, thereby getting you to buy their product? But that doesn't mean all of it is a ripoff. We just have to constantly fine-tune and heighten our awareness as to what ingredients have been shown to work scientifically (or even theoretically or hypothetically)and make our decisions accordingly. Try to remember that the skin care industry is out to make money first, and they will use every marketing strategy they can to do that. They know that if they market a product that makes the skin feel good(or even "temporarily" look good) immediately, people will buy more of it(especially if the company pays for fancy packaging and advertising), even if the product does not have any effect on reparing or rejuvenating the skin. Repairing and rejuvenating the skin is generally a "long term" process and can take weeks , months or even years, depending on the individual. Most of the skin care products on the market (like L'Oreal, Lancome, Estee Lauder, SD-StriVectin, etc.) are just overpriced, glamourized moisturizers that are meant to make your skin look and feel good instantly, but the effects are temporary and short-lived. But the companies know that above all, most people want instant results (even if they are misleading results), and if you give people what they want , they'll make you rich! This is not to say that moisturizers aren't useful, but you certainly don't have to pay a ton of money to get a good one, and remember that moisturizers won't repair or rejuvenate the skin. Even the best moisturizers will only temporarily moisturize the skin, and make the skin look and feel better, but the effects are short-lived. If you want to avoid getting ripped of, go for the DIY approach. And when that's not feasible(as in the case of copper peptides), opt for companies like www.skinbiology.com, whose main priority seems to be providing quality skin products at a resonable price, not spending money(that you the consumer would pay for) on fancy packaging. You also have to remember that if people learn to link "prestige" with a certain skin-care line, you are paying extra money for that prestige, just as you would pay extra money for the prestige associated with buying a Mercedes. But that extra prestige you pay for doesn't improve the quality of the product...you just pay extra for the prestige. Maybe that's why Dr. Perricone decided to market his products using the "exclusive distribution" approach: he markets his products only at high-end, expensive stores like Nordstrom's and Saks 5th Avenue to lend more prestige to the product, and you pay extra for that.

Basicaly, it said that expensive stuff is generally no better than less expensive stuff and that while on average improvements are rather modest, individual results vary a lot, i.e. some people get significant results while others none (see quote from CR below). And its no secret that no topical can eliminte wrinkles completely. "But every product performed better than that for at least some test subjects and failed completely for others. All the creams worked better for some women than for others, but none came close to completely eliminating fine lines and wrinkles. Consumers may need to try more than one wrinkle cream to find one that works for them. CR suggests starting with the top-rated product line and moving on only if it's not helpful to the skin's appearance."

Not that moisturizers aren't useful for a lot of people, but you don't need to spend $150 for a good one. But marketers know that if they use the right marketing strategies people will fall for it, especially people who have money to burn. If I believed that no skin care works, why would I suggest the DIY approach or skinbiology.com? The purpose of this website is to inform and educate the consumer so that we can make better decisions as to what works and what doesn't, and then avoid the products that don't work, especially the ones that cost way too much. An example of an overpriced moisturizer, in my opinion, is Creme De La Mer, which costs $150. They give it a fancy name, advertise and market it in a way to make it seem like a really special, exclusive product, and the active ingredient in it is caviar extract. But to my knowledge, there's no evidence that caviar extract will do anything to repair or rejuvenate the skin. It appears to be just an overpriced moisturizer.

Many use uncontrolled studies that are never published, and could not be published, in reputable journals. Even many, very large corporations are unwilling to sponsor serious studies of the their products. As an executive of a large cosmetic company told me, "We pay our top scientist $180,000 a year and our top model $4,000,000 a year".

EVERY COMPANY DOES. The Consumer Reports article talks about a handful of products, even though there are thousands out there. While in the past skin care was fluff and nothing else, nowdays it's no longer true. There are some good ingredients that are being discovered in the labs, and while they may not be a cure it all, as the big cosmetic companies are trying to make them out to be, they are effective to a degree. Capitalism being capitalism, I have no qualms about what most companies do, as long as they don't lie outright, or put harmful products on the market. Now, both of these points are debatable, but the fact of the matter is that it's up to each and every one of us to do our research, and make a decision that's best for us. James... why do you worry if someone buys a $350 dollar creme? If they have the money, do it freely, and feel that it helps them, it's their business. As long as the product does not cause harm, or contains ingredients that do, it's not your place to police their wallet, or tell them that their stupid for doing it... I mean, you can express your opinion (it's a free country) but why do you care so much about what other people do? It's not YOUR money they're spending...

I am aware of the fact that skinbiology is a skincare company whose goal is financial profit, but isnt't that true of every skincare company out there? At least their products don't cost a fortune, and I've had good results with their CP serum. However, I would never accept there claim that all you need for skin care is a cleanser, an exfolliant, SRCP (skin remodelling copper peptides) and a moisturizer. I think there has to be more to skin care than that. I also don't accept their claim (that they now make) that it's better to take Vitamin C internally for your skin than it is to apply it topically. They may be saying that now because you shouldn't use Vitamin C topically with copper peptides, so if people use more Vitamin C topically, they will use less copper peptides, and their sales will go down. So I don't blindly accept everything on skinbiology, just like I don't blindly accept anything I find anywhere. I just list these quotes because they are something to "be aware of" in the final decision-making process, after we've done our best to sort it all out. I do find that the skin biology website is one of the better sites that I've found for information on skincare. But in my opinion, there is no one product (or ingredient) that can do it all in terms of skincare, including copper peptides.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>claudek</string></value><value><string>needhelp</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>cc79683ddd2e1756d1f45457d5d8b08290fc6b1d</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>drtodorov Site Admin Joined: 10 Dec 2004 Posts: 3254 Posted: Thu Dec 14, 2006 6:02 pm Post subject: Of course, there are companies that make worthy products, and occasionally at reasonable prices.

The posts (like from Blueyes telling us about the Syn-ake cream....even if it's costly, it's working incredibly well for them and they were willing to take the time to report their experience with this cream) and also the posts about the DIY or inexpensive alternatives (I posted about the Syn-ake products available on ebay as an alternative for those who can't afford the more expensive creams, but still want to try something containing this ingredient) are all helpful information and posts. It's up to each of us, to read the information on here and then decide what's going to work for us or what we're willing to try and what we can afford to try. I have to agree with James, though, about SkinBiology...I've used their products for some time now and I'm impressed with them. But, I also use Renova and other products too. You just have to research for yourself and then go ahead and try what you think might apply or might work for you and go from there. Cost shouldn't enter in too much....except I do agree that there are creams out there that are WAY, WAY over-priced. And there are some "scams" out there that I appreciate being warned about on here. We're all on here, hopefully, to learn from each other's experiences.

It may well be that the creams tested did little or nothing, partly because creams in general may not be the best way to deliver active ingredients to the skin. According to Dr. Denese in her book on skin care, creams are not the best way to to deliver active ingredients into the skin. According to her, creams are intended to moisturize the skin by locking the water into your skin. But the properties that give the cream its moisturing ability (the ability to lock in water) will also "lock out" or block the delivery of active ingredients into the skin. So for delivery of active ingredients, serums and gels are best, according to Dr. Denese, then if you need need a moisturizer on top of that, you can use a cream (if it's the right one). I doubt that the Consumer Reports focused on serums or gels, it appears that they just focused on creams. And if what Dr. Denese says is true, creams for the most part will not repair or rejuvenate the skin effectively, they will only moisturize the skin.

I does not seem that DMSO by itself is useful either, but it has been used as a vehicle in some attempts at topical herpes treatments (see below). In any case, I am not a clinician, your best bet may be go see a dermatologist and get a script for antiviral pills like valtrex. ---------------------- J Infect Dis. 1990 Feb;161(2):191-7. Early application of topical 15% idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide shortens the course of herpes simplex labialis: a multicenter placebo-controlled trial. Spruance SL, Stewart JC, Freeman DJ, Brightman VJ, Cox JL, Wenerstrom G, McKeough MB, Rowe NH. Department of Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City 84132. In a double-blind, randomized, patient-initiated treatment study at five medical centers, 301 immunocompetent patients experiencing a recurrence of herpes labialis were treated with topical 15% idoxuridine (IDU) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 80% DMSO control solution, or 2% DMSO control solution. IDU did not prevent the development of lesions but significantly accelerated lesion resolution in comparison with the combined control groups. For the total population, the mean duration of pain was reduced by 1.3 days (35%, P = .01) and the mean healing time to loss of crust by 1.7 days (21%, P = .004). Analysis of subpopulations revealed that the beneficial activity of the treatment was concentrated among the patients who began treatment in the prodrome or erythema lesion stage. For these patients, the mean duration of pain was reduced by 1.8 days (42%, P = .08) and the mean healing time to loss of crust by 3.3 days (38%, P less than .001). If only patients with classic herpes lesions (vesicle, ulcer, or crust formation) were considered, there was a greater drug effect on the duration of pain (reduction by 2.6 days, 49%; P = .03) and the mean healing time to normal skin was significantly shortened (reduction by 2.3 days, 23%; P = .004). Adverse reactions to the medication were minimal.

I'm new to this board. I've been looking over it the past few days and so far I've found tons of useful info. I'm 21 years old and I started to really take care of my skin about 2 years ago. Before that I never moisturized, always had dry skin from acne medications, never used sunblock when I was younger, etc. and now I'm already beginning to see fine lines by my eyes, forehead, and around my mouth. I also make a lot of facial expressions when I speak which I don't think helps. So now basically, I'm trying to stop it before it gets worse and prevent further problems down the road. I've been using Eucerin Q10 Sensitive Skin Anti-Wrinkle cream for the past 7 months and absolutely love it. My skin feels a lot smoother but I feel I need something a little stronger to prevent damage and clear up some of my wrinkles/fine lines. My forehead I have been using Benzoyl Peroxide 5% for a while now because I get acne in that area and it's always oily. But now I'm reading how BP may increase aging so I'm going to try and do without it. One of my biggest problems is I work at a tanning salon. Yes I know how bad it is and hopefully you guys don't grill me for it, but I do go tanning occasionally. Honestly, I look 100% better when I'm tan, especially in the summer. I do it smart though and never get burnt and never over do it. And honestly, I don't find myself stopping in the near future. So basically, is there anything you guys could recommend to prevent as much damage as possible (besides not tanning). I have an outstanding diet, lift/exercise 4x a week, and I supplement with green tea extract, coq10, ALA, grape seed, fish oil, black currant oil, etc. Anything else I could do? Would it be wise to maybe add some bulk ingredients to my Eucerin wrinkle cream? Or what that ruin the stability of the solution? Is there anything I should switch to that is stronger than the Eucerin cream I use? My forehead is very sensitive, oily, and prone to breaking out though, which makes this tough. Any help would be great. Thanks guys!! Back to top claudek Joined: 15 Mar 2006 Posts: 101 Posted: Thu Jul 27, 2006 10:20 am Post subject: hmm.. I would think tanning is your worst enemy.You may look good for that tanned time as the wrinkle shadows are more disguissed by the tan, but after your skin looks older and more apt for hyperpigmentation when you get older.

The damage is lurking underneath and will show up in your mid- to late 30's when sunspots will surface and general uneven tone, fine wrinkling will start to occur. I see many comments from young people that say "I use sunscreen now and I hate using it. I don't look any different from my friends and they don't use any." BUT, wait a decade, your sun god/dess friends will be aging much more rapidly. Take a look at the skin of any person who had to work outside much of their life vs. a Deep South grandma that kept a hat on her head all the time and never, ever tanned. It's like night and day. Okay, enough preaching, huh? If you have to continue - take massive amounts of antioxidants (C and E especially) to help soak up the free radicals that are formed when you tan and are ready to hook into your collagen layer to create wrinkling and sun damage. Use a C serum (I use CellularSkinRx.com's C+ serum) to get the free radicals from the "outside" while the vitamins are helping internally. If your skin can handle it without breaking out, apply Vitamin E oil or rice bran oil post-tanning to stop the inflammatory process that continues for hours after you tan as the radiation continues to penetrate deeper into your skin. Also, taking NSAID's like ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen will reduce the inflammation. May sound weird but inflammation is the first step on the road to DNA damage....which leads to skin cancer. !!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank goodness I had it removed. I will be having more extensive surgery in the next week or so to take more tissue and some lymph nodes to make sure it hasnt spread. I am kicking myself in the ass for all the years of UV abuse I have given my body. ..PLEASE stop using the beds, and when you go outside PLEASE wear sunscreen and a lotion with antioxidants in it. Put it on BEFORE you go outside, too. I know it is hard, trust me I was a tan-addict. And its, true, you may look fabulous NOW, but it will catch up...I dont mean to lecture, just giving you some advice so you dont have to pay the price later on , like I am now.

Really, the ONLY way to go about it is to not go tanning at all. BUT... before you get discouraged and start to get depressed, and maybe start crying a little... hehehe :wink: there is hope. Self tanners are the solution. These days they are very good and you have a lot of different ways to apply them. The best one I found is Jergen's Natural Glo. This is a moisturizer that has a hint of self tanning ingredient in it and builds color gradually. Most importantly it looks natural. There are other brands as well, just make sure they are the same type and not a full blown self tanner - they can be a pain to use. Either way, you should scrub your palms and nails (along with your fingertips) with a nail-brush after you applied the moisturizer, using soap. And since your skin is prone to breakouts, my recommendation is to use either Murad's Acne Complex, or Shiseido's Pureness line. I convinced several people I know to try Murad's and it worked out great for them. One of them is a young kid and his acne is really hyperactive. It still worked for him: http://www.acnecomplex.net/?roiid=8&amp;cid=45394 If you don't want a medicated line, use Shiseido's Pureness line: http://www.shiseido.co.jp/e/pureness/html/index.htm Finally, all I can say about vitamins is that I tried many, many brands and I finally found one that no other brand can touch. I know it's a bold claim but I belive it's true. I live and die by Andrew Lessman's vitamins and supplements. They are hypo allergenic, high-potency, no binders, no fillers, no flowing agents, no lubricants... nothing but the vitamins themselves. There is nothing like it on the market. Here is the link to that: http://procapslabs.com/PCL/Content/PCLHome.aspx Lastly, you either gonna have to fork out some money for a photo facial, or laser treatment to reverse the damage already done (and take very good care of your skin afterwards) or find a high-potency vitamin C product that will help reverse the damage. You can also use Shiseido's Whitess cream, but that will take some time to work adn may not be what you need. (The reason I keep recommending Shiseido is because I believe that their products are the best quality out there. I have been using them for over ten years, and I love them. Besides, I wouldn't buy anything but German or Japanese products if I could. Sorry, but that's the truth.) Good luck! 8) blueyes Back to top blueyes Joined: 05 Aug 2006 Posts: 76 Location: USA Posted: Sun Aug 20, 2006 10:44 am Post subject: Oh, I forgot. There is no reason to ABSOLUTELY stop going to the beach and laying out on the sun. We need sunlight and occasionally, OCCASIOANLLY some sun is fine. But, wear your sunscreen, and don't over do it. A little sunlight goes a long way, but I would DEFFINITELY stop using the tanning beds. blueyes Back to top orangehrzn</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>e977358e79d3b81895561d5ab083c37e933f1e44</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Anyone tried La Roche Redermic C?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8354&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>I was told this is a good anti wrinkle cream with Vit C and collagen fillers?

I had similar experience with IPL. You sure this is IPL (lamp) but not laser? The problem with IPL is that the flash lamp has broad spectrum that is not targeted to be absorbed only by the hemoglobin hence pretty often the epidermis gets burned. Another problem is that the IPL operators don't know how to control the settings of the machine so the light passes through the epidermis. I had such experience with IPL, that's why I went for V-beam laser this time. I had similar purple bruises from the V-beam but they stayed under the epidermis and resolved in one week without getting any scabs. That's why I prefer lasers to IPL.

Hello, first off, I commend and appreciate Dr. Todorov's efforts in providing us information about skin maintenance. Now, I've been researching about solutions on hyperpigmentation. I've got some acne marks left so I wanted to get rid of them. I was able to clear some areas quickly using scarzone (zinc oxide + dimethicone). Problem is I can't look for these two compounds elsewhere. Here came Licorice extract. I got a product called "Godiva" whitening astringent through a friend that did wonders to her dark spots. I found that the "glabridin" found in licorice is the one responsible for this action. First I bought a licorice root bottle of capsules, but the powder won't dissolve. Then I found the DGL kind where they remove the one component of it, but it's black! I tried mixing it with aloe vera but the mixture is still dark and brown. It has a sticky feeling afterwards, and it gives you a nice tan effect afterwards (I thought this was a lightener)! It's been only two days since my last application. Nothing noticeable yet. My question is, will it yield the same effect, assuming the extract is only devoid of the glycyrrhizin, assuming it still has glabridin in it. Is this the same as the white licorice extract in skinactives? I didn't choose to buy there initially because I found it twice or even 3x as expensive. Thanks a lot :) Back to top drtodorov Site Admin Joined: 10 Dec 2004 Posts: 3254 Posted: Thu May 24, 2007 7:27 pm Post subject: Do you know what % of glybridin is in your extract?

I treated it with OTC acidic products (and probably squeezed it a number of times out of frustration!) and it would get smaller but never go away, and then it would come back. Like I said, this has been a year now and I have not been bump-free in the entire past year in this spot. In the past six weeks or so, I have noticed that this "bump" no longer really looks like a pimple. The skin is raised, but it is squarer than a pimple if that makes sense. There is no pus/it is not a whitehead. Rather, the skin is smooth, pinker than my normal pigment, and it seems a little "loose" or palpable, like it is over a tiny air pocket or something. Have I developed an acne scar? I am confused because what I read about acne scars is that they are craters or otherwise indented. This is really bugging me! Because of its location, I feel like I look like I am carrying around a dried piece of food below my lips ... like I was careless about wiping my mouth after lunch! Very embarrassing! I wondered if maybe it was a cold sore that never healed, but this definitely seemed more pimple-like than cold-sore like when it first started. So does the description sound like a scar? Being kind of square and smooth? And what are my treatment options? Do I have to know, before starting treatment, if this was a pimple or a cold sore or at this point won't that matter?

I don't know the product Deception -- but the name sounds a bit strange (Is the user deceiving others about her age, or is she deceived by the product's claims?). As for Emu oil, it is a good emollient, possibly a mild antiirritant and antiinflammatory. It might be a slightly better penetration vehicle than, say, mineral oil. Other than that - don't expect miracles from it.

However, being derived from pertioleum does not always mean that it is harmful -- it depends what is derived and how. You could derive (via organic synthesis) lactic acid or even vitamin C from petroleum if you wanted to, it's just cheaper to derive it from other sources...

Ultra emu on the other hand WOW! don't be duped by claims that it makes wrinkles vanish etc, becaus it doesn't and it isn't an antioxdant either (though LB put small amounts of vit E in to act as a preservative).

As you know, the ingredient lists on today's products are pretty long--it's anybody's guess. I don't remember switching products &amp; having them suddenly appear--I WAS using Ser. Skincare A-(retinol) line for a long time so the serum (a-force) &amp; moisturizer is what I suspect. That is not to say anything bad about the products, overall they were great until it seemed I wasn't getting the same benefits. I noticed the bumps about the same time I realized my skin wasn't responding to them as before. To be fair, during that time &amp; to date, I did develop a chronic illness &amp; felt that was also taking a toll on how I suddenly appeared to look much older etc. Besides the vit. a palm &amp; retinol, butelyene (sp?) glycol is a major ingredient--but that's in alot of products. I hope this doesn't make the doctor cringe -- but I even tried Pro-Active's repairing lotion to see if it would take the bumps away without luck. However, I still use Proactive &amp; am happy with how it combats the adult acne that came with the illness. I don't recall using anything as heavy as petrolium. A spa assistant suggested an eye product with rosemary extract, which she said might help as it stimulates circulation &amp; drainage. ALSO, I developed slightly different bumps at the lower lashes--called schilasium(sp?) by my Opthalmologist. He said applying a very warm compress 5-6 times a day takes those away. Wondering if that would work for the other bumps? I'm also curious if appying one of those cellulite creams with caffeine might do the trick, but I reman cautious since those are intended for the body. Funny with all of the advancements in skincare that we are still perplexed in ridding ourselves of these nasty little culprits. Glad I got some responses on this, maybe we will all get lucky &amp; a solution will be posted.

Are they bad for skin? I guess they have risk of allergic reactions and can irritate skin which is not desirable. But to avoid them is actually difficult. I know only of a skin-care line that avoids them (and it's quite expensive). Also, they need to preserve the ingredients in the creams , so they use ethanol and fatty alcohols. What should be preferred? ethanol or parabens?. Thanks a lot for your valuable answers. It's nice to hear scientific explanetions to these daily live questions :)</string></value><value><string>Theoretically, parabens, especially methyl paraben, may produce a low level skin damage as they break down and release methanol. In practice, since the rate of break down is very low and the content of parabens in products is also low, the damage, if any, is probably negligible, except in very sensitive individuals. Among preservatives, parabens are some of the most benign. In fact, the ethanol in concentration required for similar level of preservation will be much harsher on the skin. Not using preservatives at all leads to spoilage which can create toxins of its own. The bottom line is that if you have to use a manufactured product (i.e. the one requiring preservatives), parabens are arguably the lesser evel. Of course, there's also a DIY alternative, where you make a fresh batch often, store it in a refrigerator without preservatives, and discard it before it can spoil.

(store in fridge) For the cream: take 10 gr from the fat-component, 30 ml. hydrolaat (rosewater with no alcohol or boiled water ) Heat these both till 70 C fahrenheit . Then carefully drop the water into the fat, stir well untill the temp is 30C. Then I use heliozimt as a preserve. This is also used in food as a preserve. Then you can put v.i. the vitamine e or Q 10 in the cream.With 6 drops of heliozimt you can keep the cream for 3 months.This way I made the coenzyme Q 10 cream and i'm more then satisfied..I do not know if you can buy the tegamuls and the heliozimt under the same name.

Unfortunately I can not find out the english name's for the products but I try to translate what it is. The heliozimt is an preserve. It is made of kaneelalcohol (cinnamon-alcohol) and heliotropine (piperonal) It may give irritation by people who react allergic on parfum. I hope that dr. Todorov knows the englisch name.But you have only to use 6 drops om 40 ml. cream. The heliozimt I buy here is comming in a little bottle (10 ml.) because you can keep it for 6 months, then you must throw it away.Then the Tegamuls.. the only thing I can tell you it is from animal orgin. It is an emulsifier and makes the water mix with the oil and shea-butter.Then the weights and measures someone asked.1 Oz. is 30 ml. here. You can mix the fat-base with boiled water.

After giving your skin a couple of weeks of rest you could try a lower strength (e.g. 5% instead of 10%), and if you still get irritation stop it altogether.

Most likely, applying small amount of estrogens creams to the skin would have smaller systemic effect than oral estrogens (due to incomplete absorption through the skin and smaller doses).

I don't notice it, other than it has no perfume added. I also have a ruddy skintone and am of german/irish background. I believe in the many positive reviews that the ROC products have.

It will help to reverse your sun damage and thicken your skin so wrinkles are less deep and your overall skin texture gets better. Of course, if you don't use sunscreen regularly, it's really no use to use Retin-A cuz the sun will just undo all the good work the Retin-A is doing. I would also recommend that you add a vitamin C serum to your routine. It will also help to firm and retexture your skin, even out the tone, and prevent hyperpigmentation like age spots and freckles. For a quick "glow" and to get on the road to better looking skin quickly, I'd recommend an AHA peel. Platinumskincare.com sells some basic glycolic/lactic acid low percentage peels that you could use yourself. Good luck.

Back to top merton Joined: 12 Mar 2006 Posts: 80 Posted: Sun Mar 26, 2006 1:22 am Post subject: I used retin-A as a teenager when it first came out in the 70's. I wasn't told to stay out of the sun with it and laid outside for an hour the first day I used it. The result, needless to say was devastating. For a year my face turned tomato red (No exaggeration) and cracked open. It was an extremely bad year for me and I'm terrified of it. The reports of its effectiveness are good. Just please stay out of the sun if you try it. It appears that the pure science of the do-it-yourself products of Dr. Todorov are considerably more useful than all but a very few far more expensive (but useless if not destructive) on most shelves. But who would believe they could pay $5 for the cutting edge when they can spend $50 for a pretty box. Along the same line, Why did Neutragena tell me by email that the percentage of glycolic acid in several of their products I emailed them about was a "proprietary secret"? I spent forever on their site trying to find this info and it said to email them if I had any questions. I can't think of anything more basic than that question about AHA products. Too little (below 8%) or too much is a usefulness/safety issue. For $20 they won't tell me about 10 cents worth of ingredients. ($86.00 a gallon for 70% glycolic acid including shipping and the $30 hazmat fee - and thats inflated). I do like this product from Neutragena but . . . oh well. =merton Back to top claudek Joined: 15 Mar 2006 Posts: 101 Posted: Sun Apr 02, 2006 4:39 pm Post subject: Anyone here try NEUTROGENA HEALTHY SKIN ANTI-WRINKLE ANTI-BLEMISH? skin cream with Retinal and SPF15?

I had just about given up when my sister told me about a product that she was using called Athena 7 minute lift. I decided to go ahead and order a sample from their website and was quite surprised to find out how well it worked. It won't solve your problem forever but it does a great job of lifting lines and wrinkles for about 6 to 10 hours at a time (more than enough for going out wioth the girls). It seems to work even better if you use a moisturizer beforehand. The cool thing about this product is that although the results don't last forever, it does work right away when you first put it on. Definetely something to try if you need a quick fix! I've also used Freeze 24/7 but it is much more expensive and the results only seem to last about an hour at the most.

Whether benefits and/or side-effects are additive, synergitic or otherwise remains unclear - the method is too new.

Hydrolyzed collagen powder or capsules taken orally may have some benefit, but probably at an older age, when your own protein metabolosm has slowed down. Oral vitamin C does not make much difference for your skin as long as you are not C deficient, i.e.more than 250 mg a day is unlikely to impact your skin. Topical C is more effective as long as it is fresh and not oxidized.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>drtodorov</string></value><value><string>Sugarbabe</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>432b4d2d35b240d6414b80f934d732c42af34294</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Acne</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Differin or Skinoren</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=97&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>What do you think is better for acne?

Basially they use 3 types of ingredients here: botanical extracts, amino acids and vitamins. Certain botanicals may theoretically be useful in skin care, but whether these particular ones are useful at these particular (unidentified) concentrations is unclear. Unfortunately, the research on botanicals in skin care is very skimpy. The amino acids they use are common in collagen and elastin, which is apparenly the manufacturer's rationale for including them. However, there is no evidence that simply applying amino acids topically would increase collagen synthesis in the skin. Finally, they use vitamins A and E, but considering that these are at the end of the list, the amounts are probably too small to make a difference. Due to the uncertainties of the effects of botanicals I cannot categorically say that this system lacks merit entirely, but I wouldn't hold my breath for any miracles.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>drtodorov</string></value><value><string>Sugarbabe</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>2ec907c89987fb59fb540e6b5ed317cfc9f670ac</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Is Propylene Glycol Safe?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=15264&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Oops! let me rewrite that!

Besides, there was just one study with estriol and seveal with estradiol, which makes estradiol data somewhat more reliable. That said, it might turn out eventually that estriol is indeed more effective. Back to top marlene Guest Posted: Mon Feb 28, 2005 1:09 pm Post subject: estriol thank you for the explanation .

Some people do not absorb sulfur easily through their GI track. These people may find epsom salts will work for them because of the sulfate content.) Sulfur is great for your skin. I find the MSM cream is a great hand cream. The only problem with using a cream is that you can be sure of how much you are taking. But too much sulfur should not be aproblem in cream. Any form of sulfur requires molybdenum. I have specific EFA deficiencies so don't use fish oils myself. I also don't much about glucomine.

For that, you would need to take MSM internally, preferably in the form of capsules (tablets are often too hard to dissolve completely in your system). I like the NOW brand of MSM, and I think 3000 mgs is a good daily dose, taken throughout the day, but not close to bedtime.

Why not at bedtime? Please explain. I have a book on MSM that is considered the definite guide to this supplement written by a researcher who has done much of the research on MSM (Dr. Stanley Jacobs), and it states that taking it close to bedtime may tend to energize one too much for sound sleep. Why or how it would do this I don't know. I just take 1000 mgs 3 times a day, at breakfast, lunch and dinner, but none later than dinner.

Cysteine is supposed to give up its sulfur molecule more readily than other SAAs, I have read. I take the cysteine throughout the day. But at night I find that the sulfur seems to reach a certain level and will cause some GI upset for me. (Sometimes when I take two doses close together I can feel like I have too much sulfur in my system and it causes GI issues for me.) Sometimes with that upset I have some gas. Well, any gas from sulfur smells like rotten eggs. (I am glad I live alone. And the gas is usually not so much a problem until the evening time.) But the thing is that when I wake up I feel like the sulfur has been processed (through my liver) during sleep. I find that I will feel somewhat congested when my cysteine levels drop (and I felt this way this morning, for example). The mucous in the back of my throat will get thicker. I believe that cysteine or NAC has mucolytic properties, which means it does break down the mucous somehow. But I don't think the cysteine causes me any problems with sleep. I noticed my hair seemed to change somehow after supplementing the cysteine. I didn't have any problems with my hair, but I did feel like there was some difference in texture maybe with the cysteine. I came across some website that said something about using human hair for cysteine sources and how that might be viewed as canabalism. I think that hair may contain good amounts of cysteine; so the cysteine supplements may help hair because of both the properties of cysteine and the sulfur, but that is my assumption right now. http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/73/2/543.pdf I have read that a sulfur deficiency is possible but not often forgotten about. I forget how much sulfur our bodies process (or use) each day, and how much we may likely ingest. But it did seem like we use more than we may get from a normal diet. But vegetarians can be most prone to sulfur deficiencies because the best sources of sulfur in the diet are SAAs (sulfur-containing amino acids). I would be interested in knowing why you supplement sulfur?

Some people can have a problem with how their body handles certain forms of sulfur. http://www.enzymestuff.com/methylation.htm Some people cannot convert the sulfur in MSM to the needed sulfate form although other people can. Epsom salts supply sulfur in the sulfate form directly. Taking MSM or Epsom salts may alleviate a histamine reaction. This text above is under the question How to lower histamine levels. So if you find any problems with MSM you might have a problem with sulfation, which is the process of how your body converts sulfites into sulfates. I have seen posts on another forum about people experiencing hair loss from taking MSM in significant doses (several grams per day). This, I think, is a possibility for some people. So the next thing to try is some epsom salts which has the correct form of sulfur - sulfate. But some people do have a problem with MSM for some reason. The powder form should be fine. But if you continue to take MSM you should really get a molybdenum supplement too. I found some reference that said taking glucosamine at the same time every day just makes it more likely that you won't forget to take it. But otherwise you can take it any time of the day, when it is most convenient for you. Back to top Dfontaine Joined: 08 May 2006 Posts: 82 Posted: Thu Nov 30, 2006 3:10 am Post subject: Depends. Are you just trying to grow your hair faster or stimulate growth due to hair loss? For skin? outside of what you'd get in a good multi vitamin supplement which you should already be taking for reasons other than skin or hair which should already have enough biotin, as far as ingestible supplements, MSM would be what I would take for skin and hair. You would also want to take an amino acid supplement with that such as an arginine-ornithine-Lycine supplement or more broad spectrum aminos depening on you lifestyle. And yes, imo, you should try Glucosamine if you aren't alergic to shell fish and if you have joint pain due to arthitis or another degenerative bone disease. Fish oils are great in general. You might try a soy Lecithin supplement instead though. High in omega 3 and 6. If you're trying to kill 6 birds with one stone that is.... I would take the fish oils if I were concerned about my heart as opposed to my skin and hair, but the lecithin if I was concerned with all three. Good Multi Amino Acids MSM Lecithin Throw in some coQ10, extra zinc and selenium for good measure and it's a good place to start.

Jarrow. Great company. I use a lot of their stuff and have been since I heard about them in 1991. As much as I like trader joes they aren't by any means the best source for supplements. Neither is GNC. Neither is Centrum. I would stay away from all of this stuff. I cycle my multi's but a good one is made by Purity Products. Take your multi on a full stomach or mid meal or right before you eat. Night or day doesn't have anything to do with it. For frontal hair loss, that's probably the hardest to prevent. Supplements that suppress testosterone from turning to DHT would be the way to go. Many times they are the same supplements for prostate health. Look into beta sitosterol and a good hair care line. If you find something very fast and natural, feel free to market it. You'll make a gazillion bucks in a couple weeks. Not sure why you want the B-12 --- I would prefer injections if I needed b-12 but under the tounge is the next best. Not going to absorb much of it that way but much more than a swallowed pill. Waste of time if you're doing it for energy IMO. Get an electrolyte replacement supplement instead. If you're concerned with your hair, skin and joints, take a MSM Glucosamine supplement in one capslue. again, doesn't matter night or day. All that matters is how your digestive system deals with it. Again, forget the biotin. Rub it on your hair line rather than digest it. Get your biotin from a multi. Forget about the b-12 unless you need injections. Don't buy vitamins at traders Joes. (though I have many times) Centrum? no.

You can get some good supplements at Trader Joe's, and you can get some good supplements at GNC (such as their Isomer-E, which is a blend of mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols at a reasonable price). You can even get some good supplments at Wal-Mart. For example, I buy the Spring Valley brand of CoQ 10 (softgels)at Wal-Mart because it is already dissolved in rice bran oil, and since CoQ 10 is fat soluble, that's better than buying the "dry" predissolved form that has to be consumed with fat to absorb it. Also, it has some Vitamin E added to it(to preserve the rice bran oil) and it's cheaper than any other brand that I know of. And the Jarrow brand of CoQ 10 wouldn't be any better than the Spring Valley brand (although it would be more expensive), because all CoQ 10 is made in Japan anyway and then imported to the USA. I wouldn't buy all my supplements at Wal-Mart though, nor would I buy all of my supplements at GNC, nor would I buy all of my supplements at Trader Joe's, but some things I would. It depends on the supplement. And as far as using MSM for hair loss goes, MSM will make your nails, hair and skin stronger, but I've never heard that it will combat "male pattern baldness". It can help, by making your hair stronger, but to deal with that problem you have to mainly address the underlying cause of male pattern baldness, which is DHT (a breakdown product of testosterone) and it's effects on your hair follicles. For men who have the genes for male pattern baldness, DHT gradually shrinks the hair follicles, thus making it more difficult for hair to grow through. So eventually, the hair follicle shrinks to the point where no hair can through (no matter how strong the hair is). So for that problem, you need to take supplements ( internally and/or externally) that either reduce the amount of DHT in your system and/or prevent the DHT from binding to the hair follicle. Some of those supplements would be saw palmetto extract, stinging nettle(root extract), pygeum extract, green tea extract, grape seed extract, beta sitosterol, zinc, and GLA (gamma-linolenic acid, such as that found in evening primrose oil, black currant oil and borage oil)). I've read that copper peptides, when applied topically, can also help prevent the shrinkage of the hair follicles.Check out www.skinbiology.com. MSM and biotin can make the hair grow stronger, but I dont' think either one is known to affect your DHT levels or the effect that DHT has on the hair follicles. Also make sure you take MSM "capsules", not tablets. The tablets are often so hard that they will not dissolve readily in your system. If you can't break a tablet easily with your fingers, it will probably pass through your system largely unused. I think that 3000 mg of MSM is a good dose for most people, but sometimes people need to take more (as much as 8000 mg daily) for therapeutic(not cosmetic) purposes.</string></value><value><string>I starting taking Jarrows MSM powder 1scoop after lunch(1000mg) since two days and at night i am taking biotin and b12(1000mcg and 1g).

Sometimes when my b6 levels are really low I get swollen ankles later in the day. I know from my personal exprereince that vitamin b6 can help with puffiness from water retention. You might need more vitamin b6. I think your wrinkles may not be deep wrinkles but more like creases. But I could be wrong about that. You seem to young to have deep wrinkles on your face.

They have one with sulfur and then one with salicylic acid soap. Both are good for you skin. I think the salicylic may help remove dead skin cells more than the sulfur. But sulfur is great for skin; it is an essential trace mineral. But sulfur on your face can be good because it has anti-bacterial properties. I have dry sensitive skin that most cleansers that make my skin feel clean will also cause tightness. (Or the gentle cleansers don't seem to leave me with that clean skin feeling.) But using the medicates soaps were the only product I found that left my face feeling really clean but not tight at all. Now, the way I used these soaps is how it is recommended on the box. You wash and rinse and wash again but just blot off the excess lather. You end up leaving some of that stuff on your face, sulfur or salicylic acid which are good for your skin and do have anti-bacterial properties. Of course if you wanted to do a second rinse instead you could try that as well.

And sometimes it can be deceiving that a good cleanser doesn't leave that "clean feeling" behind. What I've learned through sitting through countless sessions with the dermatologist is that what feels cleans is not always the best way to judge a product. And as you all probably know, harmful chemicals like SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) should never be used on the face. Read the list of ingredients carefully, and sometimes it's the simplest product that is the most effective. But I agree, it is also a matter of trial and (hopefully less) error.

On the news the other night I heard that German scientists have found that cocoa can be good for the skin. This was no surprise to me, since chocolate (at least 70 % cocoa, and made from non-alkalized cocoa) is actually now considered one of the most anti-oxidant rich foods there is. So I found this on the internet: Cocoa butter has long been used topically in many skin creams and cosmetics because it is thought to be good for the skin. Now, new research just published in the Journal of Nutrition reveals the potential benefits of consuming flavanol-rich cocoa and how it might actually benefit skin from the inside out. Researchers found that certain components in cocoa may actually help improve the appearance of women's skin – increasing hydration, decreasing skin roughness and scaling, and helping to support the skin's defense against UV damage. The German scientists attributed the observed benefits to cocoa flavanols – a group of compounds that can be particularly rich in cocoa and that have been previously reported to improve blood flow and vessel function. In this new study, 24 healthy women (aged 18 to 65) were randomly assigned to two groups. One group drank a high-flavanol Cocoapro® cocoa beverage (329 mg) once a day, while the other group consumed a matched cocoa beverage low in flavanols (27 mg). At three different periods during the 12-week study, various tests were conducted to evaluate skin properties: sensitivity to UV irradiation, skin blood flow, skin structure and texture, and skin hydration. The women who regularly consumed the high-flavanol cocoa beverage showed significant improvements in these indicators of skin quality, while those who consumed the flavanol-poor cocoa did not have an improvement in any of the measures. "We are excited by the extent of improvements to the skin," said Catherine Kwik-Uribe, PhD, senior research scientist at Mars, Incorporated, which has supported and conducted much of the research on cocoa flavanol health, including this new study. "Much of the interest in skin health has focused on what you put on the skin. From our extensive research on cocoa flavanols over the last several years demonstrating their potential positive benefits on circulation, it is rewarding to see that these benefits may extend to skin quality as well." In addition to the improvements in skin quality in study participants, this study is the first to suggest that the regular consumption of cocoa flavanols may support human skin's defense against UV light. Study participants exhibited a reduction in the redness of skin following exposure to artificial sunlight. The authors of the study believe the skin benefits of cocoa flavanols may be due in part to an improvement in blood flow to the skin. Consistent with previous studies that demonstrated significant improvements in vessel function, in this study, the regular consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa resulted in a significant increase in blood flow to the skin's surface, effects that were sustained with the regular consumption of cocoa flavanols.

In fact, the Cocoapro beverage that was used in the study might be made by Mars. But it doesn't necessarily invalidate the study, but it's something to keep in mind. But it is true that cocoa and dark chocolate are two of the highest foods in antioxidant content.

But dark contains more copper than milk chocolate. Copper is needed to make collagen. So dark chocolate can be good for you and your skin. That Cocoapro drink is made by Mars. Why argue when someone says eating chocolate is actually good for you? I think most people who get this idea do realize that small amounts of good quality chocolate (dark or milk if you prefer) are good for you, but eating a lot of cheap chocolate may not really be all that good for you. (Too much sugar is supposed to cause inflamation and that causes wrinkles.) Back to top jamesherried Joined: 07 May 2005 Posts: 804 Posted: Tue Jun 06, 2006 12:18 pm Post subject: Actually dark chocolate is supposed to be far better than milk chocolate, because studies indicate that adding milk to cocoa actually negates a lot of the beneficial effects of the antioxidants in the cocoa. And the dark chocolate should be at least 70% cocoa. Also, the Dutch-processed (alkalized cocoa) chocolate is not a good choice because the alkalization process(used, I think to make the cocoa less bitter) removes a lot of the antioxidants. As far as the sugar in dark chocolate goes, you can lower the glycemic index of the chocolate by consuming it with low or zero glycemic foods, such as raw nuts, which have zero rating on the glycemic index scale. Also, one study showed that consuming dark chocolate or cocoa with Vitamin C enhances the effectiveness of the flavonoids.

I have a zinc deficiency which means that I take much higher than normal doses of zinc which interferes with copper from foods being absorbed. (Zinc and copper balance each other.) I really have to make sure I take enough copper otherwise I can have problems. Copper supplements make me feel nauseated but dark chocolate doesn't do that. So, I realize there may be other things in chocolate that are good for me, but the copper is really essential for me. And dark chocolate is higher in copper. But I do think that eating about one ounce or maybe two ounces of chocolate is fine, but more than that might not be any more beneficial I think. I always try to add cocoa powder (without sugar added) to my coffee. But this is what is left over when the cocoa butter is removed, the cocoa powder. Not sure exactly what is in that since it contains no cocoa butter, but the flavor is good. I don't worry about anti-oxidants when I have real nutrient deficiencies to treat. But, if that makes dark chocolate even better for me than fine by me.

I had stretch marks as a teen even though my weight never changed. This is really an indication of a zinc deficiency. You could test your zinc levels with a product called Zinc Status. Some pregnant women don't get stretch marks, some do. Most people like to think that is because of genetics but that doesn't really help those who have this problem. Zinc Status will cost less than $20 in a health food store. A zinc supplement will cost something between $5 and $10 probably. (You might find some kind of supplement for $5, that is possible.) But for about $30 you will have confirmation of a zinc deficiency and an inexpensive treatment for those stretch marks. If you supplement more than 60 mgs. of zinc per day than you run the risk of a copper deficiency. Actually zinc works against copper and manganese. So you must always consider this when supplementing zinc or any minerals. Minerals must be balanced. Or you can apply something EVERY day for months and wait for those products to show results.

It's strange because I already noticed that my stretch marked skin looks worse than usual. I've been eating terribly, and I'm sure it's affected my skin. I'm running out and getting some zinc today at Whole Foods. Do you recommend copper supplements along with zinc? That's a good point about zinc and copper. There must be copper supplements, but I've never looked. Just thought I would share my little realization. But perhaps this is in the acne section because you all know something I don't! Thanks!

Of course you should never take hormones without having your baseline levels tested first to make sure you won't be creating an imbalance if you decide to proceed. So, does anyone know about the rejuvenating properties of topical pregnenolone? I wonder, if used topically it affects serum levels. I think estrogen to the face does not. Maybe it's the same.</string></value><value><string>When you supplement any adrenal hormone in its natural form you can have tha hormone be converted into some other hormone. So pregnenolone may get converted into estrogen or cortisol or something else completely. There is a chart called the stero-genosis chart that shows all adrenal hormones and how they are one step or two steps (in terms of conversion) from other hormones. I used natural progesterone cream and the danger with that is if you apply too much you don't know what extra hormone you could end up with. And it is easy to apply too much hormone when it comes in a cream application like that. (Also using any hormone every day would not be recommended. Hormones are better if cycled.) I think who use progesterone cream may end up with extra estrogen which is not what they wanted. That may happen, or it may not but you don't really know that. So, you can be playing a guessing game with taking too much hormones. The advantage to taking any hormone in cream form is to by-pass it having to pass through your liver after ingesting it. Otherwise an oral supplement is better in that you don't guess with the amount you take. Natural progesterone I think did leave my (facial) skin soft and it is supposed to help with wrinkles. (But you should not apply more than the recommended amount which may be hard to do if it works!) Some say that menapause causes more wrinkles for women because of loss of estrogen but nowadays people are also likely to believe that loss of progesterone may be the cause. (Progesterone levels will drop to zero with menapause but estrogen levels will only drop about 40% with menapause.) But, yeah, get your levels checked and discuss with your doctor if you want to try this.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>orthomolecular</string></value><value><string>K</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>28e35b3c7c37de3bd4a1b54528b789343025f31f</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>All-natural organic facial oils</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=189&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>what is DHC ?

Jojoba oil is especially good for the skin, because it helps to maintain/supplement the natural oils your skin produces. I understand it helps skin because it is close to the natural sebum in your skin. Apricot kernel is another gentle oil, readily absorbed that is lighter than jojoba and is also a good moisturizer. It is less expensive than jojoba oil. Both oils are listed as non-comedogenic.

I have such a little amount of hair on my body, I might shave once a month for a few straggler hairs. I had access to a good laser for a few years and would treat myself a few minutes here and there. It was a nice benefit. I have performed laser hair removal for a couple years. People with olive/brown/black skin are at increased risk of pigmentation problems, even with lasers that are supposed to be used for "everyone." There is always a risk of pigmentation problems, even for light skinned people. I have not seen it on very light light skin, Fitzpatrick scale 1 &amp; 2. To minimize risk: 1. Go to someone EXPERIENCED in laser hair removal who has treated your skin color, on the laser they will treat you with. I cannot stress this enough. I would ask someone, "about how many laser hair removal treatments, with this laser, did you do last month?" 2. Ask if treating your skin with hydroquinone for a few weeks before treatment might be helpful. 3. Use a high quality sunscreen daily. Wear a hat outside when you can. 4. Ask about side effects. If they tell you that there are no potential side effects, run as fast as you can. They either are inexperienced, untrained, or just eliminating information they don't think you need. 5. Ask what they would advise if you have pigmentation changes? 6. Tell them all products you use on your face such as anti-age and anti-acne. 7. Ask for a free "test spot" and/or free consult, or both. 8. This question could be considered rude, but I might ask if their pay is based on commission. Almost all people would never sell a product/treatment that is not appropriate, but sometimes pressure regarding $$ might possibly influence presentation of the service. I have very light caucasian skin and blue eyes. Honestly, I had darker skin, I would have been cautious. With lighter skin on the laser, lighter skin can tolerate aggressive treatment. Darker skin can be problematic. Laser hair removal is awesome, but ask questions. Good luck to you.

I have not worked with lasers the past year, so my experience might be obsolete. Almost all the lasers I have used have had an element of "skin cooling." The only one, I have worked with, that did not, was the Yag (532/1064) which I used for tattoo removal and hyperpigmentation. Pigmentation can occur with this laser. The following lasers (I used) had a cooling element. The lightsheer has a "chill tip." Pigmentation can arise from this laser. The V-Beam has a cryo element that occurs very rapidly with the pulsing, this can cause pigmentation issues. The Smoothbeam also has a cryo element, this can also lead to pigmentation issues. Also, pigmentation problems can be related to using settings which are not appropriate for the procedure and the patient's skin. Laser settings are very individual. Make sure you go to someone experienced with lasers.

They are not zapped. The red patches are not diminished either. The problem was that with that pulse duration setting, my skin couldn't tolerate higher than 26J/cm^2 (we tried 27 J/cm^2 and it burned the epidermis) and at that level the IPL is inefective. If you have done IPL, what kind of settings do you use in such cases? The skin doesn't tolerate high intensity cause it absorbs a lot.

Wake up somewhat oily in mornings. I have been using a tiny dab of the Monistat PG with my foundation to make it spread smoother and thinner, but it sometimes looks cakey. I think that is the foundation I've been using. I am trying a new foundation by Physicians Formula that contains a couple of actives, including Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate (very little), so I'm thinking I might try using the C/E Gel in mornings and DMAE/LA cream at night. Does that make sense? Honestly, I'm relatively new to mixing my own skincare products and could use all the guidance I can get.

Monistat is supposed to be the last and separate layer on your skin, then it looks matte doesn't matter how oily the layer below is and doesn't interfere with absorbtion of actives. Sometimes Monistat is not compatible with some creams/sunscreens below it especially when the cream doesn't have enough adhession to skin. Then it drags the cream/sunscreen around. If you want to measure the mattifying power, put ONLY Monistat one day (the same quantity as regular cream) and see if it keeps you matte the whole day. I think it would be better to substitute sunscreen + foundation with tinted sunscreen. Less layers and it would look less caked. You could try to add actives directly to the sunscreen. DMAE will liquify Carbomer gel so avoid sunscreens that contain carbomer thickener. Put on top Monistat as a finishing layer and you won't have to blot so much hopefully. When you go to bed, you don't need to look matte so Monistat is not necessary.

I have not been able to find a sunscreen that is oil free with Zinc Oxide as the only active ingredient. And I was told to use the Monistat as an anhydrous base for Vitamin C. What if we took a different approach. How long does it take for the actives (DMAE/LA) to be absorbed into the skin? What if I washed my face when I got up in the morning, used my DMAE/LA cream, went through my normal pre-shower morning routine (breakfast, exercise, etc. -- about 1 1/2 to 2 hrs.), showered -- washing off the cream, applied Monistat, then foundation that contains sunscreen? Do you think the actives would be as effective as leaving the cream on under my foundation?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>orangehrzn</string></value><value><string>mamacat</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>cb8bf6feb092f641ff0a759f93af4a522f5201f6</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Hormones and Growth Factors</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>telangiectasia</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1714&amp;view=previous</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Dr Tod , I recently read in an article : " there is no doubt that estrogen cream produce increased dermal collagen but they carry the side effect of facial telangiectasia " .

I understand that the doctor has written some reports on this subject. Has anyone here heard of this? The EU Cosmetics Directive In January 2003, the European Union amended its cosmetics directive (76/768/EEC) to ban the use of chemicals that are known or strongly suspected of causing cancer, mutation or birth defects. The amendment went into force in September 2004 and bans carcinogens, reproductive toxins and mutagens from cosmetics. Companies are required to remove these chemicals from cosmetic and personal care products sold in the EU. Since the EU directive requires that all cosmetic products containing toxic chemicals be reformulated for the EU market, we're asking cosmetics companies to make those reformulated products readily available in every market they serve - both domestically and globally. As far as I'm concerned, what's important for the EU should be important for us, when it concerns our health. What do you think? Here's a link to a site that lists all companies that have signed the compact agreement, and a shorter list of some who have not... http://www.safecosmetics.org/companies/signers.cfm It's amazing what the multi-billion dollar cosmetic industry will try and make you believe, isn't it?

Thats probably why almost all drugs (even aspirin) cause undesirable side effects. That may also be the case with a lot of sunscreens. One alternative option would be to use organic sunscreens.

There are other articles they have also on that site related to this topic, in which they discuss some of the actual chemicals used in sunscreens and the dangers they have when applied topically. When you go to the site, click on "Suntanning", then on "Healthy Suntanning" "Free Radical Generators and Gender-Bending Estrogenic Chemicals" For decades, irresponsible cosmetic companies and a small group of very vocal, publicity-seeking dermatologists have strongly advocated that chemical sunscreens should be heavily applied before any exposure to sunlight, even on young children. They insisted that such sunscreen use would prevent skin cancer and protect your health. This was despite of a lack of any adequate safety testing of these chemicals. (It should be emphasized that most dermatologists are much more cautious and careful.) On the other hand, over the past decade, many scientists studying cancer have come to virtually the opposite conclusion; that is, the use of sunscreen chemicals may be increasing the incidence of cancer and that sunlight exposure may actually decrease human cancer rates and improve your health. It now appears that many heavily-used chemical sunscreens may actually increase cancers by virtue of their free radical generating properties. And more insidiously, many commonly used sunscreen chemicals have strong estrogenic actions that may cause serious problems in sexual development and adult sexual function, and may further increase cancer risks. It is not that these compounds were ever viewed as benign substances. Organic chemists have been long aware of the dangers of compounds in chemical sunscreens. Such chemicals are widely used to start free radical reactions during chemical synthesis. These chemicals are the dangerous types that one carefully keeps away from your skin while working in a laboratory. To use them, you mix them into a combination of other chemicals, then flash the mixture with an ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet absorbing chemicals then generate copious amounts of free radicals that initiated the desired chemical reactions. Despite the medical establishment's near unanimity on the issue of sunlight exposure, on other health issues in the past, serious errors been promoted to the public. 1. In 1927, 12,745 physicians endorsed smoking Lucky Strike cigarettes as a healthful activity. In the 1940s and 1950s, thousands of prominent surgeons were used in national cigarette advertisements to reassure the public about the safety of cigarette smoking. 2. In the 1950's, lobotomies were promoted for mental disorders and produced near-totally dysfunctional people. 3. In the 1960's and 1970's, diets high in omega-6 polyunsaturated fats and partially hydrogenated fatty acids such as safflower oil and margarine were recommended to reduce heart disease. However, long term studies found that, while such diets decreased heart disease, they increased the total death rate and the cancer rate and produced accelerated aging.

Chemical sunscreens have three primary defects: 1)They are powerful free radical generators. Their free radical generation increases cellular damage and changes that lead to cancer. Psoralen - such a compound that is used to treat psoriasis increases skin cancer rates 83-fold. 2)They often have strong estrogenic activity. Estrogenic - "Gender Bending" - chemicals interfere with normal sexual development - Engendering a host of secondary medical problems - see more below. 3)They are synthetic chemicals that are alien to the human body and accumulate in body fat stores. The human body is well adapted to de-toxify biologicals that it has been exposed to over tens of millions of years. But it has often has difficulty removing new and non-biological compounds such DDT, Dioxin, PCBs, and chemical sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens include: Benzophenones (dixoybenzone, oxybenzone) PABA and PABA esters (ethyl dihydroxy propyl PAB, glyceryl PABA, p-aminobenzoic acid, padimate-O or octyl dimethyl PABA) Cinnamates (cinoxate, ethylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, octyl methoxycinnamate) Salicylates (ethylhexyl salicylate, homosalate, octyl salicylate) Digalloyl trioleate Menthyl anthranilate Avobenzone [butyl-methyoxydibenzoylmethane; Parsol 1789] - This is the only chemical sunscreen currently allowed by the European Community. However, its safety is still questionable since it easily penetrates the skin and is a strong free radical generator.

I can see that for certain medical conditions, you would need to find products that work to fight against them, but in terms of simply finding a good product that cares for your skin, why is that important? Going to the local discount store may save you money in the short-term, but what about ingredients like SLS and parabens? I'm sorry I haven't ordered the infopack, but maybe you could let us know if SLS and parabens are good or bad ingredients? I would appreciate that, if it's not too much trouble, thanks!

I don't have acne to where it is all over my face, but usually just isolated to one area of my face. I have tried Murad and ProActiv and neither has worked for me. The only problem is that i just can't stick to a regimen, I'm not very responsible. The nature's cure system is just 2 things daily, 1 all natural pill and cream morning and night. This seems like it would work great for me and I was wondering if that would really clear me up. I have read all the reviews, and I am going to buy it tomorrow, I just wanted to see if there have been any really good success stories with it. Also, does weight have anything to do with acne?

Back to top rusty Guest Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 6:12 pm Post subject: I believe the treatment your speaking of consists of a benzoyl peroxide cream. This WILL dry out your skin. Benzoyl peroxide has in the past helped clear my acne, but not without redness and irritation of the skin. Drinking plenty of water DOES help with acne and oiliness as it flushes impurities out of your system. Rigorous exercise also helps improve cardiovascular health (blood flow). Better blood flow is another means of cleansing your system, and providing nutrients to the different parts of your body. Just try not to irritate your skin by overwashing or allowing it to become too drie. It is best to wash your face no more than twice a day, and always use a moisturizer while your skin is still moist. When applying a moisturizer do not rub your skin as it tends to strech and irritate it. Instead use a finger and apply creams with small, light strokes. Next step is to lightly pat your skin for about half a minute. To be honest, I've seen best results from neutrogena's topical cream. I can't remember the name of it, but it only contains 2.5% benzoil peroxide, which is much gentler on your skin. Try using that and a neutrogena moisturizer as its best to stick with a regimen consisting of products of the same brand. Hope this helps. - Rusty Back to top bryan Guest Posted: Tue Feb 01, 2005 5:40 pm Post subject: thank you very much, i'll have to try the neutrogena system if the nature's cure doesn't work. but, so far, the nature's cure system has helped my face improve quite a bit, but at the same time, also dried my face out alot. I drink way too much soda, so i'll drink alot more water daily, but the soda is diet soda. what moisterizer do you recommend if i were to get some for moisterizing my face, i don't think nature's cure has a moisterizer, so i would have to buying it from a separate third party. i don't like oily lotion, as it for some reason makes me feel like my face looks terrible, i like the kind of lotion that moisterizes the face, then just kinda goes and dissapears, like the lotion that came with proactiv. any suggestions?

Leaves no oiliness at all, causes no spotty outbreaks, is unperfumed no-nonsense stuff and makes your skin feel refreshed, soft and comfortable feeling, especially after using drying spot treatments or cleansers. It's the only moisturiser that makes my skin look better rather than worse. And the only one I've re-bought. Go to a counter and ask for a free sample to try out!

According to my experience it really reduces the oil by -30% as it claims. Can't eliminate the oil completely though so don't expect miracles. The active ingredient is an alcohol extract of Scutellaria Baicalensis Root. The alcohol tends to irritate my skin a little but try it and see if it's good for you.

Instead of using just the Gel, I would use the BIO SPECIFIC three-step program. Unlike Proactiv, which I used to no success, this system is designed for different types of skin. I had acne in two areas of my face, on my forehead, and on my cheeks. I used the combination/oily Yves Rocher system, and within one week my skin was clearing up. They use completely natural ingredients derived from flowers, and it makes my skin feel awesome. I noticed my skin being very uncomfortable using Proactiv. But this Yves Rocher stuff really gets rid of my acne, it repairs my skin, and the third step, the lotion, really makes my skin feel radiant and awesome.

To start off, I have extremely oily skin, visible pores, and I tend to break out quite often. I tried everything. Even knowing I'm allergic to Benzyol peroxide, I still tried Pro Active. Benzyol Peroxide seemed to reduce the acne, but I would get an alergic reaction that would leave my skin red, tender, and even more oilier than ever. On a usual basis, starting from mid-day, my skin would get very, very oily and my make-up would change colour (end up looking dirty and dull). Not only was it unsightly, but I felt like I had this thick oily, dirty film on my face. By the end of the day I was desparate to wash my face. This would be 10x worst if I were in hot and humid weather. Luckily, I discoverd Yves Rocher and I decided what the heck, the price was very reasonable anyway. After 4 days of using the Bio Specific Pore Regulation for oily/combo skin (cleanser, toner, moisturizer, and the deep treatment balancing gel) morning and night, I noticed a huge difference. I'm still getting a little oily, but nothing compared to before, a little powder can solve that. My skin feels so clean throughout the day, no oily film. My skin has also cleared up, tone has evened out, and looks more radiant and healthy. Even with foundation on, my skin feels so clean, like I'm not wearing anything. My make-up goes on more easily and stays on pretty well after 8hrs. However, I'm only on my 4th day, apparently, it takes about 15 days to -30% oil reduction. I still have yet to test how my skin would react in other conditions; Like how much oily will my skin get if I sweat (workout) or in humid envirionments, etc...Another concern that I have is that it has been working so well after the 3rd day, I'm afraid it will eventually dry out my skin. But I figure if that starts to happen, I just won't use it every day. I hope this will help anyone out there that may have the same problem as I do.

There is the Journal of the American Medical Association, also called JAMA. There is the New England Journal of Medicine, also called NEJM. Assuming somebody made up their own journal, then find the author of the article and check the credentials, ie where was the study done, how many subjects, were there any controls, what did they use to measure success, etc. When that fails, try having the company send a copy of the "article". I hope what you have found is true, but I believe you have been scammed.

It surely disperses it but it hangs in the form of microscopic crystals (like powder in liquid). If MAP is not totally dissolved, it will look like a white powder on your face after the base dries out. Also PG is kind of oily, I wouldn't go for a totally PG base. The question is why use PG when you can simply use water. MAP takes time to dissolve in water - it tends to form small crumbs in the begining which are hard to get rid of so predispersing it in PG and then adding the water will make it much easier.</string></value><value><string>Thank you so much for the quick reply.

RetinA is meant to be put on at night, not during the day, and certainly not several times a day. You may try every using it every other night in the begining. Also do NOT use soaps of any kind on your face - that just irritates it. You don't need facial washes either unless you wear waterproof cosmetics or sunscreens and need to take them off.

I never rib my face afetr a shower, always pat it gently. For breakfast i have a large glass of orange juice, along with cereal and semi-skimmed milk, as well as some green tea. After breakfast i take my vitamins, which include: Cod liver Oil - 1000mg Vitamin C - 60mg Zinc - 15mg Be careful with the zinc it has the tendancy to make you sick, so i always cut it in half and take the other half after lunch ! Throughout the day I aim to drink at least 2 litres of water. For lunch ill have a sandwich of some kind with 2 apples, a banana and yoghurt, along with some orange juice. On returning home, ill get a green tea and another piece of fruit. Tea will consist of something light, like pasta with salad, i've avoided fast food for 7 yrs im quite proud :lol: I always have a bath in the evening, a relatively hot bath, sort of like making my bathroom liek a steam room, it does wonders to the skin trust me! Some things which i haven't mentioned which i found helped me clear my zits : - A lot of sleep (at last 9 hours a night) - Changing bed sheets frequently - The Sun - Don't touch your face with your hands during the day, its amazing how much bacteria is on your hands from all sorts of places. - Avoiding fast food, take aways, etc etc its hard to stop but you never go back, i know there is no direct link between fast food and acne but still - Keeping to a routine, and not going from it I hope this helps guys, i know its my experience and such, but i thought i'd try and help others from experience, good luck everyone anyway :D Back to top missinggirl Joined: 18 Jun 2007 Posts: 12 Location: UK Posted: Mon Jun 18, 2007 5:56 am Post subject: Hello This sounds like a really good idea, you are what you eat.

Buy the veggie ones from solgar, start taking three at each meal until you get your looks back, and then one at each meal should do it, depend how bad your skin is really. well it worked for me. i started taking three at each meal and two inbetween meals to get to the level i wanted and now i just take two at each meal to maintain clear skin, though its not just my skin thats better now, everything is, hair, weight, teeth, gums, its really worth a try, at least for two weeks. missinggirl Back to top Wish</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>f68e71476f8e80261d7c73600961abe91454734d</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Acne</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>missinggirl Joined: 18 Jun 2007 Posts: 12 Location: UK Posted: Mon Jun 18, 2007 5:54 am Post subject: Acidophillus (friendly bacteria) can clear skin?

My face is no longer oil slik at the end of the day. No side effects, except dry lips when weather is cold. It is highly effective and the ONLY drug that can actually do the job. Here is a reference to a medical study that confirms my observations: Dermatology, Vol. 196, No. 1, 1998, pages 140-147 Oral Retinoids in the Treatment of Seborrhoea and Acne C.E. Orfanos, Ch.C. Zouboulis Abstract: Isotretinoin is an extremely effective drug if given systemically in severe forms of seborrhoea and acne, being the only retinoid with potent sebostatic properties. Its unique activity on the sebaceous gland still remains unclear since isotretinoin barely binds to cellular retinoic-acid-binding proteins and to retinoic acid receptors. Its bioavailability is approximately 25% and can be increased by food 1.5-2 times; after 30 min, the drug is detectable in the blood and maximal concentrations are reached 2-4 h after oral intake. The major metabolites of isotretinoin in blood are 4-hydroxy- and 4-oxo-isotretinoin, while several glucuronides are detectable in the bile. 4-Oxo-isotretinoin is present in plasma in a 2- to 4-fold higher concentration 6 h after a single dose. Steady-state concentrations appear after 1 week. The half-life elimination rate of the parent compound ranges from 7 to 37 h while that of some metabolites does so from 11 to 50 h. Isotretinoin crosses the placenta and is recognized as a strong teratogenic compound. About 10-30% of the drug is metabolized via its isomer tretinoin. Excretion of isotretinoin occurs after conjugation with the faeces or after metabolization with the urine. The epidermal levels of isotretinoin are rather low and no progressive accumulation, either in serum or in the skin, is found. After discontinuation of therapy, isotretinoin disappears from serum and skin within 2-4 weeks. Isotretinoin is the most effective drug in reducing sebaceous gland size (up to 90%) by decreasing proliferation of basal sebocytes, suppressing sebum production and inhibiting sebocyte differentiation in vivo. The molecular basis for its antisebotrophic activity has not been fully elucidated. Isotretinoin also exhibits anti-inflammatory activities. Systemic isotretinoin is today the regimen of choice in severe seborrhoea, since it reduces sebocyte lipid synthesis by 75% with daily doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg after 4 weeks. Patients who have received oral isotretinoin therapy for seborrhoea do not usually experience a relapse for months or years. In severe acne, a 6- to 12-month treatment with isotretinoin 1 mg/kg/day reduced to 0.5 or 0.2 mg/kg/day according to the response is recommended (cumulative dose of >120 mg/kg). Contraception is essential during isotretinoin treatment in women of childbearing age 1 month before, during and for 3 months after discontinuation of treatment.

Is the low dosage different and can you only get it from a dermatologist? Low doses accutane, 10mg/day, have almost no side effects except dry lips. I don't feel depressed that my skin is not oily anymore and looks good without anything on it. I buy it from internet from international sites, have no nerves nor money anymore to deal with stupid overpriced dermatologists and the predatorry inflated prices on the USA market. I have regular liver tests to monitor for side effects. Low doses accutane is the BEST and CHEAPEST thing I've done for my skin EVER! I wish someone told me long time ago about it cause there is a lot of misconception about 'the bad accutane' floating around. Higher doses have more side effects but the 'depression' has never proven to be caused by accutane. Acne people are very depressive without accutane, they can get depressed taking aspirin, does that prove aspirin causes depression lol ?

So if one or both of your parents has recurrent acne, there's a decent chance you will too. I know that one of the causes may have been switching from the pill to an iud recently. I've had blood tests take for my liver functioning. The blood tests never indicated a problem with my liver. The doctor said that adult acne in women is often caused by hormonal changes in women. He said that hormonal changes can be caused by many factors: (1) aging, (2) pregnancy, (3) menopause, (4) going off of birth control, (5) genetics and other factors.

So yes maybe it jsut hormonal. But i don't think you should accept it just yet. And i wouldn't take a Dr's word as gospel, they told me i had acne coz i was depressed, and cz i had hormonal problems.

Now... I'm a 19-year old male student and up until this past February i've never had any problems with acne. I've always had slightly oily skin but i've been able to combat this using a decent face wash and moisturizer. Currently, i've got what you would term mild/moderate acne and it's definitely affected my confidence. I'll just give you a few more background facts... I realised that my outbreaks and acne problem coincided with a New Year's resolution to become a) healthier b) more physically fit and c) lose weight. They're all interconnected but all slightly different goals. So consequently i started to eat very healthily - lot's of fresh fruit and vegetables, few simple carbs (white bread etc.) and snacking on nuts with some nice luxury cereal bars as treats. Most significantly, i started to drink lots of water, much more than i had been previously. So i'm absolutely bemused with why i've started having such bad skin when i always drink at least 2 litres of water every day, eat healthily and exercise daily??? It's mad, surely these changes should change my skin's condition for the better? I feel and look considerably fitter and healthier, and feel great on the inside. It's just my skin!!! I've got olivey skin as a result of being half English and half Indian and both my mum and brother have had problems with acne, most recently my brother had bad acne that had terrible effects on his confidence. Thankfully it's cleared up now for him without the use of prescriptions or medical advice. I've used a number of products but none have had any significant effects that have made me keep using them as part of a regimen. I've found that of these, the most effective is the King of Shaves Facial Primer. I also get terrible razor bumps on my cheeks, where my acne seems to want to limit itself to exclusively. My mum says i should use natural remedies such as gram flour mixed with lemon juice and cucumber juice as well. None of these seem to work despite prolonged recent use. Basically, i'd like to know if anyone else is in a similar position to myself or has been and has found remedies that help them. Thanks for reading all this lol... Andrew.

One possibility would be that changes in diet, exercise, stress levels, alcohol consumption, etc. increased your testosterone levels, which, in turn, contributed to acne. Also, in some people, dramatic increase in exercise promotes sebum production and may also change balance of skin bacteria (due to profuse sweating) and thus contribute to acne. Still, a healthy lifestyle with a bit of acne to deal with may be better than the alternative.

Small Eyes Make Up: Pluck the eyebrows fine to give maximum eye area.Use a little shadow under the lower lashes as well as on the top of the lid.Blend the shadow on the upper lid from the centre outwards, curving it upwards towards the brow in the shape of a wing.Line both the lids, extending the meeting line fairly out, to increase the length of the eyes.Mascara both the upper and lower lashes, using two coats on the outer lashes only. ii. Wide-Set Eyes MakeUp: Pencil the eyebrows close to each other.Add a little shadow onto the bridge of the nose or blend your shadow close to the corner of the nose and stop at the centre of the upper lid.To make the eyes appear a little closer, start outlining the upper lid from the inner corner of the eye, bringing it near the nose ridge, leaving just the width of one eye in between the two eyes.Continue the line towards the outer corner but not quite extending up to it. iii. Close-Set Eyes Make Up Tips: Shape the eyebrows so that they don't have the close-together appearance.Use the eyeshadow on the upper outer half of the lid extending above the eye and under the brow.To offset the closeness of the eyes, start drawing the eye line on the upper lid away from the inner corner.Draw it up and out.Similarly, the lower line should not begin from the inner corner. iv. Deep-Set Eyes Make Up: Use a dark eyeshadow under the eyebrow, but not on the lid, where if you want to, you can use a lighter eyeshadow.Line only the lower lid and extend the line fairly out and up. v. Round Eyes Make Up Tips: Make sure the shape of your eyebrows is angular.Blend your shadow from the centre of the lid and deepen it at the outer edge of the eye, extending it a little beyond the outer corner of the eye.Line the upper lids, starting from the inner corner and extend it out and up so as to suggest length.

I do agree with the poster that said RETNA-A is a good try,or some other type of retinoid.(differin,tazerac) Since I have been on differin gel,my pimples are much less severe,and the redness that occurs after fades much quicker.

For the past 3 weeks I have been breaking out pretty bad...like never before and I know how bad it feels to have zits pop out on your face. At some point I didnt even wanted to go out my apt... However, I have started using pure Aloe gel and it works wonder for my skin. it totally heals it and there are no new breakouts...your skin may feel a little tight at first but thats normal. Just wash you skin (I have been using Spectro Gel for years) and apply a thin layer of aloe gel over your face. let me know how it works out for you!! p.s...I have learned by experience not to pop zits unless they are whiteheads..Otherwise the sebum just spreads under your skin causing other zits. :wink: For how long do you keep aloe gel on your face? Are you supposed to wash it of after a little while? Thanks.

Back to top DrewPeacock Joined: 15 Aug 2006 Posts: 1 Posted: Wed Aug 16, 2006 4:23 am Post subject: I always wondered why head and shoulders was so effective for everyone so I researched the ingredients. Found this on http://www.acne-wise.com/scarring.htm Active Ingredients: Zinc Pyrithione (2%) known for its anti-itching and anti-inflammatory properties, it is used for the relief of skin itching, redness, scaling, flaking and general discomfort brought on by dry skin associated with acne or other skin disorders. It attracts and bonds to dandruff flakes and dead skin cells to help remove from the skin. Ketaconazole is also known to have antiandrogenic effects and can cause a reduction in the production of testosterone and other androgens by the adrenal gland and by the male and female reproductive organs. If you are interesting in this chemical and the Head and Shoulders treatment has not helped you, a good idea is to purchase Nizoral shampoo which contains 2% Ketoconazole. Anti-proliferative agents slow down the production of skin cells without necessarily acting directly against the fungus. One such ingredient is coal tar, which treats only the symptoms of dandruff. Keratolytic agents break down the intercellular bond (keratin) that holds skin cells together on the uppermost layer of the scalp. Therefore, when the top layer of cells are shed, they are separate rather than in clumps. These agents include sulfur and salicylic acid, which, again, treat only the symptoms and not the cause of dandruff. Other active ingreients include Selenium Sulfide, Climbazole and Octopirox. Inactive Ingredients: Citric Acid, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl, Betaine, FD&amp;C Blue No. 1, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5, Fragrance, Glycol, Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Menthol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Polyquaternium-10, Propylene Glycol, Purified Water, Sodium Laureth, Sulfate, Vitamin E and Sodium Hydroxide Hope this helps!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>CalBodyCare</string></value><value><string>BeautifulSoul Joined: 23 Jun 2006 Posts: 2 Location: Toronto,Canada Posted: Fri Jun 23, 2006 12:59 am Post subject: How i got Rid of my acne hey yall.... :lol: My name is Melissa and Im new to the board...everyone say "hi Melissa!" lol just kiddin I just registered so I could share my FAB-U-Lous discovery of clear skin (apparently i am capable of getting clear skin these days thank the lord!) well anyway I dont wanna bore you with minor details but to make a long story short.....I was struggling with acne on my face, neck, and back for like 4 years or so but 2 weeks ago, I read in some forum about a lady who purchased the shampoo called HEAD AND SHOULDERS for her husband to use on his body since he had acne all over his body. She said that the H&amp;S has ZINC in it which is a substance that can be found in other acne remedies. Well at first I thought this was a really crazy idea but I really had nothing to lose. Seriously I tried many things ranging from cheap household products to "THE VERY BEST...PROACTIVE" and that was just shit (oops can i say that?) well it was a total waste of my money and the Head&amp;Shoulders cost me like 5 dollars with tax included from my local grocery store. But anyway I started using it as a cleanser and I have really oily skin so i really dont need a moisterizer becuase the oil from my skin just gives me glowing skin instead of the pimples they use to give me. The bumpy old pimples dissappeared instantly (i started noticing changing in how my face felt like instantly the first time and i started SEEING a difference like 2-3-or 4 days after the start date...AMAZING!) i always use to get acne breakouts before, during and after my menstrual cycle days however....when my cycle came...I "felt" bumps coming (you know what I mean? like the pain you feel before one appears right smack on your chin or cheeK? yep those ones) however I did not see them appear bigger or visible they simply packed their bags and up and left my entire body. I really dont wanna sound like im selling this product and I hope everyone who reads this takes it as a helpful hint rather than a cure that is engraved in stone. Im not a physician (yet....although i hope to be in the years to come) and im not an expert ....im just a girl that feels beautiful again and wants to share it with the world so they too can be as happy as i am these past couple of days. Although to be truly honest, the shampoo does not help get rid of your old scars from the acne. they do get rid of past, present and (hopefully) future pimples to arrive. I always used cocoa butter (the one with the lady's face on it) to help gradually fade blemishes and stuff. sorry about writing a novel but i just wanna say that if your not using anything or haven't had anything that works just gives this a try to see if it can help even if it is for a little bit. i swear by it becuase i have had 2 small (insy winsy tinsy) pimples for the past two weeks and thats NOTHING compared to my 4-6 new ones every 2 days :? . Im 20 years old and now that my face is not an issue anymore ....i have set my eyes on more important things in life. its an amazing feeling and i hope you all (those who are having difficulties with their skin) get the same chance I did. thanks for your time and good luck :) email me if yall need anything bubblez808@hotmail.com Back to top orangehrzn</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>107b68c9cfd0da664facc1b9a95eaa1f6f00da46</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Miscellaneous Skin Conditions</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>milia</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2234&amp;view=next</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>hi....i just posted my own post about milia because i didn't see this one first. okay....this organic milia product. has anyone else used it? can anyone tell me if it is possible that this stuff works. it is 133 dollars a pop, and while i want my milia to go away, i don't want to waste 133 dollars! anyone tried it? or anything else?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>aburke</string></value><value><string>guest Guest Posted: Thu Feb 10, 2005 3:38 pm Post subject: milia what ingredients should one avoid in a lotion not to get more of these white hard fat deposit under the skin .

There is actually a "knock-off" version- much cheaper and same ingredients called "AcneFree." They sell it at Walgreens or target, but you could buy it online too at drugstore.com. For the kit it's around $20, but go to dailypress.com and they have a printable coupon for $5 off. I've heard egg yolk masks help too.

The cleanser, toner and lotion revolve around the standard Benzoyl Peroxyde so if a cheap cream with that active doesnt help with your acne or irritates you, its unlikely that system would be of help to you. The thing I didn't like is that the toner contains SD alcohol. How many decades have to pass for the cosmetics companies to understand SD alcohol is irritable and does NOT cure acne !!!!

I noticed some reduction in pigmentation after about a month of twice daily use. Also, a reviewer on this site states that her melasma reappeared after stopping use: According to my dermatologist, that is normal, especially if sunscreen is not being applied daily and/or there is even one incident of overexposure to sun (I asked about that before buying the product). I wear sunscreen daily in addition to that which is provided by this product, and I have decreased my use to once a day. That's all!

I think we have to also remember that , in addition to changing the lighting, sometimes companies use" before and after" photos of people who have had more invasive procedures (such as a deep peel), and they would like you(the buyer)to attribute the dramatic changes to their topical product. Dr. Denese, who says that the effects of a deep peel are "extraordinary", claims that some companies actually do this, and to the trained eye (one who has done deep peels) it's obvious in the photos.

(pock marking) My wife is such an awesome person. She spends most of her time taking care of other people and has not been taking care of her skin as she should. She doesn't feel comfortable going to a spa to get her face peeled, but she is in very bad need of some kind of facial peel. Years of neglect have left her skin very clogged. She has developed pock-marks and blackheads all over her cheeks. I think she would be comfortable if I spent the weekend giving her spa-treatment at home. I just don't know what product would be effective to use (and not too cost prohibitive). Can you give me the name of a product that works great in such situations? Maybe something that I don't have to do to her too often (maybe once a month) that would help keep her skin clean and clear. thanks in advance Reply With Quote Back to top az mom Joined: 27 Aug 2006 Posts: 4 Location: AZ Posted: Sun Aug 27, 2006 8:09 pm Post subject: Know the feeling...

Can't tell you enough how much this (temporarily) plumps up any pock marks and makes them less noticable. This is an expensive product (around 75 for a small jar), but great for special occasions. Other than that, once a week I do an egg white mask (whip an egg white and let it dry) to tighten the skin, and I do an egg yolk mask to give my skin a heavy vitamin K boost and clear up any dirt/pimples. Hope that helps! You're a very good husband for being so concerned and willing to help out your wife! Best of luck!

Start with low doses, if your skin gets irritated, dilute the dose. Retin-A can be prescribed from your dermatologist and you can dilute it if you want with aloe vera gel to the level u can tolerate it. Cheap and effective salicilic acid lotions (start with 1%) can be found at http://www.cosmeticscop.com/shop/category2.asp?CAT=48&amp;TYPE=1&amp;PAGETYPE=S Less irritable option is mandelic acid exfoliator (apply ONLY once per day): http://skincarerx.com/review_box.html?pid=10 If your acne is severe maybe you could try accutane. About the acne scars - topicals are unlikely to work, sorry but that is the truth. There is an acceptably priced product that claims to control the oil production (lowering the oil production will clear up mild acne). They claim it is non irritable, you could check it out: http://www.clearogen.com/acne-lotion.html Another product that claims control of oil production: http://www.greatamericanproducts.com/pages/Home/Shopping/Skin_Care/MCP_Acne_Clear I never tried any of the oil control products so can't offer a personal experience but I think they are worth trying if your skin can't tolerate the usual irritable treatments.

To my surprise, diluted retin-A micro is less irritable (start from 0.025%, 0.10% is the maximum). Initially you will flake off from retin but that will go away at low concetration. Another thing is that every time I increase the concentration, I get a mild break out which goes away in a few days. Also, it doesn't keep me pimple free all the time. If you have mild to moderate acne, I would try the oil reduction MCP acne clear. It's $16/oz and they have 30 days money back so nothing to loose. I just ordered one of it cause I still have mild breakouts from time to time. If it doesn't work I would try the Mandelic acid exfoliator. If that doesn't work or if you have severe acne, I would go dirrectly to accutane. If you don't have active acne and your scars are redness and that redness is not actually broken capillaries, the best you can do is to leave your skin alone. Believe me applying less junk on your face will clear it up better than any product.

When I had some acne in my teens, I got rid of it completely and quickly by giving my face an herbal sauna using Swiss Kriss. It's a blend of herbs that's actually marketed as a laxative, but if you buy it, it should contain instructions (inside the box) on how to use it for an herbal facial sauna. You can get it at a health food store. In fact, you may not even need the Swiss Kriss. Try giving yourself a facial sauna first with just a pot boiling water and a large towel covering it all, with your face exposed to the steam for about ten minutes. But keep your face far enough away from the steam so that the intense heat doesn't damage you skin or cause broken capillaries. You should feel your face breaking out into a sweat. The steam should unclog your pores and release excess sebum that causes acne.

It's a natural product with no side effect. Infact turmeric is a component which is very useful for acne, pimples, skin rashes etc. I can't say that the product will work on you like a magic! But keeping patience and regular use will help you out to solve your problem. Drink 10-12 glasses of water daily and eat plenty of green vegetables. Besides that try to lead a stressfree life. All the best! :) Back to top love me Joined: 03 Aug 2006 Posts: 1 Posted: Mon Aug 14, 2006 10:29 pm Post subject: All Natural! Hi!

The demodex theory has been around long time but few got cured - I guess as many as the ones cured from using shampoo to wash their faces. The current view of rosaceans is that demodex can aggravate rosacea but is not the cause of it usually. Second, 'testimonials' on a commersial site are not exactly a 'proof'. You better go to http://www.acne.org/messageboard/ http://forum.rosaceagroup.org/ and check what people that have tried it say about it - and its the usual situation - one or two 'got cured'. The rest still have their problems. By no means try it, it's not super expensive but first the company doesn't have return policy - speaks of itself and second im a little tired of products that promise pore reduction and rednes reduction but have zero effectiveness.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Crystallynn Joined: 07 Dec 2006 Posts: 12 Location: Zephyr Cove, NV Posted: Thu Dec 07, 2006 7:39 pm Post subject: What I'm going to do for my Redness and vein condition...

The kind of redness or flushing characteristic of rosacea responds less dramatically. I attended a seminar last week and learned about other types of light therapy. It's amazing, and the technology is expanding almost on a daily basis.

You should stop using any products and see if it goes away in a few weeks. If not, you should go to dermatologist. Back to top newskinoasis Joined: 09 Sep 2006 Posts: 59 Posted: Wed Nov 01, 2006 2:46 pm Post subject: One way to know if it might be rosacea is how you answer this question. Do you blush and if so does it take several minutes for the flushing to subside? Most rosacea sufferers answer "yes" to this question. Another skin condition that presents much like rosacea is couperose. Couperose causes redness of the skin and telangectasias (spider veins) but its most common cause is harsh products, scrubbing the skin, allergic reaction. Another possibility is eczema or contact dermatitis, an allergic reaction to any number of things. Visit your dermatologist as soon as possible for a definitive diagnosis and the proper treatment.

It's formulated for erythema (redness) and rosacea. In fact, I recently attended a skin-care seminar and asked one of the featured speakers (a physician) what to use for eczema on a 2-year-old child. His response: instead of steroid creams, use SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel, followed by a thin application of SkinCeuticals Hydra Balm. I tried it on my grandson and it worked. But you have to be vigilant--apply at least twice a day, even when the redness subsides, in order to keep the skin in good condition.

I especially like the Infopacks offered on this site! As a result, the following is a regimen I put together. I’m looking for any feedback or suggestions. I'm sorry if this is long but I really want to cover all bases and reverse aging as much as possible and delay any future signs. Thanks. My Profile: Male. I’m middle aged. I have lines around eyes and crows feet, and lines on the forehead. There’s some sag to skin. No acne. Light even skin tone. I am thin w a gaunt appearance. I also get Botox. Prior experience: glycolic acid 10%, stryvectin sd - no noticable improvements. ****************** sugar scrub - 2 times a week ****************************** CLEANSE – morning / night ****************************** TONE - nothing planned since I don't really understand the purpose except for a second cleaning. I thought it is for removing womens make-up that was not removed by Cleanser If not - any recommendations? ****************************** EXFOLIATE steps: 1a. Glycolic Acid 20% face - morning/night (to stimulate collagen) 1b. Glycolic Acid 10% eyes, neck - morning/night 2. Coper Peptide - eyes, face morning/night 3. Niacinamide 2% face, eyes – morning / night (to improve hydration) (Home-made) 4. DMAE face, eyes, neck – morning / night (to reduce skin sag) (Home-made) **************************** MOISTURIZE- SEAL Aveno Positively Raidant Daily Moisturizer w SPF 30 - face, eyes *************************** PROTECT SPF in moisturizer above. ************************* QUESTIONS: 1. I may get a prescription for Retin-A. That would replace the Gycolic Acid step correct? 2. The above home-made products must contain a base cream. I am unsure what to use. The base cream on ThePersonalFormulator.com site contains Dimethicone. To my understanding, this is good to have in a cream to seal in the moisture. However, using this in an Exfoliation stage would block the next product from entering the skin. Is this correct? 3. Do I need to increase the strength of exfoliating products since the addition of each product especially the moisturizer will dilute/weaken that which is on my skin? 4. How long should I wait before applying the next product? 5. For the products above, is there a site you would recommend for purchasing? 6. Is there anything I should watch out for or are they basically the same?

I am treating this as a hypothetical - take (or don't take) any/all advice with that in mind... Quote: sugar scrub - 2 times a week You have a lot of exfoliation going on. I would consider eliminating completely or using an abrasive scrub only once in a while. Glycolic (or any AHA) will do the same thing, so this is extra. Too much exfoliation can overstimulate and cause more oil production. I see this a LOT - dry flakes on top of oily skin... Quote: CLEANSE – morning / night Great - just make sure you're using a very gentle cleanser. Or - see my notes below re: glycolics... Quote: TONE nothing planned since I don't really understand the purpose except for a second cleaning. I thought it is for removing womens make-up that was not removed by Cleanser There is another use for toner (the reason I use one) - to add moisture. Just as some toners may help clean off residue, some may help provide an extra level of hydration. For example, you can use a toner containing hyaluronic acid that will help maintain hydration. A good Hyaluronic acid toner can sometimes be used in place of a moisturizer. This would depend on your current skin conditions. Quote: EXFOLIATE steps: 1a. Glycolic Acid 20% face - morning/night (to stimulate collagen) I believe a 20% every day is way too much. To my knowledge AHA's have not been shown to stimulate collagen production. Rather, the alpha hydroxy acid will remove the outermost layer of dead skin and dried oils and "gunk." :D How/how often I recommend using this depends on the product. If you have a professional 20% glycolic peel, 1x or 2x a week is all you should be doing. However, if you have a 20% AHA solution (like that found in MD Forte Facial Cleanaser III), you can use it more often - every day if your skin tolerates it. If you like the way AHA keeps your skin looking and feeling, I would consider an AHA line. Like this: Use MD Forte Facial Cleanser III as your cleanser. Follow with MD Forte I Facial Cream. The cleanser contains a mix of AHA's that will exfoliate, but won't be as harsh as a professional gel/peel. The Cream is a great way to maintain the soft/texture from AHA, in a formula that can be used regularly. **I recommend MD Forte along with TONS of other products - this is not some special endorsement, the products just happen to fit this situation. Any glycolic line would work... Quote: 1b. Glycolic Acid 10% eyes, neck - morning/night See above... Quote: 2. Coper Peptide - eyes, face morning/night This is fine - I usually recommend that supplemental treatments (those outside of CTMP) are used one at a time. So if you're going to try a copper peptide, try it for 6-8 weeks and if you don't see the results, move on to another supplemental. Quote: 3. Niacinamide 2% face, eyes – morning / night (to improve hydration) (Home-made) This is a place where you could substitute a Hyaluronic acid based toner. Remember - alcohol free, fragrance free, avoid witch hazel, citrus, peppermint and all other irritants in your toner choice. Quote: 4. DMAE face, eyes, neck – morning / night (to reduce skin sag) (Home-made) See notes on Copper Peptide... Quote: MOISTURIZE- SEAL Aveno Positively Raidant Daily Moisturizer w SPF 30 - face, eyes Sounds fine, unless replaced with an AHA moisturizer (see notes on MD Forte facial cream above) Quote: QUESTIONS: 1. I may get a prescription for Retin-A. That would replace the Gycolic Acid step correct? No - this is not a replacement. Retin A (trentinoin) is form of vitamin A that will unplug follicles to help prevent acne and has been shown to reduce wrinkles as well. AHA (glycolic) is an exfoliant, pure and simple. It will not penetrate the pore. Quote: 2. The above home-made products must contain a base cream. I am unsure what to use. The base cream on ThePersonalFormulator.com site contains Dimethicone. To my understanding, this is good to have in a cream to seal in the moisture. However, using this in an Exfoliation stage would block the next product from entering the skin. Is this correct? I am not an expert on home made products - I will defer to one of the many talented people here for this question. Quote: 3. Do I need to increase the strength of exfoliating products since the addition of each product especially the moisturizer will dilute/weaken that which is on my skin? As your regimen currently stands, my opinion is that you ar exfoliating too much! You may consider a 1x per month professionally adminstered glycolic peel at 30-40%. See notes above on Glycolics... Quote: 4. How long should I wait before applying the next product? During your regimen, just complete each step, pat dry very gently and move on. In terms of your macro-cycle, I would try a regimen and supplementals for 60 days before changing, unless a reaction occurs. Quote: 5. For the products above, is there a site you would recommend for purchasing? I use the skinstore.com almost exclusively. Please note that I do get affiliate commissions from them (I'm not linked here - don't worry). Though even if I didn't, I would still recommend them. Their shopping cart is easy to use, their site layout is excellent, they have a 115% price guarantee, their customer service is great, and their selection is second to none. The only sites that even come close are sephora.com and beauty.com, but those sites (to me) are more difficult to navigate and they do not focus on skincare - they also have a huge selection of makeup and peripherals (great if that's what your after). Quote: 6. Is there anything I should watch out for or are they basically the same? Not sure what your referring to - if you're referring to where to shop... yes, watch out for restrictive return policies and bad info! There are sites out there with info presented by untrained personnel, who have no business discussing skincare. :D :D Good luck!!

Too many products being tried all at once, and too strong a %. I believe it's recommended that people who are new to AHA should start out with 10%, or less. And Copper Peptide you need to patch test for a couple of weeks before you put it on your face. Even then, I would start off with every-other night, until your skin gets used to it. Have you read through the skin care articles on the home page of this web site? smartskincare.com I've been using MAP and DMAE every night for about 6 months. Now I'm trying Copper Peptide, so I've been alternating nights with that. Once I'm sure I want to continue with the Copper, I'll probably start using that in the morning, and MAP/DMAE at night. There are lots of suppliers, but two really good ones are gardenofwisdom.com and bulkactives.com. This is just me, but I'm very suspecious of those "base creams". They seem kind of over-priced. I've been using a jar of Coacoa Butter Lotion I got at Sally Beauty Supply, and it works just fine! (I think I posted about how well it works with DMAE in the "Firming/Tightening Ingredients" thread.) Something like Curel or regular Aveeno might also be good choices. Oh, and I've never understood what Toner was for either! It's to moisturize? Why wouldn't you just use a moisturizer for that? Back to top puppychew Joined: 02 Mar 2007 Posts: 18 Posted: Fri Mar 16, 2007 8:13 pm Post subject: Thank you George and Virgo for your response. Please be patient with me. I really appreciate your help. I think I am getting confused since I am basing my regimen on the categories (Cleanse, Tone, Exfoliate, Seal/moisturize. Protect.) It seems products I think belong in a certain category cross over. AHA(Glycolic Acid) which I thought was used in the Exfoliate category can be used in all categories. Supplemental products, Copper P. DMAE, etc. all seem to have different benefits but only one should be used at a time. It's hard to choose when it seems like you need all of them. Let me take a step back. Cleansing step - gently cleans the skin. This is an easy one. Toning cleans your skin more and also adds moisture. Shouldn't adding moisture be done after exfoliation? The first time I heard of Niacinamide was on Dr. T's Eye Care infopack with the receipe in the DIY infopack. It says it helps the skin improve hydration. You mention that this can be substituted with a Hyaluronic acid based toner. Can you recommend a toner? Exfoliating step is to use AHA to remove dead skin. I always thought that AHA should sting a bit, and that its main purpose was to stimulate your skin to produce collagen. I thought it was an alternative to a vitamin C. ( I have been using AHA for about 2 yrs from a plastic surgeon - it's at least 10%). It seems like this is an important step. Would using a cleanser w AHA, only to be quickly washed off with water, be as beneficial? DMAE is good for facial sag. Can I also include this in my regimen? It seems that a lot is done in previous steps to prep the skin but not much is done to feed it. Moisturize step . I thought the step of moisturizing was not to hydrate or add moisture to your skin, but to seal in moisture. What benefit would AHA have? I have some AHA 20% that contains Dimethylamine. To my understanding Dimethylamine is supposed to seal in moisture. If it is in an AHA solution, does that mean there is no need for a moisturizer? It seems the more I read the more confused I get. I spent hours studying Dr. Denese's products. I gave up since there are so many and I couldn't follow her plan except to try to sell her customers everything. I wish this could all be more simple. thanks so much, Ken Back to top Virgo Joined: 11 Aug 2006 Posts: 192 Posted: Fri Mar 16, 2007 8:47 pm Post subject: Oh, sorry, I misunderstood! I thought you were brand new to all these products, but now that I reread your earlier post, you did say that! You're using Botox and getting professional peels, and it's not working? I thought people loved Botox. No? That's depressing news, actually. Since you're already under a doctor's care, couldn't you ask him for advice? He already knows your skin. Although, I don't know, he might be inclined to recommend high-priced products instead of DIY. I think AHA and Vitamin C are quite different! No? You could use Ascorbic Acid for your exfoliation, but then you'd have to alternate it with the Copper, instead of using them at the same time. It's been really hard for me too... to force myself to wait before trying out the next item I'm curious about, but I know I have to give each thing a chance on its own.

Before toning, after toning? What exactly is toning, anyway? Also, what benefits are there to having AHAs, such as glycolic acid, in the moisturizing phase of the regimen. I'm not sure whether I should use an glycolic acid exfoliation pad, like Dr Denese promotes and sells, or use a moisturizing cream with a high percentage of glycolic acid in it ( 10 - 15%). Any suggestions would be appreciated. I seem to be going around in circles with this stuff.

OK, so it's pretty clear where his priorities lie! I guess you're on your own. I really like DMAE. I don't have any true "sag", so I can't tell you if it would work on that, but it does make my skin feel firmer and smoother. I had read that DMAE will make most creams separate or liquify, but I've used two Coacoa Butter based creams already (just cheap drug store body lotions), and they both worked fine with DMAE and/or MAP. Quote: Also, what benefits are there to having AHAs, such as glycolic acid, in the moisturizing phase of the regimen. I'm not using AHA right now, but my understanding was that it actually tends to dry your skin. (Dr. Todorov, for one, has said as much.) I think maybe moisturizers that contain AHA just off-set it with lots of Glycerin and other emoliants. (Someone else can correct me, if I'm wrong.) Quote: What exactly is toning, anyway? I'd like to know too! I always thought it was more of a cosmetic treatment, but people talk about it as though it's doing something more for them.(?)

Is it to simply slough off dead skin cells or does it actually promote collagen regeneration? Exfoliation removes the outermost layer of deadskin cells and any residue/deposits that have built up on the skin surface. This action does a few things... - It will tend to lighten any hyperpigmentation. Age spots look darker as hyperpigmented skin cells build on top of one another - removing the top layer helps to lighten them. - It will make your skin look and feel smoother. Because the top layer is often"bumpy" and uneven looking, removing this layer will give your skin a nice look/feel. - Removing the gunk (a technical term) :) will allow the pore to function properly, and will help to keep acne at bay. (For ance treatments you should use a BHA, not and AHA - a topic for another discussion.) - This exfoliation does not produce new collagen. Quote: When should exfoliation be done in the regimen? Before toning, after toning? What exactly is toning, anyway? - Exfoliate after cleansing before toning. - Depending on teh ingredients of the toner, it will do one of two things: Either act like a "cleansers cleanser" removing any buildup or residue from your clenaser or exfoliant, or act as a hydration agent or added moisturizer. Toners w/ Hyaluronic acid, for example, will provide a base level of moisture, which in some cases can even be used in place of a moicturizer. Toners will act in one of thes etwo ways in some degree depending on ingredients, which have a huge variation from product to product. If I know your skin conditions, I can give you a few toners to try... Quote: Also, what benefits are there to having AHAs, such as glycolic acid, in the moisturizing phase of the regimen. I'm not sure whether I should use an glycolic acid exfoliation pad, like Dr Denese promotes and sells, or use a moisturizing cream with a high percentage of glycolic acid in it ( 10 - 15%). This allows you to get the benefits without a harsh application. Yes - other ingredients "buffer" the action of the aha. I've had lots of clients have great results using an AHA-based moisturizer.

AHA is to remove all the dead skin so you have a clean slate to work with and your skin will better absorb what you next apply. I would imagine that AHA is best applied with a pad or cotton to wipe dead skin away, not to just move it around on the skin. What I read on this site was that AHA can rebuild the skin and that studies showed a 25% increase in skin thickness. Therefore I thought that I was all set using my Glycolic Acid. Actually, I am currently using 20% - I bought it from rejuvamed.com a few years ago, then started using something else, now I'm back to it. Since the seller is no longer in business, I'm not really sure what I have. It's 20% but I dont feel any sting to know it's working. The ingredients are water, glycolic acid, ammonium glycolate, propylene glycol, hydroxyethylcelulose, cholesterol, isopropyl palmitate, peg 40 stearate, magnesium aluminum silicate,cetyl alcohol, sorbitan sterate,stearamidopropl dimethylamine,stearic acid, isostearic acid, glycerl stearate, peg-100 sterate, dimethicone and tetasodium edta. If I'm understanding correctly, the TONER step is where you build, repair, or feed the skin. Is this where I could use DMAE? (I also chose DMAE since Dr. T provided DIY receipe) What can I use to not only correct, but prevent skin sag and fine lines? (I have very clear skin, not oily or dry, just starting to show aging) thanks, ken Back to top rlguy</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>8d9c8d6c9f91c421fafa0976a6aa4997ff7ef4f6</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Invasive Procedures</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>CO2 laser</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3605&amp;view=next</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Hey Everyone......i have dealt with cystic acne and scaring for yrs....

CO2 resurfacing is an invasive aggressive procedure and although your skin may appear healed on the outside, it is much more sensitive and reactive due to the overall trauma it received. I learned my lesson (the hard way) about being aggressive and wanting immediate results. More often than not, the best approach is small steps. Be cautious because the damage can be irreversible.

I had a bunch of samples from the Re Vive line of skincare, which is based on growth factors. I didn't want to waste the samples and I was out of my usual moisturizer, so I used the samples for 65 days or so, without using any other products. The product I used for about 45 days was the Intensite Creme Lustre, which contains Insulin-like growth factor (IGF). I didn't choose this cream for any reason, it's just that I had many samples of it. I tend to pick skincare products based on scientific data and double-blind tests, and I'm a skeptic about absurd snake oil claims. I like Vitamin C and its derivatives, primarily. The Re Vive line has silly pseudo-French names, which lends even less credibility to it, in my opinion. Besides that, I know that growth factors are unstable AND that they are large proteins that cannot penetrate the skin. Nevertheless, if I am to be fair and honest here, I have to admit that my skin looks MUCH firmer, less lined and plumper where I had volume deficits (nasolabial lines, etc.) after using this stuff for 45 days. I'm stumped! ****How is this possible if the actives aren't useful? Is it possible that there is something in the cream to make the IGF penetrate the dermis, and if so, what does IGF really do to the skin? **** This doesn't make sense to me, and believe me, I WANT to hate this product because it is obscenely expensive...still, it seems to work. :shock: Back to top MBGirl</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2838&amp;view=next</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Dr. T, Re Vive skin care?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>eedc1d11188396b547dd6e08e279a8158e6a8a35</string></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Miscellaneous Skin Conditions</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Natural remedies</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=13310&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Has anyone tried any natural remedies to clear acne?

I currently use 0.05% on half of my face and Mandelic acid exfoliator on the other half. Retin A totally suppressed breakouts, the exfoliator no totally but to a high degree. Retin A won't reduce acne scarring, red spots, pore size or oiliness. Ask any well informed dermatologist. I don't know a topical product that actually can address any of these problems.

Actually this happened to me once before, but the last time nth happened. I guess I would'nt be so lucky again this time round. The next day, i tried putting on my lens again. Jeeh i felt pain and i saw the inner lower eyelid to be swollen and red.. I immediately went to the Doctor downstairs..those general practictioners. He told me it was infection, gave me some antibiotics and an eye ointment. Unfortunately they did'nt work. On the 2nd week, i went to the poly clinic.. This time, the doctor told me that the lump was still there because of pus or whatever lah. She did'nt give me any medicine this time round. Argh, no change in my eyelid, went to another GP doctor downstairs, explain everything to him and he gave me antibiotics and eyedrops. Told me that if theres still no change, I should go see the eye specialist. On the first day of infection, i felt a slight discomfort when i blinked.2nd and 3 day there was some pus that was oozzing out. After that,no sign of any more pus.Currently, the lump oneyelid is still slightly red and swollen.

I am desperately looking for some help. When I wake up in the morning I always have some deep lines around my under eye area together with puffiness but those lines go away during the day. I started to notice them three years ago when I got my baby probably because of lack of sleep. What can I do? I tried so many eye creams. I spent so much money but I still have this terrible problem that ruins my day every day. :cry: Back to top guapagirl Joined: 30 Apr 2005 Posts: 83 Posted: Tue May 09, 2006 1:51 pm Post subject: It could be that they are creased in there by sleeping on your side. If you can bear to sleep on your back, it does help. Also gentle eye massage helps as well. press thumbs in socket where eyebrows meet and then press all along socket bone to outer edge. Do the same using middle finger along bottom socket bone. Heavy creams make it worse too. Try and use light gel formulas. DCX from dianayvonne.com is good (cellularskinrx.com have the same stuff called brighteyes or something as well).

There is very little product on my fngertips, but I think that is the point. I always used to use loads of eyecream but it just makes it worse, I think because the skin isa so delicate that if you slap a load of grease on there it's not going to take the weight. I think the theory that they eye area somehow magically absorbs too much of the cream makeing the eye are puffy is a myth though. As a rule I reckon a blob the size of a grain of rice between both eyes is the right amount of product. Which product? When I used eye creams, I liked Murad essential-c eye cream which has spf in it and is in an airless pump - handy because using a rice grain a day means it lasts over a year. I usually use a DMAE serum or DCX which are both gels under my emu/ha/cp mix now. Just remembered, chillled chamomile or green tea bags are good at reducing puffiness as well! :) Back to top MARISHKA Joined: 07 May 2006 Posts: 76 Posted: Wed May 10, 2006 4:27 pm Post subject: guapagirl wrote: I personally don't use eye creams at all, I just gently press the emu oil/HA/Copper peptide emulsion that I use on my face, around my eye area after massaging into my face.

Could you please tell me where do you purchase emu oil/HA/Copper peptide emulsion, DMAE serum and DCX? I appreciate so much. It is so hard to get the right help from anybody. I went to Sephora store a week ago. I got some skin care products for my face and for my eyes just because a lady who works there told me that it really works it is great and it is wonderful. So I spent over 300$ just because I was despretly looking for some big help so I figured she works there she knows what she is talking about. Well I ended up crying because all those products that she suggested me to purchase did not work for me at all. I brought everything back. If you have some questions I will be very happy to help you too? I tried many skincare brands and I also tried some organic and natural skincare lines. Just let me know. Have a good day and thank you so much!

You are only 29 years old, so I think you should try to protect your skin better, first you should use a sunscreen and also find a good moisturizer that has more natural ingredients, also drink 8 glasses of water preferebly before 6 pm then you will not get eye puffiness, also get enough 8 hours sleep. You also have to help your body to fight with aging process from inside. Take vitamin E supplements, vit C, grape seed supplements. I can suggest you to use http://www.devita.net/products/ProductView.mgi2?mgiToken=3F907L2B4L41BD1KE&amp;ID=DM it is a cream that has Hyaluronic Acid which really helps to moisturize skin. Hyaluronic acid is one of the most water loving molecules in nature and can be described as nature’s moisturizer. I wish you Good Luck! Sorry for my English it is not my native language.

I went a few days without the cleanser and still felt dry. People who use this system tend to think its the cleanser drying them out but I think its the continued use of the toner, and I only use it once a day they are probly using it twice as directed so no wonder they are peeling! But the cleanser is a little harsh for some skin types also. I was wondering though of replacing this high dose Vitamin A &amp; E gel I have in place of the toner for the same exfoliating effects. I don't really want that drying effect but I want to build collagen. Is Vitamin A an effective collagen producer. I currently use Vitamin C serum and not sure if thats enough on its own.

It reduces collagen breakdown more than in stimulates collagen synthesis. So it can compliment what C does as long as there is no irritation.

Aha's are okay, but yes they can dry out your skin. Trichloroacetic acid or any other acid will also tend to dry out your skin. That does not mean you shouldn't use them. Skin peels can have a great rejuvenating effect and can help with acne and other skin problems. A great regimen is to use a good skin peel and then a great moisturizer. I personally use TCA as it is a deeper skin peel and then I just use lotion as needed. Skin peels are expensive. I buy my skin peels right off the internet at www.bestskinpeel.com ($25) and it has done wonders for my acne!

I followed her proposed regimen.... AHA was terrible for me : I ended up with red scaly patches &amp; very dry skin .... I will never use AHA again &amp; wish I would have known better but I thought since she was a doctor....!!!! didn't know about Lac Hydrin ... I have the same problems when I do my first phase of a AHA peel. I usually do them once a year. I use a 60% solution. I put it on my face for 6 minutes. The next day certain parts of my skin (forehead and temples inparticular) get red scaly marks. By the 3rd or 4th day they are gone. These marks are actually pigmented or visible marks before the peel but the peel makes them worse for a few days. I do the peel once a week for 4 weeks and except for the minor cosmetic appearance problem with the spots, and in 6 weeks with no down time, my skin looks great and wrinkles and spots and pigmentation problems -- all gone. I'm going to check out the link brad put up for the TCA home peel. As I've mentioned, I had one a few years ago by a plastic surgeon and it made my skin look great. HOWEVER, it was a VERY deep peel and it took alover a week for the scabs/peelings to fall off. after that my skin was red for another couple weeks. After 4 weeks, my skin looked great for about 5-6 months. Then the spots started coming back where they were before, and I got some new ones. In terms of anti aging, my guess (and someone correct me if i'm wrong) is I don't think it's a good idea to use any kind of acid exfoliator as a part of a daily regimine. Mild exfoliation on a 2-3 day basis will improve the appearance of the skin temporarily, but we need healthy productive bottom layers of the epidermis which can get damaged easily if the top layer is consistantly missing. In my opinion, exfoliation should be done as a theraputic measure, not as a cosmetic one. In other words, I'm not a big fan of putting AHA's in formulations or using creams/serums with AHA's on a daily basis. I prefer the theraputic method of getting it all off in a short period of time and start healing from there.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>drtodorov</string></value><value><string>stereo</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>cf0c4458464c4678c32aa7c27d8a835c81ae960d</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Cell Energy Production Co-Factors</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Q 10</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1170&amp;view=next</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Dr Tod, read on another website that " idebenone is very stimulating " Is it the same for Q10 ? is Q10 ok to apply on broken capillaries ?</string></value><value><string>Unfortunately, without the context, this expression has no meaning to me.

If there was you would see many 'no more oil at all' reviews not many 'i think my face is a little bit less oily'. Many 'Oil control' products are simple silicone makeup that mattifies the oily skin surface. Many of them are ridiculously overpriced too. I use 'Monistat Powder Gel' to mattify oily skin although it's not being sold for 'Oil control' but it contains the same silicone mattifiers like much 'fancier'/expensive products (for example Clinique Pore Minimizer Instant Perfector). See that thread: http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=403 Also many people that exfoliate with Acids report that makes their skin drier/less oily but again this is kind of subjective. Exfoliation with Salicylic acid (which is a beta hidroxy acid) is recommended for oily skin since it is oil soluble and can penetrate the pores and unclog them. Also it's a good idea to consult a dermatologist cause what may seem as 'large pores' may be simply acne scarring (bumpy skin) if you used to have acne. About the sagging - some use DMAE for that but the effect is not strong at all. If you have a lot of sagging only a facelift would make a dramatic difference.

Also, people who use retinoids often develop dry skin (partly because of reduced sebum/oil production) as a side effect. Perhaps tretinoin (Retin A) or some other retinoid may be something to consider to both address wrinkles and oiliness. By one should be cautious with retinoids.

You do need to be old enough to have some lines or wrinkles or at least be old enough to see them beginning to form. Also many have reported great results using DMAE or GABA, but it seems that you just have to try them on YOUR skin to see how they work for you. Crow's feet are not really wrinkles......many in their early twenties have crow's feet. I don't think these will help with crow's feet (like the other poster said, Botox will give the illusion that crow's feet are gone....but I don't know of another product to use for crow's feet). I've been using the estrogen cream on my face for almost two months (there are many other threads addressing this) and I'm having the best results I've ever had. I've tried argireline/matrixyl products and did see some improvement in tightening and toning my skin and neck and also in reducing the depth of lines (only have them on my forehead and the "ll" between my eyes). But with the estrogen, they are barely visable anymore and my cheeks and neck are much tighter. I was really very skepticle about trying this too, so I'm very happy with these results. I'll post the cream and website I ordered it from, if you think you're interested (I spent LOTS of time reading which cream to get, reading studies on these creams and the site with the best price, etc.). alarson Back to top orangehrzn Joined: 23 Feb 2005 Posts: 1044 Posted: Wed Jul 27, 2005 10:58 pm Post subject: Argireline supposedly targets exactly crow's feet. My crows feet are almost invisible and the fact Argireline did absolutely nothing for them makes me think it would do absolutely nothing for bigger wrinkles. Also I never heard anybody to erase a single wrinkle with Argireline or Matrixyl so I don't understand what are the 'great results'. About 'improving tone or texture' these are VERY subjective indicators. If you believe customer reviews almost every mediocre moisturizer improves 'tone and texture'. If a product really erases wrinkles I expect to see many reviews like 'wrinkles are gone' and that is not the case with Matrixyl/Argireline although they have been in the system for several years already.

I've ordered some prescription medications that I use and also that my husband uses (for a fraction of what I usually pay) and they have been identical to what I was already using. I also compared the Estrogen to a friends (who paid around a hundred dollars a tube for hers) and the label was identical. I ordered three tubes of it when I ordered (because of the shipping charge of $15.00). But even with the high shipping charge, you'll save a lot!

This is a prescription item. You can find it online from other pharmacies (believe me, I've searched and found many).....but you'll pay a ton more for it. Here is where I found this source. It's a forum about menopause and there are threads about using estrogen for wrinkles as a face cream. The host of this forum has written books about harmone replacement, menopause, etc. and this is the cream (and estrogen) that she recommends to use on the face and she found this source to be the best and the best price.

I use the cream in the morning all over my face and even under my eyes and on my eyelids, but not too close to my eye. The cream is not greasy at all and absorbs right in immediately. I just wait a few minutes and then put my regular moisturizer on over it (the estrogen is not moisturizing at all). I have pretty sensitive skin and break out (the only time I break out now is if I'm trying something new that irritates my skin) if something's too strong, etc. for me so I used it on only half of my face for a couple of weeks before I started using it all over my face. I have had absolutely no adverse reactions to it and I know it's helped tone my face and lessen the depth of lines. I also see that my pores (on my nose....those are the only ones I have that are visable) have gotten much tighter too. I guess it's from using this.....it's the only new product I've tried for the past six months or so.

Then use a light powder concealer like MAC studio fix. This will give you a more Matte finish and will still conceal your acne. Now if you will be wanted more coverage on occasion, maybe for special events or something such as that, you can get the studio stick or a foundation that can double as a concealer/foundation. I like to use the MAC foundation stick. So basically you would put the stick foundation all over and then dab extra on acne breakouts. And for even more coverage you can dust the studio fix over it. But again if you're looking for a very light foundation you might want to try concealer combined with a light powder foundation.

We have JUST received a new technology for Acne Treatment of all skin types, hormonal or otherwise.... MyZENO Acne Clearing Device. It is rather expensive for initial purchase, but replacement cartridges in the unit are only $35 and you get 90 individual treatments from each cartridge. There is only one acne product safe for use during pregnancy and has been FDA approved... MyZENO Acne Device. This has just been introduced and featured on TheView September 5, 2005 for treatment of acne. This device is fabulous. I had the opportunity to use it at a demonstration a couple weeks back and the acne treated starts to heal in 2 (TWO) Days and by the third day -- the acne lesion is gone! It works on the premise of heat. The unit heats the acne lesion to exactly 119 degrees Fahrenheit for 2.5 minutes - this kills the acne bacteria causing the inflammation and healing begins at the time the treatment is finished. We are expecting this to be HUGE for pregnancy and teenagers and menopausal women suffering from hormonal acne.

The key is to not irritate your skin even further or strip natural necesary oils from your skin, which will in turn cause even more oil production and more acne. 1. First use a gentle cleanser. The purpose is to clean your skin and kill acne causing bacteria. Use an all natural soap containing ingredients like Tea Tree Oil, and I really like Dead Sea Minerals. Just avoid anything harsh. 2. If your skin is very oily after you wash your face you can use a toner/astringent that is again very gentle and contains ingredients like Tea Tree, Anti oxidants like Green Tea, Vitamins, ect. * If your skin feels dry or stings after using your cleaner or toner they are too harsh* 3. If your skin is oily don't use a moisturizer. This for me has been key. Instead use nothing at all or try using a Vitamin Serum or something of that sort. Just don't add unnecesary oils to your skin if it's oily already. use blotting sheets during the day to pat away access oils 4. For visible acne try a spot treatment with glycolic acid and salicylic acid and dab it on day and night 5. At night if you wear make-up, use a make-up remover and then wash your face and use toner if necesary. You can add in something like a glycolic night cream or something of that sort or just dab on some spot treatment and your done. *just try to keep it simple and observe how your skin is responding* Back to top all_over</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>13c513e4ee3903a04623bb2629efb4898e3c675a</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Acne</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>How can I get rid of acne scars?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3246&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>3b756b49d0acf608789436703b37576ca2a7b5dc</string></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Best Product for the money?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2835&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>I don't mean to budge in, but what skin care routine are you using? thanks, Allyssa</string></value><value><string>yes you can use makeup over the re9 arbonne set.

They are called NutriMin RE9 from Arbonne. I'm a guy so I can't say whether or not you can put makeup over the cream, but it's long lasting, that's for sure. You start off with the cleansing cream, which is a very nice cleanser. The toner is next, which is a good strong toner and doesn't seem to overdry the face. The serum is very shiny and silky and does burn a little. Then goes the day cream which lasts a long time with the SPF of 8. I've been using Oil of Olay complete prior to this day serum. I don't really like Oil's smell compared to Nutrimin but it's a tad less greasy feeling. I believe something has active copper peptides in it too. The eye cream is very thick. Seems good! Hard to say whether or not anything truelly works to get rid of wrinkles or not because with samples I can't see anything really improving. I've used for like 2 days now and although I like the Nutrimin system, I'm not sure I could buy everything in the basic kit. I really like the cleanser, Toner, and Serum and night cream. I think the night cream almost does more wrinkle fighting than the day cream. I feel little tingles every now and again with the creams....perhaps it's working or just annoying me, I don't know, lol. Things that tend to actually work are probably more annoying than stuff that doesn't do anything. Creme De Le Mur doesn't tingle or anything, but I'm not sure that actually removes wrinkles or not. It might just be a darn good moisterizer. However, I would say the day cream in Nutrimin is just as good for less money because it lasts SOOOO long. You do appear shiny though, that's a fact. I'm looking for a reduction in pore size near my upper inner cheeks and the reduction in wrinkles on my forehead and smile lines.

Also.... What are good exfoliants? I need to buy a good one before I start using the wrinkle removers. I'm a young looking 32, but my only worry is some mild smile lines and 3 forehead wrinkles, not the angry looking eye ones, I prevent those by not making stern faces. That's my tip for everyone who HATES the mean look. Simply don't make those faces, it's very easy. Don't squint in the sun either. Man, I hate the in between eye wrinkle. It also makes you look alot older if you have it. Look in the mirror and see if you make that face alot, and just try your best to prevent it. Oh.... I also saw this product on ebay called Syn-Nake. It has some wierd snake venom in it that's supposedly mimics a low botox effect. I guess it paralyzes your muscles slightly over time unlike Botox. Any takers? Of course I'd like to believe it, but really possible?

Too bad I didn't have more of it to test for like 2 weeks because I love the cleanser , toner, and day cream combo alot. It really leaves your skin moist. That usually means it's a good at coating the skin. If only they had little bottles instead to keep the toner fresh. Wonderful smelling product too. I felt like something was at work after applying the serum. I think it had a mild burning sensation, but not painful. The cream then soothed it.

They generally have a lighter texture than US sunscreens, and they are photostable (a rare trait in US sunscreens). They can be hard to find, but they're worth the trouble. I usually get mine on ebay or strawberrynet.com. FWIW, I don't think Paula's sunscreen is photostable. I'm not sure about the other brand. For more info on photostability, there are some great resources on makeupalley; just ask anyone on the skincare board and they can direct you to the right notepads (which have references for peer-reviewed articles, product suggestions, etc.). Sorry, I can't remember the exact location. As to why Paula doesn't recommend it for oilier skins -- maybe it's the presence of 'cones; many oily-skinned people can't tolerate 'cones (I'm one).

Many products for oily or acne-prone skin like 'oil - free' 'pore minimizers' and 'oil controls' out there have silicone bases. Even the anti-acne drug Retin-A Micro has a silicone+polymer base. What do you mean by Paula's sunscreen is not stable? It has physical sunblocks ZnO, TiO - I don't think these can 'degrade'. As far as I understand, the chemical sunscreens could be unstable, not the physical ones.

I didn't bother to check on the ingredients myself. Re: 'cones: the fact that 'cones are in many products isn't the point. They break a lot of people out. (Aloe is frequently used in skincare products as well, despite the fact that many people are allergic to aloe.) It is unfortunate that so many products contain them, because that just makes it harder for people like me to find stuff that works. It's great that you don't have adverse reactions from them -- the (skincare) world is your oyster...lucky you! I am stuck relying upon blotting papers and powder to rid myself of the oilies -- a temporary fix --at best.

Instead of that there are mattifying foundations with sun screens in them - you may wanna try these. If you decide on applying sunscreen and then putting a mattifying gel on top here is what I know about such gels: Quote: The Instant Perfector is terribly overpriced $18 / 0.5 oz = $36 / oz. Clinique also sells a similar product: Pore Minimizer T-Zone Shine Control $ 14 / 0.5 oz = $ 28 / oz. These prices are too much for a simple silicone makeup! In the same price range is the Peter Thomas Roth Max Anti-Shine Mattifying Gel $35 / oz. The Monistat gel still remains the cheapest mattifier $7 / 1.5 oz = $5/oz. The second cheapest I've found is an Oil Absorbing Gel (all silicones) sold by www.Skintactix.com , www.bion-research.com and some other sites.

Its torture. Hello, I am a 15 year old from NY and i hate my skin. It seems i have a few pimples but not many, its just this redness that after the pimple goes away that it leaves. I have very sensitive skin, so it shows up really easily. the redness has seemed to fade a little bit, but i have had it for about 2 years, and i really hate it. I am not sure if it is some sort of scaring or some sort? But its on both of my cheeks, and i have blackheads on my nose and some small pimples on my forehead, and a little bit on my chin. I am really just focused on my cheeks, because everything else is hardly noticable. I have tried facials, and was recommended clear light, microdermabraztion even accutane, but my mom and dad dont seem to want to pay for that, and dont like the side effects of accutane. I am currently using Aveeno cleanser 3 times a day ( i take 3 showers a day) triaz pads 3% 2 times a day, retin-A .04% 1 time a day at night, duac after school and a pill called doxycyclin 100mg, but am switching to clindomyicin 150mg soon. Please help. Thanks.

Microdermabration is a big NO GO for sensitive acne prone skin. It won't clear up pimples but will irritate the skin and maybe u will get more pimples at the end.

I've had acne ever since I was 14, and later on in my teens I developed enlarged pores &amp; acne scarring around my nose and cheeks. It didn't seem like my acne would be going away anytime soon so I started doing some research (and even stumbled upon this site, which has prooven very helpful). I gave up with acne creams/washes fairly early on in my teens because none (and I mean NONE) worked. I'd follow the instructions to perfection, for extended peroids of time and still achieved nothing. Useless, uninformed people would often try to advise me on what might help (none of them had ever gotten a zit in their life!) I didn't go as far as seeing a dermatologist because I was always told it was for extreme cases and that you eventually grow out of it. The only two things which ever helped my skin was mild sunburn (went to the beach alot) and teatree oil. Anyway getting back to my research... I had an indepth look at a couple of treatments and was almost convinced to try a chemical peel but thought it might be best to try something less intrusive beforehand. So anyhow, I was on ebay one day and came accross microdermabrasion cloths. I read through a few item pages until I came accross a vendor who claimed he owned the patent for the original microdermabrasion cloth. I was very skeptical of this claim but read on and became increasingly convinced. So I thought, "bugger it" and purchased two (they had a special two-for-one offer) for $13 USD including postage. So about four days ago I tried it and couldnt believe how much a soft cloth could make my skin go red and sting as much as it did. I went to sleep and woke up the next day with my face still stinging, but not as much. I put on sunscreen and went about my day at work. It felt like I had bad sunburn, to give you an idea. On the third day my face started to feel rough and bumpy, although didnt look any different from before the treatment. The fourth day, I washed my face with a normal washing cloth and warm water. I noticed a lot of dead skin coming off and by the time I was finished my skin was smooth, the acne had almost gone, my pores were significantly smaller and my scars (only have a few) were almost completely faded. I hate to use the cliche but my skin really does have a "natural healthy glow". I'd normally have to get sunburnt to have my skin this clean. The instructions say I should see genuine results after the 3rd or 4th go but I've seen them after the first go, so I guess everyone's just different. Anyway I just thought I'd share my results with all of you. I'm not trying to sell anything and I don't represent anyone but myself. I'm not sure how other microdermabrasion cloths on ebay rate, as there as so many of them, but if you wanna find out where I got mine from, just ask. Otherwise I won't say, because I'm not on here to advertise.

Is it alright to apply a simple moisturizer (like plain old nivea creme) directly after microdermabrasion? OR perhaps it would be better to let the skin sort itself out and just apply suncreen when needed? I don't know if its a good idea to leave the skin so dry for even a short period of time. Any help would be great.

Back to top danny Joined: 04 Aug 2005 Posts: 16 Posted: Tue Nov 08, 2005 8:27 am Post subject: update This is just an update on my experience, some five weeks after the first treatment. My skin seems to have developed a bit of resistance to the cloth now. It still cleans my pores and wipes away dead skin the same, however now it only takes 1-2 days to heal instead of the 3-4 it was taking before. This stinging is also less painful, which I am happy about. All my acne still wants to come back so it hasn't "cured" it. However when the cloth is used every 6-7 days (as instructions say), this seems to keep the acne at bay (hardly noticeable in my case). Also if I get a blackhead or zit during the middle of the week, the cloth seems to be good for spot treatments (however no harsh scrubbing!) I've been using nivea creme roughly 30minutes after using the cloth and this helps it immensely. However this creme also tends to block the pores somewhat and like vanyel5 was saying "exacerbates" the acne. So now I'm moving to emu oil. All in all this cloth is still a God send for me and although it is not a "cure-all" for skin problems, I'd say it's cleared up about 90% of my acne which is not bad for something that cost me no more than $13 US and is supposed to last for up to 2 years. My rating on this product 9/10! Oh yeh, and the person on ebay who sold it to me was a guy called 'thankyoustan'. He has a couple of variations of the cloth, so I just bought the origional one that happened to be on special at the time. here's the link: http://stores.ebay.com.au/id=18759111&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEFS:MESST Back to top vanyel5 Joined: 14 Oct 2005 Posts: 39 Location: york, pa Posted: Wed Nov 09, 2005 8:35 pm Post subject: hey danny, glad to hear you are getting good results...there are a couple of products i have used for acne..both prevention and treatment it is salicylic acid and is good for keeping the pores cleansed out but has gentle moisturizers in the base...as well as they have a light moisturizing gel designed for oily skin which is really nice..it leaves a slightly matte finish to the skin as well as having all sorts of good ingredients in it to heal your skin! joseph Last edited by vanyel5 on Thu Nov 10, 2005 11:24 am; edited 1 time in total Back to top orangehrzn</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3975&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Microdermabrasion Cloths; I'm surprised they actually work.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>33aa6ed120e6dcb5a11e4e5c1f5e195db8b128ca</string></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Small Peptides</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>matrixyl and dmae?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1004&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Is it okay to apply a DMAE cream over a matrixyl serum?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>bike6564</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>419f60708f32513152acec7384e8c0b5727d8983</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Basic Skin Care / Skin Health Maintenance</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Sunscreen</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3979&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Have you tried a mineral makeup?

I do my peels at home but I would not if I did not have experience and education in derm. Monitoring the skin prep for the peel, use of exfoliators, Retin A products, manner of application of the peel, determining when to neutralize and how to neutralize are crucial steps. Is the peel solution correctly prepared? Also, treating post treatment symptoms can be important to reduce the liklihood of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Even with experience and studying, a peel can easily go the wrong way. I have had frosting in patches that comes up quickly on my own face. There are many reasons that could cause that. I do not want frosting at home because it is too dangerous in my opinion. Skin peels at home do save tons of money. I will do mine at home probably until I am too old, but I am very cautious. If I want a peel that requires me to stay home for a week, I will have that administered in a clean office environment with pain control and a highly experienced provider with that specific peel. Good luck! I hope this didn't sound like a lecture. Just be careful. My favorite book on peels is the Manual of chemical peels by Rubin. It is very valuable to me.

Certain medical conditions can predispose one to puffiness and other types of edema, including as kidney problems, hypothyrodism, electrolyte embalances, etc. However, many people have puffiness for no apparent reason, i.e. puffiness does not neccessarily mean an underlying medical problem. If you have also edema (swelling) of ankles, this would be a good reason to talk to your doc about this.

Try out some of these at home . Apply chilled cucumber slices over and under-eye areas and relax. Leave it on for 20 mintues. Gently rub the slices over and under-eye areas, and then wash off. The natural moisture from the cucumber acts like a healing tonic. You can apply cotton wool soaked in rose water or saline solution on the puffy areas .After you wake up put cold tap water or a mixture of cold water and ice cubes in a large bowl or tub. Splash your face for up to 5 minutes with the water.

You may have seen my topic in the anti-aging forum, but for someone who has acne, how can you manage an anti-aging regimine while using acne meds/treatments. I'm confused. I was using differing and cleocin T (spot) and now I am trying the Perricone products (VIT C, DMAE, ALA). I think they don't work too well over the differin - they might cause irritation although i'm not sure if its only the differin causing the irritation. Does anybody have examples of routines for anti-aging and acne?

I am not so young anymore, 38, but wondering what is a good moisture cream for dry skin as I swear I look older in winter. I bought Neutrogena as I think this is a good brand? Maybe it is just that I look less colored from the sun too. Speaking fo sun, what do you recommend for a skin protection for everyday outdoor use for this coming spring and summer.Maybe,not a complete block, so I can get some color, but some protection and care for skin so I can try to take care of it.

I would use a product with hydroquinone. H can be purchased at a 2% concentration without a prescription. Sunscreen, daily, helps minimize post inflammatory pigmentation.

Only positive result was making the surface of my skin feel very smooth for a few months (which wasn't work the trouble, money and pain involved). I have been talking taking a poll of professionals about it recently. Two very experienced Dermatologists, two very experienced Laser Specialists and a plastic surgeon (who teaches at UCLA) here in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills all told me it doesn't work to any significant degree. There is a new device out which is light based called "Titan" (Thermage uses radio frequency waves). I am trying that now. Will post results, but I am not overy optomistic. It is best to wait until these "devices" have been in use for at least 4-5 years to judge whether they are really useful (or harmful).

When you get right down to it there are no 100% surefire methods for looking younger. Darrellx, if you want to learn more about either Thermage or Titan, consult a number of different doctors in your area and then check the company's website to see if there are docs around you who've gotten the proper training to do it. I'm still recovering from my last surgery (not a cosmetic one) so I can't consider anymore procedures right now but I'd be interested in hearing what you find out.

I had to sign a disclaimer and when I complained that there had been no change, The oh so nice doctor became cold. He just sent me the wording of the disclaimer and that was that. Incidentally, it was the latest model. Just don't do it. It does not work. I took photos before and after and am posting them on a website I am putting together.

Though I don't live in the UK, if I am ever visiting Swindon I will be sure NOT to step foot in the office of that doctor. When did you have your treatment? I looked on the Thermage web site that they make their docs go through a process for certification, one that is specific only to Thermage. Maybe the product itself is faulty but I'm also wondering if the doc you used is on their list of certified docs? A friend's husband who works as a plastic surgeon told me it's not a given that all docs do the same procedure correctly (scary stuff, huh?). Back to top Pennyconny Joined: 04 Apr 2006 Posts: 4 Location: England UK Posted: Wed Apr 05, 2006 4:41 am Post subject: Thermage naturallydelish , I was told about the doctor who performed Thermage on my face by my very cautious dermatologist. He said he had seen him work and was impressed by his work. Even he was taken in by the assurances. It is significant that after investigation, my dermatologist decided not to offer Thermage himself. He was dismayed to see that it had no effect on me. I can assure you that the machine was the latest ThermaCool and the doctor was well trained. Just believe me - THERMAGE DOESN'T WORK - it is as simple as that. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.

It only came out onto the market not even 10 years ago which says to me that it could take a while for both the Thermage producers and the doctors who give it to hit on the right amounts of heat/power. I'm sure everyone thought a facelift would scar you for life when they first were done. Plus you still age no matter what. There was an article on a biotechnology news site that reported a lot of people saying they look good with a combo of Thermage and fillers like Restylane without any downtime. Not like I know any of those people but it's interesting that it's promoted on a biotechnology website.

I agree with Pennyconny in the respect that you can't trust everyone who puts out an article on the internet. But on the other hand I would appreciate knowing the full story before making a judgment. I've heard a lot of contradictory statements about a number of cosmetic procedures including Thermage so it's good to just know what's out there.

This is a good place for speciality items such as EGF, SOD, KFG, Matrixyl, and some expensive or hard to get botanical extracts. However, some of their more common actives can be bought for much lower prices. I like to get the items I want from different shops, rather than just buying from the selection (limited or not) of products offered by only one supplier. http://www.ispcorp.com/products/hairskin/content/skincare/products/index.html This company is big, and they think in terms of tons. But it is still nice to browse through their list and do some 'Window shopping'. I noticed that they manufacture "Liquid crystals". http://www.pentapharm.com/sw153.asp and http://www.centerchem.com/Catg1.asp?Cat1ID=20 These two have some strange stuff, but they also have nice products. Again, it is nice to go windows shopping.

Dark circles, associated with internal organs, are caused by the build up of fluid pressure, which causes the blood vessels under the eye to expand and show through the thin skin. You will see dark circles in most situations where pressure, due to fluid, builds up. That includes allergies, colds, flu, kidney issues, constipation, liver disease, and anything else that will lead to your blood vessels or sinuses building up pressure.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>SageRave</string></value><value><string>PocoLoco Joined: 26 Feb 2006 Posts: 3 Location: Pacific Northwest Posted: Sun Feb 26, 2006 4:28 pm Post subject: How to determine cause of dark circles Hi...new here...

Usually fair skin people get circles from allergies, lack of sleep, anemia, or some other health problem. This is not pigmentation. I believe that usually dark skin people will only have a problem with excess pigmentation underneath the eye. The pigmentation can be helped with something from a visit to a dermatologist and also prevented with sunscreen.

In the upper lid the probability for wrinkling is even less because the exercise is not squinting. You push the upper lid to the brow bone there and fix it there while TRYING to bring it down against the resistance of your fingers. The actualy motion is very little since you try to hold it still but tense the musle. Also exercises for some of the forehead muscles may have effect on lifting the upper lid.

I now understand about preservatives and percent wise of how much it requires. I talked about adding extra preservatives after adding actives and they are not to pleased about this. They are saying there is enough preservative in the premade creams and that it is enough. Some of these people are adding tsp's of sea kelp and ha, and a tbsp of that, plus an array of other actives. I feel they need refrigerated or need more preservative as some of this stuff can really add up to the actual product and change the amount. I learned from your kit you should refrigerate.

That said, it is still often useful to store in the refrigerator because it is not just about preventing growth of microorganisms, but also about reducing oxidation, cross-reactions and so forth.

Back to top Discohouse Joined: 18 Oct 2006 Posts: 74 Posted: Thu Aug 02, 2007 6:00 am Post subject: It's safe to use around the eye area if used at small concentrations. An eye cream containing anti-inflammatory ingredients would help you best to slow down the aging of the eyes since wrinkles are caused by not just eye movements, but morning puffiness as well which stretches the skin. I use an eye cream from Neostrata called Eye Contour Cream. It contains green tea, which is an anti-inflammatory, and it contains 4% gluconolactone which is a milder form of an AHA, and it's gentle enough for the eye area without irritation. Vitamin C eye cream will help you too, but you shouldn't use concentrations above 5% for the eye area. DMAE may be another choice too, again, I wouldn't use anything stronger than 1% DMAE anywhere on the face. I hope this helps...Any other questions, please feel free to ask.

After doing a massive amount of research on laser skin tightening, and finding no negative side effects, I had my first treatment yesterday. When I woke this morning, I found my chin and skin under my jaw swollen to at least 3 times the normal size! I can't find anything online like this, and the person that did the procedure said that in 5 years he has never seen this before. Obviously I have several questions... 1) is this permanent? 2) If not, how long will it take for the swelling to subside? 3) Should it subside, would it be smart to continue with the remaining treatments? 4) What caused this? Was the level set too high? Is it because I am a male and the facial hair reacted differently? Thanks so much for any feedback.

I bought a couple of products from Dr Sebagh's line (not seen it reviewed here) and one of the products is called Pure Vitamin C powder cream. It's sold in individual vials and it's white. On contact with skin it turns into a cream (dry-ish cream). I haven't heard of this name before (sodium asc. ph) and was wondering if it is really useful! Here are the ingredients: aqua (water), sodium ascorbyl phosphate, silica silylate, nylon 6/12 xylitol, hexamidine diisethionate, sodium citrate. I also wanted to find out about another product from the same line, which is sold as an eye cream that targets fine lines, puffy eyes and dark circles. The product consists of two parts, one of which is a cream and another which is a dark circles powder. When I used the cream on a regular basis I noticed the reduction of dark circles, but they tend to reappear if I don't use the powder for a while. I would appreciate some help with the ingredients as these products are quite expensive (very) and wanted to know if they are just gimmicks or worth it! Cream ingredients: aqua (water), citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) flower water, phosphatidylcholine/soybean lecithin, glyceryl dibehenate (and ) tribehenin (and) glyceryl behenate, stearyl heptanoate polyglyceryl 3, diisostearatet, zea mays (corn) oil, glycerin, hydrolyzed collagen, aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, cetearyl ethylexanoate, butylene glycol, octoxynol 11 (and) polysorbate 20, dimethicone copolyol, hesperidin methyl chalcone (and) steareth 20 (and) dipeptide-2 (and) palmitoyl tetrapeptide 2, kigelia arficana fruit extract, carbomer, polysorbate 20 (and) palmitoyl pentapeptid 3, phenoxyethanol, panthenol, pyridoxine, chlorphenesin (and) benzoic acid, sodium hydroxide, methylparaben, propylparaben, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, parfum (fragrance), xanthan gum. Powder ingredients: aqua (water), silica sillylate, methy silanol hydroxyproline aspartate, glycosaminoglycans, urea, nylon 6/12, silica, nylon 12, xylitol, aluminium start octenyl succinate, sucrose, diphenyl dimethicone, glycerin, lauroyl lysine, glyceryl polyacrylate, vinyl dimethicone, hydrolyzed rice bran extract, mourera fluviatilis extract, polysaccharide, PCA, silsesquioxane crosspolymer, polyquaternum 10, oxydoreductase, soy peptides, serine, arginine, threonine, sodium citrate, potassium sorbate.

I haven't seen any studies showing benefits of retinoids for rosacea. Back to top lesleyhardie Joined: 08 Sep 2005 Posts: 16 Posted: Wed Nov 23, 2005 11:43 pm Post subject: Dr T Here is a link.

Unfortunately, it is just one study, which leaves the evidence shaky. However, if you main symptom is erythema it may be worth a try if other things don't work for you. Retinaldehyde is relatively safe - at least safer than tretinoin.

The cream has a green tinge to it which does not show when applied. It is for sensitive skin and it's meant to be used at night at problem areas - I used it all over face under make up.

The sun damage can be reduced by sunscreen daily. Treating wrinkles, there are different types of wrinkles on necks. Most people will want more results than cream treatments will provide. Surgery can help significantly but is costly and is a surgical procedure. Personally, I would not spend a lot of $$ for creams for neck treatment, but that is me.

Hi, Im an 18 year old that has recently been batteling with dry skin, its not extremely dry but still its dry. I use to have beautiful skin that was very smooth but due to a skincream I believe that my skin has been stripped of some vital oils. But im not sure if thats the case please correct me if I'm wrong. Anyhow my skin is now quite dry and looks dull. My question is if my skin can turn back to normal without me being forced to follow difficult dryskin regimes for the rest of my life? And is there anywa yfor me to regain my normal skin? Can these vital oils (that i think are the cause) be restored without being forcesd to use skin creams? If I follow a skin routine for some time will my skin go back to normal? My brother once told me that he heard a dermatologist say that if you use skincreams on normally functioning skin the skin will start an aging process is that true?

If that is the case you may experience overexfoliation symptoms - the skin surface gets dry and flaky. Fortunately it will flake off in a week and the usual soft skin will apear below. Simply stop using the product. Personally I don't have the experience that ANY topical cream can alter someone's skin PERMANENTLY in positive or negative direction. Creams can at most protect or irritate but once you stop them your skin goes back to its usual state. If your skin is still dry WITHOUT APPLYING ANY PRODUCT ON IT FOR DAYS and it doesnt flake you can moisturize it with pure Jojoba oil or Emu Oil. The are not comedogenic.

Stop using any soaps, detergents, toners and cleansers for a while - just use water. See if that helps. If relative humidity is low where you are, consider humidifier. And drink a lot of water. Back to top orangehrzn Joined: 23 Feb 2005 Posts: 1044 Posted: Wed Sep 14, 2005 9:53 am Post subject: Skin naturally produces more oil in Summer and less oil in Winter. That's why most acne problem skins 'flare up' in the summer and behave better in Winter. The soap can't change your skin permanently. It simply dries your skin when you use it no matter what they say at the label. You should stop using facial cleanser/soap at all or find a gentler facial cleanser and use it at most two times daily (morning and evening). You may want to try Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Cleanser - it is non drying if you don't overuse it. About the facial cleansers, some 'skin theoreticians' say that they are too drying if they contain the detergent Sodium Laureth Sulfate. The Eucerin cleanser above contains it but it doesn't make my skin dry so it is also a question how the cleanser is formulated. Any cleanser has to contain detergent by definition, which will strip your skin oils partially doesnt matter if that detergent is SLS or not. That's what cleansers do - they strip oils. You just have to find a cleanser that strips enough oils to clean your skin yet doesn't strip too much to make it dry. The best indicator if the cleanser is good for your skin is not to pay attention whats on the label but to try it in practice.

FYI, SLS is an ionic detergent, these are generally much stronger that nonionic detergents. So, if one can't avoid cleansers altogether, one possibility is to use cleansers with nonionic detergents. SLS, incidentally, is popular in research as a standardized way to produce mild superficial skin damage.

Warne wrote: Alpha Lipoic Acid a compound initially classified as a vitamin when it was discovered that could prevent healthy cells from getting damaged by unstable oxygen molecules called free radicals.Because Alpha Lipoic acid dissolves in both water and fat, this so-called universal antioxidant is able to scavenge more wayward free-radical cells than most antioxidants. Alpha Lipoic acid assists the B vitamins in producing energy from the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats consumed through foods. Alpha-Lipoic acid may help to symptoms of nerve damage in people with diabetes, Preserve brain function in aging adults, Prevent cancer and Lessen numbness and tingling. Lipoic acid is a redox-active molecule capable of thiol-disulfide exchange, giving it antioxidant activity. Lipoic acid prevents vitamin C and vitamin E deficiency. It is able to scavenge reactive oxygen species and reduce other metabolites, such as glutathione or vitamins. Lipoic acid has been shown in cell culture experiments to increase cellular uptake of glucose by recruiting the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane, suggesting its use in diabetes. Studies of rat aging have suggested that the use of L-carnitine and lipoic acid results in improved memory performance and delayed structural mitochondrial decay. As a result, it may be helpful for people suffering Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. As we found out recently about vitamin E, high doses of antioxidant supplements may not lead to more benefits. In fact, there comes a point where a supplement, no matter how benign, can become unhealthy if the doses are too high. For this reason it is not recommended to have more than 10 to 50 mg of alpha lipoic a day. Actually this may not apply in the case of alpha lipoic acid, since it may be the only antioxidant known to have the ability to reycle itself, unlike Vitamin E. For example, since Vitamin E does not have the ability to recycle itself, it should ideally be used with Vitamin C, since Vitamin C's main function as an antioxidant is to recycle Vitamin E. If any studies showed Vitamin E to be harmful(especially in larger amounts), it might be because they usd the wrong form of Vitamin E (alpha tocopherol alone instead of mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols) and/or they didn't use the Vitamin E in conjuction with Vitamin C, as it should be used. In regards to alpha lipoic acid, Dr. Lester Packer (in one of his books) recommends 100 mg a day. But if you use R-ALA, you may only need 50 mg a day.</string></value><value><string>Has anyone else used alpha lipoic acid?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>lipoicacid</string></value><value><string>cdryder</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>3ad7a46aec6bcbfbc130ef80238c6b86f4905a18</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Subtitle</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skin Rejuvenation / Anti-Aging</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Sources for individual DIY ingredients?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.smartskincare.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4799&amp;highlight=</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Beyond-a-century.com has a lot of suplements that are sold for internal use but you can use them for hm topicals</string></value><value><string>Beyond-a-century.com has a lot of suplements that are sold for internal use but you can use them for hm topicals</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>sullygirl Joined: 30 Jan 2006 Posts: 2 Posted: Tue Jan 31, 2006 10:41 am Post subject: Sources for individual DIY ingredients?

Did you buy powder your you buy it as a food suplement in capsules?

I'm just worried b/c some other people on this board had problems with ingredients from them. I'm afraid to put it on my face. :( Back to top jands Joined: 21 Nov 2005 Posts: 105 Location: Taiwan Posted: Sun Dec 11, 2005 6:34 pm Post subject: Have you contacted your supplier?

I should have gotten it from SkinActives!

I've come across something that I thought may be similiar to the cream that I'm using at night now. Here are the ingedients as listed and I wanted to know if Dr.Todorov thinks that this sounds like an effective cream. I"m not sure what % is enough that its useful. I'm 46 years old and i'm looking to reduce some of the fine lines, even the skin tone a bit and firm it as much as I can without surgery. I would appreciate your input. Thanks.

It is all about percentage . The law does not require listing of the percentage content of the ingredients . few people realize that most small to medium size companies do not own their product's formula. In most cases, the company place an order for a formula with one of the handful of cosmetics manufacturing factories in the US , requesting for example : " an eye cream with vitamin C " . The company either has its chemistry lab develop a new formula or it borrow an old formula from the past inventory . Large company like Lancome &amp; Ester Lauder have their own labs, but very few small cosmetic companies goes to the trouble &amp; expense of employing chemists &amp; developing their own formula . The same cream could come from one manufacturer 's lab, simply wearing a different label. when you see a product that does not proclaim the vitamin percentage on the bottle, you can assume that the percentage is low ......

My thinking is that some actives disolve well in oil and Emu is a good transdermal agent. However at the same time I have quite oily skin so the Kaolin would be helpful to absorb some of that? Would it be silly to add Kaolin to a DIY base lotion that will be used for adding active ingredients?</string></value><value><string>kaolin and other clays are used in masks, they are not used in creams that you leave on. when kaolin absorbs oil, it has to be removed from the face for the oil to be removed. anyway, it is not a good idea to add kaolin into something you don't plan to rinse off in a few minutes.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>drtodorov</string></value><value><string>jands</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ad8-4d55-b07c</string></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>None</string></value><value><string>None</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>8270b8621080993d08664e09df92a04c3144d509</string></value></member></struct></value></data></array></value>
