I have, but it gets better! 
Educate your bf. People, especially those who have not experienced acne/severe acne simply do not understand the struggle unless you lay out the facts. I know that because I was the same as him, only when developing acne later in life did I understand. Having that negativity in your life is not good for you. 
i would continue accutane. some people just require a higher dose
I would recommend trying to weed high-hormone foods out of your diet and see if that helps. 

I didn't have any acne all through high school, but as soon as I went to college I broke out terribly with cystic acne. Calling my mom to tell her about it rendered the same results -- "you're not washing your face often, you never did at home!" etc. etc. 

When I went home for Christmas break, my mom opened the door and recoiled in horror at how bad my skin had gotten. Next day, we were off to the derm who put me on oral tetracycline and a cream that I can't recall the name of. My skin cleared up magnificently and, besides the occasional hormonal pimple, my acne was gone.

Flash forward another 6 years and bam! I started getting break outs left and right of a completely different kind of acne than I had ever experienced before. After months of battling it with creams, toners, soaps, etc. I decided to cut dairy out of my diet. Two weeks later my skin cleared and I haven't had a pimple, besides one damn period pimple that rears it's uggo head relentlessly each month, since.

I suggest it because it really helped me and you truly have no idea, unless you're eating a completely organic diet, just what hormonal BS is in foods and how that could be affecting you. 

Good luck! I completely feel your pain and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. xx
Personally I don't agree with harsh treatments like Accutane, but more power to you if it works. I like taking an all natural approach, and it's seeming like absolutely nothing has worked for me. I've tried everything, absolutely everything except accutane or anything of the sort. I've been doing lots of research on it and I'm coming to the conclusion that mine is mostly hormonal, stress and maybe just genetic, my younger brother started having issues when he hit high school too. Either way, my next attempt is going to be consuming yellow dock root every day. It's a blood purifier, it also helps with stage 2 liver detoxification. So, this will help my liver process and filter any unnecessary hormones and toxins in my body that get built up, resulting in (hopefully) clearer skin. I've also found that mixing a 1:1 ratio of apple cider vinegar and water and applying that every day helps too. I also take 4,000iu of Vitamin D3 every day, that's definitely helped a little bit too. But I'm with you, I'm also 22 and just exhausted and frustrated more than I can explain about STILL having acne. I can keep you updated on whether the yellow dock helps me, if you want.
Hey Skincare Friends,

Are there any experts about who can tell me why I‚Äôve had a patch of acne here for 3 years?  It started off with 2 or 3 cyst like spots that stayed for about 6 months and it‚Äôs evolved into this.  
My doctor put me on anti bs previously which do help when I‚Äôm on them, but it comes back immediately if I skip a few days.
I don‚Äôt understand any dermatology so it‚Äôs all an enigma to me.  I would really appreciate a steer in the right direction to inform my next discussion with the doctor.
Cheers!
Lol thats literally so relateable, i have crazy scarring too and i wear my hood lol. I thought i was the only one.
Have you tried chemical peels? , I do that at home but they're professional strength. During Ultas 21 day sale they'll be on sale from 77$ to 38$. I use Exuviance AP 25 peelsC I also use Murads intense C radiance peel but the Exuviance is stronger? I would give it a try didn't have I've pick scars, but I had some red scarring around my chin that's basically gone. It's worth a shot 
I would say youd probably have to do laser treatments or microderm or something.

Theose scars are pretty common in people, no matter how many you have. Yes, we all feel bad about them, but getting over them is key in feeling better about yourself.

I have a HUGE deep pitted scar on my cheek from cystic acne. Its about an inch long and 1 or a couple cm deep. I also have the ive pick scars. I got over it bc there are some people with worse skin conditions than I. Infortunately, surgery would prob be the only way.
You can do lasers or dermapen, brian turner ( a fitness youtuber who had acne did a video serie about this topic) .... but you have to accept scarring and be proud of the battle you won, cause they will stay on your face forever... at least accepting that helped me a lot

Can you feel it under your skin? Like a hard bump? If yes, then yes. 
I only ever get these cystic spots around my jawline. Starts as a bump and comes to a head about 3 days later and leaves a nasty scab.

Cutting out dairy helped enormously but I still get these buggers almost every week.
Benozyl perioxid
Have you heard of high frequency treatments? They have been a totally game changer for my cystic acne!!!
[removed]
Yes. It worked for me for me as well but had to stop because it wasn‚Äôt a permanent solution to my acne (and like you they made a stronger comeback). Reliance on antibiotics would require a stronger and stronger dose every cycle to combat stronger acne production. Your doctor should know what to do about it. Sorry i aint of much help
The same thing happened to me when I was on Doxycycline. I used Proactive concomitantly just like you've been doing, funny enough. I found that the doxycycline stopped working for me about 6 months into use. The Proactive stopped working for me about 3 months into use. Unfortunately it took me years to muster up the nerve to give in and try spironolactone. I've never been one to take medications (even over the counter pain meds) so I just felt weird about it. But so far spironolactone has worked well. I've been on it about four months now and no signs of its effects wearing off (at least not yet). Might be something to discuss with your doctor? I feel like it's a good moderate treatment in between antibiotics and something more intense like Accutane. 
I dont know dude you have to either describe what it is and feels like or post a way more closeup picture. Why do ppl do this smh 
A refreshing approach. 
Definitely filaments.
Ugh, I have SO many of them and I hate that it‚Äôs filaments because I keep hearing there‚Äôs nothing you can do to get rid of them üò≠
I have these too and never noticed them until recently :/
 Wasn‚Äôt sure myself so I just switched to an FA Safe routine. Not only did my skin calm down, but I also fixed the moisture barrier since FA products are usually very basic and gentle. 
Looks like acne.  
It is acne, you're skin is producing a lot of sebum you should use a cleanser made for oily skin, and a gentle exfoliate and use a small amount of tea tree oil.
I'd go to visit derma again. Sounds tricky to treat at home. Good luck! 
I ‚Äúprime‚Äù them with salicylic acid or tretinoin, let that sit for a while, then put acnomel spot treatment on the spot. When I do this, they typically shrink or come to a head in about two days. Good luck. 
If they‚Äôre very very sore (and painful?), this sounds to me like cystic acne. Do they usually come to a head for you? Or is this new?

Benzoyl peroxide, or calamine lotion as an overnight spot treatment work very well for me. 
These "cystic" pimples are the only kind I ever get. As soon I see the bump forming I know I'm on a tough next couple days. It's so frustrating because you can't so anything but wait, pop it and wait for scab to heal.

I'm pretty sure diet and balanced hormones are the only way to avoid them? 
Hello! First of all, i feel this. Very much. Sorry you‚Äôre going through it. I‚Äôm a 25 year old woman, but the worst acne phases I‚Äôve been through are times I‚Äôm under high stress or not taking care of myself mentally and physically. Stress might be contributing, but sometimes you just have to be able to ride it out. The major thing I see here is picking. Even minor touching or picking my acne makes it erupt like none other. Try to keep your hands off your face at all costs. I recommend to only use a clean cloth to wash your face and never touch your face to put on product unless you‚Äôve just washed your hands (I keep it by my sink and in my shower). Do not pop anything under all costs and grab some blister bandages (also called hydrocolloid bandages) at the drug store to cut up to put on open spots or spots with heads at night. 

Anyway, hope it gets better for you soon. I know it‚Äôs awful :(
My mindset is that Im still unattractive without acne.
I am very much a picker myself - if it's there I just can't help but fiddle with it.  One thing that I've used to help trick my brain into thinking I'm doing something about it, is using the COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch (you can find some on amazon).  When I have a pimple that is 'pickable' I just put one of those bad boys on there and it helps remove gunk safely and reduce swelling.
I understand how you feel - I‚Äôm 20 and I too can‚Äôt help but pick at my acne and make it worse! Even when I‚Äôm picking, I‚Äôll hear a little voice in the back of my head saying ‚Äústop it, you‚Äôll regret this tomorrow‚Äù.

One thing that has really helped me, not physically with the spots, but mentally with dealing with them, is the mantra ‚Äúthose who mind don‚Äôt matter, and those who matter don‚Äôt mind‚Äù. You may think your skin is unattractive, but who really gives a shit? When you look at other people, you may notice they have acne, but do you care? Probably not. Everyone has flaws, and the people in your life who are really worth having significant relationships with will certainly not care about whether you have acne or not.

Another thing that has kinda helped me is that my boyfriend also has acne, but I often completely forget this because when I‚Äôm looking at his face I‚Äôm focusing on all the things I love about it, rather than on his ‚Äúflaws‚Äù. So maybe we focus way too much on our own blemishes and imperfections when other people won‚Äôt notice and certainly won‚Äôt care as much. Especially when it‚Äôs something as natural and (often) uncontrollable as acne.

I just remind myself that I'm not alone in this. Lots of people have it. When I see others with acne I don't think badly of them, so I expect that's the same way others see me. 
All of my derms have described accutane as Plan Z for acne treatment. As in, it's the very last resort. But it's very effective, and chances are it cures your acne forever. In terms of making the personal decision to pursue accutane, I would say you have to be at the end of your rope regarding your tolerance of your acne and things you've tried. It seems like emotionally, you're there, but only you would know if you've really tried everything else. 

My dermatologist had me go on a "detox" for 3ish weeks to see if my lifestyle was the cause. During the three weeks, I ate only boiled vegetables and boiled chicken (no salt, sugar, dairy, gluten, additives, nothing), didn't use any skin care products or makeup, and drank a gallon of water a day. I was also tested to see if I had any deficiencies, allergies, or hormonal imbalances (I didnt). The fact that I still had new white heads and pustules coming up every day during those three weeks told my dermatologist that whatever it was causing my acne, it couldn't be fixed with a lifestyle change. I had also tried basically every skin care product imaginable before then. So I was at the end of my rope and I got on accutane. It's worked wonders, but I'm on a low dose so I have nearly no side effects. 
Hey there. I‚Äôm no expert by all means, but I completely understand the whirlwind you are going through right now.
First and foremost, if you ever have those thoughts and feel like talking to someone, you can PM me anytime or call this number 1-800-273-8255. If you have not heard the song Logic made about it, I also recommend this remedy as well. He‚Äôs a cheesy dude but he is really thinking outside the box with spreading peace, love, and positivity through his music. 
I do not know much about Accutane but I‚Äôve heard of devastating side effects and it sounds like that is your biggest concern. Talk to your doctor and check out the other options and mention how it made you feel before. Treat accutane as a last resort to combat this battle, which eventually I know you will overcome with victory and self confidence.
Last thing I wanted to mention is - the skin is weird. I get terrible breakouts after I shave and also about 20 times a year I get very large and painful cysts on my neck and/or back. I have yet to resolve this problem, which is why I‚Äôm here with you on this beautiful thread. It‚Äôs a small community, but so many different people have posted success stories that have worked for them. Read them and think about your lifestyle as you read them. I saw a few crazy videos about Derry allergies that cause breakouts. This on top of oily foods or sugary foods can really do damage to your skin. Play around with diet and various cleansers, and always come back. 
Once you solve your problem, I want to hear the story :) 
Omg reading this post makes me feel really sad but I also feel so relatable. I‚Äôve been suffering from hormonal adult acne and my skin never seem to clear up. Although it‚Äôs not cystic acne, I feel like I‚Äôve lost my self confidence because I had to wear make up everyday to cover the acne scars. I‚Äôm so self conscious about my skin and there are times where I actually broke down because I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with my skin anymore. I hated the way I look without makeup because of my skin. I hate the texture, the pores, the scars, the redness, basically everything and I‚Äôve reached that point in life where I just don‚Äôt wanna try anything again anymore. Just a week ago I tried a new skincare routine, nothing fancy, just stuff from The Ordinary, and drinking lots of water, and I can tell you that although my skin is far from perfect, it‚Äôs slightly getting a little bit better. I‚Äôm just saying that whatever it is, please don‚Äôt give up. We all have our own battles but at the end of the day, we just need to keep trying. This is easier said than done but I hope you‚Äôll never give up. I wish you the best of luck in your road to clear skin. 
I know how u feel. But don give up. Everyone tells me it will get better!! :( 
Hey man - I have pretty bad acne and to be honest, it fucking sucks. But what I‚Äôve began noticing is that people genuinely don‚Äôt care about - or even see - your acne. Everyone has issues and times can be rough but I promise that your acne is a much smaller deal to those around you than it would appear. 

That being said, I would go to a dermatologist and see what other treatments than Accutane they would recommend. 
I cried every night for 2 years after suffering from bad acne for 10 years. I was tired of everything. I was exhausted from asking people, they all said the same stuff. But here's my advice: it WILL get better. People don't have acne forever. Don't. Give. Up. You will find an answer. It's happening for a reason, you will find what's causing it and you will fix it. It's SO difficult, I know. I was done so many times. It took me giving up completely, fixing my weight and in-turn realize what was causing it all along, and it's a handful of things. You will find an answer, you can't give up yet. Take a break from worrying about it, then the answer will come to you. If you need it, I would love to offer support and minor guidance, I have a background in research and finding the causes behind things like this and am studying to be a health coach so this sort of thing is right up my alley. pm and we can chat if you're up for it. You got this!!! 
If you have the means to get on Accutane I recommend it. Trust me, when you weigh up the side effects (which on average are nowhere near as bad as the horror stories you've heard) and the psychological side effects of acne, the pill is the way to go. 

I have a history of depression (and in my family) and the pill did not make it worse for me. I just had slightly achey joints some days.

You deserve to be happy and have some self confidence. 
Can I ask if you're trying any dietary methods to clear acne? 
I have totally been there. There were days I refused to leave the house because I just felt like a disgusting monster. I felt like when people looked at me, all they saw was my acne. And I would tell myself people probably thought I was gross and unhygienic because of it. Even though when I saw people with acne, it wasn't a big deal. It was just me that I thought people were grossed out by. It really does something to your psyche. I will say, if you are having these thoughts already, Accutane can actually enhance or trigger suicidal thoughts so I would definitely talk to your doctor. I finally decided to give Spironolactone a try and that has been working pretty well. I didn't want to jump right into Accutane but I was going to if Spironolactone didn't work out. I'm 25 so I am fed up with this damn acne. I'm also planning on going to see an aesthetician regularly to get individualized facials. If you can afford it, I recommend you try that as well! I know we don't know each other, but I am here to talk if you ever need it. Just know that you're not alone in your struggle. 
I get these exact things, same places as you. I've tried looking it up but i couldn't really find any treatment info. 
I used to get your normal run-of-the-mill pustules but as I got older the acne kind of devolved into getting those "plugs" which aren't as bad but god I destroy my face pushing those out.
They‚Äôre sebum plugs, I used to get these all the time along with closed comedones on my forehead. 
[removed]
You can give exfoliating a try, just be sure that it‚Äôs a mild one, as you don‚Äôt want to irritate your skin. Also, changing pillow cases helps a ton! Aim to change them every week or so. As for your routine, personally I‚Äôd say wash your face twice a day. Once before bed and once after you get up.
This was my problem too. Tiny little whiteheads by the end of the day, congested forehead etc,  nothing too crazy but definitely persistent and annoying

I‚Äôm finally seeing results from Corsx AHA whitehead power liquid. Been using it for a few weeks now but I honestly have not gotten a whitehead in the last week or two - which is still blowing my mind. My forehead is getting smooth too which I‚Äôve never had! So I definitely recommend that product but of course ymmv. 

So look into chemical exfoliants AHAs and BHAs and see which works for you. Remember to moisturize!! And take it slow. I was flakey at first because I wanted to see results too quickly. I still get dry somewhat but I‚Äôm looking for a better moisturize to combat that because the results are there!

Hope this helps, good luck! 
Adding an AHA or BHA is a great suggestion. There's some moisturizers that have glycolic acid in them to combine that into one step. You could also try adding a once a day usage of a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide treatment. 
I sleep with a clean towel over my pillow every night. It‚Äôs not as comfortable as a pillow case, which i sometimes miss, but i imagine it might help.

Would you say that you most often have no more than one whitehead?
I‚Äôve been been using products with glycolic acid and my face has a completely different texture in just two weeks. My skin feels so much better. My pores look smaller. The sebaceous filaments on my nose are almost nonexistent. Overall, I‚Äôm really happy and I hope this isn‚Äôt just a honeymoon phase. 
I have noticed my pores being less clogged after I started using TO Niacinamide+ zinc. My pores looked visibly smaller after around 2 weeks I started using it.
Have you tried talking to your dermatologist about getting prescribed Doxycycline? Its an antibiotic. 
Maybe Follicleanse Shampoo with Zinc. Zinc can help get rid of acne. 
The scalp is just skin, so if he can use it on his skin he probably won‚Äôt have a reaction on his head. However fifteen years is a very long time to hve a skin issue. Is there any possibility of a seeing a derm ? 
I personally recommend coal tar and salicylic acid combination shampoo and clean pillow cases at least twice a week.

I don't recommend it but I've seen benzoyl peroxide shampoo for dogs.
It may be folliculitis, not acne. I have it and it sucks. My dermatologist has dismissed my signs. I guess I will be trying Chlorhexidine shampoo soon.
Ketoconazole shampoo like Nizoral
Just got a round of fractionated CO2 laser done last week, actually. My scars definitely look better, a lot less red, a lot less deep. I‚Äôve been getting so many compliments about how good my skin looks.

Don‚Äôt expect a miracle though. I had horrible scars before, and they‚Äôre less horrible now. I‚Äôm not gonna lie and tell you that I look like a porcelain doll. I maybe went from looking like a piece of blue cheese to feta cheese. You can definitely tell that  I still have scars, they‚Äôre just not as prominent as before. 

The procedure itself was PAINFUL. They numb you for about an hour before the procedure, and I had two layers of numbing cream put on me. I still felt it. It was worse than getting a tattoo. You can literally smell your skin burning. Afterward, you end up looking like someone shoved your face into a hot grill for a couple days, and your face HURTS, until your skin peels. 

Keep your face moisturized with aquaphor, which you will need to reapply multiple times a day, because your skin just eats it up. Then, as you peel, you start itching INTENSELY. Get some
Benadryl, because I could not sleep for two days due to the itch. 

My dermatologist says that I‚Äôll continue to see improvement for a few months, and honesty, I‚Äôd gladly get the procedure done again. As long as your expectations are realistic, you‚Äôll be happy.

I work in an office where our aesthetician can do profractional laser treatments and our physicians can do the full CO2 laser while the patient is under anesthesia. For the profractional laser, there are thousands of pinpoint areas targeted, but it is not the entire surface of skin. Patients have topical numbing cream and an occasional dental block, but it still smells like burning flesh in the office. The full CO2 laser takes off the whole layer of skin and the patient cannot feel any of it while under sedation. The results are much better after the latter treatment, but it is much more invasive. 
Some of it looks like scarring. Reminder- scarring is not your fault, just happens if you get acne. Try a Vitamin C serum. If that fails, micro needling or laser therapy can help. See a dermatologist for that. Also try adding a moisturiser to your routine! Nothing fancy, I like cetaphil everyday but another popular brand is cerave. 

Good luck!! 
Face wash twice everyday with soap with fenoic acid in it.
Monday: Exfoliate for 1 hour
Tuesday: Benzoic Acid for 2 hours 
Wednesday: Clorsulfate of zinc on face right before applying cold water
Thursdays: Benzoic Acid for 2 hours
Fridays: Clorsulfate of zinc
Saturdays and Sundays I just wash my face
Please help me! I'm not sure if my acne on the cheeks is acne or scars and I don't know how to get rid of all of it :(
Just looks like scarring
I know this is not what you come here for, but from experience I can tell you that what you need most is to eat properly and drink tons of water. Yes you can follow the routine recommended to treat what‚Äôs already happening on your face but I would suggest staying away from sodas, saturated fats (anything deep fried, covered in grease etc) and would replace it with tons of water. There might be more to your skin imbalance than it might look so perhaps start there(?). I personally saw a HUGE improvement after i quit dairy and soda from my diet. Still working on drinking more water, though. 

Edit: removed ‚Äòabove‚Äô after noticing that it was OP posting his actual routine. 
Looks like rosacea to me. Look up Metrogel and either get a prescription or find OTC women‚Äôs products with the same ingredients. Nutragena french milled soap 2x a day. Both of these cleared up my skin quickly. Good luck!
I use aha from cosrx for my whitehead. It could cause purging though so you need a solid routine (face wash-toner-moisturizer-sunscreen) before trying it out imo. 
It looks almost like a skin tag to me. 
Might be skin tags but could also be warts. I used to get some on my face that looked like that.
Could be sebaceous hyperplasia.
real High def
Looks like skin tags. Are you over 30? Dermatologists have methods for removing these but I would shy away from anything at home to avoid scarring 
Remind me of warts
Been breaking out around my lips the past few days too. Suspect its the Blistex I‚Äôve been putting on my lips. Might try another chapstick 
When this was happening to me it was my tooth paste. I was washing my face and then I would brush my teeth. Make sure you‚Äôre doing all of that first. What chapstick are you using ? Is there coconut oil, cocoa butter or some other comedogenic in it? 
Do you wipe your mouth with your hand a lot? I‚Äôm really bad about touching my face and I often get acne only the areas I touch. I often find myself touching my mouth while sitting at my desk and so I struggle with blemishes around my lip line. 
I noticed this as well when i was using coconut oil lip balm then i switched to using "chap stick" (the brand) then i was all fine.

Might be your toothpaste, look at the ingredients. 
It honestly could, depending on the person. Personally, I have to use face wash twice a day (day and night) to keep my acne at bay. However, I know a friend who treats his acne by showering twice (day and night), without facial cleanser and letting the shower water on his face. If it controls your acne, why the hell not? You actually "cleanse" it at night anyway and you cleanse it in the morning with water and the shower steam. You do you
Some people are better off rinsing their face once and washing it once a day. I rinse in the AM and use sunscreen and moisturizer. 

Edit: adding also to remember to rinse your face the last thing you do before you get out of the shower so you don't have shampoo on your face. 
Hi there, I‚Äôm an Esthetician. Water can be drying to the skin and doesn‚Äôt do much to actually help with your acne. You‚Äôd be better off finding a good cleanser with 2% salicylic acid and a moisturizer with spf for the daytime. Wash that off at night and apply a night moisturizer and eye cream. Professional grade products like Dermalogica are more concentrated and more effective, so you have to use less product. They‚Äôre more expensive but are better for your skin and will last you longer. Ulta is the only place aside from professional salons that sells Dermalogica.
Also want to know that how you guys use these gel - do you apply it on whole of face or on just pimple surface.
I have a lot of mild pimple around my face so what i do is I kind of apply it as a whole layer on my face.
Do suggest your opinions regarding that.
I use clindamycin for my acne and I like it so far. It's helped with acne I would get in places that were touched a lot( near my ears due to my headphones and my chin due to my scarf). I don't know about the the other ingredient though.
I use it and it helped a lot. When I was first prescribed it the majority of my acne had cleared within a few weeks.  
Do you use anything else currently, besides the moisturizer at night?  

I love my benzoyl peroxide products. I mix up my day and night routines between products that are gentle but have no "active" ingredients and products that actually do something to my skin.  

I would recommend starting with a simple routine, and building on it once it becomes a routine and not just products you use every now and then.  Find a gentle face cleanser that you like, the Simple brand has a nice gel cleanser that is affordable and should be easy to find.  You can use this day and night.  The benzoyl peroxide treatment I use is the Neutrogena On the Spot acne treatment, but I use it all over my face and just at night (benzoyl peroxide has preventative properties too).  A gentle moisturizer with sunscreen for during the day, and you can continue to use the same moisturizer that you have at night, or get one that has some glycolic acid in it too.

My favorite acne body wash is the Neutrogena Body Clear Body Scrub. I like it because if I use it regularly, it keeps my bacne at bay and I don't also have to remember to put another anti-acne treatment on my back.
I have this crap too :/ Any advice would be much apreciated!
accutane got rid of mine
Oops sorry, soap is called ‚ÄúAsepxia‚Äù. Asphyxia is suffocation resulting in death. Sorry sorry sorry üòÇ
Do you sweat a lot? Before working as a bartender, I worked on a ranch outside and would get sweaty through out the day, so I started bringing extra shirt so I could switch it out half way through the day. Then once I got home, I would hop in the shower and use a back scrubbed that I bought at target and wash my back in the shower. Once I got out of the shower, I would just spray a toner onto my back a few sprays and just put on a clean shirt for bed. It didn‚Äôt get rid of it completely, but it helped A LOT. Now that I bartend, I don‚Äôt change my shirt (except after going to the gym if I‚Äôm not going straight home) but I still do everything else the same. Hope it works out for you :)
I started using this soap called Asphyxia (sp?) strictly on my back two weeks ago and it has drastically cleared my bacne. I have the moisturizing kind which is a godsend because i feel that my back is so dry once I get out of the shower and impossible to really moisturize, which I think contributes to the acne on my back. Give it a try! You can find it on Amazon.
You‚Äôll likely benefit from an acne body wash. Look up Panoxyl.
5% benzoylperoxide worked for me and it looks the same as I had. It got better after 3 weeks. But I also started taking zinc supplements at the same time so it could be either one or both for me.
Do you have any sort of routine? You need a cleanser, treatment, moisturizer and sunscreen. Z
You definitely need sunscreen to help not get those darker. Also clean your face twice a day 
roaccutane would be your best bet 
Hi there, believe me I'm a victim of the worst acne/pimple. I experienced way heart breaking than that. Like my pimples was all over my face and not just a normal pimples, it has puss in them, every single one. And it really feels itchy. I even tried to dry them out with some kind of anti-pimple topical gels but they keep on coming back. It really breaks my heart. I wear mask when I go to school. I even eat at the cafeteria with my mouth mask on (it cover everything below my lower eyelids to the chin) I've been to dermatologist before. But the best thing they've given to me is an oral antibiotics. But it just last for 2 weeks, they can't prescribe it to me anymore coz maybe my body would be immune with it. I've experienced crying my self to sleep just because of my pimples. Im from the Philippines by the way. I have oily skin. The only thing that helped me is a food supplement name "MX3". I drink 2 capsules a day for two months and once for maintenance. I choose this coz i know for myself that I can't be a healthy eater. It really made a difference. I SWEAR. And I exfoliate my face using "maxi-peel", for starters, use it for straight 2 months and use sunscreen coz your face will became very sensitive with sunlight and would start peeling. 


But if you are just having a problem with that part of your face and not the whole face, i could still suggest the MX3 Capsule, and just moisturize. Coz i find it really dry. Don't try to dry up your face just to get rid of pimples dear. Been there, done that, but doesn't really helped me in solving my acne problem.

Try thayer‚Äôs witch hazel! It‚Äôs the only thing that keeps my forehead acne at bay. If that doesn‚Äôt work, try going to a derm and getting clindamycin.
Tca peel, even a mild tca peel would give you great results.
Have you tried altering your diet? Cut out dairy and gluten for a few weeks and see if that helps. If you don‚Äôt notice any changes then you could also try eliminating eggs, nuts, sugar, coffee, and caffeine (i.e. the top food allergens). Also, as far as supplements are concerned, vitamin D, zinc, NAC, l-lysine, and fish oil are all supposed to be very helpful for acne. 
Don‚Äôt worry I had really bad acne in high school and I still do but not as much in college now. One thing my dad told me was it‚Äôs normal to see teenagers with acne, just like it is to see old people with wrinkly faces. The fact is everyone including adults know how hard acne can be on people and plus many adults know what you are going through because trust me they probably been through it as well. 
I‚Äôm 20 and Im also struggling like the way you did back in school. I‚Äôm also currently on Differin and I also have no idea why Im writing this because I cant offer you skincare advice since my condition is barely improving. But hey, if it helps, it takes time but I dont hate myself as much anymore. 
What's your current routine besides the differin? As far as picking your face, it will only lead to more discoloration and scarring, j know it's hard but that's only going to make it worse. 
I know what you mean, I was in the same boat. It was bad enough that I legitimately considered going on accutane, but decided not to because of all the negative side affects and health risks. 
I‚Äôve been using the Paula‚Äôs Choice extra strength acne kit and it‚Äôs helped wonders in a surprisingly short amount of time. Maybe that could be a good option for you? I went from having more pimples than skin to only 5 small ones. 
Please now that you are not alone. Acne is a b*tch. We all hate it. 
If you can see a doctor, ask him/her about cod liver oil. I hope you get rid of this sooner than you think. 
I can‚Äôt tell if that salicylic acid product is a face wash or a spot treatment. If it‚Äôs a wash, then I suggest removing your gentle cleanser as using those 2 together will strip your skin of oil. If it‚Äôs a spot treatment, then apply it after cleansing to any areas with acne. Salicylic acid does NOT kill bacteria, it just chemically exfoliates and unclogs your pores. As you mentioned you have whiteheads, I suggest using a product that contains either tea tree oil or benzoyl peroxide, as you get whiteheads from bacteria and those ingredients kill bacteria. I don‚Äôt have any experience with rosehip oil so I can‚Äôt talk about that, I suggest doing research on that. Also don‚Äôt pop ur pimples as those marks can take YEARS to fade, even with products to help with that. For you, if your acne is moderate to severe, I suggest using a salicylic acid face wash, followed by a tea tree oil or benzoyl peroxide spot treatment, and then followed by a light weight moisturizer that specially says it‚Äôs non comedogenic/won‚Äôt clog pores. Feel free to reply to this post or PM me with any further questions :) 

UPDATE: After doing some research, I found that many people had great experiences with rosehip oil for their acne scars
Are you using the salicylic acid  on current breakouts or just the old scars? The rose hip oil is good for moisturizing, but I would put other treatments in your routine to lighten the scars. Vitamin C is a great start. I had some scarring on my chin and vitamin c serum combined with at home chemical peels, they greatly reduced the redness and the scars. It depends on what type is scarring you have? 
I haven‚Äôt tried it yet but my derm told me to use it as a spot treatment for now. She said if I rub it on a spot and wait about 15 minutes, the spot treatment I use next will be able to penatrate the skin better.  Sounds reasonable but like I said I haven‚Äôt tried it yet. I use acnomel as a spot treatment currently. For me it works a lot better than bp but doesn‚Äôt dry my skin out as bad.

I've been using rosehip oil in my moisturizer and wearing sunscreen everyday. I get my rosehip oil from this company called The Ordinary. They also sell a serum for hyperpigmentation but I haven't been able to use it to see if it actually works.
Yes same!!! I don‚Äôt have acne as much but I do have lots of hyper pigmentation, and it sucks but I guess it‚Äôs better than having acne right ?
alpha hydroxy acids (ahas) did really well with lightening my hyperpigmentation. I‚Äôm 16 as well and had the same problem with no idea how to fix it. TO glycolic acid toning solution really helped my skin, but for something more gentle the FAB facial radiance pads won‚Äôt dry out your skin as much. do some research on the ordinary because there are a lot of different ahas (lactic acid 5% or 10%, glycolic acid) and theres also the AHA BHA peeling solution I think it‚Äôs called but I can‚Äôt get it in canada but many people love it. A more easily accessible one is pixi glow tonic, which is loved by a lot a lot a lot of people üòÇ. do your research on AHAs because there are a lot of options

You can a skin whitning product to even out texture.
I used to get this a lot when shaving and would even use the bump stopper product to reduce the razor burn. What worked for me was switching from the "how many blades can we put on this thing" model of razor and switching to an old school safety razor. I bought the Merkur long handle off Amazon. For me irritation greatly reduced and it is a lot cheaper as well. Also, a really good product for lather. I found shave soaps and lubricants worked a lot better for nonirratation versus the stuff that comes out of the can. And I use witch hazel and later moisturizer instead of an after shave. Sorry for the rant but hopes something here helps.
Shaving against the grain is always the best way to avoid getting razor bumps. I recommend going to Walmart and upgrading to an electric razor to prevent razor bumps.
I agree with using a straight razor. Cheaper in the long run. 

You can also try a sugar scrub before and after shaving. Depending on your skin sensitivity it might be good to get a scrub with some kind of oil(jojoba, shea). I would reccomend using alcohol or an alcohol based product(like aftershave) afterward to close the pores and sterilize your skin. 
I switched to an electric razor and no longer get bumps unless I cut myself. 
Meats that contain nitrates such as salami, bacon, sausage are on the avoid list on some acne diets but lean, organic proteins that don't contain hormones should be fine.
No. If you're really worried, stick to lean meats like Turkey, chicken, etc. But honestly, if it's decent meat, there should be no problems. 
I‚Äôve been vegetarian for about a year. I occasionally consume dairy, like cheese or eggs. I‚Äôve always struggled with acne mainly on my cheeks, but when I stopped eating meat I no longer have bad acne or break outs. I may occasionally get a very small pimple but nothing like before, and people have asked me what I did differently for my face to clear up. Now I just struggle with a bad complexion and acne scars. So in my case, yes meat can cause acne. But I‚Äôd also keep a limit on dairy 
It might be the dairy more than anything. I experimented with my diet over 2-3 week increments various times and found a decrease in dairy consumption made my acne flare up less. It's important to incorporate a face washing routine as well, but dairy is usually the place to start if you want to begin changing your diet.

Hey man, the same thing happened to me. I went vegan and juiced a lot of vegetables. I also take a lot of Vitamin C. Currently I would say I am 90% clearer than I was before. It took a long time to see results though, probably 9-10 months is where I turned a corner. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat. 
Not exactly in the same boat but maybe try fish oil. I have been using it to fight off breakouts for a while now. It doesn‚Äôt prevent them completely but helps them to clear up much faster. Typically if I have a breakout I will take 2 capsules about 3 or 4 times a day with meals if possible. On other days I do maybe 2 a day. 
Bro it‚Äôs all about your diet 
‚ÄúBimples‚Äù is killing me. At least you have a sense of humor about it! Is it possible to switch to a standing desk?
I started getting horrible buttne from working out- so i went to the derm and its not acne but folliculitus. I had to get prescribed acne neds for it tho and it works. The dark spots and scars take forever to fade which is what I am working on now. Dont worry its actually really common,it doesnt matter how clean you are, but try to not wear tight clothes where you build up sweat.
You could try the standard benzoyl peroxide spot treatment and/or stridex after you shower. That way, the medicine can stay on your skin for longer.  Also try to wear cotton underwear so your skin can breathe.

If the above doesn't work, it could be fungal acne/folliculitis, in which case washing with Head & Shoulders might work.
If it‚Äôs over the course of a day, it could be an allergic reaction, but it‚Äôs hard to say. 
To me it looks like clogged pores from using a new product. Did you get new makeup or moisturizer recently?
Bumps* sorry!
I know exactly how you feel. I can't stand it. I am in my senior year of high school and I'm a girl with moderate acne on my cheeks. Everyone in my classes have perfect skin and I'm sitting here with a pizza face. One time a boy told me I should put lotion on my face. I have no confidence when it comes to boys. I am 5'11" and I already stand out. The acne on my cheeks just makes it even worse. I hate it. I deleted Instagram because I couldn't stand seeing all the popular girls with their clear skin at the beach or hanging out together. I will never be like the popular girls who are petite with beautiful skin. They can go out tanning meanwhile I can't leave the house without sunblock on because I don't want to worsen my hyperpigmentation. I feel for you so badly. Your post made me realize my frustration. We will pull through and have glowing skin one day. Much love to you. 
My boyfriend will have Dr. Oz on with these people that have these awful skin diseases and be like, ‚ÄúBabe, now *that* is terrible. Yours is no where near that bad!‚Äù

And I‚Äôm just like ‚Äú oh okay I feel so much better now!‚Äù Haha. 
I feel this so much. Sometimes I just want to say "my skin looks like shit" and have someone look at me and be like "you're right. It looks like shit." It wouldn't feel good, but I'd sure as hell like to hear that over the "oh no your skin looks fine!" 
Why bring it up? Of course they‚Äôll say it‚Äôs fine. As a mod/severe acne sufferer myself, I‚Äôve learned to try my best to ignore my acne because it does hold us back in terms of self esteem and overall happiness. The one thing I still can‚Äôt get over is doing outside activities where I‚Äôm sure everyone is staring at my cakey foundation and awful texture.

It will probably subside somehow, someday.

And even if it doesn‚Äôt just remind yourself that it is just ONE part of you. You are not ugly or inferior by default due to acne. Not at all. Everyone has something they hate about themselves and honestly they‚Äôre so caught up in their own insecurities that they probably hardly notice ours.

It‚Äôs gonna be alright.
After reading these posts I relate to all of you on so many levels. My cystic acne broke out when I was in middle school, before everyone else had their break outs, and I was so self conscious about it. I used to blame my acne on why boys in high school were never interested in me. My friends were the same way, they said my skin wasn‚Äôt that bad...they just could never relate. I spent so much money and time on prescription topical creams and oral medications that my night routine would take 15-20 minutes. Insanity! Sadly, my skin didn‚Äôt start to improve until I was in undergrad. Now, even being 26, I still suffer with adult acne that gets pretty bad at times. It‚Äôs about finding what works for you and hormones are NEVER the best friends for us with difficult skin üòû
Did you change your soap in the last few days? As the comment above mine mentions, try tea tree oil baths. I also recommend African Black soap. Someone i know used it for their eczema and it helped clear their skin. 
Also, grab some ceraVE body wash. It‚Äôs non-comodemic and cleared up my shoulders they used to be horrible they would hurt so bad !
Do you sweat a lot at your job or just in general? 
Wash your clothes and sheets with an unscented detergent
Maybe it‚Äôs your washing detergent? 
This looks like it might be an allergy. Have you ever been allergy tested for various food intolerances?
If this happened over the course of a couple days, this could be a product issue.  When you have pustules or red papules like this, this means it is a bacterial issue.  When they are flesh colored bumps, it usually means it is congestion and it is a desquamation issue.  The bacteria that usually causes this is called propionibacterium acnes.  In order to reduce the amount of this bacteria, you need to use an acidic cleanser that contains AHA and BHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid and Beta Hydroxy Acid) .  Look for a cleanser that has Glycolic Acid and Salicylic Acid.  Using soap or fragranced body wash such as Axe, or Old Spice with heavy Fragrances can be comedogenic (can clog the pores).   After you wash with an acidic cleanser, use an exfoliating towel to scrub off the dead skin.  After you get out of the shower, apply a spot treatment contains both Salicylic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide (if your skin can tolerate it) .  Avoid wearing shirts that don't breathe, and if you perspire a lot, try not to stay in the same clothes.  If you are still getting break outs, you may need a professional back facial and then follow the protocol the service provider recommends.  Good luck! 
Try tea tree oil baths! 
I know how to heal it to avoid scars at least- 

Use Dudu Osun Black African soap AFTER you shampoo your hair (sometimes shampoo and conditioner left on back skin causes break outs)
Pat skin dry
Apply Cos RX BHA, let it dry 
Apply Seoul Ceuticals Vit C Ferulic Acid and E serum or equivalent to aid with brightening and scar prevention (it also fixes your skin barrier) 
Let dry 

Snail creams (I love Mizon) are good to heal skin as it heals btw ‚ù§Ô∏è
Accutane
I got healed by using ketoconazole & zinc lotion. For allergy control use Air Tab FX. PS: Not a doctor. Stop using any lotion/soap immediately. Change vests twice a day. 
DIY at home? nope. tried numerous times and never saw a difference. i did two sessions at the dermatologist where they used a derma pen which has needles that go a lot deeper and requires numbing cream, but the results are a lot better than DIY dermrolling 
I had microneedling done and my skin looked great for a month and then back to normal. I have rough skin and scarred pores.  I went in for another session and the rn shrugged and said cells turn over every month and I would not see any long term results. I appreciated her honesty but now what..
I think it depends on what you‚Äôre able to handle as far as pain tolerance because depending on how deep your scars are is going to be how big the needles will need to be to really penetrate them.. I use 1mm and I bleed but nothing insane and my scaring is significantly better but I didn‚Äôt have horrible scaring to begin with it was bad but not horrible I mostly have some indentations and pigmentation issues and I use it for fine lines.. I‚Äôve seen great results from that size and if I ever decided to penetrate deeper or get a bigger sized needle I‚Äôd need to buy some numbing cream because this is about as far as my self inflicting pain tolerance can handle! I personally think it‚Äôs the holly grail of skin care but consistency and post care are so important. 
Owndoc it‚Äôs an online store it has a ton of info and people talking about derma rolling plus super excellent quality rollers 
I wouldn‚Äôt use anything that makes my skin burn. Your moisture barrier could be damaged. Get that in check first before using those, and also look at moisturizing before and after you apply those gels if not indicated otherwise 
Hi! I had a really similar experience: a lot of acne when at college and almost none when I go back home. What I've done is basically avoid getting my face wet. I know. It sounds crazy, but I have actually gotten used to it and my skin has DEFINITELY improved! I used to get these massive white heads on my face a lot, but it's died down since I stopped using water. I now use simple skincare dry skin micellar water to cleanse my face once a day at night.

I hope that helped!
I experienced huge breakouts because of the water quality when I was in college. I ended up just not letting the water touch my face, and using wipes/micellar water to wash my face after showering. Some of my roomies would buy a gallon of purified water a week to use to splash their face - seemed kind of excessive but it worked. 

While the water might be a factor, could it also be your boyfriend/his bed? When I didn't live with my SO, I would break out after visiting him because I would snuggle into his chest and he would sweat almost straight into my pores lol. It's a nasty visual but that's really what happened. I would make him put on a clean tshirt for bed and also be sure to wash my face after snuggling and not fall asleep on him, which helped immensely. Similar to you, I would bring my own pillowcases because I change mine every other day at home. Good luck!!!
Ok um hi I have the same problem with literally ALL the moisturizers. The only one I‚Äôve found that doesn‚Äôt do this to me is the Pond‚Äôs moisturizer, the one with the light blue cap. I can‚Äôt remember the exact name, but there‚Äôs only one that is light blue!
It could be the facewash, sometimes "oil-control" cleansers can be very drying. And contrary to popular belief dryness and oiliness can go hand in hand especially when your moisture barrier is damaged. If you are not looking to change products or routine then idk. But I would recommend a more hydrating cleanser, and then possibly adding a couple drops of pure plant-based squalane oil to your moisturizer (or on top of it) daily. It's non-comedogenic, non-greasy, absorbs quickly and can also be used on the lips.
It‚Äôs 40 mg doxycycline capsules. Doxycycline works well to clear up infection while topical treatments start to work. I‚Äôm sure your doctor already said this, but you don‚Äôt want to be on it for longer than a month or so. 
So, I am using tetracycline for two weeks now, and my skin just get worst, my dermatologist said that if this does not work, I'm gonna take isotratinoin.

Just hoping for the best :(

Moisturizing is so important! Happy to hear about your success!
What moisturizer have you found success with? I'm in the market for a new one!

I really wish I could cut out all those things I just love food too much 
So, staying away from these foods is permanent? :'( or just for certain age?

Expensive,  but Kate Somerville Goat Milk moisturizer.  Veryyy incredible,  at sephora. Use with sunscreen!
For the winter months I would highly recommend the HEMP face protector from The Body Shop. 

I use Benzaclin for my acne and it really dries out my skin to the point where it feels like a race I'm constantly losing when trying to give my skin back some moisture. However, I started using this HEMP Face Protector cream and it has changed the game entirely for me. I have oily skin and I find that right now this doesn't make it worse at all, however for the summer months I might change to a lighter moisturizer! But for the winter months this might be a good choice for you if you live somewhere with a winter season. 
I am eighteen years old and a senior in high school, what a coincidence I too am on Spironolactone right now and have little baby cysts on my chin. I have one question: How many weeks are you into Spirnolactone? If you started it recently it might be a purging phase.  

Edit: I know how you feel. About two weeks ago I had a cyst on my chin and it was so inflamed that my bottom lip was lopsided, you know what else happened. I had to go to the orthodontist too. The most embarrassing thing ever was trying them putting new elastics on my bottom teeth because my lip kept covering them. 
I‚Äôm on it too! I also went through the purging phase and I cried every day through it but I read that it was so common that I stayed hopeful. I‚Äôm nearing two months now and my skin is over the purge phase and SLIGHTLY better so I‚Äôm starting to see the light lol. Stay strong! It‚Äôll get better!!
I am on both aczone and spironolactone as well. I‚Äôve taken it before in the past (with tazorac) and it cleared up my skin so wonderfully. Unfortunately my acne came back so I‚Äôve been taking it again and I‚Äôm already seeing huge results 1.5 months in. But it was reeeeeeally bad for a while. It sounds like you‚Äôre having a lot of pain because the acne is in areas that move whenever you open your mouth or lift your eyebrows. The only thing that helped me with the pain was to eat smaller bites of food, so I wouldn‚Äôt have to open my mouth so wide. Also using a benzoyl peroxide face mask everyday (I use neutrogena clear pore wash/mask, it‚Äôs 2.5% benzoyl peroxide I believe.) 

Is your skin cracking at all? Or is the pain from the cysts themselves? 
What are you using as a cleanser? 
[removed]
It looks like it's hormonal acne. You said you've tried contraceptive pills? The best one for acne would be Dianette or Yasmin depending on your country. 
However, if you don't want to go on the pill for any reason you could maybe at least manage your acne with a topical retinoid. Differin does take time but I've really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. 
I get these too. I assumed they were hormonal/stress related and I just had to suck it up. I have the copper IUD so I'm not on any hormones besides whatever my body does and I don't know how to clear them. I also have one on my chin that will take weeks to clear, and will leave a nice purple scar even though I don't pick at it üôÉ

Let us know what your derm recommends! 
Do you have before and after photos? 
I need to try this ASAP! Thank you for this! 
I‚Äôve stayed away from oils ever since I got bad CCs from when I tried OCM (grapeseed, rosehip and tamanu). Took forever to clear them and they all turned into either pustules, papules or cystic zits.

I‚Äôm so hesitant on trying it again (I finally got an all right routine going for me). 

But maybe I‚Äôll come around to it soon. Imma just save this post for if/when that day comes. Thanks for experimenting and sharing your experience.
Those are milia under your eye. 
Are you moisturizing?
Moisturize
For the average and very lucky person, a halt in acne production usually follows a decrease, or regulation, in hormone production, typically sometime after puberty.

Unfortunately, for alot of the people in this sub that is not the case, to which I would suggest diet may be playing a large role in your skin's health, and/or perhaps stress and other lifestyle related issues.
Because acne is caused by hormones, which you produce more of during puberty.
39 and still get it. PLEASE tell me when it‚Äôs going to stop.
I‚Äôm 25 and still get it ..when is It suppose to stop?
22! I have two brothers (one older and one younger) and their acne cleared after puberty whereas mine has just stayed constant since I was 12. 

RIP to any hope of having clear skin.
My brother is 30 and he still gets it.
30 over here and still get it! My mom is almost 54 and still gets blemishes every once in awhile. 
My younger brother has bad acne during his teenage years but now have clear skin. Me on the other hand is getting worse by day!
Usually ask your relatives when they stopped getting acne. That would be around the time you stop too
I hated Tactupump and it did nothing for me. But if BP works for you, you might like it. I‚Äôm on minocycline now, and it‚Äôs definitely keeping my IB from Retin A under control. Make sure you‚Äôre taking a probiotic a few hours before or after. You need to take probiotics with antibiotics but they should be a few hours apart so they don‚Äôt interfere. If you‚Äôre female, you‚Äôll likely get yeast infections. The probiotics will help, but tea tree oil baths can help externally 
I‚Äôve tried tactupump and t didn‚Äôt do much other then burn my face, I pretty much just stopped using it and went back to over the counter medicated overnight cream. I personally used a neutragena over night cream with benzoyl peroxide every night until my face started to feel irritated and then I stopped for a couple of days. I‚Äôm currently on my second day of doxycycline which I‚Äôm pretty sure is closely related to minocycline and I‚Äôve heard good things about it. But I would be careful with the tactupump because it also drys your skin out a lot.
I know exactly how you feel. One cheap solution you could try for acne scars is Rosehip Oil. You can get good 100% rosehip oil from Amazon or The Ordinary. If you have oily skin, use it at night instead of in the day so the shininess won‚Äôt bother you as much.
Vitamin c, retinol, niacinamide 
cold! Hot showers can be too harsh for the skin!! It‚Äôll dry out your skin and inflame your acne even more :( 
Since you use AHA at morning you *have to* use sunscreen because it makes skin photosensitive. Adding toner is totally ok too as someone else suggested. 
How long have you been on this routine? 

Adding a witch hazel toner to your routine should be fine, make sure you let it dry completely before moving on to your next step. 
Just to be safe I would alternate the days you use tretinoin and benzoyl peroxid. Don't use them together until you've consulted with your doctor or at the very, VERY least done a patch test to see how using both would react on your skin.


**edit**


For hyperpigmentation I would suggest adding a few drops of rosehip oil (one or two max) to your moisturizer to start (since you're worried about too many products). This will also help your skin recover if you have any sort of dryness and irritation as a result of your acne treatments. 
Try some AHAs. I‚Äôm noticing some improvements with them (applied after washing, before moisturising). 
I would suggest products with BHA and AHA.
Use a eggwhite mask works like a charm 
For my skin it's all about zinc with a cyst!
Benozyl Peroxide will help reduce the size and redness. 
I hate that we can't post links. If you go through my post history you'll find quite a few posts on how I healed a huge cystic breakout. Basically, very simple routine with clay masks and hydrocolloid bandages. 
Using Differin and BP has made a huge difference for me, along with some dietary changes. For BP I like Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Daily Leave-On Mask from Neutrogena. 
Hydrocortisone!! I‚Äôve been trying all sorts on my acne cysts for 20 years and finally, after seeing my new favourite dermatologist and being told that some simple OTC hydrocortisone will calm down the redness and swelling (and trying it!), mind = blown!!
(She also prescribed Retin-A to actually treat them but that takes weeks; the hydrocortisone was instant).
Hi there, maybe ask your doc for Retin-a prescription. If you have a lot of little bumps then you want a cream that will be a gentle chemical exfoliation of your pores. Breakouts heal must faster with Retin-a because it accelerates cell turnover.
not about what you were prescribed, but do you have bangs? long hair that touches your shoulders/back? 
Do you have skincare routine to treat your skin? Those gels may be drying and acne skin needs moisture too. I've had acne meds too and only afterwards I noticed that moisturizing more would've made my suffering back then easier lol. Check a blog called  "simple skincare science"
Are you referring to duac gel? That stuff works awesome but it is temporary. Then again it will take about 6 months for your hormones to regulate after going off of birth control so it might be a good solution while you wait it out.. Do yourself a favor and stay off of birth control if you can. 
I always moisturize last, I have had topicals from my doctor and put them on right after washing my face, let it dry, then use moisturizer. I have never had tretinoin so I don‚Äôt know how different it is 
Usually oily skin is dry and needs light moisture. So it'd be good to moisture both morning and night, since tretinoin etc can be drying. (Just my guess tho.) So maybe cleansing- acne creams - moisture would be good to start with. Check a blog called "simple skincare science" too. 
I‚Äôve got those pimple squeezing tools that make the work a lot easier and I apply anti bacterial gel to the area immediately afterward. I rarely wait for whiteheads because scarring is not so much an issue.
I squeeze. Can‚Äôt help myself, especially once a cyst FINALLY comes to a head after weeks of waiting. My personal rule of thumb is once you see ANY blood, STOP. I haven‚Äôt scarred. 
In addition to potential scarring, popping pimples can make them worse by increasing the inflammation in that area. You can rupture the inner lining of your pore, introducing the bacteria in the acne pore into neighboring pores. Don't use sharp (or dirty) fingernails and don't squeeze too hard, if you're gentle it can help the pore drain and not cause too many other problems. Definitely use an acne treatment too. 
If you really feel you must  pop, do not squeeze and rupture skin with force or fingers. Clean your hands and skin, use a few cotton pads and put fingers on either side.  With very very gentle pressure, push down very slightly. Don't push towards the fingers as you can create scars, which is a good reason not to. 
üëçüèº
In my opinion, you can start whenever! Personally, I‚Äôm not fully clear yet,  so I can‚Äôt undergo any sort of extensive treatment (I.e. face peels, laser surgery) but I still take steps to get rid of scarring! So some things you can do are use a mild exfoliant everyday and be gentle and you can also use face sunscreen to minimize the appearance of uneven, discoloured skin

Hey OP, I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Please reach out to a suicide hotline if you need immediate help and see a doctor about these feelings as soon as you can. I hope things get better for you and I sincerely hope you don't hurt yourself. 
It won‚Äôt last forever, what really matters is how you see yourself on the inside. That‚Äôs what makes you a human. I hope things get better for you, and will send positive thoughts your way! 
Hang in there, I'm in the exact same position. 21, been dealing with this since I was 14. So trust me when I say that I know how shit it feels. One day we'll have perfectly clear skin and we'll look back at this time and laugh. My heart goes out to you, if you ever need to talk I'm here. 
I was the exact same way when I was 21. I had cystic acne and hated my face so much I stopped leaving my apartment. I was severely depressed from it as well.

Now I‚Äôm 31 and have almost no acne. When I tell people that I used to have horrible acne they tend to be shocked. 

When I was 21 I felt like I had tried everything and I never thought my face would actually ever clear up. 

Hang in there. It gets better.
What do you eat daily? 
Sending you a lot of love. You're beautiful I'm sure.

What did you do to your diet? It took me 2 years of playing around with my diet before I got to a diet that completely healed my skin.

If you have any questions Id be more than happy to help!
Try drinking peppermint tea ‚òïÔ∏è. It‚Äôs good for hormonal acne.
There is hope for you! I would seek out a reputable naturopath that can help you diagnose your cause of inflammation. It could be food allergies, enzyme deficiencies, yeast overgrowth, mold toxicity, insulin resistance.. dermatologists rarely if ever seek to diagnose the root cause but a good naturopath could help! 
Please don‚Äôt start Mirena. I have heard a lot of horror stories and if you‚Äôre acne prone, it just isn‚Äôt worth the risk. You could look into non hormonal methods of birth control such as the copper IUD.
This routine doesn't promote or prevent acne. If you wanted an anti-acne boost, you could use a benzoyl peroxide dash wash at night, or a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide treatment at night. Since you're not acne prone, that might be too much and a daily moisturizer with salicylic acid or glycolic acid may be enough extra exfoliation to keep acne from forming. 
You can‚Äôt really prevent hormonal acne with a routine, based on my knowledge. I get cystic hormonal acne monthly because of my period. The reason you get hormonal acne is because androgens like testosterone increase at a certain point in your menstrual cycle (I think just before your period starts.) The androgens increase the production of sebum(oil)  which can lead to blocked pores and hence, acne. The problem with hormonal acne, or mine in particular, is that it starts super deep within the skin. Topical produces like creams, ointments, or cleansers work at the surface so they have little impact. I‚Äôm not sure how hormonal levels change with the insertion of an iud, but this is what I know about it based on my own experiences. I have to treat my acne with, ironically, birth control. It‚Äôs a different kind than what you‚Äôre planning to use, though. Hormonal acne is typically treated with specific birth control pills that regulate the production of androgens. 
You WILL BE FINE on the mirena IUD. Yes its hormonal bc but most of the hormone stays localised in the uterus, some may enter the blood stream and circulate but at much lower amounts than what you get by taking oral contraceptive. Everyone reacts differently, I have had the mirena for 2 years now and it hasn't caused any problems. I was previously on Ginet 84 which is awesome for skin (but not so much your body)on, so coming off that I did have a wee adjustment period but nothing major. 

The main change I would make is remove the coconut oil from your routine, it sucks for skin and I have no idea how it got so trendy. If you would like an oil go for something like rosehip oil or argan oil. For a more occlusive oil squalene is good to help seal in moisture. 


don't put coconut oil on ur skin
I'm also have problem with acne on my face. Should I use tretinoin to treat it? Any side effects. Sorry I'm not good at English. I really appreciate your help!

I would get your hormones tested, see if you can rule that out. It sounds like you‚Äôre taking really good care of your health and skin. That‚Äôs what makes me think it could be related to hormones, especially because it‚Äôs out of the blue and it‚Äôs origin is confusing. I hope you find answers! 
You‚Äôre getting acne because you‚Äôre a puberty aged male and your hormones are so out of whack. Keep using the products that work for your skin and keep drinking water - that‚Äôs really all you can do
It could be hormonal. It's not unusual for teenagers to get hormonal acne. You can also look into using things other than salicylic acid for acne  like benzoyl peroxide or differin.  You can also tell your doctor about it and they can refer you to a dermatologist or they can prescribe a topical antibiotic or medication themselves( that's what my doctor did)

I am not an expert on male acne however when my husband gets acne its on his chin and  because of his beard. So get a gentle exfoliator and try using that and also get a moisturizer.  When you clean you face you remove impurities but if you skin gets go dry it will crack and cause acne. 
I'd lance it, put a hydrocolloid bandage on it over night (or all day if you have no shame like myself) and then after the bandage is done sucking all of the gunk out of it, use either the clindamycin or BP.
Out of all the products you listed, Benozyl Peroxide would be your best bet. If it's during the day and you want to be discrete. I would just dab a little bit of 90% Isopropyl Alcohol to dry it out. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ONLY DAB A LITTLE. ALSO, TEST A DAB OF THE ALCOHOL ON YOUR ARM OR LEG TO MAKE SURE YOU WON'T GET AN ALLERGIC REACTION OR INCREASED REDNESS. And that's pretty much it.
My friend was traveling in asia for a while and when she got back in north america she started breaking out again. For her it was the added sugar everywhere so she tried to eat less bread/pasta/pastries and it worked for her. Cutting dairy also helps. Try to find the differences in your diet when you were there and when you are in america. 
I feel you there, my skin got angry during my study exchange. Different climate, food and more pollution.
Try double cleansing your face, maybe it could help a little?
Amazing results 
Scars?! Girl WHERE. You look amazing. So happy for you. I‚Äôm on week 2 of tretinoin... praying for results like yours 
Looks amazing!!! You hardly have any scars! I had  similar, maybe a little more scarring than you and I‚Äôve been getting microdermabrasion facials regularly and now they are gone, highly recommend it. Great job!!
That's amazing! I'm so glad you posted this because I have the same kind of acne and I'm wondering about scaring myself 
I am amazed at this transformation!! I‚Äôve been on tretinoin for about 6 months now and wow the difference it has made for my skin! I had a lot of those comedones all over my forehead temples and chin and it‚Äôs all gone now. I cried when i noticed it start actually working. Ive struggled with all different types of acne since i was like 12 years old. So going to the dermatologist and figuring out wtf is wrong with my skin and the treatment actually working was amazing. I‚Äôm so glad there are so many people benefiting from tretinoin too!!
I literally said out loud ‚Äúdaaaaamn‚Äù when I saw this, talk about a stunning before and after! You look like a completely different person I‚Äôve never seen one this dramatic üëçüèª
Hot DAMN. Girl look at you! That is absolutely amazing!
Wow this is seriously amazing. I know you want help with acne scars, but you have been seriously blessed with fast-healing skin because I don't see any! Congratulations on you awesome results. Your dermatologist should use this before and after for their website to show potential patients that miracles can happen
There‚Äôs a reason tretinoin is prescribed as much as it is for acne, and I‚Äôm so glad it was prescribed for you, as it seems to have truly transformed your skin. üëç I don‚Äôt have too much experience myself with scar treatments, but two things I do which are highly recommended are daily sunscreen application to prevent any scars/spots from darkening and then exfoliation. Tretinoin use by itself will help with leftover scarring, but another exfoliating option is glycolic acid. Vitamin C serums/products are also good for lightening dark spots or dark scars- Skinceuticals C E Ferulic serum is pretty well liked and also contains the antioxidant vitamin E, which can improve the appearance of scars after the initial wound has healed as well as protect skin‚Äôs outer layer. There is also micro needling, which can either be done at a dermatologist‚Äôs office or at home with at home devices, but that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never done so I can‚Äôt exactly personally recommend it.
You look amazing! What type of moisturizer?
I think the clindamycin really helps because if there‚Äôs any hint of infection it clears it right up. I actually use it on my ingrown hairs too and on my arms. My arms and back of my legs have keratosis pilaris so it helps with the redness of all of that crap. üò¨
I love this. Really gives me hope for the future of my skin and self confidence!! So happy for you!! 
amazing! looking fab!
I thought my acne was bad. But those seems like excellent results 
Acne scars will heal over time. Although i have heard exfoilating helps clear them faster 
i have found that massaging Bio Oil on my face before bed helps reduce my acne marks/scars 
If you don‚Äôt have makeup on in the right photo, your skin looks amazing!!! Congrats!
WOWOWOWOWOWOWOW what scars?  you look like you haven't had a breakout since high school!
Whoah!!! And as for scars I don't see any really lol, but I can recommend Jamaican black castor oil. I was super sceptical about it but my sister bought some and in just like a week my scars were already alot less red and noticable. And skin feels smoother and softer. Just apply overnight and if your at home doing nothing.
And again, stunning transformation, you sure give motivation for many people!

This is awesome and you look amazing! Did you have any initial breakouts? Also how long did it take for you to see noticeable results with tretinoin? 
Oh my gosh! You go girrrrrl! Incredible results. I‚Äôm 6 weeks into Retin A and purging like crazy. I want to cry. Are you using birth control pills or Spironolactone? Wanting to know if it‚Äôs only the Tretinoin that has cleared your skin?!?!
Gosh what a difference. And acne scars? What acne scars. Freckles aren't acne scars 
u look really sad in the before...  like I didn't even see the acne, I just saw your eyes. it breaks my heart. I'm happy things are better for you ( :
 Was tretinoin used every night then moisturizer for a year straight? what was your routine exactly? did it irritate at first then get better with time? what percentage of strength was it 0.05? 

how long to see results, let us know!  
for scars use organic virgin olive oil or organic virgin grapeseed oil ( olive oil is better but try and see what works) massage into skin very well every night (pea size amount)before bed where the scars are as night serum! save lotions and creams for the morning, & use oil at night, it will take a couple weeks to see results but worth it! 
WHAT THE WOAH! 

Congrats on tret working for you! It did little to nothing for me.
i feel like the products you‚Äôre using are too harsh and are compromising your skin‚Äôs protective barrier. are you moisturizing? time to simplify and to ditch the wipes.

am routine:
gentle cleanser like cerave hydrating
good moisturizer
spf (elta md clear is the best for acne!)

spf is so important as it prevents the scarring/discoloration from getting worse among many other reasons :)

pm routine:
remove MU with micellar or oil cleanse
gentle cleanser
good moisturizer
retinoid (moisturizer before acts as a buffer for irritation)

as things progress or plateau then i‚Äôd suggest adding in more but not by means of scrubs or fragrance, two enemies of acne!
Chemical peels are wonderful especially for what you're suffering from. I use Exuviance AP 25 peels they're professional grade that you can do at home. They have helped by skin so much, they treat wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scarring, and general texture of your skin. Before you spend a a lot more money on lasers I would try it out. 
I have been told that it takes multiple laser treatments to see full effects. Like 4-5. Idk how many you had within a period of 2-3 months but if it was only 1 that's probably why there wasn't much change
you should clear up the acne first before getting laser (I thought that was a requirement?). also it should take 4-5 sessions like said above to see a difference. sometimes you need a mix of treatments as well for maximum results. 
I've had acne since I was 10, so for about 18 years now. My skin looks to be similar to yours, but instead of forehead scarring, much of my pimples/cysts/scarring is concentrated on my jawline and neck. I also have EXTREMELY oily skin (more oily than anyone I've met or seen), have tried plenty of prescribed and OTC stuff, etc just to give you some background. 

I've changed my routine a little lately and have seen some improvement! 

AM- 

- pink Garnier Micellar Water: super gentle; non-irritating; doesn't dry out my skin; leaves my skin feeling clean; my favorite new product to have added!

- Neutrogena oil-free moisturizer spf 35: doesn't break me out, but not my favorite because it doesn't sink in well; used to use their daily moisturizer spf 50, but found it way too greasy, didn't sink it, and often pilled

- If I'm putting on foundation that day, I'll make sure to use these well before applying makeup


PM- 

- Stridex pads (red box): sometimes used as soon as I get home from school to cleanse/remove some oil from my face/neck/chest

- Neutrogena acne wash (orange colored): lathered with either my hands, a soft rubber facial scrubber, or a gentle exfoliating sponge; still on the lookout for something better though

- CeraVe PM moisturizer: was afraid the new formula would break me out, but I haven't seen any adverse reactions in the last month 


Occasionally PM- 

- Cosrx hydrocolloid patches: keep yourself from picking and use these! They're good for any size pimple or cyst and have definitely reduced inflammation time for me

- Target brand benzoyl peroxide: used 3-4 times per week if my skin isn't feeling sensitive

- Prescribed Tretinoin 0.1%: used maybe once a week; can be extremely drying, so moisturizers and hydration is necessary

- Squalane oil: sometimes I'll mix a couple of drops of this with my moisturizer; no frangrance; doesn't seem to clog pores; makes my skin feel softer

- Collagen face mask (from Daiso): really helps my skin feel refreshed and hydrated; seems to help with redness


I am definitely a beginner when it comes to knowledge about skincare, but one thing I know for sure is WATER makes a huge difference in my skin. Stay hydrated!!! Even a humidifier might work for you as well. (I loathe outdoor humidity, but when I travel to humid areas, my skin looks and feels great!)

I'm not sure if any of this will be helpful or beneficial for you, but I hope, at the very least, you know someone out there is struggling with the same stuff! 

PS: If anyone has any suggestions for me, I'd greatly appreciate it as well! Thanks!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Dude don‚Äôt worry about it. That‚Äôs literally nothing dawg. If it gets worse contact a dermatologist. Your best best is to just not touch it my dude.
That's no problem my guy, just let it heal naturally it'll clear away eventually (maybe 2 weeks at most). 
That after shave balm has hella fragrance. My skin hates fragrance and breaks out from it. Might want to switch to just a regular fragrance free moisturizer instead. I use moisturizer after I wash my face every time. A well-known option is Cerave PM in the pump. You can get it at the drugstore. 
Do you exfoliate? 
You should be exfoliating at least two To three times a week, using a Glycolic cleanser. I use Murads AHA/BHA cleanser. You need to exfoliate all the dead skin cells off and treat the skin underneath. L'Or√©al also has a Glycolic acid cleanser you can get at the drug store 
?
If you want to have your skin treated by a professional, see an esthetician. Estheticians are skincare specialists. Cosmetologists are technically licensed estheticians, except they are only required to learn about a 3rd of what actual estheticians are. So she might have a general knowledge of skincare but she is likely better sticking with hair care.

Great progress! Getting clear is a long and difficult journey but you're well on your way üòä
Slight improvement? I think it‚Äôs a drastic improvement! Congrats :) 
Hello r/acne, posted on here about a year ago detailing a 5 month improvement by means of only erythromycin. Since then, the antibiotic lost it's effectiveness causing me to relapse at times, the left picture being the worst. 

I knew prolonged antibiotic use wouldn't be good for me in the long term and eventually stop working, so since then I've committed to an actual skin care routine while also monitoring my diet.

For the about the past 3-4 weeks, I've been going with a basic 3 step routine day and night consisting of:
 
1). Noxzema Original Deep Cleansing Cream
2). Clean and Clear Persa Gel 10% Benzoyl Peroxide
3). Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer

Alongside reduced intake/complete omitting of dairy, excess sugars and chocolate, I've noticed a gradual reduction with my current acne, with less appearing in my typical trouble spots.

The flash probably makes it seem better than it actually is, but I tried replicating the current picture to the before picture as best I can. My skin isn't perfect, but it's a sure way better than it was at its worst. Hopefully this helps you guys out there!
slight?? tht looks like a transformation. congrats u look great
sweet hair dude!
You look great! Mine cleared up with epiduo so I always recommend a benzoyl peroxide/adapalene combination
Looks amazing to me! Good work
Sick hair! Congrats on the improvement
Amazing progress, good for you!
I love ur facial expressions lol. Reminds me of my uncle. Keep on keeping on 
Don‚Äôt forget to wear sunscreen!!
I'm sad to hear about your problems. You've gone through a lot meds and stuff. All I can say is that be nice to your skin and to yourself. Sounds stubid I know. Do something that makes u feel good, have a walk at nature, drink tea, read books. It will be fine. 
Curious how long you tried each thing. Just a ballpark? Bc for example it took at least 4 months of crazy tretinoin purging and peeling before I saw improvement. 
have you tried benzoylperoxide? Im on benzoylperoxide and zinc for 3 weeks now and Im seeing progression after not giving a shit for 10 years.
> Accutane has been working like a charm,but I'm only two and a half months in and have debilitating anxiety from it.

>What else is even left?

You realize accutane takes several months right?
Just stick it out..
Your skincare routine looks amazing (I‚Äôm so jealous!!!! wish I could afford all DE products). 

Anyway, not sure of your diet, but have you tried any diet/lifestyle changes? I know it‚Äôs so annoying to hear, but changing your diet (like decreasing sugar, dairy, and alcohol if you eat them) and upping your water intake might help! 
I completely switched over to Drunk Elephant in the past 2 weeks and have only been using their products. I‚Äôve noticed a minor difference in redness and less skin irritation even since I switched, but my acne still has these tiny white bumps all over my chin that I can‚Äôt get rid of no matter what I do. Any advice?

Have you tried cerave? They have a thick night cream that I like. 
Have you tried any hydrating face masks that you can leave on overnight? I love the thirst quencher mask from complex beauty. I apply a generous amount and leave it on overnight and wake up to more hydrated skin. After a few days of doing that in a row, my skin was flake free. I also have the glossier moon mask, and like it, but overnight it left my skin feeling sticky and kinda gross. The Glow Recipe watermelon sleeping mask is also really nice, but it has ahas and enzymes so I think it might not be the best because you mentioned your skin was sore after scrubbing and might need a break from exfoliating, physically and chemically. I *think* your skin barrier might have been compromised from too many exfoliating products so I would also try the dr. jart cicapair cream to help soothe and repair the barrier. 
Girl, if you‚Äôve been doing bunches and bunches of routines that haven‚Äôt been working it‚Äôs very likely you have dehydrated skin (which will get oily and acne prone *because* it‚Äôs so dehydrated, but it isn‚Äôt true oily skin). Specially with the redness around your nose, that‚Äôs what it looks like to me. Check the blog ‚Äúmaid from scratch‚Äù. I‚Äôve been following her routine for a couple of weeks and it‚Äôs been really good for me.
All the peeling you‚Äôre doing is probably just further drying, damaging and irritating your skin.
what's ur current skincare routine 
I had similar acne 2-3 years ago. I still having scaring left but what helped me tremendously was to simply wash my face without any products. My breakouts slowed down and lessened. It didn't go away completely though. 



Also, I used to eat tons of sugar. (Cookies,Cake,Chocolate,etc)

 Giving sugar up and those harsh face washes helped my acne a lot. I learned that my face was sensitive and easy to over dry (dehydrated) and that caused my face to produce EXCESS oil causing more acne.
4 years? Accutane.
They were nothing compared to the amazing sweet peace of mind knowing I was going to wake up everyday with no pimples 
‚ÄòTweezerman stainless steel extractor‚Äô 13$ at target & Kohl‚Äôs. Hands down better than any other ‚Äòextractor‚Äô out there.

I use mine mostly on my nose to get rid of blackheads. Works best right after taking a shower
Have you tried clay masks and aha/bha? Try beauty salon?
Idk but I am also curious because my acne looks like that. Hard bumps under the skin that are slightly painful 
Vega One All in One Nutritional shake is AMAZING - best part is, it has probiotics too!
Almonds, cashews, peanuts, and pumpkin seeds are good sources of protein. Granola is a good option too, and dried fruit. Yogurt is dairy but also high in protein and probiotics and I find it doesn't break me out like milk or cheese (probably less hormones). Baby carrots,  cucumber slices, bananas, watermelon, berries, cherry tomatoes. All good snacks you can pack for on-the-go.
Almonds? 
Carrots and hummus? Heavy on the hummus (make sure it‚Äôs Free of GMO and other bad stuff!) also are you intolerant to gluten? Or all grains?
Google low-glycemic snacks: gluten-free granola, air-popped popcorn with low-salt, 70 percent dark chocolate made without milk/soy, coconut chips, kale chips, quinoa puffs, sacha inchi seeds.
almond butter?
I eat a lot of carrots and broccoli as small snacks.. yea it sounds boring
Blueberries 

Full of antioxidants, one of the cheaper berries, and delicious. Not too calorie heavy but definitely a clean source of calories if trying to gain lean mass.
When I have avocados in the house I make this all the time: one avo, coconut milk, shredded coconut and a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses 
Haven't tried these for acne by myself, but you just need to moisture more if your skin feels like burning. I don't know do you have skincare routine, but try layering (alcohol free) toner, add oil and find good, gentle yet heavy night cream. 
[deleted]
Do you have healthy diet otherwise and do you have skincare routine to treat your skin?

Personally I've noticed that green tea helps a lot for me but the results are slow. Matcha and rooibos is good for acne, as well as peppermint tea.

I'm also trying to eat almonds for vitamin E. Keeps skin soft and healthy.
You might benefit from a routine that treats dehydrated skin instead. This is what I do:

Every morning: freshen my face with rose water, then moisturize with cold cream

Once a week: do a probiotic face mask and a hydrating face mask (usually one on Wednesday and one on Sunday)

Stopped showering every day, and when I do, I no longer use hot water. Just cold or lukewarm. And water almost *never* touches my face. Also started drinking more water everyday and took out the foods that were offending me from my diet.
Panoxyl body wash
Acne free terminator spot treatment

There is a pinned post on this sub that lists some great products
If you look close enough, most people do have some form of acne. Some cover it up, others don‚Äôt, so that‚Äôs an option. Acne is only a problem if you make it out to be, most people won‚Äôt even notice it/think twice about it. 
I know it's easy enough for other people to say but it's true: no one cares about acne, and the only people who point it out are insecure about something they have. You'll grow out of it; they'll never grow out of being a prick. Just play the waiting game, see a derma, and most importantly, stay happy. You deserve it xx
No one cares about acne my guy (or girl?). Really it all depends on how much you let it define you, do you see yourself as nothing more than a face filled with acne? Or a person with other qualities who other people should see? Everyone suffers from breakouts, it all falls down if you let it physically and emotionally cripple you. 
I usually just look around and realise a good percentage of people also have some form of it.
Personally i dont stay confident and just keep my head down
From what I've experienced, people don't look at you long enough to even notice your acne.. but if we're talking friends, well they probably don't care. I had 2 amazing friends back in HS who had probably the worse acne in school and no-one ever commented nor cared. (They were popular as well haha)
It's not a cure. It may temporarily relieve redness or inflammation.
Just be very careful because taking it for long periods or at high doses can cause permanent kidney damage. Definitely let your doctor know that you have been taking it, how much and for how long etc. 
[removed]
Heard vitamin e oil was good. Not too expensive either, I order some for my self yesterday hoping for good results. 
Dont exfoliate ur skin daily, it may irritate ur acne too much. I'd add more moisture and gentler cleanser.
For scarring  vitamin c and snail mucin is good. Also sunscreen! 
Someone on skincareaddicts sub mentioned ordinary‚Äôs nittroxine or some funky chem name. It‚Äôs only 6$, and is great with redness and scarring. It‚Äôs currently out of stock at Sephora, but I intend to get my hands on it when it becomes available again :)
As of late, I've been using Kojic acid soap on my back every other day. Acne goes down faster and dark marks have lightened. So far so good!
What's DIM CDG?
Congratulations !!!! 
I started a similar vitamin routine a couple of weeks ago - this post gives me so much hope! I am F/25 with similar jawline/cheek cystic acne. Thank you for sharing!
Im jealous... send those clear skin vibes my way!
Same! I'm finally clear - for now.

Luckily though my PIH is still there to make me feel awful.
Thank you for the post ! I will add CDG and DIM to my routine. Personally(F/40yo),I like fish oil-I can see results within a week. 
 
A week of without any breakouts makes me feel on top of the world. It makes me feel like "It's finally over" until I break out 2 days later...
Oh listen to your derm. It seems to be a solid routine
Hyper-pigmentation sucks!! I‚Äôve reduced mine SO MUCH in 1 month.

I use Vitamin E oil to fade my hyperpigmentation. I should‚Äôve taken pictures to show how much my super red scars faded.

I recommend Jason Vitamin E oil (the more thiccc, the better! must have 3 c‚Äôs!) at 32000IU. Make sure it‚Äôs PURE oil and not laced with other ingredients, as you might be sensitive to other ingredients and breakout. 

Application Tips:
1) You need to apply it religiously and consecutively if you want scars to fade FAST.
2) Apply it at night.
3) Rub the oil into the scar spots. RUB. Now don‚Äôt tear into your skin, but you want a good rub.
4) Don‚Äôt apply the oil into active pimples. 
5) Cover your pillow with a towel


My usage: I used the oil for nearly over a week straight each night, and it faded my back and face hyperpigmentation dramatically. 

It also makes your skin glow, which is an awesome plus. 
I don't see what's "cash grabbing" about this. Your derm isn't making money off elta sunscreen. It looks like a good, simple routine that will do the job while being gentle.
Before I even had a routine, antibiotics cleared me up completely after my skin went a little nuts changing birth control. Took it for a few months and now I've not needed to since. Retinol is great for preventing acne, and it's also good for clearing scarring. Salicylic acid is my holy grail even now I only get the occasional spot. TO salicylic acid is the only thing that remotely touches cysts, and a facewash is a good preventative. I haven't tried lytera, but the reviews all raved about it fading scarring. 
I used a product with 1.5% Salicylic Acid for a few months and noticed a decrease in red hyperpigmintation spots. I don't have experience with the exact product you were prescribed, but it seems to me like you might as well give it a go. 
Additionally : lytera was suggested. Does anyone know anything about this?
I‚Äôve been dealing with the same issue. Sounds like closed comedones. I have gotten rid of about 90 percent of mine but it has taken three months so far and I still have a ways to go.  I‚Äôm not a dermatologist but my best advice would be to get a super gentle cleanser. One that doesn‚Äôt make your face feel tight after you use it. Definitely stay away from the physical exfoliating scrubs like st Ives. A bha toner is what helped me the most but it takes time. Classic acne treatments don‚Äôt seem to work well on closed comedones because they aren‚Äôt inflammatory. Maybe start with a bha exfoliator every couple of days. When your skin gets used to that you could try alternating with an aha exfoliant like glycol is acid. Don‚Äôt forget your moisturizer. I also seem to develop fewer comedones when I use a light mineral makeup vs a liquid foundation. Hope this helps. Good luck. 
Used this exact cleanser in high school. Every Neutrogena product I have ever used (cleansers, SPF, even spot trestments) caused some kind of redness, dryness/flaking, breakouts, irritation... I swear my skin just hates Neutrogena. Never tried the other brand.

Do they contain salicylic acid ? 
It has Glycolic acid and Latic acid, But the three different charcoals are what Amazing, it pulls everything go then surface then slowing the  acids into the pores to really do deep clean 
Latic and Glycolic 
Anything with a head (which is what I assume you mean since you said ‚Äúopen‚Äù) would actually be referred to as a pustule. Papules are inflamed, under the skin pimples that rarely form a head. As for your skin concern, I would suggest adding an active if you don‚Äôt use one already. Actives don‚Äôt really work for me but a lot of people seem to have good results. Glycolic acid, azealic acid, salicylic, etc..
I'm curious - - what is your skin type and what areas of you face that you seem to get the most acne? I also get acne around the same times and it comes up around my jaw line the most. 
use a moisturizer and a sunscreen in the morning!! also maybe try a more gentle cleanser because the actives in the cleanser may be irritating your skin. Maybe try a gentle routine for a while? Try a cleanser like cerave foaming cleanser, then follow up with the aveeno moisturizer that you already have. if you want to slowly start adding it actives, try stridex in the red box/cylinder whatever
I'd go see a derm. Cystic acne is hard to treat at home too. Also, do you cleanse your skin properly? 
Edit: its maybe not cystic, sorry! Try aha/bha and hydrocolloid patches 
Hemp Milk. Hemp milk is rich is Omega-3 and Omega-6. Studies have shown that supplementation with Omega-3 can reduce acne severity (over a ten week period (nothing is quick with skin) participants found they had reduced inflammatory acne by 40 to 50% and non-inflammatory acne by about 20% after supplementing with 1000mg EPA and DHA).  Hemp milk contains 0.9g Omega 3 and 2.9g Omega 6 per 250ml which means you would have to drink a lot of Hemp milk to have similar response to the clinical but.... it is a good choice alternative to dairy. Dairy milk has been shown clinically to increase the hormones that lead to a rise in sebum production and skin cell growth; both of which are a root cause of acne. Hope this helps.
Does or doesn't? There's a lot good alternatives, maybe r/vegan may help more 
I've heard almond milk is good
Depends on what you want it for. I love coconut milk, but it doesn‚Äôt go well with everything 
Almond milk definitely.  Also soy milk is pretty good
I had acne across my jawline too, and also acne on my chest and back. Have you tried doxycycline antibiotics? Literally the only thing that helped me. I've been on it for a little over a month now by prescription and my acne reduced by like 70%. Still got 1 more month to go 
I suggest stridex pads (once or twice a day)! They‚Äôre relatively inexpensive on Amazon and they cleared similar spots on my face perfectly! Afterwards you apply, moisturize!
I second Stridex!
wait, it says links are not allowed but here is the name:

Humane Benzoyl Peroxide 10% Acne Treatment Body & Face Wash

and it's on amazon for like 20 bucks
ALSO: watch the diet, especially sugar (not from fruit) and dairy
Wow no reason to be mean. I know what I am talking about and my forehead acne looked exactly the same and it turned out to be fungal, even if you google picture fungal looks very similar, I just want him to research, I also said that I am not an expert. Jesus. 
I am not an expert, but it looks like fungal acne, you might wanna research about it.  :)

I had the same issue, the best thing to change is your diet, drink a lot of water and don‚Äôt eat greasy food or just any junk food In general, no fast food no candy no chocolate no fried foods either 
lol, you look like a disturbed serial killer in this pic!
Not sure about that brand, but I use the body shops tea tree oil and I love it. Was my first step into skincare and it really helped my skin get more clear. Not helpfully for cystic but great for having less breakouts
Always dilute it in another oil or something else it is soluble in! I use about two drops mixed in with a teaspoon of jojoba oil or almond oil and use that as a spot treatment. It works for me because the tea tree is antibacterial and dries out the acne and the jojoba or almond oil then moisturizes to heal and protect.
I use it as well. Helps as an antibacterial and drying agent. I use about a 5 to 1 ratio dilute of tea tree oil in witch hazel and shake it up then use it as a toner on my face after washing but before moisturizing. For treating local acne it‚Äôs completely normal to put some on a cotton round and just gently dab on the spot. Make sure that if it burns or stings for longer than a couple of minutes you dilute it in some water or witch hazel to avoid irritating your skin!
I use it morning and night. With clean hands, i pour a dot out onto my finger (i used to use a q tip but this is so much easier), then spot treat each individual pimple, let it dry, then add a dot of aloe Vera gel on top of every spot individually. 
Clears my cystic acne better than retin-a or antibiotics.
I‚Äôve used it with ‚Äòmeh‚Äô results. Didn‚Äôt really see an effect on my acne. Be careful using it though! It‚Äôs poisonous if ingested, even in tiny amounts. So keep it away from your mouth, obvi. 
I don't dilute it. I have been using various brands for years. It works amazing on acne and insect bites. 
Thank you so much for all your tips! I realized I didn‚Äôt knew that much about it 
It's good diluted in a toner for oily skin, or dotted on a spot to help dry it out. 
Has anyone used the doterra tea tree oil for acne.? I bought a kit and melaleuca was included.  If you have, what were your results/opinions?! 
Might be your toothpaste. Does your toothpaste have sodium lauryl sulfate?
do you use a lip balm often? if so are there any pore clogging ingredients? i was using a chapstick with coconut oil in it & kept getting clogged pores etc & it vastly improved when i switched to a different one!
Sometimes when I get stressed I chew the inside of my lip/cheek and end up touching my lip Area a lot which ends up in some pimples there it might be as simple as you are just touching your mouth with dirty hands but of course this could just be a me thing 
Be prepared for your skin to fluctuate a lot. I have acne as well, my skin cleared up a bit while pregnant and I had that "glow", but afterwards it came back in force. However, some women get worse acne during pregnancy. So it really just depends on you since everyone is different. Your best bet is to find a good routine that works for you and stick with it throughout. 
My dermatologist told me there are only 3-4 medications you can use during pregnancy. Clyndamycin lotion being one of them (that‚Äôs what I used). I would get off all supplements and acne meds and eat clean for a couple months before you plan to get pregnant. Only take a prenatal vitamin. My skin broke out for a few months and I would go to a lady for light peels, dermaplanning, and facials. But by around month 5 or so, my skin never broke out at all and stayed clear until like 4 months after baby came. Then all the sudden booooom cystic acne came back. Now I am back on Epiduo. Best of luck to you!!!!   
Acne scars in general
Have you tried a dermatologist. Can get tretinoin or even accutane
Not sure what it is, but mine looks very similar. Would be curious to see what other people have to say.
Thanks for sharing - I had the exact same experience cutting out dairy.

Went on Accutane for a year, which worked temporarily, before deciding I would try treat the problem at the source - what I was putting into my body. Dermatologists fail to ask these questions and jump to medication.

I don't even crave dairy products anymore because all I can see/think about when I look at them is breakouts. We don't need dairy to be healthy, quite the opposite. I eat a lot of broccoli for calcium. 
I HAD THE SAME RESULTS. ITS DAIR NOT JUST MILK. FUCK IGF 1. 
I had the same experience as well. I also ended up finding out even butter gives me acne. Not completely break out, but it doesn‚Äôt look as good as if I cut it out 100%. Ghee seems to be fine but I also try not to have it all the time
Thanks for sharing your experience! I'm curious, did you cut out just milk or all forms of dairy (cheese, yogurt, etc)?
Are soya based products better? I‚Äôm just wondering because I love yoghurt and cheese. 
i got acne at a young age and still have it at age 23. mostly redness and large pores. did you have these problems too? and did stopping with the milk help that?


ive wanted to cut out dairy, its hard, but i think i will try
I have been dairy-free for a week now but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve seen improvements. I know it‚Äôs only been a week but I‚Äôm so discouraged. :(
Did you see an immediate effect after quitting? 
I'm so happy you had a good experience, my GP was also amazing for my acne and eventually got me put on Accutane. 
My first GP was absolutely dreadful, wouldn‚Äôt listen to a word I said. Eventually I moved to another surgery and my GP there is amazing. Recommended me to a dermatologist for accutane at my first appointment (even though my acne at this point was fairly mild, but I spoke about how much it affected me mentally and it really felt like he actually cared what I had to say about my own skin!). So happy I didn‚Äôt let the first negative experience keep me from going to a doctor - and extremely happy the appointments are free and prescription prices are so decent!
F/23... Glad you had a good experience! I‚Äôve had mild acne since I was 11 and never realised how unseriously I was taken by my GP until I switched practices very recently! This new GP saw how I had been on every acne medication available on the NHS (bar roaccutane) and had even been fobbed off with some twice over the years without realising! 

I only became aware of Roaccutane after joining Reddit. The GP took one look at how upset I was that my ‚Äòmild‚Äô acne was so stubborn, she referred me for it.

But surprise -- after waiting 8 weeks for the referral letter I rung up today and they haven‚Äôt even received my details üòÇ 

GPs and I don‚Äôt get along apparently!
That‚Äôs a really bad idea.  
Yeah you shouldn‚Äôt do that. Go see a physician. 
I just started drinking matcha tea two days ago so I'm curious about this.
What kind of acne did you have before? Mild or moderate? I'm not saying matcha tea has no health benefits but how do you know it wasn't the prescription cream working its magic after a while? 
Anyone else have experience with Matcha Tea? I'd love to I hear more opinions
I Want to be able to drink matcha so bad but I am super sensitive to caffeine. Caffeine in sensitive individuals can lead to cortisol levels going up which could translate to more acne. I actually drank a bunch the other day and it made me throw up. If anyone does consider matcha make sure you‚Äôre consuming a proper amount - it‚Äôs super strong! 
hang in there!!!! i had gone to a dermatologist after i had struggled with mild acne that had turned severe after my town was hit by hurricane harvey. no cleanwater for a month + the stress RUINED my skin. but.....he made my skin even more terrible. i mean, cystic, oozing, and rashes all over. it was awful. i decided to go to a different dermatologist out of town, who prescribed me minocyline & tretinoin. within two weeks, my skin was A W F U L. it had worsened! i gave it another few months & my skin cleared right on up. give it time & do not pick!!!!! i know its hard but dont!!!!! remember to tone (i use the mario whatever rose water, any rose water would work), and moisturize! i use aveeno but its just what ive been using until i find something im set on. if youre on tretinoin, exfoliating is your new bff. i also use a skin bleach/lightening cream called nadinola for leftover scars, theyll be gone within a week. if youre using tretinoin with mino & it isnt working, ask if you could bump it up! when i used .025% i didnt get results, but when i went up to .050% it worked immediately. like i said, hang in there! it gets worse before it gets better. 
You‚Äôre probably having an initial breakout, especially if you started using all those products everyday all at once. Generally it‚Äôs a good idea to ease into a big change in your routine (for example, rather than starting out using epiduo every day, using it every other day until your skin gets used to it). Your skin is probably irritated by all these new products, which could be contributing to your initial breakout (IB). 
i don‚Äôt see anything.. bad pic? 
I agree.... diet plays a HUGE role (especially when we're wired to break out)! But gdamn, pizza is amazing--and pizza without cheese just isn't pizza.

A nice substitute for cow's milk is cashew milk -- it's pretty tasty (even unsweetened)



Blame it on being a teenager, especially being male, since your test levels are gonna be out of whack 
teenage acne is due to hormones, that‚Äôs not something you can prevent unless you go in birth control or something 
No chance
No way
One pimple does not mean your whole routine isn't working lol... Most acne is influenced by hormones, and further aggravated by genetic predisposition to things like oil production or inflammation. There's no perfect routine that will magically cure 100% of acne. Especially at your age. 

Stick with the routine, keep your skin healthy, and treat the occasional pimple with a spot treatment when they occur. 
diet is a major factor in acne.  no amount of skincare will fix a bad diet
I just started a new birth control in January for my hormonal acne called Gianvi (has the same hormones as Yaz), I don‚Äôt have any experience with ortho tri cyclen, but I‚Äôm really glad I started this new birth control. I‚Äôve been taking birth control since 2015 and have tried three different kinds, this was the first one that worked for clearing up my face. As long as you take it around the same time every day, you shouldn‚Äôt get irregular periods or spotting. I encourage you to give it a couple months, you can always stop taking it if you don‚Äôt like it or don‚Äôt get the results you want. Good luck :)
Each person reacts differently when taking any medication so it depends on how your body will react to it. If the birth control doesn‚Äôt work out for you then switch to a different one. I‚Äôm taking Yaz right now and it really made my skin clear. I do still break out but it wasn‚Äôt as terrible as before. Just give the pill a few months for it to adjust your body. 
bc pills cleared up my acne but once i stopped taking it due to the side effects, my acne came back 10 times worse. it got so bad that i am now on accutane. unless you plan on taking bc pills forever, i don‚Äôt think it should be used to treat acne, because once you stop taking it it‚Äôs just gonna come back. 
Apparently there are a decent number of women who get unwanted side effects from hormonal birth control. It‚Äôs really just depends on each individual person. For example, I‚Äôve been on a handful of different hormonal birth controls over the years just for birth control reasons and I‚Äôve not had a single negative side effect from any of them. That‚Äôs just me, but your experience will be your own. You can always discontinue (with your prescribing doc‚Äôs permission) the birth control if you experience bad side effects- there are multiple basic hormonal formulations, so you can try a different one at that point. On the other hand, while birth control didn‚Äôt cure my acne, it does definitely help keep it mild and under control.
Every woman has different side effects so you shouldn‚Äôt base your thoughts on someone who may have never had a side effect. 

I was on for a long time for my acne and it helped me tremendously. I got my period every time I was supposed to. Never had any spotting (only when I came off I got my period twice in one month)

I had a friend who became extremely depressed on birth control so she didn‚Äôt last long. 

You should try it out. I am going back on once I give birth in September. 
I was very very nervous about getting on birth control but I‚Äôm so happy I did! The reason I got on it was because of my acne and my periods were very heavy and irregular. It‚Äôs cleared up a lot of my acne which is great. Also going back to ur comment about spotting and ur period getting messed up. My doctor told me (and she was also right) I only had random spotting the first 2 months of starting my period and it wasn‚Äôt that bad, also ur periods r not random they are planned because of the birth control :) good luck
[removed]
I‚Äôm also very curious about this. I have a (non-reproductive-related) condition that I need to take medicine for permanently, and the medication interacts negatively with hormonal birth control. It‚Äôs not harmful to me, just makes birth control less effective, so I would imagine it wouldn‚Äôt help my acne much. I have an appointment with my doctor next week and I plan to bring it up, but I‚Äôm starting to feel very hopeless, because my acne is very clearly related to my hormones (there‚Äôs a noticeable difference at different points in my cycle).
Get on birth control because it will help, but pay attention to your body and communicate with your doctor if you feel like something is wrong. I can‚Äôt stress enough how important both of these things are. 

There are a lot of different types of birth control pills out there, at a lot of different hormone mixes and levels. The first one you try might not be the right one for you. One that makes your face completely clear might make you have horrible mood swings. That doesn‚Äôt mean you need to give up or live with it, talk to your doctor and try something else!! And if you feel like something isn‚Äôt right (ie: you find yourself crying more than usual or are easily irritated) then tell them. If they don‚Äôt listen, find a new doctor. They should take your concerns seriously and there should be mutual respect. 

Finding the right birth control might take time, but is worth the effort because it has so many benefits (regular periods/less mood swings/improves acne/no babies). Good luck!!

Experience: I‚Äôm almost 30 and have been on bc since I was 16. Tried at least 4 different pills, now have an IUD
It‚Äôs completely normal to feel how you‚Äôre feeling. I was in the same exact position. I agree with everyone else that says it‚Äôs important to listen to your body and work with your doctor. I was put on ortho tri cyclen a year ago. I was iffy because I didn‚Äôt like the idea of being on medication. But I‚Äôm really glad I did!! Take my experience with a grain of salt, but I didn‚Äôt have any disturbances in my cycle. Remember, medical practitioners generally prescribe things because they feel that the benefits outweigh the risks. For the first week I took it, I did have pretty bad nausea for about an hour after I took it each day. I like it because it actually made my cycle more regular though and after that week or so I didn‚Äôt experience any side effects. My skin did clear up quite a bit :) But after a year, I still had some pimples. So I definitely won‚Äôt preach it as a cure-all, but it has been helpful for me. I‚Äôve now re-evaluated my acne with a derm, and she put me on spironolactone which works with my birth control to stop hormonal acne. My skin is quite clear now! Best of luck! :) 
I started spiro without BC and it didn‚Äôt do much of anything for me because of my PCOS. I added BC recently and it has done a lot. Conversely, i was off BC for about a year and lost all libido and general interest in my relationship but since restarting, that has begun to change and i‚Äôm happier about that. I should note that from 16 until 27, i was on estrostep and trilegest fe but I requested yaz (well, generic obviously) because i felt the other wasn‚Äôt really helping my PCOS nor is it as effective when paired with spiro as ones often touted on this sub. Also worth noting, i‚Äôve taken adderall for my ADD since ~2009 and *that* is the cause of all my fuzziness. I have learned to manage that as best as possible though it has gotten increasingly harder as i‚Äôve got like 10 years of that crap impacting my memory and brain :( i have found that certain brain foods really help though, have you tried adding certain foods and removing others? If the spiro doesn‚Äôt help alone or you feel like you should try a BC again, it‚Äôs worth looking into and also developing certain methods that help you keep your mind sharp (new studying or learning approaches, different brain exercises, etc). It may sound fruity, but it *has* helped, even in my situation. 
Which BCs have you tried? Some really mess with moods :/
Moisturize, don't touch it, and wait. It's likely just blood under the surface of your skin but anything beyond your normal skincare routine is just going to make it worse or lead to scarring.

Go see a derm if you're able, they might be able to give you a shot or extract something.
I have had a few of these. The blackish blue color faded (to reddish normal pimple color) and the pimp went away. I wouldn‚Äôt worry at all.
I have noticed my skin is much clearer when having 1-2 bowel movements a day.
And if I don‚Äôt my skin will be terrible the next day with painful acne.
I definitely think there‚Äôs a connection 
Yes! This is so true. A great way to help this is taking probiotics. You can find them in your local vitamin store, or if your grocery has a vitamin aisle. Also, try to cut out some dairy in your diet. Maybe drink almond creamer with your coffee, lay off yogurt or cheese. Also zinc supplements are great with acne! But 100% look into getting some probiotics. I would suggest 8 million per capsule. It helps the good bacteria in your guts which will help benefit the bacterial on your skin :) 
I'm having this issue at the moment and it's really getting me down because I've had my acne pretty much under control for the past year. I always get a few spots on the last week of my pill and during the break week when I get my period, and I usually have some digestive issues during this time too. My digestion has been particularly bad this month, and that combined with my period has spots breaking out in places that I never get them like my cheeks and forehead. There's a lot of redness around the breakouts too and it doesn't seem to be fading, I think it's probably because I've got a lot of internal inflammation with my digestion. 
Yes I do, I think it's due to the inability to get rid of toxins from the body so they are expelled via the skin. I have poor digestion so naturally this fucks up my skin üò≠
Hi , u can use benzoyl peroxide /clindamycin  gel to coat the acne with and then try manoeuvring around the active acne ü§î.. or u could do a pulse dose therapy of azithromycin  ( 500mg OD  three days a week only for 5 weeks  ) use BP nightly .. wait for the acne to subside and then Dermaroll ...  
Please seek ur physicians guidance before  any oral medication ..  


Definitely avoid rolling on any active spots. It will spread the bacteria and potentially cause more acne or even damage and scar your current spots. Blackheads probably don't matter so much but for sure try to avoid CC's/whiteheads. Only roll over the scar you are trying to improve, and only about once every four to six weeks. You don't want to overdo it. It takes time for your collagen to regenerate after being damaged which is basically what dermarolling does. 

Always do it on a clean dry face and sterilize the roller as best you can with alcohol before and after every use. Also for cleaning personally I use a baby toothbrush and lightly brush it then soak with alcohol to remove any hair or skin particles that may get stuck. They're gentle enough to not break the needles.
Since a few months, I've been visiting a skin therapist almost weekly. I'm still in treatment, I hope I'll have clear skin in a while!
I've also been changing my pillowcase daily. I drink lots of water, I changed the products I use on my face, and I stopped wearing face makeup. Also, I changed my diet (not sure it it's related to my skin clearing up), I eat way more fruit than I used to, and I have way more fibre in my diet.
What exactly is a skin therapist?  Never heard of this 
Depends on the lotion. Most hand/body lotions are scented which can cause acne/irritation for some people. It‚Äôs best to find a moisturizer specifically for face to use. Moisturizing your face is super important imo. 
I use Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy 
Doesn‚Äôt really have much of a scent though. But i wanna get a moisturizer that has a spf 
I use shea butter it works well on moisturizing and it doesn't clog my pores.
Don't use body/hand lotions onbyour face. Find a moisturizer formulated specifically for use on the face.
Most of them are just scars. Best thing you can do is going to dermatologist
Looks like mostly scarring and some freckles. Doesn't look like cystic acne so it could be helped by something simple like cutting things out of your diet (dairy, sugar) or even just as simple as switching laundry detergents to something more natural and changing pillow cases often. Lots of sunscreen too! If you go to a dermatologist they are going to prescribe meds. Before I would do that, I would exhaust all other natural options first because I think you can help yourself, I don't think you'll need heavy meds or anything! Good luck! 
Scarring with some inflammation, a few tips I can give you, make sure you're using only non scented moisturizers, rub gently (no need to scrub your face it just makes it more red and irritated), changing your pillow cases, try cutting dairy out for a bit and see how that works for you :)

If all else fails and you consider the option for yourself then go ahead and see a dermatologist 
How long does it last? It could be a cold sore?
You might wanna see a professional for this one
Sorry I'm on my phone and it won't let me add text to the post but basically I've never had terrible, terrible acne/skin, only mild, but my skin has never been perfect. I've always gotten this nasty pimple in the same spot on my face though over and over again, and even though it will go away for maybe a week, it always reappears in the same spot. Sorry the picture isn't good, but is it cystic acne? There's never a head to them always just a large red pimple on my face that's so gross :( any suggestions on how to get rid of this for good? It really affects my confidence in day-to-day life and I don't like to wear makeup, but especially when it looks this bad, I feel like I'm required to. 
I honestly think it's a cold sore. I get one on my face occasionally and I thought it was a pimple but nothing worked. I tried Abreva and it was gone in 2 days. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I recently talked to my derm about the same issue - I get acne on my back in the summer. She recommended using Nizoral Shampoo on my back while showering. I *have not* tried it yet, but it was recommended by a professional, so maybe it is worth a try for you. It is available at Walmart and other common places.
Hi! I had that issue as well. I got the First Aid Beauty skin rescue body bar and it changed my life. It is $5 and I promise you its worth it, which is crazy because it is kind of a high end company. I got a lot of my friends on it and it worked for them too. Just rub it on your loofa and keep it on your back and shoulders for a lil while. Make sure you arent allergic to any of the ingredients. Good luck!
I had back acne for 10 years and it‚Äôs cleared up almost completely after playing around with a few routines. When I shower I ALWAYS wash and condition my hair first making sure to completely rinse everything out and put my hair up before washing my body (shampoo/conditioner can clog your pores).  I use the body clear pink grapefruit as well,  it definitely works for me. I use a loofa and scrub my back in a circular motion to rid the dead skin and clean my pores. Rinse with lukewarm or cold water to close up your pores and make sure to rinse completely so no product is left on your skin. Pat your skin dry and wait a few minutes before moisturizing. I use cetaphil moisturizer for back and body. It‚Äôs extremely important to moisturize because dead skin cells can clog your pores and cause acne. If you have long hair don‚Äôt let it touch your back while it‚Äôs wet. Keep it up until you have a shirt on and put a towel over your shoulders so it doesn‚Äôt saturate your shirt. Also, don‚Äôt over do it with the acne products. Sometimes I‚Äôll just use the cetaphil body cleanser to clean my skin. Over using acne wash can also cause breakouts lol basically everything can which sucks. Don‚Äôt go more than two days without showering! This cleared up my back acne (still have scars) in about a month. It takes time but have patience. This comment is longer than I wanted but I know how depressing body acne can be. Hopefully this helps! If not feel free to message me for any other advice! 

Edit: make sure you wash your back immediately after working out
Maybe try switching shampoos. Something in there might be causing you to break out. I just switched to a paraben and sulfate free shampoo and noticed improvement. 
I think you might have answered your own question; if a Derm prescribed your Accutane ask them about the spots as they may need to be extracted to avoid the scaring/pigmentation. Good luck 
[deleted]
Going off of the type of cystic acne and placement on the face, I think accutane would work very well for you. It‚Äôs a tough medication to take but after 6 months of using it, many people don‚Äôt ever get acne again. My fianc√© had acne like yours and accutane worked wonders for him. You wanna go to a dermatologist. 
What is your diet/routine like?
Maybe Accutane? I‚Äôve also tried all so my derm finally said Accutane. 
Please ho on accutane
It would be easier to help you if you posted your current skincare routine and background info like treatments and products you have tried in the past that were ineffective. 
Looks like skin irritation. Buy a soothing oil free moisturizer or aloe. Try not to scrub your face to much or aggressively. Tone down on products. 
I've had something similar for years. like you I've had no acne in these areas but now it looks almost like scarring. I've used Cetaphil for years, recently I added a vitamin C serum to an (almost) daily routine, it's not harsh at all and seems to be helping. 
Hey guys! Any idea what are those red patches on the sides of my face. I didn't even have any acne in that area.
This looks like a condition called acne rosacea
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve decided not to remove the honest review. Others want to know what your actual experience was so they don‚Äôt end up having the same one.
This actually just happened to me but on eBay (and the bribe wasn‚Äôt money but sending me a new item to replace the faulty one I received). It was sketch because they wanted me to change my review to a good one BEFORE sending me the new product, which might not have worked either. I say just let the truth hang right out there because what are they really going to do about it (besides waste your money)?
well i think that you deserve your money back, so maybe you could post from an anonymous yelp account just warning ppl not to go
I‚Äôd take the money, we broke. 
This sounds so dodgy. You definitely deserve the refund and I wouldn‚Äôt remove the yelp review. Also is there not someone you can report him officially to? Especially if he is prescribing without a licence. I‚Äôm in the UK so don‚Äôt really know how it works where you are but he would be      disciplined here and probably stopped from practising.  
Wtf you should report this dude to the authorities he should not be practicing without a license. What country are you in??
Well there are a few more things to try:

- Cutting our dairy 
- Benzoyl Peroxide Contact Therapy
- Epiduo
- Differin + antibiotic
- Epiduo + antibiotic
- Azelaic Acid
- Clindacymin + Differin
- Tazorac
- Retin A
- Isotretinoin

In order from mild treatment to nuclear haha
Currently using tretinoin 0.05%, and cetaphil gentle skin cleanser 
It looks like you have some hormonal acne. I would recommend the birth control pill. I take brand name yaz (generic won‚Äôt help as well as brand name for acne) and it has worked wonders on my chin acne. 
Also, try a silk pillow case and changing it every 2-3 days. 
I fuckin love your attitude and the fact that you‚Äôve got yourself in a quality comfortable position in life. Imma save this post for if acne ever gets me down.

Anyway, laser treatments are the new big thing. They are very promising. They completely restore texture after a few sessions.

My suggestion? Vbeam laser (pulsed dye laser). Effective, safe, might be costly but I promise you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Good luck!




Microneedling Radiofrequency :) works amazing for all types of acne scars . Talk  to your dermatologist . U need a minimum of three sessions once a month . If u have ice pick scars ask your dr about  a technique called TCA cross.. good luck üëç
Laser treatments is a thing, tho haven't tried them. Some also say dermarolling is good, you can do it at home but if you go to spa they can use longer needles. 
Idk how into skincare you are, but vitamin c, rice and snail mucin is good for scars. Bio-oil is nice too.
Congratulations!
What amazing progress! Keep it up and keep us posted!
Great! Thanks for posting your results and message of encouragement, because god knows us people in this particular sub can often use a dose of skintastic optimism
You have very nice routine! You're not over doing it at all, remember to patch test them slowly, so you can see do u get any bad reactions from he products. For example I've had rash from sunscreen and lots of CCs after using some specific products/brand. 
I see no reason why not to use oil together with the acne cream, but try it with oil or moisturizer to see which is better for your skin. 
You‚Äôve got a good start with a routine! I highly recommend the acne(dot)org regimen! It‚Äôs basically what you are already doing plus a Benzoyl Peroxide gel. You‚Äôd do your Cetaphil cleanser, wait 5 minutes, apply BP gel, wait 5 minutes, and lastly apply your moisturizer. It‚Äôs a very simple and effective regimen! 
Which moisturizer are you using? I would probably start incorporating some ‚Äúactives‚Äù. Have you tried azelaic Acid? It has been so helpful with my acne. Look up Melazepam on amazon! 
A couple quite commonly used (and easily found over the counter at the drugstore) treatments would be any benzoyl peroxide product (topical application, comes in different formulations, mild to moderate acne, kills acne bacteria, takes at least a month to show progress, only works while being consistently used, can dry skin out); salicylic acid (topical application, mild acne, comes in different formulations, unclogs pores/prevents pimples, mild acne, only works while being consistently used); retinol (topical application, comes in different formulations but Differin Gel is the only OTC retinol product approved for acne treatment, mild to moderate acne, chemical exfoliator to prevent pimples from forming, can get a prescription strength for more severe acne, MUST be diligent about using sunscreen always when using, can take a couple months before consistent progress is seen and acne may initially seem to worsen before getting better, can irritate skin, must be used consistently).

There are of course also a host of prescription acne treatments, especially for moderate to severe acne, but if you‚Äôd like to get good information on those I suggest visiting a dermatologist/doctor who can both suggest certain medications, prescribe them, and also monitor your progress. I would suggest first trying one of the over-the-counter treatments for a while... whichever one you discover your skin tolerates best. If it doesn‚Äôt do anything/enough after a month, try another kind of OTC acne treatment. If that one doesn‚Äôt do anything/enough, you may want to find a dermatologist in order to discuss prescriptions meds/in office procedures (because it‚Äôs not always about something you slather on your face).
Just adding my two cents but have you had your hormone levels checked? Even if it is considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù each person has their own normal levels. I dug into this for my own skin and had success in tackling it from a hormone perspective. Been on spiralactone and progesterone and it has done wonders. 
Just a different sugggestion, you might wanna try adding more moisturizing agents into your routine, maybe something like jojoba oil or hemp seed oil. This would allow your skin you stay hydrated and repair itself 
Your acne looks like my acne did. I used Cetaphil products for a long time before I experimented and learned my skin was irritated by cetyl/cetearyl alcohols that their products are laden with. Could be a starting point to change those products if that is all you are using. 
I have been thinking of trying Differin Gel, Glossier Solution, Pixi Glow Tonic or something by The Ordinary to help clear this up. does anyone have recommendations? 
Please go on accutane now is the best time and put non comedogenic sunscreen when going out
Please use sunscreen 
And vitamin c and zinc can interact, I hope those aren‚Äôt both lotions or serums 
Also, there are some way better options then vitamin E for acne scarring 
[removed]
Defending on your age and type of breakouts, I would say vitamin C would be better for fading minor scarring. The skincare addiction subreddit is amazing ... great product recommendations and advice 
You got this dude, do you use a moisturizer aswell?
think I'm gonna give that a go, nice results:D
You are really looking good. Well done!
I used ¬´Spotless deep cleansing daily face wash¬ª by Aco
Take a look at  those fuckin gains. Props üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
So no bread? I don't think I could do that :(
Nope, tried basically every ‚Äúnatural‚Äù solution and there is no easy, homemade, one or two product solution, BUT thankfully, there are lots of organic skin care brands out there that cater to people who don‚Äôt want a bunch of chemicals on their skin. 

Tea tree oil (diluted ALWAYS DILUTE ESSENTIAL OILS, I don‚Äôt care what the shifty pyramid scheme companies say!) helps for some but not most. 
Oil cleansing method works for a very very select few. 
Aloe helps with moisture and is a nice step to add to skincare routines but won‚Äôt do anything on its own.
Never use lemon juice or baking soda on your face, EVER. Strips your moisture barrier and damages your skin soooo bad.
Coconut oil on your face is an internet joke, people are telling you to use it to break you out and mess with you. It‚Äôs highly comedogenic and dries most people‚Äôs skin out because it‚Äôs a surfecant and doesn‚Äôt actually moisturize but keeps a film on your skin.
Daily turmeric supplements made a huge difference, it‚Äôs not a cure but it cleared me up significantly.
[removed]
Darn. I meant to link some NIH studies but r/acne isn‚Äôt a fan. Anyways, check out gugulipid and zinc. 
Just thought you should know that homeopathy is fake. It doesn't work for anything. The idea behind it is you take a substance that causes something, like acne or insomnia and use it to cure that thing. But, there's a catch, you take the substance and dilute it with water so much that there is no longer a single molecule of the substance left. Homeopathy is just water or in some cases sugar pills. Don't waste your money.
Nervous it‚Äôll spread bacteria around but kind of intrigued by the idea of cleaner pores than I‚Äôd have using my fingers! Or am I a sucker for buying this?

Also do you use regular cleanser on it, exfoliant, either?
Don‚Äôt use an exfoliating cleanser with it! I‚Äôve seen amazing results with silicone scrubbies (so much so that I upgraded to the Foreo Luna Mini 2). I put on my treatment products right after and the exfoliation helps my products absorb so nicely 
I have the exact same one and was using it with a regular cleanser. It is nice for exfoliation once a week but doesn't give the deepest clean ever. For $8 or whatever it costs it's fine
And I take doxycyline but I've been on that for ages and it's only just started clearing and I'm starting accutane in June because I've had acne for 5 years since I was 12 so unless it magically dissapears for good before then that's whats up
You shouldn't stop taking your antibiotics before the prospect/ your doctor says because then you'll "create" resistants.

See, here's the thing: antibiotics kill bacteria, if you take one dose you'll kill the weaker ones, another dose you'll kill the ones that are slightly stronger, and so goes on. Meaning that your last doses are targeting the stronger bacteria. If you cut off antibiotics prematurely, you are leaving the *stronger* bacteria on your skin. And moreover, you've just cleaned the other bacteria that were competing with the stronger ones for space, and the stronger bacteria will spread potentially creating stronger ones.

These will make it more difficult the next time to get rid of your acne-causing bacteria.

&nbsp;

So regarding how much time you have to be on Cefalexin, you should just take it as much time as your doctor tells you to; they will set a timing regarding the severity of your acne. Anyhow, you shouldn't be on antibiotics more than three subsequent months because that could really affect your natural biota.
Time to go on Accutane! 
Ok. 
So I‚Äôve been on them for 8 months. 
Go see a derm
It could be a cyst... i would definitely see a dermatologist. Don‚Äôt go to a regular doctor because they‚Äôll just tell you to go to a dermatologist. 
Funny you say that I have the EXACT same thing in the same spot and was just going to make a post about it 
Can your friend take a look at it?
For sure just try to keep it really, really clean to prevent infection. 
You may have something called keratosis pilaris. Look it up and compare. If you do have it, there isn‚Äôt really a cure since it‚Äôs genetic. But you can manage it. When you take a shower use an exfoliating cloth to scrub your arms, and use really good lotion right after. I would use gold bonds rough and bumpy.
I guess scrubbing is a bit of a strong word but you do want to exfoliate. But yes you don‚Äôt want to scrub your acne because it will break the skin and scar your face. But keratosis pilaris is caused by excess production of keratin and blocks the hair follicle causing the bumps and redness . You should look it up because though I have KP and manage it, I am by no means an expert. If you are unsure, go to your General practitioner or dermatologist. 
Lactic acid or Urea may help.
Is it on the back of your arms?
Eat less gluten 
I have to eat gluten free due to a disease and it does not help me with acne. Mine is hormonal and needs spironolactone
I'm on the leaky gut diet (basically an elimination diet including no dairy, grains/gluten, soy, sugar, legumes, night shades to name a few) my skin has been clearing up miraculously. It's only been a week and a half so I don't wanna get too excited yet. Since starting this my diet has been so much healthier at the same time. I'm only eating fish/meat and tons of veggies and a little fruit. I've been an acne sufferer for 13 years and have tried everything under the sun, so maybe diet is the real answer for me, I dunno!! You could have unknown food sensitivities that are triggering your acne also. I think it's worth a shot, nothing to lose
For me cutting out carbs worked. I was trying keto to lose weight and clear skin was a side effect. I eat moderate amount of dairy and it is not a problem for me. Get your vit D levels checked, if it is low your hormones will be imbalanced. Try getting more Omegas in your diet along with Vitamin supplements and see if it helps. 
Gluten free did nothing for my acne. Cutting dairy did. 
I‚Äôve been gluten and dairy free for a couple months now and nothing‚Äôs changed for me :(
Nars concealer breaks me out, so I'm right there with ya.
My sheer glow breaks me out. I don't understand how so many people love the foundation, my face hates it. 
I cut gluten and dairy from my diet recently as well! (3 month‚Äôs) But nothing really changed that much :/ 
Okay here's the thing. Sometimes acne and intestinal irritation is from Gluten, Dairy, High Sugar consumption, etc. Sometimes it's not. For you, this has worked, but it's not always the case for anyone who has cut it and nothing changed. But congrats though, glad you're skin is starting to clear.

Yes! Diet plays a huge role! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre making progress :)
Me too!! Yayyyyyy! I'm so excited to see how I look in a month 
IMHO, diet makes no significant differnce to skin. Don't pick at pimples- do not cause scarring- and in time things will get better because you are young. By how much your skin has improved in 7 days, it's obvious you have nice skin that is going through some shit. You'll be alright. It's possible to train ur skin by showering less and letting ur skin naturally take its course, but it's not a route most people believe in and many people would argue with me. You're gonna be alright
Taking accutane was the worst year of my life, yet it was probably the single best thing I've ever done to improve myself. I'd have oily, pimply skin if I didn't do the treatment, but instead, I have clear, dry skin that is perfectly moisturized with lotion. Mentally, I'll always be damaged from that year and struggle with suicidal thoughts. Still, I tried every cream and Rx in the USA and none of them were cures. Accutane was the only cure. Now, I get manageable acne like a normal person. A rare pimple every once in awhile. Take what you'd like from this. I'd never recommend accutane, but it was my only hope and it worked. I apologize if this sounds negative.

I'm curious as to why this is an acne issue and not a vegan issue? Are you vegan, or plant based? I could see someone just on a plant based diet considering consuming dairy, but if you're vegan then I don't think you'd want to eat the chocolate because it has milk in it, not because you're afraid of acne. 
Milk fat still has trace amounts of casein, but not lactose. Not sure which part of it causes your acne, but the important parts when dealing with acne and intolerances is casein, whey, and lactose.

Been on the Cerave, Stridex, Cerave trio for the past few months and only recently started getting SUPER inflamed zits on the tip of my cheek bone. 

Wondering if it's average for just 2-3 zits to be so red and light my face up so much. Is there ANYTHING I can do to get rid or reduce the redness? 

Also curious how long it takes you guys to completely lose a zit. Some of them will leave a red mark for 2-3 months for me and it feels like they never go away. I know I'm pretty pale, but not sure if that's really the cause. 

Takes a few weeks, but I just want to remind you that redness DOES get eliminated naturally by the human body. Scarring, on the other hand, does NOT. Therefore, you are blessed to have redness and no scars. You will be OK, given time.
if you are going to keep track of your supplements, what about keeping track of everything that you eat? 
insulin is implicated in acne.  what you eat affects insulin production.
that title‚Äôs my grindr bio
Differin? thas my best. need your skincare routine deets tho
Still attractive, acne or not. Just quit eating garbage. 
DIET
Stop wasting your time.. go on fucking accutane! You‚Äôll be hot.
BP always works for me. Idk your skin could be different.
I had pretty bad cystic acne and was prescribed Oxytetracyline. The acne has pretty much stopped but I‚Äôve got a lot of red scarring which looks horrible on my pale skin. I really want to be able to go outside without makeup on. How can I help the scarring fade?
I‚Äôm not a dermatologist but from the looks of it, I don‚Äôt think your acne scars are so bad. 
I recommend using Bio Oil. Sounds weird, I know, but I‚Äôve been using it for years and it somehow always does the job for me & it sometimes even works faster than the expensive serums I own. 
If you‚Äôre not a fan of putting oil on your face, try using The Ordinary‚Äôs Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% which prevents appearance of acne and melanin production. 
The process may be slow, but that‚Äôs why I also recommend getting a good micro needle/derma roller! It basically pokes tiny needles and confuses your skin to ‚Äúheal‚Äù so then it‚Äôll fix any uneven skin texture by producing more collagen. During the healing process, you can put on any acne/acne scar products on your skin so it‚Äôll soak up the products a lot better and hopefully speed up the healing process as well.

With stuff like this I like to put a good dab of moisturizer on it  (just a blob, I don‚Äôt even rub it in) and throw a bandaid on top of it. Do this as many times as it takes for the skin to soften... Let it come to as much of a head as it can until it basically pops just by applying a slight pressure. Don‚Äôt squeeze or press too hard. Wipe off any goo with a little rubbing alcohol and then add another dab of moisturizer or neosporin, add bandaid, then leave it alone completely for a few days. 
I use Pond‚Äôs cold cream with the blue lid. It‚Äôs pretty greasy by some people‚Äôs standards but it‚Äôs seriously hydrating. 
DHT Blocker? I‚Äôll have to look that one up.

Cystic acne ruined my life for 4 years! Reading your post literally made me cringe because it brought back horrible memories! I had to deal with so many of those. Almost looked like huge bee stings sometimes. I'm glad you're going to a dermatologist because in my experience that is the best advice I could give. Try not to pick at it. I hope the best for you because believe me when I say I know the pain.
saw palmetto causes hormonal imbalance because it increases testosterone. it's used to treat prostate issues like cancer so that should say a lot. 
From personal experience with saw palmetto and vitex, none of these worked for me. I had angry, hormonal, large, frequent cysts all over my face and attempted everything I could even think of and read about. I was absolutely desperate. 
Anything that targets hormones without being monitored is probably not a good idea, no matter how great people on the internet say it is. Saw Palmetto and Vitex caused worse acne for me, spearmint did absolutely nothing, primrose oil (and jojoba) broke me out.
Tbh, if you‚Äôre not moisturizing enough, you really need to invest in some good moisturizer/s first. If you‚Äôre eligible for accutane, that‚Äôs something worth looking into if you‚Äôve tried most antibiotics and topicals like I have. If that‚Äôs not a route you want to take, getting on birth control, trying another oral antibiotic (Bactrim, tetracycline, doxycycline), or spironolactone is worth a shot. Just be aware that you‚Äôll probably have a decent chance of becoming intolerant to antibiotics (also, BC and spiro if you‚Äôre a woman, obviously). 
Honestly, your situation probably needs medical intervention and a good skincare regimen, and most likely a holistic ‚Äúcure‚Äù is just wasting money. 
Maybe try researching a naturopath in your area. They can run tests and set up a plan with natural medicine and diet. I also recommend reading up on leaky gut, auto immune diet and GAPS and see if any of those things resonate with you. There are a ton of free resources for those online with guidelines for each. You could always try changing your diet for a month or so and see if you get any results. It cost nothing extra besides a little extra time and meal prep. I'm a huge believer of natural medicine and you can't always just throw antibiotics and chemicals at your body and expect it to fix the issue. Sometimes it creates more issues (like in your experience, and mine). I've recently had results with changing my diet, and was also having gut issues. I'm working on healing it and restoring good bacteria. (Was a moderate to heavy drinker and coffee drinker for years, and a dairy addict) I also have terrible PMS and primrose oil has helped alleviate my symptoms a bit when taken orally, which also helped my acne, but nothing too drastic. I'd take it from ovulation to when I started my period and then take a break from it until my next ovulation. I haven't tried the other herbs in question, though. 
I cut out carbs and sugar as part of keto diet and the change started at around 2 weeks in, then after 4 weeks no new ones came and around 6 weeks my cystic acne was a 100% gone. I have stayed on the diet and it has not returned.
I had no change in acne once I became vegan 
Studies have shown that trim milk in particular and a high sugar diet do have associations with more acne, however the effect takes months to measure so its unlikely that you'll have instant results (correct me if I'm wrong!). Sorry i don't have the studies to link because I'm on my phone but if you google scholar diet and acne you'll see that most studies measure dairy and sugar. Its worth a try though, a low sugar diet is good for everyone. I would personally keep a small amount of dairy though as it is a good easy source of calcium and other nutrients - perhaps do unsweetened natural yoghurt instead of icecream.

For my acne I found that what helped the most was being more gentle to my skin and using bland products - like CeraVe, neutrogena, cetaphil etc plus differin and benzyl peroxide. Getting enough sleep has also had a huge impact on my skin. 
I went full vegan last October, but out sugar and a refined foods. After a month or so it no acne, my cystic has been worse than before.  I don't know what else to do... 
instantly. but I didn‚Äôt stop any medications when I gave up certain foods, so you may experience a purge..?
Mirrors are the worst. Especially car mirrors. OH MY GOD THE CAR MIRRORS  
Same here!! Started when my acne was at its worst (two years ago or so) and I've been doing it ever since. Can't remember the last time I actually saw myself haha
I don‚Äôt look in the mirror unless I need to shave :/
Tbh try tretenoin and if that doesn‚Äôt work maybe accutane. Scarring is harder to fix than acne! Still looking good tho, you lucked out with bone structure! 
just keep up your routine, try a soothing toner with minimal ingredients, you can also try a moisturizer like cerave that‚Äôs has peptides and ceramides which keep your skin healthy so it can heal (like the acne and scarring) those are honestly the best things you can do for your skin. I‚Äôm not sure what doxie is, but benzoyl peroxide didn‚Äôt help my skin any. tretinoin has cleared my skin up though. 
Doxycycline its a antibiotic 
But thank you for the feedback and Ill definitely try that out 
Hey I just started on doxie like three weeks ago. From the looks of it, your pimples seem to have flattened out (if I'm correct). Mine did too/Is being doing so, but I do have red marks like yours. The doc recently prescribed me tretinoin and clindamycin gel to use as well because I still have new cystic acne forming..

What I'd suggest to reduce the redness is use Vitamin C serum. My scars have lightened up due to it. Just use it after your Cleanser. I'd suggest you start slow so mix it with your moisturizer. Hope this helps! 
COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch, 24 Patches 

Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera, 12 Fluid Ounce 

Desert Essence Bar Soap, Tea Tree Therapy, 5 Ounce 

I use the three products above and i havent gotten any breakouts. 
Make sure you use non-oily sunscreen. Those pimples are very prone to hyperpigmentation (turning brown under sunlight)
I don‚Äôt have any products to recommend you but I would suggest maybe try cutting some dairy out of your diet & seeing if there‚Äôs at least a lil difference with that?
it's hormonal. u need to take vitamin a and d supplements like cod liver oil. i would also take zinc supplements and probiotic supplements. that's all it takes. don't ever go on any of these medication the side effects aren't worth it they don't even know how it really works. don't trust stuff like that ever. also all these products u use i wouldn't ever use on myself. i wouldn't recommend them to anyone without acne either. it's bad indigents and it's never going to get rid of ur acne bc it's internal. acne is ur body scream for help literally and u shouldn't ignore it. u have to heal it internally. instead i would advise to a couple of products that have ingredients which are actually helpful. for example these products for moisturizing and hydrating. the ordinary natural moisturizing factors ha. niod multi molecular hyaluronic complex mmhc2. dr jart ceramidin cream. i would also get the ordinary rose hip oil as a natural antidoxant. stick to basics. i would also research what natural stuff could work for u so you could use it as a mask for example tumeric and mixing in stuff like green tea etc. it's really cheap and makes a huge difference if ur consistent. not to mention it's all natural. i myself didn't believe that using natural stuff makes such a difference. but honestly i am serious and hope you will buy the supplements bc they play the most important role and function from the inside. this stuff is cosmetic and helps w the appearance of ur acne. ur skin barrier is destroyed and u shouldn't be stripping it off more stuff. instead just concentrate on hydration and feeding ur skin natural stuff. and for the future i would recommend u to check on cosdna how irritant ingredients in a product are and avoid them completely. 
Watch your diet. No one likes doing that but you have to decide if getting a clear skin is your goal or not.

Dairy, high gi food will do. Learn to cook your own stuff 

Product recommendation: you need something that has salycilic acid in there. And to address scaring you need vitamin c and retinoids 

The ordinary has all that and it's pretty cheap 
Accutane would probably be great for you!
Accutane? Not sure if doxie is the same thing

Insulin reistance causes over consumption of carbs to be spike insulin. But fructose and saturated fat cause insulin resistance. Why do high rice eating populations in asian not have IR problems? Cause they eat low saturated fat. Eating loe carbs and High fat avoids the issues of blood sugar spikes, but is the root cause for the IR itself
regular teenager diet? i bet that includes snacks with lots of sugars. Sugars work differently for everyone in terms of acne. I suggest cutting off all snacks with more than 5 grams of sugar and eating more greens instead. What i do is buy spring mix that comes in the box or bag and putting a handfull of it into a blender and then chugging it. Dont think about the taste and think about what good it is for your body. Decent amount of greens for the day in a few seconds. It has changed my life. 
Regular teenage diet? Aka pizza, burgers, and coke? That's your problem. 
Add SPF to your routine!

Cut Dairy and Sugar and Trans Fats, reduce Saturated Fat. Do this for 2 weeks and see what happens
What acne meds have you been on? I've been on Sprio for a month and my face is so horrible right now. 

I've actually been considering trying it too and wondering how soon results can be seen or felt as well... if they require a lot of them, then i have to evaluate my budget and shop around :/
I have been usinf Benzefoam Ultra on my chest and back, and it has worked wonders. You have to get a prescription, but it‚Äôs totally worth it. It‚Äôs the ONLY thing that has ever worked for me!
Yikes! I say treat your skin very gently the next 2-3 days per another commenters suggestion. And if you haven‚Äôt already I‚Äôd advise to buy a nice gentle exfoliating cleanser and start using that 1-2x week to help get rid of the bumpiness. 
I found that the best way to deal with acne is to treat it as what it is: injury on your skin. Keep away from those things that just damage your skin. Drink a LOT of water, stop washing your face so much. If you fell down and scratched your knee you wouldn‚Äôt be compulsively washing it multiple times a day, right? So don‚Äôt do that to your face. Leave it the f alone and that‚Äôs better than 99% of things people tell you to do. Don‚Äôt get close to anything that has artificial perfumes with a ten foot pole. Just wash your face with water, and just ONCE a day. Then *gently* pat it dry. Remember, treat it like you would a wound. If you feel like you need a little more than just water, use a little bit of raw honey to wash your face. Then cut out inflammatory things from your diet: dairy, sugar,  fried foods, and if you eat a lot of gluten, cut back on that a little bit. Focus on natural, Whole Foods. Veggies, eggs, meat.
Also, take note if other parts of your skin, like your elbows or legs. If they are dry, there‚Äôs a huge chance the skin on your face is also dehydrated, and that‚Äôs the reason it gets oily, and you don‚Äôt actually have oily or combination skin. If so, I recommend using some type of moisturizer once a day. A natural one, preferably, like grape seed oil, shea butter or mango butter.
You never derma roll if you even have one zit.   The bacteria spread and that is what happened to you.   Clear up your acne first then you can do it again.  
Get some hydrocolloid bandages!! It‚Äôll suck the gunk out and heal it ASAP 
Oh god I got the same thing right now I hate it
same but mine has no whitehead, it‚Äôs keloid for mine.
Go get yourself a tube of Icthammol Ointment from CVS. Put some on the spot and then a circular bandaid over it over night. In the morning it should have been drawn to a head. Then pop it however way you see fit. 
Could possibly be an ingrown hair
Cheapest would be Turmeric (from the spice aisle, ignore those stupidly overpriced pills.) Mix with a bit of water and apply the resulting paste liberally till the pimple is completely covered. 

Do this every day, I guarantee within a week or less the gunk will be brought to the surface and, eventually, will pop itself.

Turmeric worked wonders for me, particularly for bigger pimples/cysts. It‚Äôs  a heck of a lot cheaper than other treatments too, and as an added bonus it has a bunch of other health benefits and can be used in cooking as a spice.
If its been there for months it's an ingrown hair.  Clean it with warm water and a facial soap, and GENTLY squeeze it with two Q tips from either side? 
Honestly it's gotta be sub 2% imo. My acne was really really bad and with a combination of Accutane, antibiotics, steroids and steroid injections it cleared up. I also believe over the counter products are not much use for anything other than mild acne and In some cases, like my own some of the chemicals were actually making it worse.
My acne has never been AWFUL by my skin in general sucks. It‚Äôs crazy dry, always sore, and acne definitely wasn‚Äôt light. I tried a ton of stuff and only in past month have I found something that works brilliantly. I‚Äôm talking I noticed a remarkable change in two uses. I had tried every pill, cream, antibiotic etc I could think of. I had injections. Accutane was next up but I had reservations and discovered my miracle product(azelaic acid) by complete random chance. I think there‚Äôs something for most people, it just takes time to find. I never thought I would have almost totally clear skin that didn‚Äôt hurt or flake, but I do.
went to a water only regimen after 10+ years acne and its working i got a few zits in the mean time but other than that its done a pretty good job clearing my face and definitely don't scrub your face when you use water just splash it on your face but yeah i haven't been getting acne pretty much at all anymore and my scars are lightening 
almost all people can get clear skin, but you have to address diet 
I always used to get acne there and I thought it was related to hormones (menstrual cycle) or a reaction to dairy (which would get worse around the time of my period). I‚Äôve been slowly getting rid of dairy from my diet and the acne seems to be getting better. I‚Äôm not sure how much of that is coincidence though. 
I broke out in the exact same spot for years.. I‚Äôm fairly certain it was hormonal, and eventually had to go on accutane. Spiro also worked very well, but I wanted a more ‚Äòpermanent‚Äô solution. 
Toothpaste doesn‚Äôt touch those parts right? If it does, it might be the sodium lauryl sulfate.
Acne here for me is 100% related to dairy and sugar. I‚Äôve cleared it up completely by cutting those things out 100%, but when I have something with dairy or sugar, they start to come back. I used to get really bad cystic ones here. Took so many years to figure it out!  Now if I could only get rid of the acne on other parts of my face....
exact problem as me.  i drool too when i sleep aswell. :/
I get acne exclusively in this area. Nothing really worked until I used spironolactone! I do notice that I have been breaking out after eating half of the cheesecake and drinking milk. There is some correlation between sodium lauryl sulfate (a foaming agent found in toothpastes, soaps, etc) and acne breakouts. Perhaps look into toothpaste and face wash without this? 
Never thought this could be about toothpaste! Now I‚Äôm looking into this!

So I have acne almost exclusively there as well. It was hormonal for me, a good contraceptive plus Spironolactone plus strict dairy free diet seemed to work wonders as long as I kept up with all three.

Also, not sure if you get little hairs there that you pluck. I had an outrageous outbreak about a week ago, shortly after getting my chin hairs threaded off. Any chance you‚Äôve been picking or plucking that area?

Good luck! 
I've had that same problem for a year or so. I recently went to the dermatologist and it's going away.

Routine: wash with 10% bp morning and night
Apply clindamyicin phosphate after bp wash
Minocycline pill 1x day

It wasn't super effective, so she incorporated Trentinoin at night instead of clindamyicin, and my face honestly hasn't looked this good in years.

If otc products aren't working ,see a dermatologist
I had terrible acne there too. I went on a sugar+dairy+gluten detox for weeks to see if that was the problem. Nope, still had 'em. I tried perscribed and over the counter topical treatments, nothing. Tried antibiotics too. Nothing helped me other than accutane. I even had like 5 blood tests to rule out hormones and deficiencies. My dermatologist was flabbergasted that she couldn't find the cause. She just kinda wrote me off as a weird case. Accutane solved it completely though. 
That's actually more regularly a hormonal area (Look at my post history to this sub - mine were in the same area). 

Do you take birth control? If not, I highly recommend it. I take Tri-sprintec and have great results (in post history).

How much dairy, soy, and whey protein do you consume? Especially if you consume a lot, cut it out for 30 days and see how your skin reacts.
No dairy No sugar no processed food take birth control take evening PRIMROSE oil.  I had mine for years until 3 months of this discipline.
Go on an elimination diet if you haven‚Äôt yet
your skin looks pretty clear, but for the occasional pimple try a spot treatment like the clean and clear acne spot treatment
10% Benzoyl peroxide has helped my acne a lot, much more than salicylic acid. It dries my skin out though, so I use it once every other day or every 3 days. Or I'll use it everyday as a spot treatment. I got it at Target and it was around $4. 
I was trying to decipher from your post, but do you usually get breakouts of any kind on your forehead? AHA‚Äôs, BHA‚Äôs, retinoids, and other acids can all cause an initial purging period. Purging is usually located in places where you would typically break out, and if it‚Äôs a place you don‚Äôt typically get breakouts then it‚Äôs likely just a breakout due to the product itself. But to answer your initial question, yes, a lot of people purge with AHA‚Äôs :) 
Not sure why I got down voted for asking about current routine. It‚Äôs relevant since acids can cause purging if you‚Äôre not used to using them and I was curious if OP was already utilizing one in their routine.
I feel stupid but can someone explain (in easy words) the difference between an AHA and BHA? 
What does the rest of your routine look like? 
Hello, first of all, if your family is picking on you over your skin, I highly recommend you say something to them about how it makes you feel. It's hard enough being stressed out about your skin. Having you family add to that stress is no good.

Next, one year is not "too short" to see a dermatologist. Even three months isn't too short. If your skin is rapidly breaking out and cannot be controlled, you have a valid reason to see a derm.

Regarding pricing, I'm not too sure, as I'm from the US. I would recommend just calling an office and asking. I know with social anxiety, it may be hard to get on the phone, so maybe someone can help you. If not, just think about how much you stand to gain when you finally get on the phone and make that call. 

When you see a dermatologist, be prepared with some questions that you may want to ask them. Like treating body acne vs. face acne. They will more than likely prescribe a topical treatment that you will apply after washing your face. In other cases, they may provide an oral antibiotic along with the topical cream. I took Minocycline oral antibiotics and used Epiduo cream once a day and my skin cleared up very quickly and stayed clear. I went from taking the antibiotic twice a day to once every other day and eventually not at all, and just using the topical to keep things controlled (this was after trying a ton of other things, everyone is different, so what worked for me may not be best for you, your derm can determine that).

Lastly, I recommend investing in a gentle glycolic acid cleanser for your face. It will help with pigmentation caused by acne. I have used it for a long time, so my skin has built a tolerance to it. But I recommend starting at a lower percentage, maybe 5%. You can ask your derm about this too. Also ask about a moisturizer.

Good luck, and remember, you're not alone. Acne can very debilitating. I remember waking up and seeing my face and not even wanting to go to school because I was so embarrassed. But don't worry, you are your own worst critic. So what may seem horrible to you, others probably won't even notice.
I still take antibiotics, and I shower every morning. When I wash it everyday with tea tree oil face wash or something I get more break outs, so I don‚Äôt do anything like that anymore. Of course I get a small bump here and there, but this spot on the right side of my forehead is really a mess. The red spots are not pimples, I guess they‚Äôll fade away with time.

I eat healthy, everyday 2 pieces of fruit, always some vegetables, I don‚Äôt really work out. I feel so insecure about this, it never goes away... I‚Äôm so done at the moment... Please give me some advice
Have you checked everything out on the acne Einstein website/blog. Acne can be a signal of something wrong inside of us. For me it is gut health, but acne causes are different for every person. Good luck. 
Be sure to use sunscreen everyday. Go to a dermatologist and get acne medication. Sometimes that's all you can do. That's the only thing that's helped my acne significantly. 10% benzoyl peroxide also helps, but it dries out my skin so I don't use it that much. 
Even if you eat a good amount of fruit and veg, you should still watch your sugar and dairy intake. Many people find that cutting out dairy as much as possible helps their skin. Other than your diet, acne could also be caused by stress, dehydration, or lack of sleep.
your skin looks very worn and thin do you scrub pretty firm when you wash or is it a light contact?
How long have you been on antibiotics? 
it's helps fade them & I personally just used an actually plant , I shaved the rough outer edge off & threw the gewey inner part inside a blender until it was a gewey liquid that you can apply 
It helps, and I love it as a daily moisturizer. I use the Holika Holika Aloe Vera Gel but any without alcohol is good.
Any products with Vitamin C or Niacinamide. Also wear sunscreen so they don‚Äôt get worse.
Im very green about skin care - Get some organic Aloe from Lilly of the Valley and slather it on thick twice a day on clean skin after toning morning and night. Let it fully absorb before you put on any other products. Its a wonder for post acne redness and inflammation. Plus a whole bunch of other good stuff. Keep it in the fridge too. 
Rose hip seed oil also works wonders in repairing damaged skin and lightening dark spots. Apply it on a clean face at night before bed and wash it off in the morning. 
They will go away in time. But for now, you can use Thayer‚Äôs rose toner and maybe Paula‚Äôs choice BHA.
I‚Äôve been using rose hip seed oil and it‚Äôs been working for me 
Skinlex niacinamide serum. I‚Äôm serious. It has an ingredient in it called n-acetyl glucosamine, which helps niacinamide work ever better in its dark spot fading properties. It‚Äôs friggin‚Äô gold. You can find it on eBay.

For dark marks introducing actives would be your best bet. I agree that you don't need to use that physical exfoliator everyday, switching to a gentle cleanser and adding in an aha like glycolic acid would help with discoloration. Vitamin C is also great for dark marks! Try using the cetaphil cleanser every time you wash, using the glycolic acid and vitamin c serum in rotation and introduce them slowly and one at a time.
Current routine:
First aid beauty polish exfoliator
First aid beauty ultra repair cream
Lush tea tree toner
Occasionally i would use a glam glow or faceshop face mask, the cetaphil hydrating cleanser and neutragena night calming cleansing wipes if I apply makeup
Roaccutane 
Please don't exfoliate every day. There is no need. 
So I clicked the picture on left on 25th January 2018 and on right is my picture I clicked today. And though you can say my skin is far from good, I am very happy with the progress I have made. Acne. Can really take a toll on your confidence, but I want you to know, it's possible to control it and when you do start seeing change you'll feel great. Don't lose hope. Also very very important, stay hydrated!

Skin care routine:

Morning:
Neutrogena extra gentle face cleanser
Neutrogena combination skin moisturizer
Neutrogena spf 50 sun block (very important) 


I also apply clindamycin phosphate gel if I'm breaking out, usually twice a day (it's just an antibiotic topical gel but it worked wonders on me)

Night:
Cleanse
Neutrogena fine fairness brightening serum
Moisturize

Once a week I use the neutrogena face scrub. Also a honey and lemon mask, 2-3 times a week. 

Any suggestions? 



amazing progress!!! 
From 25 jan?? That's so fast!! Jealous :(
This is absolutely great! Congrats on such an amazing progress omg
Your skin looks good! And the progress you‚Äôve made is phenomenal! 
Nice! Love your very minimal routine 
How much water do you think you drink a day? 
I‚Äôd get rid of the people who are making fun of you. 

Your blackheads are very mild, and I agree with the first comment on working to minimize them. 

And seriously, you need better friends if they are making fun of something that‚Äôs out of your control. 
Try clay masks + aha/bha. Works even better if you have proper skincare routine too. 
I recommend Stridex wipes (with the red label) to get rid of them. It says you can use them once or twice a day, but I recommend 2-3 times a week.
There is also a difference between blackheads and sebacious filaments on your nose (which everyone has). If you squeeze them too much or try to dry them out too much your skin will overcompensate by producing more oil and potentially making matters worse. Don't overdue it with masks and such

The only BC that helped my acne was Diane-35, it kept my skin super clear from age 14 to 23. Then I had a doctor who freaked me out about the side effects of being on that specific one for extended periods of time so I went off it and my skin has never been the same. After a couple years of no contraceptive I tried Alesse, Yaz, and Ortho Tri Cyclen and none of them worked. If I were to go back on one I‚Äôd definitely give Diane-35 another go. 
I‚Äôve tried Yaz, Diane-35 and another one I can‚Äôt remember, but they never helped until I was put on the low oestrogen pill called Gedarel 20. I noticed IMMEDIATE results. On day 2 I noticed I was getting no new spots and I had severe cystic acne before. By the end of week one it was just hyperpigmentation left. I‚Äôve been 95% clear for a year and a half now. 
I‚Äôve been on a generic version of Yaz (Drospirenone-Ethinyl Estradiol) for almost a year. 
the first few months were horrible, as I probably had 5-7 angry red cystic pimples on my face at all times. 
nowadays, my skin is so much less oily than it was, and I maybe get a few pimples each month. (although I have cut back on dairy a bit, and that has helped clear me up, too.) 
I'm on ortho cyclen the medium dose and it did wonders! I had cystic acne on my chest back and face. I got stared at in public it was so bad. My skin is so much better now. 
Ortho Cyclen was always great for my acne and overall well-being. It helped my skin immensely, but I still needed Rx topicals to get it clear. Yasmin, on the other hand, completely eradicated my acne.... but it made me into an absolute crazy person (which is strange because I have PCOS and since it was helping my acne and I had no pain from ovarian cysts anymore so I would think it wouldn‚Äôt affect me like that). I also developed melasma and it continued to get worse, despite wearing sunscreen SPF everyday rain or shine. I never had melasma and have been on and off birth control pills since I was 13, and also had been pregnant before. Strange. But I took it for about 8 months and my family and I couldn‚Äôt take my anger & mood swings so I went off of it after having an emotional breakdown. It also made my anxiety worse (I have panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder). Just wanted to give you my experience. When I go back on birth control, it will be Ortho Cyclen! 
BEYAZ 
I was on trilegest fe from 16 until about 26. I stopped because i moved and lost insurance and needed a new obgyn but couldn‚Äôt find one. I finally said enough and wanted to try something that worked better to accompany my spironolactone prescription (1 month on it so far), so i saw a doctor last minute via doctorondemand online and got a prescription for Yaz bc i know it worked for my sister‚Äôs acne. I think i have pcos so i heard it also helps that too, so i‚Äôll let you know as it goes. But the beyaz/yaz types helped many people I know while my trilegest did didly squat 
Not a pill but Nuvaring really helped cystic chin acne after the first month or so. Used in conjunction with Spironolactone. Unfortunately had to drop the Nuvaring because of mood swings and it really lowered my sex drive - but lots of my friends still use it as their preferred BC.
I‚Äôve been on Gianvi for 6 years and it has made a huge difference. It‚Äôs pretty much cleared up my acne except for the occasional pimple (6 years ago my acne was severe and not just face acne) I refuse to switch off of it. I haven‚Äôt had any side effects except for super short and light periods. I would definitely recommend it! 
Oh boy, 

You definitely don't have combination, oily, nor dry skin. By the sounds of it, you have dehydrated skin. You take medicine which dries out your face, you cleanse multiple times a day, and you don't moisturize. For the love of God man, hydrate your skin!!

Your face is getting oily throughout the day to compensate for who thirsty it is, and drinking more water and moisturizing at least 2x a day will do wonders.

As for the hyperpigmentation: wear sunscreen (at least 50spf) every single day, and use a light chemical exfoliate about 2 times a week (NEVER scrub your face). I have much worse red marks than you and I know it sucks, but time and patience is the most important part. 

Hope that helps! 
I‚Äôve thought of this too and have also been on 2 rounds of accutane, I feel like focus is more on cures rather than on the actual causes in the first place. Maybe because if we all knew what caused it we could prevent acne but then skincare brands and pharmaceutical companies would lose so much money. But then again it can also be a different cause for everyone

Some say it's diet (sugars, saturated fats, and dairy).
Sometimes it's hormonal (definitely this in my case).
I've heard people ask if I'm "stressed out" seeing that I'm broken out now. 

It could even be environment! Point is, no one knows because it varies so much person to person. 
Loren Cordain did a good job in finding the root cause of acne.  Not many people care.

I've dealt with chest/back acne for a while now. About three years ago, I decided to get serious and try to fix it. That's when I learned that some of the "zits" I had wouldn't go away. In time, I learned they were actually sebaceous cysts. Now I want to finally get rid of them, because they look awful. I've had them this long, so I don't think they're going to go away on their own. At this point, is surgery removal my only option? And how would that work? 

(also, they look worse than the camera shows.)
It‚Äôs best not to use retinol products in the day time as they rapidly break down when exposed to the sun. If you want to keep using it, you could probably just use it at night and it would be fine because it‚Äôs much less potent than tretinoin. But if you have a lot of irritation/ redness from the tretinoin it would probably be better to back off and not use it at the same time as the tretinoin. 
Are your pillow cases clean? Maybe you sleep on that side of your face and it causes acne?
I've found that one side of my face breaks out sometimes when I rest my face in my hands for a while (like when I'm in class or watching a movie). That, and not changing my pillow cases often enough.
Extra info: To clean my face I use Cetaphil oily skin cleanser 2/3 times a week, and in the morning i put on aloe vera gel + suncare lotion and only aloe vera gel at night. I've used tea tree oil before, and benzoyl peroxide gel 5% for a week or 2, but i didn't see much difference so i stopped using it. My skin is an oily type. 
[removed]
I've used tretonin and micro retinal and and lush grease lighting and stridex and benzoyl peroxide and salycilic acid facewash and nothing helps. The pores react to absolutely nothing but the acne does get better when I wash it frequently. 
Have you tried dermarolling?
Once I was able to get my acne under control, I went for chemical peels to help unclog pores while tightening them too, as well as help fade my annoying acne scars. My dermatologist charges me $125 for one per month. Look into getting one & stay consistent with them. They work great!
I could be totally wrong, but maybe do some research to see if a hydrocolloid bandage would help? I know they only work when there's an opening, so not sure if that would help you. 
I use both! I take the pills after a meal in the am and in the pm (not sure my dosage, too lazy to get off the couch). They don‚Äôt lie when they say it can give you an upset stomach. If I eat or have a glass of milk I‚Äôm ok. Tertinoin I use at night with benzoyl peroxide. I also use a moisturizer to help the dryness. If you get really dry use it every other day or every two days. ü§ì
You will definitely need sunscreen
Tbh your skin is beautiful, I‚Äôd kill for that skin.
Closed comedones, there are many products you can use. I use the buffering lotion from Mario Badescu and it works great!
My dermatologist prescribed me RetinA for my closed comedones and it worked like a charm.  
If you can't get a prescription for anything I've found that AHA's work really well on cc's! Try introducing a glycolic acid.
I have never had a dermatologist help me with any degree of success. I‚Äôve seen plenty.
Totally agree. It took me way too long to get to my dermatologist and once I did he was able to work with me and figure out what worked best for my skin. My acne has cleared up so well and it‚Äôs been pretty inexpensive and low maintenance . I wish I had gone sooner! 
I've never gotten as far as a dermatologist. My GP (I live in the UK) would need to refer me, and the ones I've seen think it's no problem. I've tried lymecycline, erithrymicin and zinc. Benzoyl peroxide. None of it worked.

Still have acne, and I'd still have to go through a GP to get to a dermatologist, unless I pay privately which I can't afford to do. 
Derms are useless when it comes to acne. Just my 2 cents. But I'm glad it worked for you. 
Probably a bit of razor burn causing irritation, clean/change your razor head and be more gentle. Make sure you're changing your pillow cases too 
It seems pretty mild to me... Perhaps it's a bit on the moderate side. 

As for the acne, a good skincare routine will help you get rid of it. 

The scarring can be treated in different ways but I wouldn't do anything with it until you're acne-free because most treatments meant for scarring are rather harsh on the skin. Check out this sub's FAQ if you have some questions, or you could ask me directly as well, even though I'm not an expert. 
thank you so much! i will try and get all these and start a new regimen and let you know how it works out! i was wondering if you also have any tips for body acne and for how to stop picking? :-) thanks again 
Look at your diet first.. you could have a food intolerance. I would do an elimination diet if I were you. I think you should do this before using products on your skin.. products can bring more imbalance and can be harsh on your skin. If it does help, it may only be a bandaid for the real source of the problem. If you eat processed foods definitely cut them out. Same with dairy and sugar. 
I'd try some benozyl peroxide on it - ita very drying though, so make sure to moisturise. Idk where you are, but in the UK you can buy it over the counter in pharmacists.
Get an alpha hydroxy acid like glycolic or lactic acid for that. 
Is it itchy at all/not responding to acne treatments? Try looking into fungal acne and see if some of your symptoms match up. If you're not sure try treating it as fungal for a few days and seeing if it clears up, an antifungal cream like lotrimin ultra would help most of it within a few days if it is and if not no harm done!
you could put neosporin on them at night before you go to bed and that should help heal it and prevent scarring 
When I have a scab, I usually use a liberal amount of oil on top of it (like almond oil or jojoba) and let it sit and kind of soak in, then reapply as needed. Just be careful not to pick at it anymore and it should heal and naturally come off within a couple days if not sooner. 

Edit: I forgot I used to use the cetaphil moisturizer the same way, I‚Äôd put a dot on the scab overnight and it helped it heal! 
One round of Accutane was the only thing that worked for me. It was 20 years ago and the acne never came back, aside from the very odd spot here or there.
Minocyclen worked for me but I had to go off of it because of a rare side effect. That won't happen to you, trust me, but watch out for yeast infections. That's a really common side effect. 

You'll probably get a purge with Retin-A, just remind yourself that it has to get worse before it gets better because you're increasing cell turnover and bringing all your acne to the surface. Be gentle and moisturize!
I use Retin A . I mix it 1-1 with my lotion before I put it on my face (at night). My dermatologist recommended this because on its own it dries my skin out. It has definitely made a difference in my acne like nothing else before.
I tried minocyclin, didn‚Äôt do anything to improve my acne. I did have some trouble with yeast infections a couple of times.
My doctor had me do 25 for 2 weeks and then 50mg thereafter. I‚Äôm now on 100 but I think I got the best bang for my dose at 50 (some improvement for me moving to 100 but not much). I have no significant side effects except for a little breast tenderness that went away quickly. That said I‚Äôm a young healthy person who generally isn‚Äôt that sensitive to medication side effects. Don‚Äôt be changing your dose without your doctor weighing in though - spiro interacts with some other medicines and your doctor might have a reason for choosing a specific dose for you. 
I personally don‚Äôt remember what dose i started out on (I used to take 2 pills a day, I now take 3) so this probably won‚Äôt help a whole bunch, but i will say.. be patient. spironlactone was the only thing that helped me and my 6+ years of dealing with acne but it didn‚Äôt kick in until a good 5/6 months. The first 3 months i saw improvements in my skin but no quick fix. I can now say I barely break out just trying to get rid of scarring but I wish you the best!


Also! quick edit. birth control has always played a huge factor into my acne ‚Äî it has helped a ton. idk if you can get your hands on it or want to try it, but definitely talk it over with your doctor.
What does your skincare routine look like? 
Dermarolling fixed my old chicken pox scars.
Chemical peels! SERIOUSLY. TCA, salicylic, and glycolic acid peels have really helped my skin.
No no! I definitely recommend doing your research and finding an esthetician or doctor who does them, never do any chemical peels at home.. ALOT OF THINGS CAN GO WRONG. 

I do Dermarolling and glycolic acid peels I‚Äôll do if I do a peel I wait to derma roll till my skin is completely healed! When I Dermaroll I normally do it once a week i choose Wednesday nights I clean my face pay it dry then pat witch hazel on my skin then roll! After I put vitamin c serum and go to sleep sometimes I do some aloe Vera along with the vitamin c serum.. my skin gets super red! And sometimes bleeds‚Äù I use a 0.5m roller that I bought online at owndoc I did a lot of research on dermarollers and this is what I found to be the best quality for price‚Äùby the next day lost of my redness is gone and my face is pretty plump.. for more pitted scars I‚Äôve read you would use 1.0m I‚Äôm a huge wimp and haven‚Äôt made it to that size yet.. when I do the glycolic acid peel I wash my face then use rubbing alcohol to clean all the oil off then apply a few layers of the glycolic acid I leave it anywhere from 5-10 minutes then neutralize it and gently splash water on my face till it‚Äôs clean then pat dry and tone with the WH and use VCserum and jojoba oil or aloe.. I normally don‚Äôt peel but every once in awhile I‚Äôll have a light peel.. this leave me looking like a glowing star haha and super polished.. I‚Äôve noticed a huge difference in pigmentation and pores. I use 40% glycolic and bought it on amazon it‚Äôs brand is skin obsession and I‚Äôve been using that brand for years. 
For me exfoliating helped a lot (aha/bha) and they're actually quite save since they don't sell super strong ones at stores (idk about USA etc but normally they're like 5% to idk 10%? Any stronger you need to be careful imo) and using sunscreen. :) Check out a blog called "simple skincare science"
I'd advice your friend to have a good skincare routine, oily skin needs moisturizing too. Ask him to check out a blog called "simple skincare science" for starters. Some say that peppermint is really good for acne. Rooibos is also good, green tea is super healthy too. Also vitamin a and e, you can get a lot e from almonds. Hope this helps
Edit: Vlogger Liah Yoo has great videos about this subject
I spent way too many years trying to fix up my super oily skin buy buying strong cleansing products. It has begun to clear up for the first time in my entire life since I switched to milder, more natural products + used toner and moisturiser everyday (seriously cannot stress moisturiser enough!!!). 
I‚Äôm not sure where you are from, but I use an organic Australian brand called ‚ÄúSukin‚Äù for my toner and cleanser. 
They have a face scrub but I have stopped using face scrubs because that damaged my skin. 
Also, calamine lotion as a face mask before I go to bed, it‚Äôs cheap and it reduces redness. 
Omg yes when I switched to natural products, my skin cleared up so fast 

All of these products are from LUSH btw:

Cleanser: Herbalism 

Toner: Tea tree water 

Spot treatment: Grease lighting 

Moisturizer: I use Celestial, but if he has the extra $$ I recommend Vanishing Cream (helps with scarring too)

Face mask: Ask for samples of Catastrophe Cosmetic and Cosmetic Warrior. See which one you like best. I personally use Catastrophe Cosmetic every other day. 

Stay on full course of accutane prescribed by doctor, there are some occasions when skin clears up only by the very end of the course 
I don‚Äôt know what scrubs and creams you tried but usually they make things worse.
I went down that same road, including the elimination diet and although staying away from dairy helped me, my skin never cleared up.
I suggest using a neutral ph cleanser (I like Cerave) with lukewarm water to wash gently. No abrasive exfoliating, ever (but chemical exfoliant can work well).
Pat skin dry / air dry, then apply one or more serums (maybe some vitamin C and/or niacinamide / azelaic acid)
Then your non-comedogenic moisturizer (I like Cerave in a tub; I used Nivea cream for a while some years ago but it didn‚Äôt agree with my skin).
Do this every night. In the morning, do the same but you can skip the serums if you like (although vitamin C has protective properties). In the AM, always use SPF. Again, must be non-comedogenic. Use the sidebar in this sub to find one you like. It‚Äôs a bit of trial and error. I‚Äôm still looking for my favourite.
Ask your dermatologist for Retin-A. That‚Äôs working well for me. I put it on after the moisturizer.
There‚Äôs a lot more you can try, and as always, patch test and don‚Äôt add all new things to your routine at once.
Also, your diet is excellent but how is your supplementation? I‚Äôd at least add some fish oils if your dietary fish is farmed. Some people also swear by Zinc, but I haven‚Äôt tried it yet. 
I wish your moisture barrier and beautiful skin a speedy recovery!
May just possibly be hormonal acne. What worked for me was routine, I purchased one of those Clarisonic Mia 2 brushes ( a little costly) and use that to wash my face twice a day with a facial cleanser of your choice. It helped reduce my pore size and give my skin an overall better look. 

I'll usually put some Clearogen 3% Sulfur Acne Lotion afterwards which is supposed to help with cystic acne and the likes. I found this product after being recommended it by a dermatologist and it has worked wonders. Keep it simple, and the most important thing is routine. If your face ends up getting too dry, take a break from the clearogen for a bit but I'm able to wash my face twice daily (once in the morning, once at night) and have seen visual improvements in the scarring on my face as well as overall acne. While rather light, I'd recommend the COSRX Snail 92 moisturizer/cream to reduce redness and keep your skin taut.

I went through a slew of products and found this to work the best for me. I struggled with cystic acne for a handful of years and the routinely washing my face twice a day along with clearogen was the only thing to subside it.

I was able to buy these products out of pocket no problem, if the cost of that mia brush is too high, I'm certain there must be alternatives out there. Hope this helps you even a little.
My skin didn‚Äôt clear up until after I was done with an 8 month course. For some people that‚Äôs just how it works. 

Your diet seems pretty lean. Some studies suggest that a higher fat diet helps maximize the benefits of the overload of vitamin A that is accutane. You could try make sure that the fat you do eat like eggs,  or even a couple of spoonfuls of peanut butter, are eaten around the time that you take your pill. 

And you should incorporate sunscreen. It‚Äôll protect your skin while it‚Äôs fragile and fight against scarring. 

Accutane works, but it‚Äôs not an immediate effect for some people. Keep your head up, it will get better!!

Ask to have your prescription upped. Are you aware that roaccutane is best absorbed with a fatty meal? If you're eating a lower fat diet you can try absorpica which is more readily absorbed.
You never said if your were male or not.

If you are, just keep on with the accutane but make sure to take it with a fatty meal.

Looks like rolling and a few ice picks. I‚Äôd recommend 3-5 sessions of micro needling and using a topical cream for scars like tretinoin
The best option for the rolling scars you have would be subcision. Seconded by radio frequency microneedling. Normal microneedling will not have as much of an effect, because rolling scars are caused primarily from tethering of the skin to the lower muscle layers, and this is a vertical procedure. Subcision cuts the tethers horizontally, and RF microneedling causes heating and coagulation under the skin that both burns tethers and increases fibroblast numbers. For ice picks, TCA cross is the number one treatment. 
Just stay away from fraxel laser. It will make your scarring worse and even create more scarring. My face has been wrecked because of it. It killed lot of the fat underneath my skin as well so I now have a more gaunt appearance. My texture is orange peel like too. Do not laser whatever you do!
thank you i'll definitely look into it!
Do you have skincare routine to treat your skin? :) I think vitamin c, rice and snail mucin could help. I haven't tried dermarolling tho. 
Sounds normal to me! I had one like that for years. (Often, it was just a little hard lump I could feel).
Finally, I recently caved in and asked my doctor, who referred me to a dermatologist. It was just a cystic acne lesion that I had likely pushed further into the skin.
It seemed like it was always emptying but it wasn‚Äôt ever fully getting extracted.
Derm said no extraction as it‚Äôll leave a scar (I had asked for a professional extraction) and prescribed Retin-A with strict instructions not to ‚Äúmanipulate‚Äù it.
Finally, after 10 days of applying said Retin-A, the deep bugger came to a head (and I couldn‚Äôt refrain from manipulating it then!)
The deep cyst is finally a flat pink mark! Waiting for that to fade now :D
Yes! But it‚Äôs much cheaper when you buy it directly from Deciem 
yes. don‚Äôt buy from amazon, you‚Äôre getting hella ripped off. if you live in canada you can buy it from beautylish
If you haven‚Äôt used any chemical exfoliation before, I would suggest starting with less aggressive ones. You never know how your skin reacts to it. Deciem also has other options 
Make sure you wait at least 20 minutes after you cleanse your face before applying. You want to make sure your face is completely dry. Work your way up to 10 minutes. 
I'm waiting for it to be back in stock :(
I have this same problem. I‚Äôm assuming hormones might be the cause of this?
Probably hormones. Are you taking contraceptives? 
Thirding the suggestion that it's hormones. My skin was clear until I turned 25, and now I break out in exactly the same way you have in your picture right before my cycle starts. I don't use hormonal birth control, though. Any chance you could talk to a dermatologist or GP?
hormones, I look the same and can‚Äôt figure out a solution /:
Yep hormones. I only break out on my chin in the same spots anymore. Haven't figured out a solution either. 
I've got to chime in to echo it's most likely hormones and add a question - what's your dairy consumption like? Recently I was having the exact same skin issues (after years of no acne then a horrible 'bout of cystic acne that took meds and cream to clear up) and cut dairy clear out of my diet. Two weeks later and my skin was smooth and breakout/bump free!
Same issues here. My dermatologist told me it‚Äôs hormonal. And because I‚Äôm pregnant not much I can do. It‚Äôs been like this since my first pregnancy and now this is my second and it‚Äôs worse. 

I am going to go back on birth control after this baby in hopes to control it 

Otherwise I recommend philosophy exfoliator I‚Äôm liking it so far. 
The chin breakouts are most likely caused by dairy consumption....I‚Äôm 32 and STILL deal with constant chin acne because of my nonexistent willpower to stop eating ice cream and cheese. Try cutting out any time of dairy for a week....you should notice a big difference! Good luck!
Try spearmint tea or capsules or ask your dermatologist from spironolactone.  Both are great for hormonal acne!
Thank you everyone for your suggestions! I definitely assumed it was hormonal but hoped it wasn‚Äôt. Going to try BCP for a few months and see what happens. Maybe cut out dairy as well, even though it will be tough.
I did 3 months of Fabior Foam (same thing) and it both improved my skin and made it worse.

It evened skin tone, reduced scarring, and destroyed blackheads. But, because the topical is so drying and irritating, I developed cysts more frequently. The initial breakout sucked too.

Because of the initial breakout and irritation, my skin actually looked worse after 3 months.

On Accutane now: 30mg 2x/day. 10 days in.

Good luck! Hope this helps a bit.

You could try mario badescu drying lotion. It will dry out spot overnight, works like wonder for me.

Hi everyone

I'm new to this website and was just looking for some advice, information etc. 
2 years ago I took the morning after pill and shortly after I started to develop mild / moderate acne. (Not sure if it was down to this but I imagine so as nothing in my regime had changed) I tried every topical possible, antibiotics, Yasmin, Rigevidon, and in April last year I went on accutane for 4 months. Soon after my course had finished I came off the rigevidon and I was clear for approx 5 months. In January I started to get a few spots on my jawline and decided to buy la Roche posay astringent toner. I used it for one week and (5 weeks later almost) my skin is in a sorry state. I don‚Äôt know if the toner has caused this awful breakout / purge or whether my hormones are to blame as the accutane has wore off. I am taking a blood test on Friday morning to test my hormones and thyroid for any imbalance. I‚Äôve attached a picture to show where my acne is and what it looks like. Any experiences / info / general pick me ups would be appreciated as I feel like crap every single day and my skin is starting to rule my life! P.S the right side of my jaw is definitely the most aggravated! 

Thanks for reading :) 
Definitely seems hormonal! Getting them checked is a great idea and once you find out the results your doctor/dermatologist should definitely be able to help. Something like spironolactone usually gets prescribed for something like that.  Acne never looks as bad to others as it looks to us and I guarantee there are a lot of people that would still kill to have your skin. Keep your head up!
Thank you so much for those kind words. That‚Äôs really cheered me up! Just waiting on my hormone tests back and I‚Äôve been prescribed co-cyprindiol so we shall see how that goes! Thank you again üòä
I prefer bandages, they'll stop me from touching or picking. (Good skincare is important too) 
Hydrocolloid bandages work if the acne spot is already ‚Äúopen‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt really pull something from under the surface of your skin, at least but in my experience. I like them for open spots burn drying products for stuff that‚Äôs still just under the surface. 
it's something to do with what's going on inside your body because this is such an usual place to get that type of thing. i would get tests done. to see how are your insides functioning. get an every possible test done before anything else. seriously this looks serious i would get tests done because it'll tell what's causing it. 
My skin looks very similar to yours! Commenting to follow. I wonder if it‚Äôs PIE? 
Also curious as to what these are!!
Yes! Was vegetarian for 6 months (only had cheese, yogurt, and ice cream, no milk) and recently switched to a vegan diet and have had a dramatic improvement in the number of pimples. I‚Äôm using The Ordinary Azelaic Acid suspension and it is further helping with breakouts and the scars from cysts and deep zits from the past. 
I had bad acne. Completely cut out all dairy (and preservatives and most sugar), and it didn't even slightly help my face. Shits either bullshit created by vegans or I REALLY lost the genetic lottery. 
Yes. About a year ago I used to drink 3 glasses of milk a day thinking it would help make my bones stronger. I noticed at this time I was having bad breakouts. My mom randomly went all health police on our house and got rid of dairy (except cheese, cheese is a staple in my house), junk food, processed food, and foods with food dye (Red 40, Yellow 5) and since then my acne has been very moderate. I also replaced all that milk I drank with water and stopped drinking soda. It really helped.
I was completely convinced that my acne was due to dairy, so I finally cut it out of my diet. When I did this I also unintentionally cut out sugar, since I was trying to eat healthier overall. When I started adding dairy back into my diet‚Äîno breakouts. I had a big piece of chocolate, though, and lo and behold a big cyst popped up the very next day. You might want to consider cutting out sugar if you‚Äôre hesitant to cut out dairy and seeing if it makes a difference, it did for me!
It‚Äôll slow down breakouts but won‚Äôt fully stop them 
Dairy did a number on my skin. My primary source of hydration was whole milk lol. I had awful acne on top of bad rosacea. For some reason I just sort of quit drinking milk and eating yogurt like crazy, and within two months, my acne and rosacea were gone! I think it really helps. I drink water and sweet tea now, and my skin is gloriously clear. I'd say definitely give it a try! 
I've had bad acne for 6 years or so, and I developed a milk allergic about 3 years ago now. I had always heard that going dairy free would help my acne but it didn't help my skin at all. I've read about going dairy free helping a lot of people's acne, so I still think it would be worth a try though.
I stopped eating meat and saw a huge improvement. I don't do dairy because I'm lactose intolerant 
I cut it out for 6 weeks recently after only eating it minimally for a long time and saw no change. I did see an improvement by going from a lot of dairy to cutting out most of it. 
Yep it's helped my complexion and hormonal acne soo much - milk has hormones in it that fuck you up, not to mention the dairy industry is incredibly cruel, so cutting dairy out is a good idea.
Unfortunately, yes. 
I've been cutting down milk, yoghurt and sugar (bread too) and it makes difference for me. For cystic acne and scars check out a blog called "simple skincare science" 
I cut out dairy around 6-7 weeks ago and my skin AND fatigue has improved significantly, at first I thought it may be a coincidence but I had a bar of chocolate last week and the next day I had a fresh spot :(
I've actually surprised myself with how well I've done without it because I'm a cheese fiend myself but I haven't craved it at all, give it a go and see how you get on.
I think diet affects everyone differently but I do see a difference in my skin for the worst after a night of dairy and greasy food
Cutting out dairy is like the only thing that‚Äôs actually helped clear my skin. I was fully dairy free for like 6 months to a year and my skin was 100% clear after a couple months in! Once I started adding it back in I started breaking out again. Dairy was the only thing I cut out so I know it was definitely the cause. Sadly, because I love cheese. And milk. And cream for coffee üò≠ But yeah it really works for some people!
Dairy  broke me tf out. I only drink plant based milk and the thought of dairy disgusts me.
I‚Äôm the odd one out here in the sense that I‚Äôve tried cutting out several different food groups over time and my skin didn‚Äôt improve. I wish getting clear skin was as easy as cutting out dairy though (I had to go on accutane). 
Yes. I've noticed whenever I had past a certain amount of dairy, I would have a cystic breakout 2-3 days after. And once I stopped consuming all dairy, I stopped getting cystic, painful acne. 
You actually have all types of scarring. The enlarged looking pores are ice picks, though they are very small. The broader ones with the sharp edges are boxcar, and the divots and undulating areas are rolling scars. I would honestly recommend Radiofrequency microneedling (3 treatments, done at a clinic) as it would help immensely with the rolling and boxcar scars. It can also help enlarged pores, and to a small extent ice picks. I would tell you to worry less about the ice pick scarring because no one will think twice about it.
It worked for me but it took almost the full six months. I had pretty severe cystic acne and very oily skin. The sitting oil on my face is completely gone now and I rarely break out. It's been about 4 years or so since I took isotretinoin. There are a lot of side effects related to the dehydration caused by this drug. As I understand it, Isotretinoin works by promoting cell turnover and stopping oil production. I experienced: extremely dry lips, eyes, eczema on my hands, headaches, mood swings, poor night vision, and joint pain. All of my side effects went away, except I still have moderately dry skin and eyes, but I'm fine with that. You're going to need to drink a ton of water, avoid alcohol, get monthly lab tests, and get monthly pregnancy tests if you're a girl. I would recommend checking out the Accutane subreddit; which is the name brand for this drug. r/Accutane 
It started working for me within a month. I did not get worse before I got better. I had tried a bunch of topical, oral and natural acne meds, none of them worked. Derm recommend I try accutane and I went on it. My acne wasn‚Äôt severe but it was starting to become painful and it was scarring deeper which is why I went on. I stayed on it for a year and have not broken out like I did before accutane. It sucks being on it but it does work. 
For me I saw results in 2 weeks. 
I think having a good skincare routine would help a lot. :) Check a blog called "simple skincare science" as well.
Looks irritated skin for me, not sure about scars tho. Your skin looks a bit flaky and dry, do you have proper skincare routine to treat your acne?
It‚Äôs post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Give it a google. I recommend acne safe sunscreen during the day and a retinoid at night. Start with Differin over the counter for 3+ months ndhorr advancing to tretinoin. 
it looks like PIE (post inflammatory erythema). do you have a good skincare routine? a moisturizer with ceramides and peptides should help a lot to keep your skin healthy so it can heal the scars quickly. cerave‚Äôs moisturizers have those ingredients. all you can do other than laser treatments, is take super good care of your skin so it‚Äôs as healthy as it can be so it can heal and the scars will slowly fade and go away. it just takes time 
Laser, microdermabrasion, a peel, needling, vitamin c serum, AHA, wear sunscreen, hydroquinone are some!!
A tretinoin gel will work over a period of a few months without any pain or irritation (for me anyway). Just don't use it every single day and be very sparing. Also use SPF cream on your face daily as it can leave the skin less protected.
I think you have to learn how to use adobe photoshop, then you can remove the red area very easy.
Seems like acne scarring. Aloe Vera gel helped me.

I used to have pretty bad bacne, something that pretty much cleared it up completely is the clean and clear continuous control acne cleanser with 10 percent benzoyl peroxide. This product was god awful on my face, burned and stung it. But amazing for my back! I know it helps because even now that my back is clear if I go to many days without using it I start getting a few pimples again. All I do is spread it on in the shower and honestly wash it off almost immediately. Hope this helps in some way. :)
Use cetaphil body wash and moisturizer 
Wash ur hair while bending forward

Exfoliate! Salux towel etc or just sugar

Moisturize gently

You can try aha/bha for shoulders too etc

Change clothes often
I have the same problem! It appeared out of nowhere and it‚Äôs much worse than my face.  I already have tons of scarring too wtf 
Retinol has been helpful for me, along with overnight snail-slime masks once or twice a week and every-other-week chemical peels (I use mandelic acid). A dermatologist is your best bet if it‚Äôs very severe, but a couple of little marks should be easy enough to fade yourself. 
Lasers messed my skin up. Fraxel specifically. It killed off a lot of collagen in my cheeks. Go on RealSelf and search for fraxel damage. I
Vitamin C serum has helped me
Depends on the type of scarring. Aloe Vera gel helped me.
acne scars are literal dents and holes in your skin, so no, you can‚Äôt ‚Äúcure‚Äù it with homemade methods. they can only be fixed with laser treatments or microneedling which should be done by a dermatologist 
Press some ice on it. And honestly it's not a big deal.
I'd use aha/bha and slap cosRX pimple patch on it. :d 
Don't focus on it too much or (if you're like me) you'll end up putting way too many different products/"remedies" on it and scrutinize it in the magnifying mirror until you start picking at it hahaha. But ice is a good idea!
Ice it. I also like to cover big guys like that up with some charcoal paste or mud mask while I‚Äôm just sitting around the house because a) it dries it up and b) it keeps me from touching them!!!

Holding a cotton swab of tea tree oil on the spot for a few minutes might help dry it up and appear smaller as well. 
Apply honey on a bandaid and leave it overnight for a few nights. Applying ice to it is also good. 
Benzoyl peroxide. Do not touch it unless it‚Äôs white as shit 
Personal experience after years of homemade solutions, picking and popping. Anything you can do without consulting a doctor/esthetician will make it look worse and need more time to heal. You only have two days. I would personally find a good concealer and use it in case it had become worse by thursday. It may well shrink if you leave it alone. If you try to pop it, the area will likely become dry and it will be hard to put makeup on even after moisturizing. Tea tree oil and/or witch Hazel will not cure it but can make it smaller/less red without drying it. I'm a boy and I put concealer on my spots on important events, there's nothing to be ashamed of! :) Your mouth looks gorgeous. Good luck with your date!
[removed]
Benzoyl peroxide works for me, or (weirdly) a small dab of toothpaste on it before bed. I don't know why but it seems to help dry things up!
In my experience, even if you think youve washed everything off, or dried it, you'll find it can still bleach stuff. I ended up with bleach marks round the neck of my tops, on my bedsheets where i snuggle my face into them and on my towels. In the end i bought white bedsheets and towels. 
Also, idk if your insurance covers a lot of epiduo, but i had to pay $125/month with insurance. I found out that over the counter differin combined with persa-gel 10 (bp) were the *exact* contents of epiduo. I put a bit of each (slightly more differin) on the back of my hand and mix them with my finger and then on my face. Same thing but OTC. The biggest tube of differin at my local target or walmart are $29 (size smaller is about $12) and persa-gel 10 is $3 and i found it lasts longer and doesn‚Äôt bleach so much (or maybe that‚Äôs just me being wiser about white towels and being super cautious to keep my shirts protected in any way.

I was just prescribed tazortene (sp?) so we‚Äôll see how that goes when its in. I hope it doesn‚Äôt bleach my stuff as much. 
I don't think so but you can do some research about it tho. Inner health and what you eat can make acne worse tho. Check a blog called "simple skincare science" too

I am unsure if these dark marks are a side effect. I have two indentions on my face from cortisone injections in pimples. One of them is discolored, but the opposite from yours...it turned white around it! I hope your problem resolves soon. Best of luck!
Do you take any other supplements along with this?
Oddly enough, Vitamin E hasn‚Äôt done much for me. I started taking zinc though, hoping that might work.
I started taking zinc 2 weeks ago. I had big stubborn cysts on my left cheek for like 2 months and it started to dissappear slowly but surely. I also take brewer's yeast tablets and vitamin D3. I tried everything and so far this is the best thing that helps. I might try Vitamin E. I have had small breakouts but its only one or two whiteheads per week and they went away under 2 days. Keep in mind that i used to have a much healthier diet and it might be because of that. I also use calendula cream at night.
Can you take it with zinc?
I heard selenium, Zinc, vitamin e, and vitamin a help a lot. I started those but my new derm wanted to try spiro so i let those take the back seat for now. 
Glad the vit e is helping! Some I know it makes it worse :/
When I had acne on my temples, it was because of my shampoo and conditioner. Do you use sulfate free hair products?
I had acne on temples because of bangs. Growing them away helped a lot. :D Also shampoo can affect. Do you have proper skincare routine to treat acne? 
Congratulations! You look great!
Why did you take accutane? You literally had an extremely mild form of acne, it doesn‚Äôt even look bad. Seems incredibly unnecessary.
When are you going to finish accutane?
I'm obsessed with you
woohoo! congrats!!
That's AMAZING!! I tried to do the 'less is more' option myself but my skin's not having any of that :'( Congrats!
A probiotic 
I've started taking Spearmint capsules. It's only been a couple of weeks but I've noticed I've had fewer cystic break outs in that time (save for one on my forehead because I accidentally slept in my makeup and missed a capsule). It's too early to say it's the capsules for sure, but it's the only new thing I've introduced recently, so I'm feeling positive!
Wheat germ oil! It sounds kinda odd and doesn't taste the best, but it gave me really good results. Skin felt more plumb, soft and no break outs. It has a lot vitamin E. If oil isn't your thing almonds are good option.

Someone said that spearmint capsules are good but with those you need to be careful with hormonal balance (if you're a woman). Works with tea too.

I've started to drink green tea daily and I think it also makes big difference. Results aren't fast but if I don't drink any tea for a week my skin goes little worse. 
Search the subreddit for body or chest acne. 
Also read the pinned posts. There's info on body acne.

Your acne isn't terrible. In my opinion, you should try other, less harmful methods, before you try accutane. I am currently on minocycline and cylindamyicin and those are helping, I haven't had a major cyst/large pimple in a couple weeks. 

In my understanding, accutane is considered to be the 'last resort' so to speak, due to its wide array of negative effects. Just do a quick search on this sub and you'll see what I mean.
 
If you haven't yet, see a dermatologist and see what they say. I doubt they'd suggest accutane right away, unless you've tried other medications to no avail. 

I hope I helped
Ok thanks so much
I agree with the other comment. There are many other avenues a doctor or derm will try before accutane bc it is a last resort medication. A derm should try topical creams and low-dose antibiotics first, as there is no reason to put your body through strong medicines when it may react perfectly to a sulphuric face wash and a retinoid, for instance. 

I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about your mother passing. I know that having acne can effect someone emotionally and mentally so try your best to take care of yourself. Small steps are better than no steps :) 

In regards to your hormonal acne you might want to try a bc pill. I‚Äôm not sure if you can use one with the health issues you listed but visiting a gyno may be beneficial. 

For a routine it‚Äôs always best to use products close to your skins ph level which means products under a ph level of 6 so probably around 4.5-5.5. Wash twice a day and moisturize twice a day but make sure you use a moisturizer with a SPF in it in the morning (it makes a big difference in your marks after you get rid of your acne). Using a vitamin c serum in the morning after cleansing can help with brightening your skin. In the evening after cleansing using a chemical exfoliant can help a lot with the texture of your skin followed by moisturizing. Also, using a clay mask or sheet masks few times a week helps a lot with clogged pores. 

You‚Äôre probably gonna have to do some research to find products that are affordable for you and are in your area but they do exist. 

Taking vitamins everyday has changed my skin. I take vitamin d, vitamin a, and a probiotic and my skin doesn‚Äôt look dull and it has an overall healthy  look to it. It may also be beneficial to get a blood test done to see if your deficient in anything before taking anything random. 
would you consider a second round of accutane? it‚Äôs not unusual for people with severe acne to go on more than one round to fully cure their acne
I'm so sorry that you're struggling with this and that the other medical concerns have made the acne worse. It's bad enough when we feel rotten on the inside, but when it shows up on the outside, it can be devastating. 

I know you mentioned what you've tried for the acne, but whose care are you under for the acne treatments? Are you relying on the same doctor who is treating your PCOS? Or are you seeing a dermatologist? If you can see a dermatologist, I would recommend it. I would also recommend getting a relaxing Acne facial if you can swing it. It will feel so good. It can help with the breakouts and just feel amazing. I think you deserve a good pampering. And if you have a birthday coming up anytime soon, tell everyone that THAT is what you want. :)

Also, look up the LightStim handheld device. It kills the bacteria and you can use it at home. See if a dermatologist recommends it for you. I don't think it makes a difference if it's hormonal acne.

Good luck. Sending virtual hugs.
Hi, please know we are here for you in every way we can. I recommend you try a keto diet before accutane or any other pill. Keto is a great way to keep PCOS and diabetes under control. It is a low carb, high fat, moderate protien diet and has worked miracles for my acne. Please head to the keto subs for some great info. Lots of women with PCOS have had success with it. I can personally vouch for it fixing my years of struggle with acne. Vit D and Omega 3 supplements can also help. Take care of yourself. PM if you need any suggestions. 
I have diabetes 2, but I've got both hormonal acne and fungal acne. Fungal acne is very hard to treat in my opinion since it looks like hormonal acne as well with the cysts and pus...etc. with fungal acne 99% of creams and oils breaks me out.

What really worked well for me was the Indian Aztec Healing Clay, sulfur soap and limiting all food that turns into sugar. 


I don‚Äôt have any advice for you besides maybe Accutane? I‚Äôm starting in two weeks. I just wanted to say I totally feel you about how depressing acne can me. I too have a hard time even looking my parents in the eye. It‚Äôs truly so hard 
you look absolutely wonderful! congrats
60mg of accutane daily for 7.5 months. I had severe acne since I was a preteen...I‚Äôm 30 now. Topical differin for maintenance and sometimes clindamycin phosphate spot treatment. 
The difference in your expression says it all! You look great! Your skin tone is so even!!!
Awesome! You look really good üòâ! Do you mind if I ask, did you experience any negative side effects of accutane ? And if so, for how long?
Would you mind sharing your skincare routine and how you clear up scars and PIH?
It's amazing that you don't have any deep pitted scars. The transformation is incredible I hope you feel amazing about yourself ‚ù§
Amazing! You look great :)
Happy for u
Amazing results. Congratulations
Fantastic!
how long did it take for these changes to take effect? you look absolutely wonderful! üòá
What a progress. Congrats! Also, you have a lovely bone structure. You remind me of Emma Caulfield.
Omg you are so beautiful!!! 
What all had you tried before?
Wow! You look like a completely different person!!
Gorgeous! And it will continue getting better!
do some research :) blog called "simple skincare science" has good info 
we can‚Äôt diagnose you based on a text description 
Do you use hair product?
1. How long is your hair? And do you use any product in your hair?

2. Do you use body wash? How often? What kind? Does it ever touch your face? 

3. Have you changed climates? What‚Äôs the weather change? 
Hi this happened to me 2 years ago (developing ocd/body dysmorphic disorder specifically about my skin), everything you are saying sounds very similar and i know how isolating and weird it gets and i had a lot of weird rituals that would take so much of my time and the shame and embarrassment that surrounds this. It can and will get better!  clearly defining the broken logic of my thinking, and constantly reminding myself that 1) people only see your face from about a couple feet distance in general so they do not see the detail that you see and 2) i see people with acne all the time, and i dont care or think badly of them, and most people are this way, seemed to be the start of recovery. it takes time, and it sucks, but solidarity. it is relieving to read this and know i wasnt alone. 
I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I have severe OCD as well. Mine is bodily contamination and things related to that though. I have strong urges to check my throat and inside my nose constantly. I was having eye problems because I would shine a bright light to see up my nose constantly. It‚Äôs getting better because of 2.5 years of therapy. I also had severe acne for more than 17 years and it ruined my life. I finished my accutane course a few weeks ago and my skin hasn‚Äôt been this clear since I was a child. I promise there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Please stay strong and hold onto your shred of hope! Things will improve faster than you realize. Keep faith in yourself. 
While treating acne, many dermatologists also insist on patients receiving counseling to address self-esteem issues caused by acne. Are you seeing a dermatologist? I recommend seeing a therapist about this so you can manage your mental health while you treat your acne.
I think Kalel (Kalel kitten on YT) had some videos about this, her acne wasn‚Äôt that bad, but she had the same issues as you (Also she mentioned living in LA with perfect people and it was definitely taking a toll on her) if those are not on their channel I‚Äôm sure other people uploaded them.(Kalel kitten Acne) she treated it with accutane too.
To be completely honest it rubbed me the wrong way, i found the approach to the issue to be very shallow. But to each their own. I deal with acne, but I‚Äôm a completely different person, so I can‚Äôt relate. 
For what you say you put a lot of value on your appearance. I think that you definitely need to work on loving all of you. It‚Äôs definitely messing up with the way you interact with people, and being isolated and bitter is the perfect storm. Best of luck!
I've tried SOOO many cleansers, and so far Cetaphil's gentle cleanser is the only one that works well. As for moisturization, I've tried a few, and CeraVe's moisturizing cream (in the tub) is a godsend. Also, don't be stingy with how much  you use, I just throw a huge glob (half inch in diameter?) on my hand, and slather it on my face.

Also, take it from me that you need a sunscreen, and for that I recommend Neutrogena's 55spf breakout free. 
I struggle with this too! What has helped for me in order of effectiveness:
-CLEAN YOUR PHONE DAILY (it‚Äôs gross, believe me). I use alcohol pads
- stop touching your face!
-sheet masks at night help restore some moisture. I like Korean masks with snail mucin
-fresh pillow cases every other day
-rinse your face with water after sweating
-double cleanse at night. I like oil and micellar water
-I also found that cleansing day and night was actually making my breakouts worse because it was too harsh. If your face is tight or burning after cleansing, you‚Äôre using too harsh of a product

I've had vitamin E (oil and almonds) and it makes difference with skin in the long run. Generally vitamins are healthy for mind too. You can do some research about this subject 
I found that vitamin b12 and others (other forms of B including biotin) in a multivitamin chew/pill make mine worse. :( 
Zinc, selenium, vitamin e, and a can help acne sufferers sometimes so those are worth a try. 
Haven‚Äôt experienced this but have you tried a 3 month pill? I‚Äôm on a 3 month pill and I really like it. 
21/f from the UK here!

The pill cleared me up for around 3 months until similarly it stopped working for me and my skin was 1000000x worse than it was pre-pill. I‚Äôm talking big cysts and loads of under the skin bumps/closed comedones - I mostly had loads of whiteheads and blackheads pre-pill. Luckily the gp referred me to the dermatologist who put me on roaccutane, just entering my sixth month and couldn‚Äôt be happier!

All the best :)
Are you saying that the pimples calm down but come back very fast? They always appear in the same place? 

It's hard to tell tbh, but I can advice just to have a proper skincare routine and you can search some face mapping articles too if curious
Always cleanser. Water alone won‚Äôt really clean your face and the moisturiser is probably only sealing in any germs and grime. If I‚Äôm understanding your post, you‚Äôre only using water and no soap specifically for your face? Just water is only rinsing, not cleansing. 
would you shower without using bodywash? 


Please share your routine omggg
üëèüèºüëèüèº
How!!!
You look great! Congrats! üíï
This gives me hope, please share how you've done it
Congrats, this is awesome!
Your skin looks great! Wonderful progress
Wonderful progress! Congratulations
Oh my gahd this is amazing! Congrats!
How long does it take to go away?
I sometimes get painful bumps behind my ears, I treat them a 20% salicylic acid peel I got from Amazon. It will take some repeated treatments but it will usually clear up within a  week or two. 
Do you usually get your acne in small clusters? I‚Äôm not a doctor and I haven‚Äôt used this device so I‚Äôm just spitballing but could it be that you are removing smaller acne spots that have yet to develop into full on pimples?? 
I don‚Äôt have any advice but I too have that same type of hormonal acne, especially around the jawline! And I completely agree that the skin never seems clear because of the acne and/or scarring. I‚Äôve tried a Korean brand version of those pimple dots you‚Äôre talking about and for me, I feel like they only help after my cyst has come to a head already. It kind of sucks it all out.
I own pimple patches, it‚Äôs normal. If you have a large angry stubborn painful zit, you can pop it or lance it sterilized, the place the sticker over it for some over night relief. But the patches just suck up excess fluid and oils, they take down the swelling and make a seal around the wound for faster, safer healing. 
For this time of year I‚Äôd say 30 is okay, maybe in the summer I‚Äôd up it to 50. I‚Äôm in Canada, where the sun isn‚Äôt nearly as strong as Cali, but I was just in Tampa with SPF 30 and I was fine. 
I'd say spf 30 is quite equal for 3 hours, spf 50 for 5 hours. There is some articles and blogs about this subject, but I can't link them for you. When summer arrives use spf 50 and add frequently if you can. Usually I just swipe my face with toner and add more sunscreen if I dont have any makeup. 
I see it mentioned all the time, although I myself have never been on it/know what it is 
I had great results (it literally all cleared up) but it shot my kidneys and I had to go off it after about 9 months. Now my back and chest acne has returned and I'm on this subreddit trying to figure out what else I can do. 
I lovvvvvee spiro. I took it before going on accutane just so my derm could say I exhausted all my options and my skin cleared up in less than a month. I still went on accutane bc that's more of a long term solution but 3 years later my acne is coming back and I'm considering spiro again. It really is amazing and less harsh than accutane 
why does it only work for women/what is it exactly
Needs more moisture, you can have dehydrated oily skin. I get this often and using acne treatment products dry out the skin more. I would try maybe looking for pure jojoba oil, or checking out Paula‚Äôs choice, there‚Äôs an Asian subreddit if you want to find some high quality ingredients at a better price. Most of the drug store moisturizers have never worked for me, always have issues. 
 You‚Äôll probably want a mineral sunscreen, there‚Äôs a lot more options for sunscreens from Asian brands. There‚Äôs even powdered sunscreen, which is mineral and safe for acne prone skin. 
You routine seems really drying and your skin is probably producing more oil to compensate. I‚Äôd just back on the mud masks and maybe use the tea tree oil once a day instead of twice. Add more moisturizing steps in as well. 
I started getting this about 6 months ago at the age of 25, starting as a few closed comedones along my cheekbone and progressing into this.

It is only like this on one side but it has started spreading to some slight breakouts on my forehead and closed comedones next to my lip on the other side. 

I have been on the same pill for 10 years and haven't had any cysts, just this very very red blotchy mess of small spots, a lot of blackheads on my chin and open clogged pores. Could  this still be hormonal? 

I don't sleep on one side, use my phone against my face or lean on my hand so I don't know why it's so much worse on one side. 

Broke out when I was 16. I'm 21 now and still haven't seen any signs of it disappearing. I've been prescribed ointments which have ended up burning my skin and caused it to become really dry which caused it to flake. Got some pills too which didn't help at all. Currently I have no routine and want this to clear up ASAP. Any advice would be grateful, thanks. 
Using products that are close to your skins ph level are usually best so typically anything under a 6 should be safe. If your products aren‚Äôt that low then it could be that some of your acne is not genetic but caused by the products to use. Taking vitamin d, vitamin a, and a probiotic may also help but it‚Äôs always good to double check with your doctor first. 

I like The Ordinary and Mario Badescu products the most as well. 
The Sunday Riley Saturn Sulfur Acne Treatment Mask has helped a lot of my acne, not sure if it works for everyone but it definitely helped me a ton.  It is a bit pricey but I'm sure there are cheaper alternatives.
I use ClearProof, it has a blemish toner, a spot treatment, a face gel, and a moisturizer. The moisturizer is oil free and I think it's all plant based or something along those lines but don't quote me on that.
Not that bad tbh 
Buy differin. Use it everyday before sleep. Apply sunscreen everyday. Use a cleanser twice a day. Use moisturizer if necessary. You will be fine, your acne is pretty mild. 
This is a relative question so you‚Äôre probably not going to find an answer you‚Äôre looking for. Head to a doctor if your acne bothers you. 
if you google the four stages of acne, you‚Äôre possibly a 3 but most likely a 2. Nowhere near severe. 
Not bad, is beautyfull girl :) you can search tutorial for get rid of acne, Good Luck!
My advice, drop the face washes you are using.

Your skin is clearly irritated by what you are putting on. Your skin seems to be very healthy.

Try Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser oil-free. It is hard to rinse off, but it will clear you in a week. Believe me.

Also, your pimples might be from shaving. If you want to make sure they are not, don‚Äôt shave with a razor, just trim them.
First and foremost please do not take your life. If you feel suicidal please contact 911 or a suicide hotline immediately. 

I‚Äôm not sure who recommended coconut oil to you but you should not use it on your skin since it is comedogenic and can cause acne to worsen. You can try Mario Badescu A.H.A Botanical Body Soap $15 for 16 oz. Many reviews have noted that it helps with body acne. You can also dry Dr. Bronner‚Äôs soap $8. There are many different scents but maybe the tea tree oil one would work best for you since tea tree oil can help get rid of/lessen acne. Your other issue may be that your skin is too dry. You can try Ocean Potion Aloe Lotion (yes it‚Äôs made for after sun care but reviews online said it has helped with acne. I haven‚Äôt used it for body acne but on my face and I liked it.) It‚Äôs made with tea tree oil, vitamins a, c and e which are all good for the skin. Using an exfoliating glove once or twice a week helps get rid of dead skin cells that can clog pores. Also taking vitamin a, vitamin d, and probiotic is probably a good idea but don‚Äôt go crazy on the dosages because it can have negative effects. I‚Äôve read that taking a spearmint supplement has helped people with acne so that is an option. Although it is not recommended by some you can try African Black Soap (the legit stuff not Shea Moisture) Its about $6 for a bar of it. I use it on my face and my cystic acne has almost cleared completely. (If you go with this option be sure to research how to store the soap properly) If you google African Black Soap many people have said that it has helped with their body acne. Nothing will work overnight so time and patience is a must. If something is working you should see results in about 3-4 weeks depending on the severity. If it‚Äôs not working you should also see that it‚Äôs not within the same time frame so ditch the product. 

Additionally, maybe you should find a new doctor. Maybe there is something off with your hormones and you need blood work done. 
This acne is horrible it's all over my arms, I've tried meds, coconut oil, vitamin A benzol peroxide, saylic acid nothing works and it's always coming back with bigger, sometimes incredibly painful acne 

Have you gone to see a medical professional?
When I asked "professionals" they would always give me some bullshit expensive meds or creams but they did nothing to help me, they only worsened my situation and I have thought that this may have started due to me not being able to produce the protein keratin 
If it‚Äôs fungal acne you can use an anti dandruff shampoo and leave it on your face for 15 minutes a few times a week for 2 weeks to see if it goes away. 
The quickest way to find out if it‚Äôs FA is to use a topical antifungal. I used clotrimazole cream but it didn‚Äôt work for me(nor did nizoral), but 3 days after using lotrimin ultra my FA was down by 48%.
What's your diet like? A lot of pro inflammatory foods can cause acne like this. You may have a candida overgrowth in your gut, look into probiotics and a cleaner diet if you aren't already... I'm so sorry! Itchy acne is the absolute WORST. Best of luck!!! 

Edit: adding yeast feeding foods like bread and sugar and dairy might be the cause, look into an elimination diet! 
[removed]
I mean...I do know it‚Äôs good for dry shampoo and homemade deodorant...so I know that theoretically it can work as an acne treatment. Certainly sounds a lot better than baking soda!
Do u know ur skintype? You could also search for face mapping articles (wishtrend has a good one)
What kind of skincare routine you have? I recommend 1st&2nd cleanser, toner, moisturizer, suncreen and 1-2 times a week aha/bha or scrup and clay mask :) 
Redness may be because of dryness or irritation. Hope this helped a little
Zineryt expires after a month, you have to get on repeat prescription - also use sparingly, the more times you put it on the less effective it is
I‚Äôm assuming you got the Aczone as a prescription, so your doctor should be able to tell you what to do when your skin as cleared up. If you‚Äôre getting bumps though you might be at too high of a dose.  As for the dryness every acne treatment I‚Äôve been on turns over skin cells aka flaking. Try diluting it with moisturizer to help with the inflammation and only use it on the acne. Hope this helps.
I used this when I had mild acne, it seemed to work really good and got rid of the all the redness super quickly. About 5 months ago my acne came back severe. I tried to use it again, and it didn‚Äôt seem to work that well. Of course my severe acne has mostly gone away now and I might use it again just because of how fast the PIE went away the first time I used it
Look at the ingredients of your products on the website called COSDNA. I‚Äôd link it but links aren‚Äôt allowed. I have a feeling your clearasil wash probably has some pretty irritating ingredients which can cause acne. I‚Äôd switch to a gentle hydrating cleanser (like CeraVe) if I were you. I‚Äôd also recommend the Stridex pads in the red box for chemical exfoliation (salicylic acid). 
That‚Äôs Hyper-pigmentation! And it also sucks! Haha.

I use Vitamin E oil to fade my hyperpigmentation. GIRL it seriously WORKS!! I should‚Äôve taken pictures to show how much my super red scars faded!! 

I recommend Jason Vitamin E oil (the more thiccc, the better! must have 3 c‚Äôs!) at 32000IU. Make sure it‚Äôs PURE oil and not laced with other ingredients, as you might be sensitive to other ingredients and breakout. 

Application Tips:
1) You need to apply it religiously and consecutively if you want scars to fade FAST.
2) Apply it at night.
3) Rub the oil into the scar spots. RUB. Now don‚Äôt tear into your skin, but you want a good rub.
4) Don‚Äôt apply the oil into active pimples. 

My usage: I used the oil for nearly over a week straight each night, and it faded my back and face hyperpigmentation dramatically. 
You could try a glycolic toner instead of a glycolic wash in the evening go help with skin texture. Also use a face wash close to your skins ph level. 
So here‚Äôs my ‚Äúroutine‚Äù

AM - clearasil ultra boost face wash, ponds b3 spot correcting cream 

Occasionally, I use Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser a couple times a week 

PM - same as the morning! 
You additionally use a face wash near your skins ph level
It could be irritation from your makeup. I know that I have a bad habit f unknowingly resting my chin in my hand while working and that can cause/ worsen acne too. I would say be very mindful to keep hands off it and go makeup free if you‚Äôre comfortable with that until it calms down. 
Rose hip oil has helped me immensely. I use it as a night time moisturizer. It has been shown in studies to immediately kill off the acne causing bacteria as soon as it hits the skin 
I‚Äôm the same age and have the same issues as you. What has helped me the most is using a boar‚Äôs hair brush with sulfur soap when I shower. I use it on my face and body. It has cleared up 90% of my acne. I use the Sal3 bar soap. 
Everyone has different body. Maybe you use pillow case which irritates your skin? Body produces sebum at morning the most which is the reason why I have also a lot pimples when waking up. There is some articles which explain what skin and body is doing during the day if you're interested. Do you have skincare routine that prevents dark circles etc? :)
That's how I discovered that my laundry detergent was bugging me! Every time I woke up my face was so red and I even had acne down my neck that wasn't there before. Switch to a natural detergent and see if that helps! 
Do you sleep on your side?
could be your laundry detergent? you can never go wrong getting a wash for sensitive skin and hypoallergenic 
I sleep on my face and I look 10x better waking up. After wash and moving around it gets red
Benzoyl peroxide can be really irritating to some people‚Äôs skin (like mine) beware
I've been a frequent lurker on this subreddit alt account to see if anyone else had the same skin as me but I couldn't find products which were recommended that had all of my issues (e.g. closed comedones, oily skin etc). (I'm 17 years old)

Here's the skin routine I've been using for about 4 months:

**AM**

* Cuticura Skin+ Balance for Oily Skin Cleanser 

* Fadeout Advanced + Vitamin Enriched Day Cream SPF 25

* Lymecycline 408mg Capsule (prescribed by Doctor)

**PM** 

* Biore Deep Pore Charcoal Cleanser

* Facetheory Regenacalm 2% Retinol and Vitamin C Serum

* Duac - (prescribed by doctor)

In short, the pigmentation, closed comedones and most of the spots are centralised to both cheeks and forehead; the same places where my skin gets oily (Oily T-zone). You can see that there are a few enlarged pores.

I would really appreciate for someone to tell me what to change in my routine and what products they would recommend for my skin condition at the moment to help get rid of the pigmentation, closed comedones, oily skin and the enlarged pores.

Thanks.


If you've been on that regimen for long time, with no improvement maybe it's time to talk to your derm about accutane? 
Have you tried honey? It's a pretty good cure-all for a ton of things
I‚Äôve done it. I don‚Äôt think it really helped with getting rid of or lightening hyperpigmemtation but it did help with the texture and tone of my skin overall. Dermarolling might be better. 
I think it's best if you consult a dermatologist before trying anything new with your skin.
I've tried microdermabrasion and I've been doing about 1-2/years. It feels nice and good and it cleans your skin, meaning that the surface spots, black spots and dry skin will be removed. Skin will feel softer, healthier, better after. Like it breathes more. But it doesn't help with under skin spots or with big, deap ones. You can go for a microdermabrasion before your wedding but i would advice to do it at least 1 week ahead, because I always need a lot of hydration after as my skin is freshly exposed.
Hi there! Oh my goodness! This is crazy... I am gettin married in less than two months, have also been using Curology for a while now. I just started microdermabrasion about three weeks ago and have had two sessions, and have my next two scheduled. I plan on doing 6 to 7 treatments as that is the number of sessions I would need to see a significant difference. Has it crossed my mind that I was told this as a way for the business to make more money? Yes, I have. However, after a bit of research, it seems a few sessions, shortly spaced apart, are necessary to get the ball rolling. 

The esthetician was honest about not seeing much of a difference the first time. This was true, not much of a difference visually, but my skin did feel smoother and, surprisingly, less oily for 2-3 days afterwards. However, my skin did look firmer and brighter. I‚Äôve mostly cleared my acne but have been dealing with marks for a while now. After two visits, I swear I can see a bit of a difference. I‚Äôve been very happy with my skin these past 3 days, which is rare for me!

If you‚Äôre going to start, the time is now! Give yourself a good 8-10 weeks to do enough sessions, after that you can maintain as needed. I‚Äôd suggest doing some research and reading reviews before you pull the trigger. 
Hyper pigmentation, pockmark looking indents around the sides of my nose, and pretty big pores. Picture looks better by not capturing all the colors.

I've been using coconut oil, rose hip oil, MSM cream, cleanser, omega 3 oil, chromium picolinate, and scar gel, but it has been ~2 months with zero results

Is there anything that can be done, besides expensive laser treatment/surgery? From what I've heard, scars are pretty permanent.

My father has pretty bad acne, and my brother did, but he cleared it with no problems by my age. 
ROUTINE!

I‚Äôve been dealing with mild acne since I was 11, but once I entered college it progressively got worse, to the point where my entire cheek was covered in cysts and white heads. I‚Äôve been following this routine since December and so far it‚Äôs been working!

Morning:  Wash face with Purity Made Simple Cleanser (its a little expensive but very gentle, plus it makes my skin super soft!) then apply Dickinson‚Äôs pore perfecting toner, moisturize with Neutrogena‚Äôs Sensitive Skin moisturizer. I used to use Lush‚Äôs Vanishing Cream but ran out. :/

Night: Basically the same thing, but if I‚Äôm having a bad breakout I apply BP before I moisturize, then spray my face with rose water.

Grats:)
Quick question, have your wisdom teeth come in yet?

I took minocycline and tatracycine as a teenager, and they turned my still-developing wisdom teeth black. It's not a big deal (purely cosmetic, especially since statistically you're likely going to have them yanked anyways) but if a dentist ever freaks out over your black wisdom teeth, at least you'll be expecting it. 
Is minocycline something you have to keep taking for it to work like doxycycline? Did is there any side effect will you are taking medication? 
Minocycline fucked my skin up. It worked for a year, but after that, it went downhill. 

After I stopped taking mino, my forehead looked like a rocky road and I had a terrible, terrible breakout.

I hope it all works out for you! As long as you‚Äôre keeping a good relationship with your Derm, you‚Äôll be good. 
This is making my skin crawl 
I clicked this while eating.
I am disgusted
I wish I could do this with all my pores, wish I could just squeeze everything out 
CLOSE UR MOUTH GIRL PLS
This is unironically my fetish 
I think about stuff like this all the time. The fact that we have white goo and oil under our skin is so weird. And that we can squeeze it out through our pores. It makes no sense. Why did we evolve like this. 
I read this comic and it made my fear of pimples infinitely worse. Also, I never touched vegetable oil. 
I love junji ito‚Äôs art 
Omg I will have nightmares for life 
Let me die
literally the actual Worst junji ito comic in history
Thank... you?
i think i threw up a little
What's the name of this comic?
Has anyone seen that video of the guy squeezing his nose and this literally happens 
Cardio! If I get my heart pumping every day I can actively see the red spots fading away within.a week or two. 
Do you use sunscreen? You can look for vitamin c, rice and snail mucin skincare products. Laser treatments are expensive to remove deep scars but it works. 
I‚Äôm using vitamin C, and once a week I use the Caudalie glycolic peel mask. I also use a derma roller once every three weeks. It‚Äôs a slow process, and some marks make me feel very self conscious, but they‚Äôre fading. And also, I never go out without sunscreen! 
I found an article about this exact situation that I would link if this stupid sub would allow hyperlinks. As it is, this was recommended by a dermatologist and an optometrist (I suppose because this is near your eyes) for this exact situation - warm compress, *not* ice, and anti-bacterial ointment. If there is no open wound, you can use vitamin E to prevent scarring. You should never put makeup on an open wound. In this situation I would imagine that liquid bandage would look weird and give you oatmeal brows. I would just avoid the area when you do your makeup.
Definitely use antibacterial ointment overnight. Definitely follow other instructions to prevent scarring. 

But for your interview!

You need cream concealer and setting powder in several layers.  Apply the cream concealer on the boo-boo so that it extends slightly over the edges of the wound.  Blend the edges out so that the color blends with the rest of your makeup. Dust on your powder.  Blend the edges again.  Repeat if you need more coverage.  

THEN apply your eye makeup.  Use matte shadow, not shimmer.  Shimmer will highlight any unevenness in the skin.  You WILL want to use a highlighter, though.  It's more even and not as glittery as shimmer shadow, and it diffuses light to prevent the shadows that will give away the uneven skin texture. When my skin is real bad, highlighter goes everywhere and then I just glow and you can't see any of the bullshit if you're looking at my face in normal light. 

So put on your eyeshadow and do a slightly smoky or halo eye look, but use a neutral palette like browns and taupes, not gray or black.  That would be too vampy.  Make sure to fill your brows nicely so that they look crisp and a little fuller than your actual brow. Extend the brow on the underside slightly, and it will go over a portion of the area that you've just filled, so the texture difference will blend in more. Use a pink or peachy shimmer shadow in the center of your eyelid, but keep the rest matte in and above the crease. Do a conservative liner. 

Then go ahead and do some more colorful makeup elsewhere on your face.  If you do a relatively neutral eye, you can use a brighter lip color to draw attention away from your eyes. 
Yup I‚Äôve totally been in this exact situation - the wax took off huge strips of the skin directly underneath my eyebrow. My doctor told me moist wound healing would help, so I kept neosporin on it to keep it moist while it healed. For me, this actually helped reduce scarring and speed up the healing process. Also, to keep it clean I didn‚Äôt put makeup on it until it healed up. You‚Äôll be happy you did. 

Good luck!
Maybe try liquid bandage and then an eyebrow pencil over it?
Hey! I have the same type of acne, I‚Äôve been on mino twice (had to stop for first time after a month bc of horrible side effects), but the second time around it took 6-8 weeks to see results! I had a small breakout around my chin/jaw the first month but it quickly went away with BP.
Do you do any sports? I only ask because when I was in middle/high school I wrestled and had moderate back acne and found that if I washed my back with a warm towel right after practice or conditioning my back acne tamed down a lot. It didn't go away completely until my like my junior or senior yr but helped lots. As for the face if you go to a dermatologist and get an antibacterial cream (can't remember what it's called) that should clear it up relatively fast and if it doesn't they'll give you some stronger stuff. Lots of people have good home remedies and while I can't speak to any because I never tried them myself (was always too lazy lol was easier for me to just go to the dermatologist and get a prescription) I'd encourage you to look into some if you don't want to deal with going to a doctor. Hope this helps, but keep in mind it's a part of growing and sometimes there's nothing you can do but wait it out. Best of luck to you. 
For back acne using gentle low pH body wash may help, as well as exfoliating and washing hair while bending forward. Do you have skincare routine? :) You can start slowly, but I recommend double cleansing and moisturizing. 1st cleanser (oil or micellar etc) 2nd cleanser (gel, milk etc) toner, moisturizer and sunscreen (AM only). You can also exfoliate and use clay mask 1-2 times a week. Sounds a lot of work, but per day it just takes maybe 20 mins or less. At least use one cleansing product and moisturizer. Hope this helps, sometimes acne is part of growing so it'll go away by time. Good luck!
I agree with all the posts above- I want to add that my biggest regret tying to treat teenaged acne was trying too many products and too strong of products to clear it. Doing too much won‚Äôt clear skin up faster and it will likely make it more irritated and actually take longer. 
Edit- and don‚Äôt pick or pop. If I could go back to middle school it would be for the sole purpose to tell myself to not pop my acne!!!
The above suggestions are excellent! I‚Äôd just like to add that diet can play a huge role in causing acne as well.  I found that a lot of my acne growing up was caused by an intolerance to milk and would make my face and my entire back break out. Charcoal bar soap is an excellent body cleanser as it is both gentle and clarifying. Also- hydrate, hydrate, hydrate and eat your fruits and veggies, it‚Äôs amazing what simple changes will do to improve skin.

Edit: Some products I really like are: 
Clarasonic- spendy, but amazing.
CeraVe Cleanser
First Aid Beauty Cleanser
Murad Salicylic Acid Cleanser
Witch Hazel Toner
My zit popped while I was making out with this guy and it got on his face. I wanted to die when I saw his face because there was blood and the little white thing that comes out of the pimple on his face. 
That's hilarious and I feel so bad for you! At the very least, someone who probably deals with the nastiest of mouths I'm sure it wasn't too bad.
That suuuucks!

Just today, I managed to accidentally pop one just by puffing my cheeks full of air. I try not to pick or pop them so I don‚Äôt scar (then I lance when it‚Äôs come to a head) but I guess this one was READY.
Docs in all fields see enough nasty everydat, don't worry about it.
Happened to me once when i got a haircut. So embarrassing !
I remember when I had braces and had to go see the orthodontist and he pulled my cheeks so hard there was blood on his gloves. I think when they put that super strong light on your face and they can see every blemish in full 4K HD is the most embarrassing bit. 
the copper is non-hormonal so it will have no effect on your acne. the mirena however might make it worse
I have one! Have had it almost two years and it has been the best birth control choice I‚Äôve made. I had an unplanned pregnancy at 17, and after went on bc which ruined my decently clear skin, that coupled with a lot of hs partying and sleeping in my makeup led to a 5-6 year shizstorm of trying to get it back under control. On hormonal bc I had tons of cysts and blackheads on my lower jaw and chin area, and after having Paraguard it‚Äôs helped get the hormonal acne under control because for some reason my body didn‚Äôt tolerate synthetic hormones well. 
Copper IUD should not have any effect on acne since it is non hormonal. 
I'd like to know how safe the copper iud is. The reports of it breaking up inside people sound horrific 
Mine has no effect on my acne. Birth control pills helped, but I put on weight so I got the copper IUD. Expect heavier periods and more cramping though!
Although the copper IUD is non-hormonal, the copper itself can have some effects on people.  I got the copper IUD two years ago (after going off Apri hormonal BC pill).  While I‚Äôve absolutely loved not having to worry about taking a pill regularly/getting pregnant, I‚Äôm actually getting my Paragard removed tomorrow because I‚Äôve been experiencing terrible acne and anxiety/depression symptoms.  In your body, copper and zinc balance each other out, and for some people the added copper in your body from the IUD is enough to throw the balance out of whack.  Too much copper accumulation in the body (i.e. insufficient zinc levels) can lead to acne and mental health issues for some.  It took me a while before I really started to notice anything was off, but my partner recently mentioned that the spike in my general, constant anxiety correlated to when I got the IUD.  I had assumed that my acne was just my body‚Äôs response to coming off hormonal BC, but my acne has improved slightly by taking a zinc supplement, so now I‚Äôm fairly convinced the IUD has got to go...

I was on accutane previously, and no longer suffer from cystic acne, but for the past 2 years its been a weekly onslaught of white heads, raised red marks that take months to fully heal/fade, and blackheads in places I‚Äôve never had acne issues before (my forehead has always been fairly clear, my cheeks/jaw are my problem).

I don‚Äôt want my experience to scare you though!  I‚Äôve loved everything else about my Paragard (although it took some initial adjusting ‚Äî periods were heavier and crampier in the beginning).  If you have health insurance that covers birth control, it might be worth it to try it out!  I don‚Äôt think my experience is the norm.  Good luck with whatever you pick!
Nope, but yasmin is working wonders for me 
I have it. I'm not sure of the effect to be honest. After getting it I became super paranoid it was causing tons of horrible symptoms, including breakouts. Then the paranoia went away. I've had it almost 4 years and my skin has been all over the map in that time. I've had a bottle of zinc supplements I keep meaning to take, to see if things can be improved by shifting the copper/zinc balance, but for some reason I'm really reluctant to.

There's a lot of mixed opinions on Steam rooms. Pores can't open or close (that's a myth) , and Steam can be quite drying to your skin (plus there's a risk of broken capillaries if over used). However, it can also improve circulation, which is good for your skin to heal.

In terms of annecdotal evidence, some people love it, some hate it. Personally I find a good Steam session great for my mild acne. I usually follow this up with chemical exfoliation and moisturiser and my skin looks great afterwards. I often do a home Steam (Hover my face over a bowl of hot water with a towel over my head) before using a facemask.

I would give it a go and see what works for you.
I don't know what kind of steam room you're talking about but where I live we have sauna. :D Steam softens skin so it makes exfoliating more easy, so you could try clay mask and aha/bha right after, it makes a difference. Personally I find that skin "drinks" moisturizers better when it's a bit moist after sauna, so you could go and try. 
From my experience it makes it worse. I have pretty sensitive skin though so the heat really makes my skin red- especially my acne and acne marks!
Edit- i went and got a facial recently and the lady said skin does accept products better when it‚Äôs damp so I mist my face with rose water before applying products. I think it has helped a lot but I can‚Äôt say for sure that is the cause. 
I had started doing this as well in hopes of getting clearer skin. I have both active acne and scarring. But noticed no major improvement while using Vitamin E Oil. The only thing I really noticed was that my closed comedones increased. So I would be mindful that this could clog your pores. I no longer apply any kind of oil on my acne/scars. I'm on Clindamycin, BP 5%, and Retin A. It's not a quick fix, but I am seeing improvements in both acne and scarring. Good luck to you!
Use oil high in linoleic acid: rosehip oil, argAn oil etc 
The ordinary sells rosehip oil. It's like $16
Sounds like you should visit a dermatologist or even a doctor. 
Do you exfoliate gently? You could try aha/bha for chest, but you need to start slowly with those. 
Get 10% benzoyl peroxide and put on your chest and back every night. That should help. Doxycycline helped my back breakouts alot. At night I use the benzoyl peroxide on my chest followed by a moisturizer. Give it time

Hey there Supremebenni, 
Since I can't see your face, if the texture on your forehead feels rough and bumpy, it is probably congestion.  You need to exfoliate.  Depending on if your skin is sensitive, you need a combination of AHA and BHA exfoliants.  If your skin becomes oily within 2 hours of washing, you are using a cleanser that is stripping your acid mantle, forcing your skin to create more oil.  The red marks after acne are called "post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation".  1). You need a cleanser that will restore your acid mantle because the lipids in the sebum is what the p bacterium feeds off.  This is the bacteria that causes acne. 2) you need to exfoliate with both those acids.  3) You need to hydrate your skin with an water based hydrator vs a cream that may cause more problems.  I have a background in cosmetic chemistry and this is my profession.  If you would like more information, you can look up my handle.  Remember, if you have flesh colored bumps, you need aha products.  If you have red bumps, or red bumps with pus, you need to reduce the amount of bacteria on your skin .  Hope this helps.
Please help, I used to have perfect skin before but all of a sudden around january this year i began breaking out and its led into this. I have a dermatologist appointment next week and plan on going on accutane. My skin care regime, which i just started doing because of this breakout has been pixie glow mud face cleanser, garnier micellar water and apple cider vinegar with LaMere moisturizer.  Could anyone tell me why this happened to me? Also do I need a blood test before I go on accutane or do those only start after u go on the medication?
Its your hormones being influenced ny diet. Cut out dairy and sugar for 2 weeks and see what happens
Did you take any antibiotics the last months?
Book a dermatologist appointment
You most likely will not be prescribed or even considered for accutane until you try other antibiotics and tretinoin, etc. Even if you were, your insurance likely would not cover it if you havent tried anything else. 
You'll likely be given tretinoin/ clindamycin, and possibly minocycline/doxycycline 
i see like one or two indents that could be scarring,but honestly i wouldnt know you had any if i wasnt like inspecting your skin lol
Try a dermaroller 
I tried fraxel laser too, 5 sessions over a three year period. It made my scars more visible. Then used bellafill to fill in the scars. Scars still remained after 3 separate bellafill sessions.  Now I am using  tret .025 a few times a week and going to see a dermatologist to see what other options there are. Basically the fraxel laser made my scars and texture worse. I think it killed a lot of fat in my cheeks as well.  
Apart from scarring and texture, at night I take a warm wet wash cloth and gently wipe off all the oil from the day then I use manuka honey as a cleanser and rose hip oil as a moisturizer. In the morning I cleanse with the honey as well but spritz my face with rose water and after my face is towel dried I use beach bum sunscreen. This has prevented any real pimples from forming on my face. And rose hip oil has been studied to show that when applied to the skin it kills off the bacteria that causes acne almost immediately upon contact. 
How often do you get it done? The dermaroller is just added to your skincare routine after your toner. I use it morning and night and saw an amazing difference. It causes mini trauma in your skin which triggers the collagen fibers. You can get them just about anywhere. 
I'd also post this in some sort of advice subreddit.

I'm not a guy but I know acne is inevitable and I don't care if people have it. 
I‚Äôm a guy, just be confident, and he won‚Äôt notice or even care. But if it is bothering you just avoid certain positions 
I‚Äôm a woman but had the same problem in the past. My advice is, that‚Äôs probably going to be the last thing on his mind if he sees your acne. You‚Äôre (self proclaimed) a beautiful woman and he likes you enough to want to get to know you more, it might be worth bringing up later if it continues to bother you but if you can try to ignore it for one night and just be your beautiful confident self i don‚Äôt imagine he will care if he even notices it:)

Also, as far as covering it up, it could be helpful to control the lighting and make sure it is flattering rather than using some kind of makeup, etc. 

Good luck!! Remember, we‚Äôve all had annoying zits even if it‚Äôs not as severe as others, I‚Äôm sure even Mr. Greek God has experienced big zits and breakouts and understands that it happens to everyone. 
I‚Äôm really self conscious about my back acne and I‚Äôve only recently gotten more comfortable letting my bf see it. I confessed to him how self conscious it makes me and he was super supportive and it‚Äôs gross but I recently let him q-too some BP on my hard to reach spots haha and they‚Äôre actually starting to clear up! Totally worth it!
I was actually literally thinking the same thing today! I'm going to a music festival next weekend and have bacne- I went today to get some tops to cover my back and am worried the guy I'm going with is going to get turned off by it.

I‚Äôve had trouble since I was 13 years old (though all the important years of development) and I am now 27 years old. Body acne happens. I still get breakouts but I never let it get in the way of my life. I am an outdoor athletic junkie, even when my back looks terrible I run in a sports bra. I don‚Äôt care. Clothing can really cause a lot of acne issues and I highly recommend giving your skin some air and say f*** it!! Have fun...you only live once!!
Try to use physical sunscreen, even though it may leave a whitecast they don‚Äôt make my skin breakout. For brands I like asian ones, try the ‚Äúnivea sun protect water milk‚Äù, or ‚ÄúRotho mentholatum Acnes UV milk‚Äù, and ‚Äúinnisfree perfect UV protection cream (for oily skin)‚Äù you can find them on eBay.
I have always had success with Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch sunscreen. I have sensitive skin with moderate acne, and get really oily around certain parts of my face. 
I am in the same boat as you. I just recently started using vanicream and so far so good knock on wood no problems.
I would really not recommend the scrub. A physical scrub like that can be really irritating and make acne worse. Instead, try for a chemical exfoliant like an AHA/BHA serums or even a gentler astringent like a quick wipe of witch hazel or tea tree oil around the acne prone areas. 

As far as a product to reduce that redness, the Dr. Jart  Cicapair Tiger Grass Cream has worked WONDERS for me in the past with dry red irritated areas while still not clogging up my acne or making it worse. 

Good luck!
First I use Burts Bees cleanser. Then I use X Out Acne wash in solution (BP) and Kroger apricot salicylic acid scrub. Usually use the X Out in the morning and scrub at night. Use a Lush moisturizer called Celestial but honestly I think its making things worse. Not sure if my face is purging bit I believe so because I'm a week in. What can I do to help with the redness?
You should use sunscreen after salicylic acid scrub I think. You could also moisturize better? I recommend double cleansing - 1st cleanser, 2nd cleanser, toner, moisturizer and sunscreen (AM only). Redness may be because your skin is either dry or irritated.
Best to avoid harsh physical scrubs IMO. Stick to gentle cleansers and chemical exfoliants like salicylic acid (BHA). For acne try a gentle benzoyl peroxide solution like Paula's Choice regular strength in the Clear line. A lot of BP I have gotten over the counter at stores has other ingredients that irritate the skin, cause redness and dryness, but I have had no issues with Paula's. 

Definitely moisturize regularly. If the one you are using breaks you out look for a non-comedogenic fragrance-free option. A lot of people here like CeraVe in the tub, or Cetaphil. I personally use Aveeno Clear Complexion because it has a bit of salicylic acid and the ingredients are simple and don't clog me up. 

You can use an occlusive on top of the moisturizer or mix something in, personally I mix about 4 drops of Rosehip seed oil with a dime size spot of moisturizer in my palm before application. If I still need an extra boost like in cold weather or from a lot of nose-blowing I use pure squalane during the day, and Vaseline at night (not all over though typically just the dry areas).
If you are extremely sensitive to dairy and if it is whey protein then sure. It just depends on you and how you react to things. If you have no problems with dairy then it's worth a try. 
If you are having enough water, then you won't have any problems generally. 
So I have been regular on my skin care routine ( wash, moisturize, sun screen and serum at night). And I haven't seen any major breakout in a long time. But I still don't feel like my skin looks good (like you can see). There are scars, there's redness (i have applied a little bit of concealer) and there are very little bumps that make the skin look dull on the whole. Any tips? What should I do? 
I had marks like that and started using tretinoin and now they have faded. 
i use epiduo along with a non-prescription routine. it works for me but i assume it just depends on each person and what kind of acne you have. 
Absolutely nothing worked for me. I was hopeless and 22. I had some epiphanies after months of stress crying over it that lead me to switch my laundry detergent to a natural one (Seventh Generation) and I completely cut out dairy and my face hasn't been this clear since before jr high. Cetaphil, ACV toner, some good moisturizer, scrub 2x/ week and chance pillow case every other night and flip the pillow every night. The biggest thing that did it for me was cutting the dairy. It's worth a try!  

There is SOMETHING causing the acne, it doesn't exist for absolutely no reason. Food, genetics, allergies, it could be anything. Try natural things and try an elimination diet (google it). You will figure it out, don't give up!!!! 
Have you tried getting your hormones tested and working out a way to balance them? If it is hormonal and Spiro worked the surely with some testing they could find where the hormonal imbalance is and potentially give you a birth control pill to correct it or you could try to balance it naturally etc?
Differin Daily Care Moisturizer with spf 
Cetaphil seems Control spf moistirizer (didn‚Äôt like but doesn‚Äôt cause acne) 
Renee Rouleau SPF 

Elta MD Clear is recommended by tons of people but not a moisturizer, only spf 
R/accutane
See a dermatologist would be my best advice! They can advise you from there. 
You should probably go see a dermatologist. Most estheticians won't open up cystic acne as it can lead to infection and more scarring. They will extract blackheads though. If you're looking for treatment on your back, you should go to a place that does back facials. I really don't think you'll see the results you're looking for though. Those creams and medicine from a dermatologist really aren't that bad. You might have the best of luck with Accutane, but you might have to try some other treatments first. 
100% DERMATOLOGIST!!!!!! Extractions will only make it worse in the long term (even if it looks better for a little after, it won‚Äôt last!) The dermatologist will most likely prescribe you something, you could always try both simultaneously (a prescription and extractions!) 
If you do not see improvement with OTC products and lifestyle changes, then it's time to see a dermatologist. The longer you hold out on seeing a derm = more permanent scarring you may have to deal with later.
I‚Äôm 24, have oily skin, live in a pretty damp climate (South West England), and have had similar acne to you (area & type) since I was 17-18 with various levels of success treating . I also have a fair amount of PIH on my chin, jaw and cheeks. I‚Äôm on a pretty low income so I‚Äôve not been able to really splash out on any expensive products or treatments, tried Lush products as I worked in my UK factory for the best part of the year and could get a lot free/discounted and was also resistant to going to see my doctor about it.

In the New Year I decided to tackle it properly, went to my GP who prescribed me 12 weeks worth of antibiotics straight away. I‚Äôve been taking daily Lymecycline for 5 weeks now, and aside a breakout in my first 7-10 days my skin hasn‚Äôt looked this good since I was 16. I‚Äôm currently in the process of switching my contraception from the implant to the non-hormonal coil as I‚Äôve also heard that the implant can increase acne.

I‚Äôve got a fairly basic regimen using SR skincare foaming witch hazel cleanser, The Ordinary 2% Salicylic acid, niacinimide & zinc and Vitamin C & HA spheres and Clinique gel moisturiser. The acne-free areas of my skin are also looking better than I can ever remember.

I‚Äôm a bit worried about what my skin will do when the prescription runs out but at the moment I would definitely recommend going to see a health professional.



I‚Äôve seen a huge improvement cutting out dairy and sugar. Just to be safe I‚Äôve also cut down on other allergens such as peanuts and gluten.

Aside from the that what has been the biggest thing for my skin, I‚Äôm talking changes like night and day, is using the Thayers rose toner to wipe my face instead of washing it, and following up with oil/moisturizer.
I have acne similar to yours, but I live in a dry climate so not exactly the same. I find using an AHA acid 1-2 days per week has really helped with my acne. I was having a breakout this past weekend, and last night was my AHA night. After using it, I woke up with noticeably clearer skin. The AHA also helps to (slowly) exfoliate away hyperpigmentated scarring over time. I used Stratia Soft Touch (mandelic acid) last night, and I also like the Silk Naturals AHA toner (lactic acid). Start with once a week, because more is NOT better with acids. 

If you're interested in supplements, I take vitamin A and borage seed oil but I'm not sure how much good they do. 
I'm 27 and had pretty clear skin till I hit 25? Then bam, got all these hormonal and fungal acne. Hormonal can't really be helped specially during that time of month. But having fungal acne is horrible, since it's pretty much goes everywhere, neck, jawline (worst), cheeks, forehead, chest, chin,...etc. 
Sulfur soap, Indian azetic healing clay and cutting out junk food works the best for me. 

My worse trigger is sugar, it swells up my acne and turns it to either pus filled or cystic. 

If you have fungal acne then you are kind of screwed, I really hope you don't. Because 99.9% of all cream and oils makes my acne worse.
If you live in a place that isn't sunny all year round try vitamin D. Get a good moisturizer.
I cleared my acne with a similar diet, although I had to cut out high carb nuts (cashews, pistachios), rice, and the fruit.
Yep, same. I can eat all unprocessed carbs (rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes) but everything processed has to go, including oatmeal. It's extremely hard and I keep falling off the bandwagon though because I'm basically a junkfood addict by default.
May I ask what you (typically) eat for each meal? 

I‚Äôve tried literally everything. I‚Äôve been vegetarian for 15 years, but went vegan 5 months ago but I can definitively say dairy isn‚Äôt the cause of my acne. I know too much refined sugar causes the odd pimple for me. 
This is awesome I notice diet effects my skin but I usually don‚Äôt get a reaction till a few days after whatever I eat. I am doing a food sensitivity test to see what I react too and want to see if cutting it out clears up my skin. Has cutting out flour dairy and sugar helped with weight loss too or just your skin? 
I did this too. No sugar, no flour no dairy. 100% works. All avoid insulin spikes. I actually cut back on fruit a bit too and saw an improvement 
I want to try the no flour and wheat approach too, but I have a very hard time substituting those things. Like what do you have for breakfast/lunch/snack? I stopped eating sweets or cookies but just cant substitute flour or wheat. Any tips?
My routine is: 

Am: 

Wash with Cosrx low ph good morning cleanser 

Tone with Clinique clarifying lotion 2 

Moisturize with glycerin and aloe mix gel 

Pm: 

Wash with Cosrx 

Tone Clinique 

Moisturize around mouth and eye area 

Curology prescription: 8% Azelaic Acid, 1% clindamycin and .25% Zinc Pyrithione 


I feel like my skin is really oily now that it‚Äôs getting warmer and it‚Äôs a thin oil. 
I also have noticed a lot of little skin colored bumps under the skin only on the right side of my face on cheeks. I have an ongoing battle with inflamed cysts from allergies and hormones. 

I have used Paula‚Äôs choice 2% bha liquid once and it made me shiny like overexfoliated and have little bumps on my forehead. So I stopped using it.  Is that a normal reaction? Purging? 

Any advice on any of these issues would be great! 
Fix your diet. Topical products don't work on cysts, and in my case topical products made my texture worse. 
Are you using proper SPF protection? Those medicines can cause extra sensitivity to sun exposure (hypersensitivity) and requires more diligent sun protection. Acne also cause hyperpigmentation and you need SPF to account for that as well. 
My dermatologist is giving me stuff now to fade the scars. One is epiduo forte and the other is finacea foam. i think the epiduo is the one that fades them because it has retinol in it.
Are you sure it‚Äôs purging? Are you getting breakouts in the usual places, and are they coming and going quickly? 
Tea tree oil is good and will kind of dry out your spots. Id recommend spot treatment as opposed to using it on your whole face. And make sure it‚Äôs diluted, it‚Äôs very strong. 

Change your pillowcases often, check out hydrocolloid bangldages, and make sure you‚Äôre drinking a lot of water and keeping your skin hydrated. 

Tea tree oil worked for me for a year or so but my acne changed and my skin became really resistant to it. Use little at first.

Honestly man, just looks like mild acne. Depending on how old you are, could just be based on diet or hormones. I wouldn‚Äôt even worry about it, but if you eat a lot of sugar or dairy products, I would try cutting those out and see if you notice an improvement. 
Try adding a glycolic acid and salicylic acid toner to your routine 
Neostrata makes a great one
From all the times that's happened to me, it takes around half hour-hour for it to fully disappear! Just don't touch it or provoke it as it will disappear on its own.
UPDATE: for anyone reading that's going through something similar - it has pretty much fully gone after 48 hours. I used aloe Vera generously through the day and sudocrem over night .
First, do you have a skincare routine?

Also: 
Do you wear glasses? Do you clean the arms of your glasses regularly?
How often do you change your razor out?
Yes I usually use clearasil wipes morning after school and night I use an exfoliating bar in shower and clearasil 5in1 along with witch hazel,,,, I don‚Äôt wear glasses but I wear headphones to play ps4 and I use an electronic trimmer that‚Äôs cleaned often
Stop using hydrogen peroxide, use a low pH gentle cleanser (like CeraVe hydrating) and use a moisturizer
Dial soap has a ph level of 10 so I‚Äôm not surprised you broke out. That‚Äôs pretty harsh for a facial cleanser. Face wash should be close to your ph level. It‚Äôs probably been thrown off balance. 
You could use a basic face wash that doesn‚Äôt have a lot of irritating ingredients-  such as Cetaphil, CeraVe even Purpose. They sell them at drug stores. 
Dial soup has high PH meaning it's a strong base which is bad for skin. Especially with sensitive skin, though it could be hormonal changes too.
Azelaic Acid! You can buy it from The Ordinary (online/Sephora online) or on amazon. On amazon you‚Äôll have to search for ‚Äúmelazepam.‚Äù Also Dr Jart Tiger Grass Cream (from Sephora) has been amazing for my redness! 
No suggestions to treat the redness but I have switched to cleanser/ moisturizer for sensitive skin rather than acne prone skin and it has helped a lot with my overall redness. 
Leave it on but after it's dried,(5/10 mins) apply a moisturizer on top which hides the cream and counteracts the extreme drying of the skin from the bp 
Looks like PIE not scarring 
Wrinkles
What's your secret?!

This makes me confident mine can get better
Amazing progress!
looks great man
Hope it will work for you!
You need the moisturizer though.
I've been doing this for a week,just warm ish water from the shower,it's helped alot
I just applied it and in the same boat as you
Nothing but time

Edit: sorry thats not true, you can use vitamin c serum to speed up the process of fading your scars
I would also like to know. I am a male with the same marks from whitehead pimples 
For me, COSRX‚Äôs 96 snail mucin essence helped me with reducing hyperpigmentation (reducing acne scars) and hydrating my skin. I use it every night before going to bed. One little squirt of this product really goes a long way. I saw results after a few nights of using it. Even after my acne scars faded, I still use it because it evens my skin tone and also gives my skin that glow in the day time without looking oily. Hope it works for you as it works for me :)
just know any type of oil COULD clog pores not always,that could be one part,and for chin and around mouth,it could be hormones..pick up some green tea complex from walmart and give it a week or two,i had  really bad accne around on my jaw and chin and it cleared it up
If you are female it could be hormonal. Mouth/chin/jaw is where I get breakouts. Birth control could be an option to discuss with your doc. 
Edit- my advice would be to try a gentle routine with some salicylic acid and don‚Äôt try a bunch of new things all at once. You can also look at your diet and environment. 
I think if you used adapalene and BP+Clindamycin together both at PM it'd be better. There are articles demonstrating the increased efficacy of Benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin when put a while after putting differin on.

I too was using the same things (brand names Differin and Clindoxyl) and I found that waiting 30mins to put BP+Clindamycin after putting Differin works better. Differin works like a delivery system to bring BP deeper into the skin, so it can work better.

I'll help further if you give me your whole routine. 
Dermatologist!! You will see improvement in 4-6 weeks with products that actually work.
What really cleared up my acne was only using oil free non comedogenic products so i ended up changing all my moisturizers, makeup, and face wash and my cystic acne is gone.
BENZOYL PEROXIDE
Thank you guys so much.

Do you have a skincare routine, or at least anything you do for your skin?
In the US, a lot of insurance companies want to see that you‚Äôve tried nearly every other option before they will cover accutane. My insurance required 3 months of retin-A in combination with an antibiotic, which I had already done so my dermatologist prescribed accutane without an issue. 
Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt tell you if you qualify from just your description, but if you have exhausted all other medications then, if you feel it is your last resort, speak to your doctor/derm about it as an option. I‚Äôm not advocating it at all. It is a last resort option!
This is something you‚Äôll have to establish with your dermatologist. If you acne isn‚Äôt severe then you might need to exhaust other treatments first before being prescribed accutane. I myself have severe acne and was able to go on it immediately. 
Ice (but not for long periods of time) if it hurts really badly. You could try steaming your face to open the pore. I use Freeman‚Äôs Honey + Tea Tree Oil mask as a spot treatment on deep cystic acne and within a few days it comes to a head so I can put a Cosrx pimple patch on it. You can also try some tea tree oil on it but you may want to dilute the oil a little bit. 
That sounds possible. I recommend getting an allergy test and talking to your doctor about it, because none of us are qualified to answer this.
Just watch a few dairy industry documentaries and you'll never want dairy again.

Dairy free is also my trick to having clear skin (plus a Zinc supplement). And no soy. Go for almond or rice milk. 
I went vegan January 1st and have seen tremendous improvements in my skin. You should consider the vegan/dairy free replacements for sour cream and cheese. Tofutti brand sour cream is very similar to the real thing, and for cheese try Daiya or Follow your Heart brands. If you enjoy milk, almond milk is very good. And if you want some ice cream, Ben and Jerry's makes 4 flavors of dairy free ice cream!
I feel you. I'm exactly like you. Not eating dairy sucks because everybody thinks you're lactose intolerant and will still serve you Parmesan or whatever. But I have perfect skin now, but one croissant ü•ê and I'm ugly again. ‚òπÔ∏è
Yep. 100% with you. One bite of chocolate and I'll break out. It's a sad life. I miss Del Taco's queso bean burritos the most I think. I'm so sorry, I don't know why we were chosen for this life... but I will say I feel so much better after cutting out dairy! Tons more energy and no more "oh god roll down the windows NOW" worthy farts! 

Edit: just going to add that I use almond milk in my oatmeal and avocado oil to cook with. Not a fan of fake cheese, I just have to make my sandwiches super elaborate so I don't feel like I'm missing out. Protip: mayo is great with a lot of stuff. 
I struggle with it, too. I managed to switch to almond milk and almond creamer for my coffee and scratched all other dairy and added sugar. I didn‚Äôt see a huge improvement.

But I cannot give up cheese. I need to live my life and cheese needs to be a part of it.
Dairy is known to be notoriously bad for you. After all, cheese is technically "coagulated pus"
Feel you! I've been cutting down milk based products (yoghurt etc, choko too..) but damn I love cheese. What helps for me a lot is drinking lots of green tea and sometimes taking zinc and vitamin E (wheat germ oil or almonds!)
I miss cheese too...
Gluten doesn't but sugar MAY cause acne. If you don't really have any issue that makes you can't eating gluten then you don't have to resign form eating it.
Gluten can cause acne in some people, but only if you are sensitive to it and experience problems.  As for sugar, YES.  Stay away from that at all costs. 
Honestly see a derm. If it is fungal you may need a prescription or it can be something totally different. 
If it itches, or you notice it gets worse with heat, it could very well be fungal. I had fungal acne for the longest before I knew it. It started when I moved from the northern US to Florida for school. When I first moved, I had enjoyed gorgeous, clear skin since I started using tretinoin and salicylic acid at 17. I went to school at 19 and by the second semester my skin was abysmal. Broke out constantly on my forehead and cheeks, as well as my chest and upper back. I went to a doctor (not my doctor, not a derm) -- big mistake. They said it was acne despite me telling them that I had been successfully treating my acne for three years, and that my acne had never looked this way or appeared in these spots. They prescribed docyclone and I only took it for a few weeks thank GOD because now I think I have an antibiotic-induced skin problem that I'm going to see the derm about on Monday. In short, it was pityrosporum folliculitis that I was able to successfully treat using ketoconazole shampoo. It will clear up almost immediately if this is the case. A quick test that may work (though don't swear by the results or lack thereof) -- use clotrimazole on a spot and see if it mitigates it. Again, if it is itchy or flares up after sun exposure and heat exposure, it's probably fungal. It looks like it could be folliculitis from the picture. Good luck!
Get yourself to a dermatologist! When nothing over the counter works, you probably need some prescription strength medicine and possibly antibiotics. 
I used it twice and it caused me severe cystic acne all over my face 
I adore it. I mix one part charcoal powder, one part this, and two parts water and leave it on until it‚Äôs completely dry. I always do it before bedtime. You really can feel your face pulsate and after you take it off, your face is SO RED and a little tight and dry. I apply my nighttime moisturizer and go to sleep. When I wake up the redness is gone, my skin is brighter and more youthful looking, and the pimples I have are greatly reduced. I use it 3 times a week, 4 if I‚Äôm battling a bad breakout. 
I really love this mask. But I don‚Äôt think you should do it too often, or you‚Äôd dry your skin out. It‚Äôs great for sopping up lots of oil a few times a week! Or even just once a week.
It helps even out my skin tone. I only use it once a week. 


FYI- be careful when you take it off...this can clog your sink! 
It‚Äôs really cool! I like it. I have dry sensitive skin, currently purging after adding 2% granactive retinoid to my routine. 
Shit will DRY. YOU. OUT. if you have dry skin or leave it on too long/use it too much. I mix a roughly 3:2 ratio of water to clay, get it pretty liquidy (there will be clumps of clay in the mixture) and then massage it onto my skin so the clumpiness breaks down. It definitely is very powerful, so I‚Äôm not hugely surprised it can cause cystic acne, though I have to wonder if it‚Äôs causing purging, not a reaction, since it‚Äôs definitely exfoliating and accelerating skin turnover via increased circulation. Aggressively. if I leave it on for too long it gets tight enough to hurt, and my face will stay red for a while. 

Don‚Äôt double up with this and AHA/BHA. trust me. Do not make the mistakes I have made. 
Overall tho I like it! Will def have to try mixing it with charcoal or other active ingredients. 
I tried it along with black charcoal soap and it dried up my skin and caused redness. However..................I didn't have moisturizer at the time so perhaps I'm a dumbass. I might give it another go because of the amazing reputation it has. I'm convinced I simply did it wrong and wasn't prepared.
I used it a few times and never had issues with it. Seems like it might be a problem for some skin types but my acne is food related so I had no issue. It took some redness out but it tightens your face up so use moisturizer after! I mixed it with apple cider vinegar. 
This mask helped me so much last year when I went through my worst acne breakouts. My mixture is 1 tsp ACV, 1 tsp of bentonite clay. You can really only do this mask once a week, and right after I usually mix my moisturizer with rosehip oil to replenish the hydration in my face. If you are curious about other experiences I highly suggest looking at their amazon reviews. 
wash your face, then tone, then use clearasil, then moisturize, then put SUNSCREEN, then makeup.

If you tone after anything, the thing you put before will get wiped off.
As said first cleanse then tone (i would do that all over face) then moisterize and put sunscreen on. 

May i ask what brand of toner with witch hazel u use? Just pure alcohol free witch hazel didnt worked out for me (was some 96%) that was way to drying.

Also maybe as next cleanser a less harsh product then clearasil face wash, that one contains alchohol. I would recommand something like Cosrx low ph good morning facewash (there are great informion Posts about what skincareprodcts are great and in wich continents they are sold on here!)
The retinoid described was Accutane
I have these too!! They just pop out of nowhere and it is just so odd bc I‚Äôve never seen anyone else with this
Try Nizoral shampoo! Use as a nightly leave on treatment 
I too would like some information on this.

Have had a spot inside my eyebrow for maybe a year now. I just try to ignore it as it's hard to see but why won't it go away if I'm not touching it!
[removed]
I get them after plucking my eyebrows.... :/ The only thing I've found that helps is using toner after plucking. When they do show up, I give in and sadly pop them. 
 I started drinking a shit ton of water, like a couple bottles a day and they all cleared up!! Give it a try, seriously just driving water whenever you think about it 
I used to get these as well... realized it was cause of plucking and stopped. 
1) Compulsive picking doesn‚Äôt CAUSE other pimples to come about just because you picked them but picking them and then touching other parts of your face spreads bacteria. She should stop picking because she can leave behind darks marks and scars. 
2) Exercise can help because it helps promote blood circulation but nothing will ever cause immediate results. Make a routine and stick to it so she can see the results. Most of anything takes a few weeks before anything is noticeable. Nothing is overnight. If she does exercise she should wipe her face of any sweat afterwards. 
3) Cystic pimples are very deep so when you pick them or force them to pop you are going to bleed more than when you have a white head. It‚Äôs like any wound on the body. The deeper the cut the more it bleeds. 
1. No. But picking always increases your risk of scarring* especially where cystic acne is concerned. 
2. For me diet, changes are seen immediately in the sense that I won't get new breakouts. 
3. If it's on a blood vessel I guess. 

*edit: meant scarring, not picking lol
Diet and exercise contribute, but only if your diet is really heavy with certain sugars or other unhealthy foods. Most of the time these only make existing acne worse, not cause it. 
Picking at your face certainly doesn‚Äôt help the situation, but it‚Äôs not going to cause acne. 

In fact, your body is the actual *cause* of acne. External factors will contribute in extreme cases, but not much. Serums, lotions, and washes can help sometimes, but sometimes your skin just revolts. 

Please be gentle with your girlfriend about this issue! 
You‚Äôre doing pretty well, but it does sound like you‚Äôre overtaxing your skin. 
First, stop using the clay mask for several hours. That‚Äôll dry out your skin like mad and it stops being effective after about 25min/starts doing more harm than good. 
What cleanser do you use? 
I am using it since the beggining ofnthe year,but i dont see a lot of improvements.
I am happy it worked for you!
If your skin is very itchy and dry I recommend applying a moisturiser after the gel has dried, it should help as your skin won't heal if it's dry. Congratulations on finding something that works! 
Yeah use a good moisturizer especially if you live in a comer climate rn. Aquaphor is great and never clogs my pores (but only use if it's cold out or super dry), also Neutrogena has great non pore clogging moisturizers 
I was using epiduo for 6 months before being given lymecycline. The lymecycline started working 3 weeks in, had about two months acne free, then it stopped working. Still using epiduo but tbh I don't really think it does much (cept kinda keep SFs at bay) just use it to help with blemishes 
Me! except I was perscribed epiduo forte, 
I've had excellent results.

My only warning is it may get worse before it gets better, but I managed to get almost perfect skin in less than 2 months so it was amazing for me!

I've been off Limecycline for awhile now, and it seems the epiduo is still doing its job :)
Have you tried a different bc pill? I had the same problem and my gyno said that hormones can change and can cause cystic hormonal acne. I switched and it went away. I now have to keep an eye out for when I do really breakout because it might be time to change bc pills. I use to always go to my derm for my acne problems but when nothing changed I decided to visit my gyno. My derm also prescribed doxycycline and it did absolutely nothing. I was on it for like 8 months. If you would like my skincare routine I would be happy to post. 
I had painful cystic acne on my jawline, in the past few months I've finally found things that are working for me. I take vitamin D3 (4,000iu per day) and fish oil (1200mg per day). After a few weeks I saw huge improvements. I also use a thin layer of grapeseed oil on my skin every day, it helps TONS with hyperpigmentation and speeding up the healing process.
I highly recommend the Curology program. 100% worth it, IMO. (Yes, I‚Äôve used it and got to the point I didn‚Äôt need to any more)
How long have you used the SA? It usually causes purging for a few weeks

Is your face tight after using it? If so you should switch to something more gentle

Also if your face can handle the SA ,maybe if the SA isn't working BP could work,but it ALSO causes purging
imo its not about how bad it is, its about what you try, if nothing works, you should probably go for accutane, perhaps your derm will tell you that. 
Backstory: my chest has looked this way since I was 14(32 now) and just a few days ago I had a doctor insist that my acne wasn‚Äôt that bad and prescribed me a combination of topical gels that didn‚Äôt work at all separately in the past. 
It‚Äôs severe enough. Id say get a new derm if he know that antibiotics and topicals haven‚Äôt worked in the past and won‚Äôt prescribe the tane 
Personally I would say no way near severe enough.

I was far, far worse. Despite this, after researching the horror stories about accutane, I decided to stick it out rather than take it. Taking such a powerful drug is not to be taken lightly, it has consequences. If I were you, for what it's worth, you're fine, it's not severe at all. Try anything else, by all means, but only take accutane as an absolute last resort. I would hope a dermatologist would tell you the same thing though, that what you have is pretty mild and nowhere close to requiring such a severe medication for it.
Yes I have. My skin was clear before starting birth control, I would probably get ~3 pimples when my period would come. 3 months after starting birth control, I started getting acne on my cheeks and chin, places I didnt get acne even during puberty.
Also forgot to mention that I have been on 200 mg of minocycline since December 1st. My acne has gotten better but isn‚Äôt completely gone. 
Not quite the same circumstances, but when I switched from ortho tri cyclen to ortho cyclen my acne got absolutely terrible. Switching back fixed my face, somewhat. I got really clear when I switched to Yaz. 
How about Dr. Sandra Lee's products? She's Dr. Pimple Popper on YouTube and has a show on TLC, I think. I've also had success with mixing a benzoyl peroxide cleanser and a salicylic acid cleanser, then Aveeno Clear Complexion moisturizer, Keep your hair clean and off your face because if you have an oily scalp, it's contributing and that's why your acne is on your forehead and along your hairline. Visit a dermatologist. See what they suggest. It's usually the best route, but definitely do the cleansers and moisturizer.
What‚Äôs your current skin care routine? I‚Äôd hate to suggest any new products or habits without hearing more about your routine. 
It's great that this all works for you but I think people should also be aware that essential oils can be very irritating on the skin in part due to them being highly fragranced albeit naturally. 

Pore size is also genetic so anything that claims to "shrink" them is actually just increasing blood flow and causing the skin to swell, decreasing just the appearance of large pores. 

I'd also be careful putting pure tea tree oil on inflamed skin as it can cause burns so it should be diluted first. Benzoyl peroxide also inhibits bacterial growth and it's generally a safer option for acne. Azelaic acid is an even more gentle option and it also works to reduce redness/brighten the skin. 
I also have struggled with painful cystic acne on my jawline for years. I only recently was able to get rid of it and allow my skin to heal by taking a saw palmetto supplement and another with chasteberry. I had previously taken a combination supplement for hormonal imbalances from a health food store that really didn‚Äôt do much for me even after taking it for three months. It wasn‚Äôt until I began taking a high quality version of these supplements (USANA), of which I was already taking the vitamins and fish oil etc. Within one month I noticed the acne was gone and I haven‚Äôt had any cystic breakouts since. 

I also notice when I eat ‚Äògreen‚Äô smoothies my face is very clear and ‚Äòglowing‚Äô as people will say. 

I also use tea tree oil and I enjoy that tingly fresh feeling. And recently began using a cleanser with saw palmetto in it (Origins Zero Oil) to decrease the oil on my face and have noticed a difference with that as well. 

I am still looking for the right product to help decrease my hyperpigmentation scarring but so far it has been healing/fading slowly on its own. 
Cheese and dairy are also big culprits of acne. Steer clear of those if possible. 
Personally I don‚Äôt reckon that the risk of Accutane is worth it with mild acne because I just think there are other routes to solving it without the potential side effects. A kid at school I knew went on it and wow was his skin incredibly dry, he was tired and also lost hair when his skin wasn‚Äôt even severe enough to have him go through all of that.

Personally I recommend exfoliating, wash face and also hemp oil. Drink a ton of water and apply vitamin E cream also. Cold showers for me give my skin an even tone also but I don‚Äôt know if there is any science behind them. It really is a case of trial and error, I mean I am nineteen now and have had acne since like thirteen and only now is it going as I am using this routine. Of course they say that the acne will go as you get out of your teens, but I‚Äôd massively put it down to what I‚Äôve been doing.

If you don‚Äôt mind the side effects Accutane really does work like very well, but your spots could come back also afterwards. 
1. stop squishing.
2. Washing more than twice a day really damages your face, your moisture barrier is probably wrecked, it happens.
3. No ‚Äúhot water, cold water‚Äù use warm warmer all the way through. 

What products are you using? Seems like you‚Äôre probably using harsh products, washing too much, and probably even scrubbing too hard. We‚Äôve all been there, do you know what your skins moisture barrier is?  


Edit, saw your products
For cheap good stuff, try clean and clear acne prevention and morning burst. Acne prevention in the morning, morning burst at night (names don‚Äôt matter, the point is that morning burst is a light wash that will leave your face fresh for the night, acne prevention keeps away oil for the day) use morning burst gel moisturizer and the regular spot treatment. PLEASE go easier on your face, you‚Äôre doing yourself no favors washing 3 times really hard and squishing.
Why don't you go over to r/SkinAddiction ? They have lots of good advice. I would suggest not touching the acne you currently have and maybe icing it so that the inflammation goes down a little bit. 
That is a really, really bad routine. You need to go much gentler.
Purpose face wash, witch hazel toner, cosrx spot treatment patches. Black soap or charcoal soap is also great. If you have the time I would look into the 7 step korean face care routine which does include the above. Its very moisture heavy but the snail serums, face masks, and cosrx definitely help with skin issues. I swear by it. 
As people said here before, you have too drying routine and these products are very harsh for your skin. (Bar soaps tend to have very high pH too.) You could start double cleansing and moisturizing better. There's also nice spot treatments like those cosRX pimple pads. What helped for me was changing skincare products, starting to gently exfoliate and using clay masks. There is nice tips also at r/asianbeauty  
Hot water is a no go. Warm water will be much better for your skin. Please get a gentle face wash (good affordable options have been suggested) and a gel moisturiser. I'd also recommend an spf to help prevent dark scarring. Ditch the soap. It is not ideal to wash your face with it, much less three times a day. It might seem like you're doing very little in the ways of damaging your skin, but your moisture barrier will probably need to heal. I get most of my acne on my cheeks when my skin is dry because my face is an asshole and its how I know something is wrong. Avoiding dairy might help but it isn't a cure all for everyone and didn't work for me. 
try this
1. do nothing
2. do nothing
3. avoid dairy 
4. avoid sugar
5. repeat step 1,2,3,4, and most importantly five.

:youd be surprised that if you give you face just time to breathe and mend on its own itll do a lot dont do antyhing just wash your face one time with normal water
Get the CosRx pimple patches! And honestly, practice makes perfect. Just remind yourself not to and eventually it‚Äôll subside. But I‚Äôve heard the patches really help! 
Having a fidget cube to mess with when I want to mess with my face really helps!
IF you have to touch them,do it with the upper side of your palm it is much cleaner than the the other side,also if you pop a pimple theres always a chance that it'll pop and that another one will take its place or there will be scarring,so basicly think like this when you are about to pop one - "do i need another one by tomorrow morning to greet me as i wake up" .I stopped picking myself and i have never been clearer since i started having pimples :)

edit-typos
you‚Äôre on accutane and you‚Äôre still using bp and retin a??? you‚Äôre suppose to stop using all actives when on accutane. your skin is extremely thin and fragile on accutane and you are risking some serious long term damage to your skin
Let go of the BP man, trust me. I used BP every single day, twice a day, for the past six years, until about 3 weeks ago after starting Accutane. Like you probably are, I was terrified about stopping the BP cause it was the only thing that had kept my acne somewhat in check all these years. But I gave it up cause I knew BP+Accutane  will dry you up like a motherfucker. Now all I use is a gentle non-medicated cleanser and a moisturizer, and my skin  is starting to clear up. Let the Accutane do its job man, from the inside out! 
Everything they said. 

Also sounds like you‚Äôre damaging the surface layers of your skin like mad. All of that washing, the topicals in addition to the accutane, just exacerbated your skin‚Äôs sensitivity. 

Damaged/fragile/dry skin=top layers that flake easily & panicking oil glands=loose debris and excess sebum=clogged pores=face demons. 

Dab salicylic acid (2% at most) on JUST active spots. (It‚Äôll stop bacteria from growing, break down sebum, and break down keratin deposits.) get some hydrocolloid bandages off Amazon so you stop touching active spots. 
Wash less, make sure your laundry detergent is fragrance-free (just to be extra sure) and give your skin a few weeks to figure itself out. 
Also talk to your dermatologist and listen to whatever they say. 
Washing your face more than two times a day could be drying out your face and is not good for your skin even if you do use moisturizer. That could be a reason
I just wonder if you do other things that can be more beneficial for you. Do you pick your face? Do you touch your face? Do you regularly change/wash things that touch your face? Pillow case? Towel? What is you lifestyle? Are you active? Did you eat well recently? (I know that the link between food and acne is kind of debatable, but you are maybe one of those who see a causality) Does your face touches people often , like in a hug? 
Just something to think about, sometimes managing those bacteries is more important than dry yourself out. 
Count yourself lucky my dude, your regime is one of the harshest possible things I‚Äôve seen. Benzyl Peroxide, which peels your skin, with Retin A, which peels your peeled skin while drying out your skin, with ACCUTANE, which makes your skin turn into a desert. Not only that, but you‚Äôre overwashing with 3 times a day, with the vitamin C (which is good when used properly) mildly exfoliating your face. Your exfoliating the living shit out of your face.

Accutane will clear you up. It takes time. Let go of the BP and Retin A. They are singular treatments!
Accutane is a monotherapy. Stop the bp, retin a and vitamin c serum. 
By ‚Äúpimple‚Äù, do you mean white spot, a head, or an additional area that‚Äôs raised more than the surrounding swelling? 
Also, stop squeezing, pushing, trying to extract etc. Pus, especially white or opaque fluid, is a sign of infection. When you mess with spots on your skin, you damage the internal cell structure and aggravate the area, which can cause the infection to spread. 


Trying using Cosrx pimple patch. I had a similar situation and I got fed up with it. I used one of those patches on it and within a few days it went away completely (changing the patch every 12 hours of course) and I have never had it come back. 
i have the copper, it‚Äôs the best decision i‚Äôve ever made. if you break out from one type of hormonal bc you‚Äôll most likely have a similar reaction with all. not worth jumping from one type to the other and risk getting permanent acne scarring in my opinion 
Have you ever tried a 3 month pill? 
The problem is masturbation. the moderator will probably try to take this down idk why but i'm trying to help this dude. google nofap acne! moderator lay off !!!!
Do you have any PIH? If so I suggest talking to your dermatologist about chemical peels. Keep in mind though they should not be done on active acne, so you may need to wait until after accutane. If this is the case, you can also ask your dermatologist how to exfoliate your skin in other ways. 
Hi, have you tried eliminating certain food groups or a low carb diet to see if it helps? Omegas and vit d can help too. I would try diet changes before accutane.

Stop smoking :) not only because skin, it‚Äôs bad for every organ 
Stop smoking, if that‚Äôs when it started, it should stop when you stop! 
I smoked for 10 years, couldn‚Äôt figure out why my skin suddenly got so bad the last three years I smoked. My skin cleared up in about a month after I quit. Quit smoking for your skin.
I'd stop smoking first. :) You could check if your shampoo has barabens, silicone etc (I'm not super familiar what kind of stuff is bad in shampoos when thinking of skin wise but there's a lot info online). Do you moisturize and cleanse properly? Maybe you are allergic to something that the new toner has? 
You should stop smoking. It‚Äôs not your shampoo or toner, friend. 
Just an update, Anw it turns out it‚Äôs the toner I‚Äôve been using. Exuviance soothing toning lotion!!! My breakouts stopped when I stopped using the toner, I even did a patch test on half of my face to make sure it‚Äôs the toner. 
Anyway there‚Äôs this pretty neat website I used to research on the ingredients comedogenic level. There‚Äôs one particular ingredient called ‚Äúoctoxynol-12‚Äù which is said to be 8 on the safe index. 


Benzoyl peroxide is best on these types of blemishes. 
Try green tea complex supplements and give it about two weeks
Wash your face after brushing your teeth; some toothpaste can exacerbate acne. (Found that out the hard way.) Make sure you‚Äôre not resting your face in your hands during the day, use the bp recommended above. 

Keep track of whenever food, drinks, or other things touch your chin. I once got a chin zit cluster a few days after eating a rack of bbq ribs, because WHY NOT DEPRIVE ME OF DELICIOUS THINGS, ACNE. 
Sorry for the white flecks, was an aspirin mask.
I haven't got any cystic acne in along time, but this was painful and appeared on Monday. Tuesday I iced it, and Wednesday I did a Bentonite clay mask but I exfoliated it a little bit too which I think made it worse.
It's flattened out, but what would you recommend to get rid of it ASAP? 
I can post my routine if necessary 
is it a bump? is it drier than the rest of your skin? is it tender to the touch? is it just a red mark? 
Ice it 3-4 times a day, it helps it shrink fast :)
Try tea tree oil, it worked for me before.
Hydrocortisone cream over night!

Yes. Stopping my birth control was a horrible decision for me. When I stopped birth control, my face and neck suffered from the worst acne I have ever seen on myself. I've always had acne, and I've always struggled with it, but I miss how "good" my face was before I decided to stop birth control. Anyway, I suffered for 3 months before re-starting my birth control with the hopes that my face would get back to normal. I have been back on birth control for about 3 months now, and things are getting better and looking up. It's still worse then it used to be, but it's getting there. Additionally, now I also have to deal with the scars that the acne explosion left behind. Moral of the story: my birth control is now my ball and chain forever (not really, but you knowwww). I never want to deal with that acne explosion again!
yup. recently got of bc pills and i am suffering from the worst breakout of my life. full on cysts everywhere. just started accutane a week ago.
Most acne is not caused by diet, usually it is hormonal, bacterial, or even fungal. But if your body is not used to certain foods and then you indulge in those foods in a short period there is always a chance for a reaction. For some it may be acne, for others irritated bowels. If you find your diet affecting your skin dramatically and consistently, pro-biotics may be a good option to try. Also teas, like green tea or peppermint, help some people because of the anti-oxidant benefits. It may just take a bit of trial and error to find what works for you.
My skin goes like that if I have too much sugar :(
The reason may be something like gastritis or reflux or anything on your digestive system. My cousin has problem like that and when he went a dermatologist, the doctor said it is not the food affecting skin, food affects the digestive system and that causes acne. He use pills for his stomach and now his skin has no acne.
My guess is your body isn't used to that diet. But I am using educated guesses.
people be posting pictures with 1 pimple and be saying help my face is extremely bad and I need help. Honestly those posts used to get me so depressed because my entire face was covered with extremely deep cystic acne. I had one cystic ance was so big, probably about 2-3 quarters size ($.25) big on my face. After taking months of steroid, antibiotic pills and a 6month course of accutane, my acne is gone But  I am left with deep cystic acne scars the same size of the cystic acne on my face. I've been off accutane for 6months exactly, and my scars are slowly getting better, hang in there.
What's funny is that when people post pictures of their insignificant 'acne' they get tonnes of advice but when people have really bad faces there's no real help, look at my post history 
There's a lot great tips and help at r/asianbeauty. I've had horrible acne too and had meds and treatments at beauty salons etc for it during the years. What helped for me a lot was changing skincare products and starting to double cleanse. Maybe you could start with these and maybe change your diet little be little? Tea is super healthy and easy to make. Don't lose hope, it'll get better sooner or later :) 
I have had acne for over a decade now. I think you should seriously consider accutane. I wish I had earlier. 
Everyone's here to help or they wouldn't be here ,don't be embarrassed at all
Look take bone broth from trotters (or hoof) of goat, buffalo or sheep for 2 years

Leave dairy diet, I mean all dairy, and gluten and any kind of nuts including coconut and dry fruits and stay on greens like broccoli and fruits

I had same immune system issue and i have fixed it, 

Do you get pimples elsewhere on your body as well? Like back of the neck or on thighs and back 

Do not discard the idea of accutane!!!!
You've probably tried remedies other than medication, but just to clarify, have you tried special diets, juice cleanse, etc?
Here is some advice i can give you. I am not sure whether it will help you in your condition, and there is some bro science involved in here. Some of the more educated people here, feel free to correct me if necessary.

Anyway, I had acne for 8 years. I am 21 now. I had my ups and downs. But now, for the past year, i think i have turned the tide, and am getting closer and closer to an acne free state.

Here is my advice. Pimples are harmless really. Give a week and they will fade away. Typically, in most cases (in mine as well), they are caused by hormones. That is common for teenagers, hence why they are usually the ones that get it.

Now, if you actually start popping pimples, you risk getting an infection. That's how i got acne on the jawline. It was just 1 small zit underneath my ear. I popped it and it multiplied, and everytime i would pop the new ones, that area would multiply even more and more.

Infections are hard to get rid off. They are deep inside your skin. You can't just pop them out anymore, and often they would turn red (known as inflammation, it means that your body is fighting that infection). Out of the non drug options you get tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide. I have used both. Originally, i started with benzoyl peroxide, and here is what i can say. There is a good chance it will make your acne worse. This statement mostly applies to benzoyl peroxide because it's much stronger, but it could apply to tea tree oil as well.

Why can it make your acne worse? Because contrary to the popular belief, oil on the skin is necessary. It's a protective layer. Benzoyl peroxide needs to go deep inside your skin. It will help you fight the infection, but it's strong. It will dry out your skin, and without oil, your face will be open to any bacteria. You put down your face on a pillow, and  BAM ... you just got yourself a new infection (which is usually much stronger than the original one). That's why you pair benzoyl peroxide with a mousturizer (if you think about it, a mousturizer is artificial oil).

Tea tree oil is a more safer option. In fact, when i was using benzoyl peroxide, i made by skin worse. Tea tree oil killed all the infections. It took about 2 months though, cause it isn't as strong as benzoyl peroxide, but it's much safer. Don't put it on everyday though. Definately don't put it on twice a day like some people are recommending. Let your face recover. It still has the same drying effect and you don't want it to backfire on you.

There used to be a time where i could put a hand on any area with lots of pimples. Wouldn't pop them or anything. And then i would bring it up to my nose and smell pus. After 2 months of tee tree oil, it was gone completely.

Honestly, fighting acne is all about patience. Go slow. And don't pop anything. Just not too long ago i have a spot that was still infected because i did that. It took me 2 weeks to put down the fire, but it feels like its recovering now.

Once you get rid of the infection, you will have a lot of spots on your skin, known as acne scars. Currently, i am in that stage. I read that it could take a year for all the scars to heal up. There are things that could speed up the process though, like vitamin C is very good at healing scars. I have invested in a mousturizer that has vitamin c in there, and it did wonders for me. But i am planning investing into something more powerful to kill it off for good.

> Also, here are a few tips i wanna give.

1) Don't use soap on your face. Face skin is sensitive. You will only irritate your face. Get a special soap if you want to wash your face with soap.

2) I found zynerit very helpful against normal pimples (not infected ones). Very easy to use. Just put it on, and it will be gone the next morning.

3) I knew a guy that been eating macdonalds for a whole months. Litereally only that (it was an exam month). His face got really really bad. It made me feel good though :), because my recovering face looked better than his, and just a month ago, his face was perfect.

Also, there is a girl i know that is about 10 years old. She is prety chubby, and she already has breasts, and she has severe acne. She likes fast food. I didn't have acne this bad when i was 10 years old. Honestly, my acne started becoming progresively worse in grade 9-10, when my popping lead to an infection. Anyway, clearly the girl has something wrong with her hormones. 10 year old girls shouldn't have breasts.

Anyway, i think the morale is clear here. Stay off fast food. I haven't had any for a month now. Looks up the food that can cause acne, and try to stay off it and see if it gives any effect. Personally when i was fighting the infection, i gave up all the sweet stuff, anything milk related, and also switched from beef to chicken (i read that beef can cause acne). Now that my infection is gone, i started eating nutella, jams and yogurts and it did have an effect on my face. I have limited it to jam only for now.
I can assure you
It's really , not that bad
One thing is for certain, if you sweat a lot, much of it will go away. You should completely eliminate sugar from your diet.
I guess makeup can also be a great idea.
I am a 22 year old African American with eczema and atopic dermatitis. I didn't really have a serious issue with acne up until about my senior year of high school. It has been consistent since then and on occasion (several times a year) it will get very severe. This is going to be a long ass  post so I'll try to condense it the best I can. 

TLDR: recurring atopic dermatitis and eczema, I eat clean, sometimes smoke and drink (have stopped for months at a time previously). 50/50 on drinking enough water. Am working on conquering depression, take Adderall. Blot hourly due to super oily face, acne this bad doesn't seem to run in my family, sometimes will pop a pimple. Sleep schedule isn't consistent, negative results on an extensive allergy patch testing that did not include food allergies.

I try to go to the gym about four times a week, in the last month have only been making it 2-3 times. I eat fairly clean. Mostly chicken, bacon, rice, beans, coconut milk, sunflower seeds (the raw ones with no salt) fruit, veggies, gluten free tortilla chips, and as of recent I've been making chicken curry that I'll eat throughout the week. I also try to eat gluten free, so unless I'm sampling something in a grocery store or just say fuck it every once in a while, gluten doesn't go into my system. I also try to avoid soy, but I consume that in small doses once or twice a week. I have also been avoiding dairy, save for eggs. I went about 2-3 months of no eggs, didn't see much of an improvement. I'm considering going vegetarian a couple days a week, or full on pescatarian to see if it's the meat that I'm reacting to. I do eat these vanilla mints from Trader Joes on a daily basis because (probably TMI) an hour after brushing my teeth and using mouth wash my breath will smell absolutely terrible, to the point where I don't point my head directly towards people when I talk. Hopefully it's not a part of a bigger problem...right? as far as acne goes?

I have been smoking weed on a somewhat regular basis, and I've been having a few drinks a couple times a week for the past month. Before you rain down fire on me, I'm aware that these are big factors with acne. As of today I'm cutting both of those out for at least a month, but I've had several stints of time where I'd go months without smoking, and only drink vodka (staying away from brown liquors) once or twice a month and didn't notice any significant improvement. Not sure if it's worth noting but my roommate is definitely a stoner and smokes almost daily.

I'll admit I've been kind of 50/50 with drinking water. Some days I'll hit close to a gallon, other days if I don't make a conscious effort to drink I'll have maybe 12 ounces. I change the sheets on my bed at least once a week, usually twice. I'm wondering if I should change the pillow cases more often since I do use olive oil in my hair on a daily basis. I'm also not that great with keeping my hands off of my face when there's a glaring pimple I want to pop. I'm definitely going to put more of an effort towards that, but I'd also like to know if in other people's experience if that was the difference between having moderate acne, and having a clear face.

SLEEP SCHEDULE. It's all over the place. I get 7-8 hours of sleep maybe once or twice a week. The rest of the time its usually between 3- 6 hours. I've never looked into it, but would this have negative effects on my face?

PRODUCTS. I've tried a variety of things, and I don't think I've come across a product that's been a complete game changer for me. My current routine is:
Morning- Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel. I only have it because my mom bought me a facial cleansing kit for Christmas, just started using it regularly about a week ago. Before that I was using a Trader Joe's facial cleansing oil that I actually liked. Follow that with Trader Joes Rose Water Facial Toner which is another new purchase. (Prior to that it was Skinfood Peach Sake Toner which I felt like worked really well for me in the beginning, but in the last month didn't seem to be doing much. Prior to THAT it was a Dermalogica Toner that seemed to work best, just haven't bought it again yet.)
After the toner dries I apply Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 2.5% that was prescribed by a doctor. Only been using it a couple weeks, doesn't seem to big a difference maker yet. I wait a few minutes if I have time and then put on my moisturizer, CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion for normal to dry skin. Up until last week I was using the Boscia Tsubaki Swirl Gel and Cream Deep Hydration Moisturizer which was nice until it ran out. Then about a minute after I dab some Burt's Bees Acne Solution Spot Treatment on a Q Tip and apply. Another few minutes and then its Dermalogica Hydrablur primer. Finally I follow it up with Bore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA+++. I love that stuff. Feels great on my skin, helps a bit with oil control. Unfortunately because I'm always in a hurry I only end up applying it a few times a week. Working on my time management :) I do have The Ordinary Advanced Retinoid 2% that I used at night, but I stopped using it once I got my prescription lotions because I wasn't sure if I should try to incorporate all of that into my routine.

Night: I use the Stridex Maximum Strength pads only, since I've heard that washing your face too much can actually cause more acne. Then I use the Tretinoin 0.01% I was prescribed. Wait a few minutes (sometimes) then apply the prescribed Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%. CeraVe Moisturizer then bed

CONCERNS. So obviously the recurring acne is my biggest concern. I'm the only one in my family that has acne this severe. Siblings, mom and close relatives have nice clear skin besides the very occasional pimple. Not sure about my biological father, I've only met him a few times but from pictures I've seen he didn't seem to have much of an issue either. Also my face is extreeemmeeellyy oily. Like, if I go longer than an hour and a half without blotting my face with tissue or paper towels, it gets super oily all over. T zone, cheeks, where my hairline starts, even eyelids. (Not sure if I should buy something specifically to blot my face with?)
And then my face has developed two things: very tiny wrinkles and these small bumps below my bottom lip. You can see the small bumps in the 4th picture, and the wrinkles in the last picture. There's also these bumps that are right under the surface of my skin of my cheeks that never come to a full head. They just sit there and I usually can't pop them. Lastly in the 1st picture there's a dark spot visible that's been there for...idk at least 4 years? It hasn't faded or lightened in the least bit, not sure what's up with that. I included a couple pics that show my full face so you could see that it just looks tired, worn out and beat up. It looks like that even when I do get a full nights rest and I don't know how to fix that.

To top it all off, I have little patches of eczema on my face that usually isn't visible once I moisturize. My doctor prescribed me steroids to take care of it, but did say that it's likely to cause me to breakout. But if I don't use it, whenever I get hot from the weather or from exercising, my face gets really hot and prickly and itchy and it's the worst feeling ever. And the eczema is still there.

Like the title says, I am literally ready to try anything. And I mean anything. I would've already seen a doctor about getting the acne scars removed through laser surgery if I didn't still have recurring acne. I'm eyeballing Accutane now, but I'm hoping there's some great products/methods/diets I haven't tried yet that's my saving grace. Oh, also I did get an allergy patch test. The one where I have tape all over my back for 2 days. I was told I got tested for over 150 things, and they all came back negative. But I was also told that they didn't test for food allergies since "in my situation it's not typically the case."

SIDE NOTES. I am currently working on conquering depression, and I do take 30mg a day of Adderall for ADHD. I was almost kind of hoping that something positive would come back from the allergy test so that I'd at least know what is causing all of this, but now I'm a bit lost. Best I can think is to start a super clean diet from scratch again and sleep more. Also, I will occasionally get a pimple or two on my thighs that doesn't come to a head. it just stays and eventually leaves.

If you have somehow read through all of this, even if you had nothing to contribute I genuinely thank you. I'm worn down and tired from fighting my body on a mental, emotional, and physical level, and it means the world to me that someone would take the time to read all of this. I know it's a ton of info but I tried to make it as thorough as possible. Any and all help is greatly appreciated!
I second everyone who has recommended making sure your laundry detergent is fragrance free. 

Change your pillowcase more often. I‚Äôm white as a baguette so I can‚Äôt speak to 4a-c hair care, but my 3a hair needs moisture constantly and I have color-coordinated pillowcases for nights where I have a mask in my hair. 
Also olive oil clogs pores. 
I change my pillowcase 2-3x a week (if I‚Äôm being good). 

Only use BP as a spot treatment, not all over. It‚Äôs drying out your skin which will make the oil production worse. 

Look into a safety razor for your facial hair. Bevel is black-owned and knows wtf they‚Äôre about when it comes to razors and black hair/skin. I won‚Äôt get into the science of it, but it could make a HUGE difference for your cheeks. 

What have you tried so far?
You could start double cleansing and maybe change moisturizer to a lighter one (oily skin doesn't like heavy moisturizers). Also you could search for a gentle exfoliant (maybe aha/bha etc), there's great tips at r/asianbeauty as well. Personally I'd eat even more veggies and less spicy food. 
A derm would be able to tell you best but from what I can tell it looks more like scarring and redness with some regular sized pimples. (Personally, I consider cystic acne severe)

 If those suckers feel deep and embedded into your skin then maybe go and have a chat with your derm, otherwise try changing up skincare regime/diet first and see if it helps! Could also just be hormones and you could wait it out to see if there's any improvement. 
not at all
More moderate than severe but I'd definitely recommend seeing a dermatologist, or at the least getting a consultation from a general practitioner, to see what treatment options are available to you.
[removed]
I don't use the TLDR guide... but I use BP twice a day after washing my face and then I put on moisturizer. That works for me!
Male 19 (almost 20)
Sorry if long but it's necessary info and can't glaze over it 

I haven't picked in about 2-3 months
I've been to the dermatologist and was on this BP cream and antibiotics
It helped but still not 100% clear
Everything visible in the picture is scarring minus the spot on my chin.
My forehead has broken out too a bit
My dermatologist wants to put me on Accutane but my insurance won't pay for it, or the alternative my derm sent over. 
I'd like to do laser but my insurance probably won't cover it and my dermatologist said to wait till my acne is clear.

Morning 
Wash face in shower 
Sometimes use witch hazel
Apply Cetaphil moisturizer
Put on Garnier oil free BB Cream (this isn't good for my skin, but for my self esteem)
 
I didn't use to have to but I have to blot constantly everywhere 

Night
Wash makeup off with Cetaphil cleanser
Wash face with Nivea cleanser
Every other night I'll use a sugar scrub with lemon
I have a Clarisonic brush too
Then I shower and wash it off
Then I apply witch hazel, and put on an aspirin mask
Let it sit, then wash off and put the moisturizer on 

Recently I reincorporated dairy into my diet and I feel like my recent breakouts might have to do with it. Oddly since I reincorporated it my cheeks stopped breaking out and it moved to tiny bumps on my forehead and I have this cyst like thing on my chin which hasn't broken out in forever

My forehead started breaking out of nowhere, and I think it might be a fungal infection so I am starting to use the Nizoral shampoo on it. 

All skin is different. I personally never purged with Differin but others do. So just hold off till after your event if you‚Äôre worried. Just remember to only use a pea size amount of the differin and 2.5% bp. And only apply at night ‚Äîdon‚Äôt glob it on thinking that will make it better faster. It‚Äôs a cumulative thing. All other items in your routine should be gentle and non medicated, meaning no acids or more bp. 
Hi! From a facialist point of view, you are using way too much different stuff. A simple 3 step from the same brand will do you much more good. 

Eg any time you use a different type product, your skin needs 5 full weeks to get used to it. By using different brands (which are all basically chemicals that aren‚Äôt designed to work with each other), you are resetting this daily and/or twice daily.

You only need daily:
Cleanser
Toner
Moisturiser

Once Weekly or every 2 weeks:
Cleanser
Exfoliant (it can be physical or chemical)
Mask
Toner
Moisturiser

Plus whatever your dermatologist has prescribed, exactly when and how they prescribed it. 

You‚Äôve clearly got the doing it part of the routine down (well done!!), it‚Äôs just refining it. 

From a makeup artist perspective there‚Äôs nothing that makes your makeup better than cleansing etc beforehand BUT it should be reserved ONLY for special occasions. 

From a skincare perspective you should never put makeup on after cleansing routine. So as for your BB cream, use it on its own. You will get much better results from doing your cleansing routine just at night purely from not putting makeup on after.

Hope this helps!!



Your skin is likely getting dehydrated from the bp and scrubbing and overproducing oil to compensate. 

You have hyper-pigmentation which is dark marks left after acne. The best way to reduce that is by using a retinoid. You can get one over the counter called Differin. You can even mix differin with the bp if you‚Äôd like to stay on bp‚Äîthis is basically making the prescription Epiduo on your own. Retinoids help with acne and the marks left behind. After time passes and acne has stopped, then you can consider laser treatments but that‚Äôs down the line. 
I have some Bentonite clay but I haven't used it much lately, I'll start using it again. If you see this reply, how do you use it? 
What do you mean "healed"?
I‚Äôll be honest with you, it took me months before my skin was back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I used a ton of BP out of desperation and my breakout got 10 times worse. I applied 3 parts Bio Oil, 1 part tea tree oil every night for MONTHS, and my skin went back to the same amount of acne I had before.
That stuff freaked my skin out. My acne just got worse and my face was peeling all day like a zombie. When I stopped using it and using retinA (before it was banned) it calmed down quite quickly.
A lot of it is genetic too. Some of us are simply more prone to acne.
It all boils down to hormones , pore size , skin type, and a bit of luck. Those with sensitive skin just need to work harder to keep it clear. Try using an oil free moisturiser if you can afford it. Its worth the extra price
Acne is not just a result of excess sebum. Keratinisation is the process in which cells in the lower layers of your skin differentiate into keratinocytes and travel up to the epithelial layer to be shed. Genetic factors linked to acne mean that this differentiation is hindered in some way so there is a buildup of cells in the surface of the skin. Vitamin A derivatives like Accutane and Differin don't only target the oil glands but also correct this differentiation process so the cell turnover rate is increases as they are made to differentiate faster. This means there is nothing on the skin to stop the sebum travelling up from the pore as it should and you have less clogged pores to harbour bacteria and therefore less acne. 
Sebum quality. You can be oily, but if your sebum isn't the type to clog, you won't get acne. Sebum quality and quantity can be determined by diet, environment, things you put on your skin, supplements quality of your skin etc. 
Generally oily skin isn‚Äôt really paired with not getting acne or at least spots. 

You are probably seeing sweat. Which when you cake makeup on has nowhere to go except drip down your face.
Well I've used it for my forehead when for what I thought was acne but turned out being a form of dermatitis that looks like acne but its actually a fungal infection. It worked out and my skin cleared up within a month and a half!
I'm currently experimenting with this on my chin/jaw. I'm in the midst of the mother of all breakouts and am waiting to start roaccutane for the 2nd time but saw suggestions to use Nizoral on fungal acne, I'm not sure if this is the type of acne I have, so as things couldn't possibly get worse I thought I may as well give it a try and tested it on a few spots. I started yesterday and tbh it's brought a few spots to a head and dried others out loads. Obviously your skin may be very different to mine and it's still early days for me but if you do try it just make sure you patch test first. 
It depends because Nizoral has harsh sulfates that may strip your skin, damage your moisture barrier, and exacerbate the problem. Typically I'd say if it is not meant for use on the face, don't risk it. 

I would recommend using an AHA & BHA peel like from The Ordinary once or twice a week, and their Niacinamide + Zinc serum in your AM and PM routine. Paula's Choice also has some great options, I personally use the BHA Skin Perfecting Liquid (salicylic acid) and Benzoyl Peroxide Daily Treatment. Both are affordable and available in trial sizes.
Don‚Äôt wanna be that guy with no natural suggestions, but I have a couple more treatment ideas:

- Epiduo: Make sure you use for at least 3 months before stopping. If you tried Retin-A in the past, did you consistently use it for 3 months or so? Sometimes people abruptly stop because they can‚Äôt see the results. It is meant to take a while.

- Azelaic Acid: Meant to exfoliate while getting rid of hyperpigmentation. I would expand on it but if you look it up it‚Äôs quite self explanatory.

- Accutane: If it is as horrible as you say, as problematic as you say, and as unresponsive as you say, Accutane will completely clear you up. You take it orally, 6 months. Obviously it has some stigma to it. You‚Äôll get side effects, but people exaggerate them. Mostly just dry lips and skin. Moisturise and use chapstick and you‚Äôll be fine.
Try switching your hair conditioner and avoid your hair touching your back in the shower. I realized that a lot of product residue got on my back and was causing it to break out. Washing/ conditioning my hair swept to one side has helped immensely. 
Definitely change your shampoo and conditioner, try something sulfate-free. And always wash your back after you're done washing your hair. Keep your hair up when finished washing either in a bun or wrapped in a t-shirt to keep it off your back. Irritating shampoo ingredients are a big cause for bacne for a lot of people. Also switch to a gentle fragrance-free cleanser for washing your back, like CeraVe. Don't scrub!
I've had the same problem for 7 years, nothing worked ever. Luckily I've finally found something that's working. Try taking 4,000iu of Vitamin D3 every day. After about 2 weeks to a month you'll see some improvement. Also, a very thin layer of grapeseed oil every day helps TONS with the hyperpigmentation left over from acne. 
Noble soap and stridex knocked mine out after years of trying everything.
Mine was never horrible, but tea tree oil baths helped me a lot. 
Same problem. I‚Äôve had this problem for years. Kinda limits your clothing choices.

Have you tried kojic soaps? I‚Äôve had noticeable difference on my bacne when I used them. 
Make sure your detergent, body wash and lotion is fragrance free. First thing I can recommend. I had body acne from HELL. Cystic zits on my back, dermatitis on the back of my legs, cleavage zits, you name it. 

All brand Free&clear laundry detergent. Antibacterial dial hand soap for body wash (I am not shitting you. It made me dry as hell, so I don‚Äôt actually recommend it, but it helped.) 
Cetaphil moisturizer. 

Acne went away. Took two months, but now, years later, the worst offenders are clogged pores between my shoulder blades 

(Eventually switched to neutrogena Salicylic body wash. That works well, still. Can‚Äôt use any body wash or lotions with any scent, even natural stuff from lush. Worth it to have a clear back.) 
Maybe sulfur soap? I totally get you, I've tried a ton of stuff for the rosacea on my cheeks...I'm about to try sulfur soap on the recommendation of my doctor and possibly doxycycline in a bit... I don't love the idea of using an antibiotic though.
um, I've never "tried" to do this on purpose before, but sometimes depression leads to me dropping skincare for several days or weeks at a time. I would not recommend it. It will severely impact your skin texture and lead to dehydration, unbalanced oil production, buildup of sebum and comedos, which leads to blackheads and poor skin texture as well as dull complexion. in terms of acne, in some cases not doing anything to my skin for a while will slowly end breakouts. but it's not reliable, and I would say it's more typical that not washing my face/moisturizing causes me to break out.
What is this regime?
My experience:

Been on caveman regime for past 2 weeks, and im extremely satisfied. However, I didn't drop everything at once, I started around 1.5 months ago dropping individual products one by one (first cetaphil washing, then the micellar water and finally even moisturizer).

So I'm a 19yo female, moved to the NL and started my first year of uni in september. I had weird skin, combining pimples, very bad overall redness and rashes, super oily, and bumpy surface. Never knew what to do, as acne treatments would make me super red and irritated, and 'redness' soothing treatments would break me out. Once when I went home I forgot to take some of my products, and so I only washed my face and moisturized before sleep. My skin was visibly better the next day. Then I came back to my routine -> back to usual acne. So one day I decided to try to not do anything, just warm water morning and night.

First 2-3 days - amazing. Never looked better. Skin was less red and oily, smoother, no new pimples, everything was healing. Then dryness came, but funny thing - your skin still looks amazing, but you FEEL it's dry af when you wash it. For me, dryness only became visible when I put on makeup (immediately removed it, looked terrible and flaky) or when I did sth requiring stretching my face too much lol, like eating an apple. Other people have said that this dryness is common and should stop after skin gets used to new routine. Waiting for that:) Occasionally I get some breakouts around my period time, but they only bother me for like a day, then they disappear quickly. 

So yeah, right now i'm sitting in my room and there's a mirror right next to me, and looking in it never felt better. My skin is not oily at all, even without using oil absorbing sheets (though I do use them from time to time when I'm out). I feel good, can leave home with no makeup and feel confident talking to people face to face. I even go to parties with no skin makeup and I still feel pretty, which 2 months ago was out of question.

Side note- of course everyone's skin is different, what works for me might not work for you. 

(I think I will have to start looking for some good sunscreen, as days are getting sunnier and I never reacted well to sun exposure. )

Good luck! And drink plenty of water, eat healthy (especially cut dairy), exercise, clean your pillow case and face towel every week, don't touch your face. 
Just wanted to give an update: day six of the full caveman: my skin never looked better - everything is less inflamed, my skin isn't oily anymore and some cysts came to a head and disappeared shortly after. (: 
It worked for my acne.  been nine years going, but you have to get supplementation right.  I supplement creatine, glycine, vitamin A, vitamin D, taurine, zinc, molybdenum, copper, vitamin C, selenium, iodine, calcium and magnesium.  And mitigate excesses, ie iron, with blood donation.  
It works bro all these products are bad for your skin
I have incredibly sensitive skin, and I can tell you what works quite well for me. First try taking vitamin D3 every day (2,000iu, after a month if there's no improvement try 4,000iu) that really helps, I also use a thin layer of grapeseed oil all over my face and that definitely helps, especially with the hyperpigmentation left over from acne. (If you go buy grapeseed oil, be sure its all natural and pure grapeseed, some brands mix other things like canola oil into it) For a spot treatment, try tea tree oil. Extremely powerful antiseptic, and has a nice cooling sensation to help with any painful acne. (I also only ever use Cetaphil as a face wash once daily, any other facial washes irritate and dry out my skin)
Try using tea tree (very diluted in coconut oil or rose hip oil)  and witch hazel. Also take vitamin E
Personally I would recommend switching to a gentle fragrance-free cleanser like CeraVe or Cetaphil. Paula's Choice has great acne treatments. I have sensitive skin too and use the BHA Skin Perfecting Liquid and Clear Benzoyl Peroxide Daily Treatment from there. Neither have caused any irritation, redness or flaking. You can get them in a trial size to test before you buy a big bottle and both last a good amount of time. 

Also The Ordinary has quality serums and peels. I use the AHA & BHA peel once a week as well as a Niacinamide + Zinc serum daily. For moisture, add a couple drops of either pure squalane or rose hip seed oil to your moisturizer. Works wonders.
Both have helped my skin immensely. I have a silicone one though (the Foreo Luna Mini 2). The nylon brushes of VP/Clarisonic etc can be really abrasive on active acne and the bristles harbour bacteria even if you replace them as often as you need to. These two point meant silicone was the way to go for me. Everyone‚Äôs skin is different though and I have friends who adore their VP/Clarisonic 

The mask is so awesome and I definitely recommend it. My skin is always visibly improved after I use it. I mix mine with 1 part Aztec, 1 part charcoal, and 2 parts water. If you have oilier skin, you might benefit from using ACV. 
is that the side you sleep on? How often do you wash your sheets/pillow cases?
This looks like it might be hormonal. The same thing will happen to me where I get acne on one side of my face, but usually the next month it switches sides, which tells me it has to do with which of my ovaries is ovulating since they are supposed to switch every month. 

For me, cutting out dairy helps calm hormonal breakouts. And watching my sugar intake. And not binge drinking. Spearmint tea helps too cause it lowers androgen hormones.

For the scars, sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen. Also my skin really likes the Niacinamide and Zinc serum from The Ordinary, which is only like $5. Niacinamide  is supposed to fade scars as well as communicate to your cells to control sebum production. Zinc has been known to have acne-fighting properties. 
Change your pillow cases nightly and try to sleep flat on your back 
What‚Äôs your routine and diet ?
Do you rest your hand on that side of your face? Do you wear your hair to one side? Do you drive a lot, and is this the side that faces the window? Do you put your phone on this side of your face? Since your acne is localized it seems like that this could be a physical interaction. I would change your pillow case more often, try every other day and see if that helps. I know that sounds like a lot but many people claim that it helps them.
All I can say is that I had a huge breakout on my right cheek for many months and it eventually cleared up a bit, but I still get acne predominantly on my right half. Haven't had a breakout on my left side though. I do sleep on my right side sometimes and I guess I may touch the right side of my face, but I did not stop doing that to clear up that cheek. I feel your pain and I just encourage you to hang in there.

Side you answer phone on?
Bruh... think about it. You literally completely changed your diet to foods you probably did not enjoy as much. You lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks. You were anxious. You were way more STRESSED during those 2 weeks. 

Then you returned to your normal eating habits and the big event had passed. You were much less STRESSED. 

Do you see my point? It never hurts to try to clean up your diet. Try not to be so extreme and give your body time to adjust. 
My acne is completely correlated to my diet. For me and a lot of people, there's a two week to a month turnaround period from when what you eat affects your face. How well were you eating before you started the diet? Its very well possible that what you ate that week causes your break out, and the restrictive diet is why you're clear now. There's a simple way to test though. Since you've gone back to how you ate before the diet, stay on it for a couple weeks and if you start breaking out again, then you know you're restrictive diet was helpful, just delayed. Another theory is based on how much fruit you were eating. I cant tolerate any sugar do I can't eat any fruits because of their sugar content. Is it possible you were eating as many fruits as to actually increase your daily sugar intake compared to your original diet? 
i eat so much junk food everyday i dont get breakouts, some people have specific triggers which cause them to break out.  It depends on person to person but yeah i agree nutrition is important too, vitamin deficiencies aren't good
I don't believe there is a secret perfectly balanced diet that will help everyone's acne, or healthy problems in general. There seems to be no truly conclusive information in either direction for whether some foods or diets "cause" breakouts. There is a lot of anecdata that dairy may be acneic for many people, but certainly not all. If there are any perfect diet balances, they seem like they would be different for different people.

One aspect of your situation is that you only followed this diet for 3 weeks. I know that with medication, it can take 1-2 months to go through "purging". I'm not suggesting this is what you specifically went through - just that your experience is unique and IMO proves nothing, and suggests nothing in regards to what others should do, it is only suggestive for what you should do.
See a professional who can drain if you are NOT ON ACCUTANE, after they drain it make sure that they flush it with antibacterial, and cover it with rapid skin recovery patch 
I'm no expert, but bar soap always gave me bad acne. I switched to an all natural tea tree oil based soap called Dr. Bronners and it's really helped clear up my acne. (No face acne but some stuff on my back and shoulders). Lasts awhile too. I've already responded to another post about acne recommending the same thing so I hope nobody thinks I'm sponsored or anything. Anyway, that doesn't really sound like normal acne to me at all. Could be a skin condition if it's something that doesn't go away and never comes to a head. I would see a dermatologist if I were you.
There's a lot great tips at r/asianbeauty, but it'd change the bar soap for starters and exfoliate and moisturize with gentle products. :) If it doesn't help you could visit a dermatologist as suggested
Hyperpigmentation is more common in dry skin and sun exposed skin. Is the climate dryer where you are? Or are you getting more sun without using sunblock or reapplying throughout the day (super important in minimizing hyperpigmentation!)
Do you use any type of hair products that can get onto your forehead? Hairspray always breaks my forehead out. 
How much sleep do you get per night?

This!!! I had this before. And it is a major bitch. I went to see a dermatologist about it. What I did after that; I cut off dairy and sugary products, when I shampoo my hair, make sure the product ALWAYS stays away from the  face. You have to let the acne grow bigger then apply benzoyl peroxide to treat them. Here is the recommended routine. I have the same type of skin as you do too.

Morning 
1. Face wash
2. Toner (alternate)
3. AHA cream (for scars and acne)
4. Vitamin C
5. Sunblock 

Night 
1. Face wash
2. Moisturizer 

It took me a month or less to have them gone 
I also use 0.025% and i cleanse my face with cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and use epionce medical barrier cream afterwards. 
Apply to your face at night 30 minutes after a thorough, gentle cleansing when your skin is completely dry; ensure that your hands are also clean. Spread evenly over your skin, avoiding eye and mouth areas and any open wounds. Wash hands after applying. For more information visit mintrxpharmacy.
1. Yes, it's probably best to ask your dermatologist what your options are. Severe scarring are often difficult to mitigate with OTC treatments.

2. I am not sure why you did your blood test and I'm not sure which medication will be prescribed to you so it's best you ask your derm first. Medications like spiro and accutane often require a blood test prior to taking the medication.
You should look into laser treatment for severe scarring 
The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of Zinc for 19+ year old individuals is 40mg. 

50 daily is quite a lot. It's fine for a few weeks at most. Just make sure not to make it a long-term thing. Space it out.
That is really great. I will probably start in the following days as well, since nothing else works. What form do you take ?

I am thinking of Zinc picolinate 22mg. The only thing that troubles me is the Zn-Cu balance, but I guess a low-dose won't be a problem
Awesome! Zinc helps my acne, as well.
Vitamin D also helps. 
Oh wow. I have a bottle still half full but I find myself skipping it cos of the stomach issues it gives me‚Äîand I take the capsule with food. 
How do you put on the Aloe vera? Do you leave it on? Wash it with your face soap? Wash with just water?
Do you tolerate zinc well?
I had them prescribed to me by my dermatologist to take in the mornings. 
They gave me such nausea I had to stop taking them. I felt on the verge of throwing up every time I took them. It was awful. 
What does the label of the supplement you're taking say? I hear there's two different types of zinc supplements and one doesn't work, so i want to get the right one

Are you vegetarian by any chance? I just read an article suggesting high bread and grain diet and less meat leads to less zinc absorption. I recently cut down on meat and am currently pretty much vegetarian and have gotten the worst outbreak. No other explanation I can see as I am still avoiding trigger foods (e.g. dried fruits). 
Looks like PIE and scarring 
Take something transparent, like a piece of clear plastic, and push against a spot and see if the redness is gone when applied pressure. 

If it's gone = PIE. (Sorta like inflammation) 
If nothing happens, it's PIH. (Hyperpigmentation)

Good stuff to use is aloe vera, vitamin C, BHA, niacinamide (find skincare items w this in it's ingredients) 

Both will go away over time, but it might take awhile depends on your habits/environment. WEAR SUNSCREEN because the sun makes those marks worse/harder to heal. I have both at times and I find PIE takes longer to fade away. Eitherway good luck!
Can you elaborate?
How did it work for you? Are there any downsides? 
Yesss! It‚Äôs completely cured my acne. I‚Äôm using the whole range. Deffo worth investing in. I think they sell it on Amazon
It might be product build ups. Do you usually double cleanse?!
Do you rest your face in your hand a lot? 
Currently have pimples on my jawline as well. Mines started off like yours ( football helmet ) was causing it. Don‚Äôt pop them, I don‚Äôt want anyone to repeat my mistake. Just leave them alone or you‚Äôll end up with scarring like I‚Äôm currently dealing with. Red marks that last like 2-4 months. If it gets worse, go to your dermatologist because you don‚Äôt want to take any chances of your skin getting scarred.
i slept on my arm and had this problem. I stopped doing that and it has improved
Currently using Neutrogena gentle cleanser and pore refining toner. I‚Äôve had acne my entire life and nothing has really been successful 
Any product recommendations?
Are you stressed at all?
The other side of my jawline also has acne, just not as bad. I also have acne on both temples.
Are there active pimples or just scars?
I'm using bp with differin. I added TO niacinamide to my routine a few weeks ago and I'm liking it! I have the azelaic acid too, but use it less frequently. Did not notice any problems. I moisturize with the cerave moisturizing lotion 2x/day because differin made me peely.
Holy shit. Your skin looks so different. Congratulations on your progress.
Amazing progress! Accutane might give you a breakout at the beginning, but it‚Äôs worth it. Congratulations!
ahh oh my gosh I bet you‚Äôre so happy. congrats!
Great progress!! What‚Äôs your routine like??
yess !!!!
wow it looks amazing!! i have acne in the same area. cheeks/lower chin area/around mouth or whatever. some are whiteheads and some are little red marks like yours. I'm 2 weeks into my second round of Doxycycline. I'm hoping it helps me.
Right on!
The bigger concern IMO is pink eye, not acne 
In my opinion you would more likely break out from the irritation you caused by this whole multiple cleansing than from the shit itself.....please calm down and leave your face alone ;) 
I think if you washed your face you should be okay. You could always put hydrogen peroxide on a cotton ball and wipe your face. 
r/tifu
this is hilarious
This made me laugh, sucks though but it shouldn‚Äôt cause acne
It honestly looks like a burn I‚Äôve never seen anything like it
Dude your skin is fine. Maybe you should get a new partner though 
Lemme put it this way... I'd take your complexion in a heartbeat!!
Some extra info: My partner of 6 years recently brought up my acne scars. He was suggesting I should try laser treatment because it would help improve the texture of my skin and therefore make me look...well...pretty. I am in a constant battle with my skin and it is now somewhat stable. Hearing that was heartbreaking and brought back a lot of insecurities. So my question is, does he have a point? 
They‚Äôre not distracting at all... it‚Äôs hard because when having a partner I guess they should make us feel good about ourselves. You can always try microneedling if YOU want to do it, not because some dude said something to you. Fuck that.
They are not bad at all. My scarring is muchhhh worse than yours and people tell me they can't even see them. I don't think you should worry. I know it seems like he is being cruel, but maybe he rally just wants what is best for you?? I am so sorry you had to go through that though :(
No, they‚Äôre not distracting. If we were talking, I‚Äôd be looking into your eyes 90% of the time. And even when I noticed your scarring, it would mean nothing to me in the grand scheme of your appearance.
I‚Äôm guessing he suggested that because it may help you to feel more confident in your skin, but I get why that comment made you feel self-conscious. 
I don‚Äôt think people are all that distracted by physical imperfections- I‚Äôm trying to come to terms with that reality, myself. 
Just take care of yourself in whatever way makes you feel confident in your appearance, doing what you can to feel comfortable with yourself is what‚Äôs important.
I hope you feel better.

No, I wish my skin looked that good.
No, I really don‚Äôt think they are distracting at all. Your skin is beautiful and even though I do see the scars when I look at your pictures, I think you have a pretty even skin. I hope you will talk to your partner about how his comment made you feel. Maybe ask him about his intentions with the comment. This is important. You should feel beautiful and he might‚Äôve had good intentions but it made you insecure and that‚Äôs not how your partner should make you feel. 
What scars? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Your scars are barely noticeable... and very, very, very shallow. I would not do any harsh lasers or peels as you risk just making your skin worse. Maybe you should just talk to your partner. 
OP can you give us an update on this whole situation?
Do you eat before bed at all? Like after dinner snacks?
Processed food is bad for your health and causes acne.  Get rid of the cheerios! 
Vitamin C works great for scars and hyperpigmentation
That and aloe vera,personally had aloe heal my pih faster than vitamin c
Tea Tree Oil
Cosrx pimple patch always did the trick for me 
Buy differin. Buy persa-10 gel. Put one dot of each on the back of your hand and mix them. Put it on your pimple. It‚Äôll go away very quickly!! 
This mixture is what epiduo is, just MUCH cheaper. It works for many. 
Thre is no any shortcut for anything if you will for everything you should have patience. And if you want some tips for a pimple then you can try some home remedies. Like you can apply vitamin E oil, Put ice on it, Use vinegar, You can apply papaya juice, Tea tree oil is also good for a pimple. You should try things it will help you get rid from a pimple.
There is no shortcut for anything. So you have followed some routine to get rid of a pimple. Apply ice cubes on your pimple, Tea tree oil is also good for a pimple, You can use toothpaste also, Steam your face, These are the simple way to get rid of a pimple.
Ice them little rascals, thrice a day. Helps them shrink fast.
How long have the marks been there? I get red marks like that if I've had a pretty grisly spot but they usually go away after a month or so 
no it will not, spf doesn‚Äôt add up like that. your max level of sun protection is still spf 55
Sunscreen doesn't stack. You only have the SPF of the highest level of SPF that you're wearing. SPF 55 is more than enough, if you use a sufficient amount and reapply often enough. 

> For patients who really wish to know ‚Äúhow high should I go?‚Äù I suggest products with SPFs no lower than 30 and no higher than 50. In addition to an SPF of 30+, your sunscreen should include some combination of the following UVA-blocking ingredients: zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, avobenzone, ecamsule, and oxybenzone.  Sunscreens with both UVA and UVB protection may be labeled multi spectrum, broad spectrum, or UVA/UVB protection. 

>Source: skincancer.org, written by Steven Q. Wang, director of dermatology at Sloan-Kettering, NJ
55 is plenty. In all honesty you probably don‚Äôt need that much at all
Every case is different of course, but I called my doctor to request a different treatment, and she said that all other treatments are just band aids, not cures. She said prolonged antibiotics were not good, and she wouldn‚Äôt prescribe them again. 

I‚Äôm surprised your doc didn‚Äôt try a topical though. 
Curious to know how you got rid of your acne. I don't see any scarring, and while your pores are a bit enlarged, I think your skin looks wonderful. I see your skin is a bit red, so maybe once that has calmed down, your pores will be less noticeable as well. 
I‚Äôd kill for your skin. 
I had that problem too. Quite severe. I followed my dermatologist advice to apply toner after I wash my face. And it worked ! I hope it does for you too. Neutrogena non alcohol toner is wonderful. Note that this is meant for the open pores
Your skin looks great! 
Make sure you wear SPF every morning. Your skin looks great by the way! 
Any recommendations for sunscreen for acne prone skin? Last time I tried la Roche posay 50+ face sunscreen and it still broke me out (though admittedly this was a while back! Would appreciate suggestions :)

I have been using 99% aloe Vera on my skin and it's evened it out A LOT. It's a natural way to go about healing, too, it's good for acne, scarring, sunburns, etc. I think I read once that your skin may be more sun-sensitive with it so I guess use a good sunscreen alongside it 
Hello! I see sensitive and oily skin (I do skin analysis for my job so can help some but without feeling it and examining thoroughly it will be a little less than perfect answers), however Make sure you don‚Äôt confuse sensitive skin with irritation from products eg allergy soreness. 

By using sensitive products this will calm your skin. Finding one for oily and sensitive is difficult, however by avoiding harsh ingredients in an oily skin set of products you should do well. It‚Äôs more personal choice. 

If you are on any medication or have used lotions to help with acne, or your environment is very hot/cold or sitcom/stuffy then oiliness can be masked by that and will just be dehydrated. In this case, using oily skin products without harsh ingredients and a separate moisturiser for dry skin, staying hydrated and keeping your environment in check will help you immensely. 

You have beautiful skin and pores are just pores and they won‚Äôt ever change size, but I would avoid using ‚Äòpore filling‚Äô products as they will cause further irritation and may cause blemishes themselves. 

Scars can feel like you still have acne for a while, I was covering mine a lot as I still looked sporty even though I wasn‚Äôt. However after around 6-12 months post acne I saw a huge improvement myself and didn‚Äôt use any scar ointments (avoid anything like bio oil or scar treatments on your face unless you use a specific facial product).


Have you tried using a make up primer after your moisturizer? My pores are large as well.. I find that this helps keep my face matte and my pores ‚Äúfilled‚Äù. I use the Smashbox primer, it goes on clear!
I loved it and it changed my skin in an amazing way. I had literally been through everything else - accutane, antibiotics, birth control and every topical cream ever on the market.

I still get an occasional pimple but nothing like what it used to be. I just use a regular over the counter cleanser and moisturiser - cetaphil and wear makeup every day. 

Seriously, spironolactone was a game changer for me.

Make sure you drink loads of water as a it‚Äôs a diuretic. I do sometimes get a little dizziness if I stand up too fast, but nothing that impacts my life significantly.
Spironolactone was my saving grace. Finding the correct dosage took a few months but now I only get a few pimples near my period. 
I used to wear heavy makeup everyday and now I rarely wear a light foundation. I hope it can work wonders for you too!
I personally hated it. I was prescribed spironolactone about a year ago and no matter how much water I drank or how much I ate before hand it irritated my stomach so much. I missed so much school because I would be puking in between classes. My body never adjusted to it and I stayed on it for months before I stopped taking it. 
A few weeks to a month and there was no purging like with other drugs.

My skin is not perfect now and I still get a couple spots every month but it‚Äôs miles ahead of where it was.
Definitely skin cancer with months to live. Months. 
There is no such severity threshold for acne that you need before seeing a dermatologist. If it bothers you, you should definitely give it a shot.
I would love to see pictures if you‚Äôre comfortable posting! Always looking for recommendations to calm/dissolve cystic anceüò£
Warm water is best. Hot water will definitely aggravate acne. 
No.
I personally like to start out with a warm shower, then close my pores back up with cold water at the end.
Cold water closes pores
Hot water opens it 
I only allow cold water to touch my face 
You can shower with hot water but then just let cold water hit your face
Those just look like cysts to me, not PIE or PIH? 
I've switched from milk to almond milk (although still use butter) in hopes to somehow help my acne. It looks like I have my acne under control, not this redness is bothering me... any tips and treatments?

Thanks!
Are you using anything to combat it? What does your skin care routine look like?
Last time I went to the one in square one, they were out of a few products in the ordinary line. 
I've read to wash your face both before and after going to work out.  
I thought sweating was good for your acne as long as you wash your face afterwards

Hmm try wiping your sweat with small towel instead of using the head bands
I heard lightly wiping sweat is best,I've heard you shouldn't let sweat dry on your face
Are you over cleaning your face? You might just be irritating it. Sweat doesn‚Äôt clog pores. So sweat can‚Äôt cause your acne. What can cause your acne is irritation. If you panic and start washing your face more than twice a day it will make things a lot worse.
First suggestion is to take note on how effective the current products are.

Second suggestion is to take note of any negative side effects.

I personally prefer all natural products, as the medicinal ones left me with unbearably dry skin/lips, sun sensitivity, and worse acne than when i started. 

Thankfully im clear now, but if theres no significant improvement after another few weeks, id recommend looking for alternatives. 
It does not make my acne worse. 
That's what I use and I love it! Not greasy or anything 
Upvoting so someone else who actually has legit experience with/knowledge of Accutane will see this and hopefully comment, but also there are a couple questions I have for you. First, how long has your acne been present at this severity? And second, what other medical treatments have you tried which did not completely work (acne creams, antibiotics, etc)? Accutane is not anything that someone tries as a first option, generally due to the potential side effects, but you might already know that. I also assume you have seen a dermatologist, and I would be interested to know what he/she had to say about your acne.
your acne is mild at best, and it‚Äôs not cystic. if you have exhausted all other options then bring it up to your derm to see if they are willing to prescribe it to yoi
Hey, I‚Äôm on accutane right now, 16th day to be exact.
I have worse acne, cystic, battling it since I was 13( am 18 now ), but believe me, if it is not hormonal, it will last.
Everyone says that it should be the last option, but in my opinion, if you want it to go away, go on Accutane. It is worth it. We all have different reactions to different medications, some may experience worse side-effects than others, but it is granted to go away.
Personally I have tried cutting diary, eating healthy, working out, naturist medications, nothing worked.
It was my last option too, being scared of the side-effects... but haven‚Äôt experienced anything else than dryness and a little fatigue, which are worth having for a couple months until my acne fades away hopefully.
Even though some can be affected by other worse side-effects, they won‚Äôt last forever, like baldness, head aches, back pain, etc and if I were to have any of those, excluding anxiety/depression, I would still think it is worth the try.
Alas, depression or anxiety ain‚Äôt joking around. It can affect your entire life, which wouldn‚Äôt be that worth on my side.
I was desperate for a clear skin, I still am. If you are already depressed/anxious, it is not recommended to go on Accutane.
Hope that helps, if interested in more, shoot me a PM! 
You can totally go on Accutane for mild acne if it is persistent enough/causes scarring. Other methods (topicals, antibiotics) generally have to fail first. I'm on Accutane for mild (leaning moderate on occasion) acne since I've had it for about 10 years. So far, no regrets - although the side effects sure are annoying! Talk to your doctor/dermatologist. 
If it bothers you enough, I'd say go for it.
As someone who took bactrim from 12 years old all the way to 25 years old and took accutane a few years ago, definitely worth it.

I heard horror stories of all the side effects and they can be true, but the payoff was worth it in that it got rid of my acne forever. It's like a great weight has been lifted after all these years
Antibiotics don't "target" any area as far as acne goes. But they should clear up acne in all areas. 
Typically Benzoyl Peroxide is used before moisturizer, allowed 10-15min to absorb, then moisturizer applied on top. Also a 2.5% BP is recommended because of less side affects. It is just as effective as higher percentages. 
OP, please go to a dermatologist. OTC products are mostly only effective for mild to moderate acne.
You really look like a candidate for Accutane.

If you can't get a hold of a Derm, any GP can prescribe tretinoin/clindamycin topical or Benzamycin topical with oral doxycycline which will be better than anything you can get over the counter.

Plain old BPO or tretinoin isn't really appropriate initial treatment given the severity of your acne.
[deleted]
You look like me a few years ago. Except I didn‚Äôt do shit. Definitely see a dermatologist 
Before trying accutane, try using topical prescription. I recently started curology with azelaic acid, clindamycin and zinc pythricone & after a week of purging, my skin is finally cleared up. My skin has been responding well to the formula so my next bottle will have tretinoin, clindamycin, and azelaic acid
hey lucky shamrocks SCREW YOU!!! i'm trying to help this guy. masturbation acne is not a myth. i'm not trying to lead him on. i'm trying to help him you stupid moderator
Is your skin dry or oily? Or a mix of both?

I'd recommend trying Blistex's Stridex Maximum (red box) salicylic acid pads 2.0%. Start once a day for a week. Apply at night before bed after a gentle wash. Then after a week apply morning and night. 2 pads a day. Don't moisturise if your skin isn't dry. The pads are alcohol free and aren't drying, and once you have wiped your face over, the salicylic acid stays on until you next wash. Salicylic acid slowly breaks down keratin, unblocks pores, prevents sebum and dead skin forming a plug and therefore is also preventative. I know cystic acne is deeper but it can help.

There will likely be initial irritation starting BHAs and existing blockages take time to break down so give it 4-6 weeks before altering anything. 

AllStarHealth do good deals on Stridex pads. If you're in the US it's even better but I import the from there to the UK. Don't get Paula's Choice BHA, it's grossly overpriced and a big con.

Oh, extra word of advice... Don't rely on cetaphil gentle skin cleanser if your skin is oilier than usual. The reason I say this is because as a cleanser it is so gente that it fails to remove a lot of crap from the skin. I changed to cetaphil oily skin cleanser and that was much better but only use it with warm not hot water. 

What is your diet like btw?

Only use Accutane as a last resort. I went on a puny 10mg dose of Accutane for several months and while it worked, once I stopped taking it the problems came back and I was left with permanently dry nasal passages long after quitting it. My acne though was only moderate, but I was put on it because I had tried everything under the sun and my primary concern and cause of acne was my super oily skin. So far now for me diet control and Stridex salicylic acid pads have mine under control by preventing blockages and reducing sebum productivity. 
I had very similar scarring and acne patterns and I‚Äôve been on accutane for 2 months seeing good results so far. Definitely speak to your family doctor or dermatologist and they‚Äôll be able to figure out the problem before it causes more scarring. 
I see people down voted a comment about cutting dairy and sugar and dairy actually does play a role in cystic acne, at least it did for me. I still get acne but not cysts like I used to. Changing your diet can help and before you run to accutane I'd suggest having a dermatologist get you a couple of topicals to try out. I personally hated accutane and didn't last a month on it because it was causing me bad muscle pain. But I've found that topicals can work really well if you get the right ones for you. Once your acne goes away a bit more you could ask about a bleaching topical to help get rid of the scarring.
[removed]
Cut dairy and sugar from your diet for 2 weeks. Sew what happens
op is a cute guy, would date
My skin is very dry and sensitive (it‚Äôs red because I itch at it from it being so dry) I take VERY good care of my skin, it‚Äôs not over worked or dehydrated either. I‚Äôve been on accutane twice and both times acne came back after 6 months to a year. Topical treatments do not work for my skin and they never have.
Is it by any chance fungal?
Looks really sensitive. Shot in the dark but could be rosacea, compromised moisture barrier or even a skin allergy if your skin is sensitive and there are various products which could be the culprit?
Fungal acne! I know you said you‚Äôve been checked but I had forehead acne like you and it got sooo much better from Nizoral shampoo! 14$ and I say give it a go girl 
I like the conversation you‚Äôve planned out. Remember that even though they‚Äôre doctors, they‚Äôre providing a service and you‚Äôre their customer. Be firm, you got this!
There is a lot of variability in GPs. Can understand your anxiety. 

The most useful tips I can give is:
1. Be very clear and to the point with your acne 'history'. The harsh reality of the UK GPs is they only have 10 minutes to see you so be clear but I wouldn't agree with the comment below about being firm. I mean you are there to consult with them so try to be open to the comments of the GP and their medical training as well as things read on reddit (my post included!). Things that the GP will want to know (most of which you told us above) is 
a) your experience with acne (Duration: 10 years, recurrent (have you noticed any 'monthly' pattern at all etc. get PIH post break out, Distribution: mainly cheeks jaw, forehead and nose, How it has affected you: confidence etc.)
b) A clear chronological breakdown of what treatments you have tried in the past.

I think it is worth mentioning that you would like to try epiduo but the reality is that GPs have relatively structured guidelines to follow when treating acne.

Try not to get disheartened if things don't work the first time. They won't give up on you. But the way the NHS is structured they have a bit of a stepwise approach that they have to use (obviously does have some variability based on severity) but usually:

1. BenzylPeroxide Alone
2. Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill (The implant you have is just oestrogen. It is oestrogen + progesterone that has been shown in some studies to treat acne. But obviously your GP and yourself would have to consider whether this is appropriate from a contraceptive side of things.)
3. Combined creams like Epiduo/ Antibiotic creams
4. Oral Antibiotics
it goes on. but you get the point!

If I am honest I would be surprised if they don't start you on benzyl peroxide alone first as it doesn't look like you have tried this. I know this might be disappointing but used correctly benzyl peroxide can be a bit of a wonderdrug when used correctly for acne.
What I would say is get a good but fragrance free moisturiser if you get benzyl peroxide or Epiduo. Something like Eucerin night.

Hopefully this is helpful. Please don't take this as gospel because YMMV. 

As far as logistics for prescriptions normally they will give you enough for 2-3 months then ask you to come back to review and change things if needed. Once you have found the treatment that works for you then that will get put on repeat prescription and then depending on the 'risks' associated with that medication will just review you every year or so if you are still needing to use it regularly.
i have the exact same type of bumps all over my nose and they are also from past pimples many years ago. epiduo will not work, ive tried it myself. it is used to treat active acne, not scar tissues. the only thing that helped was getting some of the bigger bumps lasered off
What skincare/treatments have you tried?
what are the side effects of accutane ?
you should get a sleep study done so you can rule out sleep apnea.  Sleep apnea may be fatal if left untreated.  

for sleep, there are a lot of OTC supplements (magnesium, melatonin, glycine, 5htp) you can try as well as lowering the temperature of your bedroom and restricting light.


Unisom works for me,although it literally leaves you groggy,melatonin is good,some people use supplements like skullcap or valerian root,personally tried both of them for sleep and it worked

Glycolic acid will help a bit with evening out skin tone and possibly lightening dark spots left by acne scars. I beleive Glycolic acid is an AHA while Salicylic acid is a BHA. Using both in your routine is usually fine. I use both and have my acne relatively under control. I use stridex pads in the morning and Glycolic acid in the evening before bed. 
Glycolic acid helps lighten the dark pigments within your skin. To my experience, it‚Äôs not fast acting but if you give it a little time, it does work. 


I heard that you shouldn‚Äôt use them together (ie. don‚Äôt apply salicylic acid and then glycolic acid after). Try to separate them - salicylic acid during the day and glycolic acid at night. 

Btw ALWAYS wear sunscreen the day/week after using glycolic acid at night. The acid is really sensitive with sunlight and could lead to a dark pigment on areas where you didn‚Äôt use sunscreen (in my experience/vague understanding). 
Me too!! So frustrating because they're so deep and I can't do anything about them :( and even if I don't touch them they always leave marks. I just put some drying lotion or w.e its called (the pink stuff) on and hope for the best lol
Ive been trying to figure this out too! everything I put on the acne irritates it more and i have to wait weeks for it to go away. I would love to find a specific solution to help. 
I‚Äôm not sure but I have breakouts in similar area.  My derm put me on spiro And differin, I noticed a difference! 
Why do you think its fungal?
This is the type of acne I get after consuming moderate-high amounts of processed sugars the previous day I break out really bad with lots of small red bumps literally on every spot of my face, my advice would to cut back sugar and see if it makes a difference.
Am:
- Cleanse with Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% Sulfur 5% Cleanser (Given to me by derm. Is this too harsh?)
- Apply metronidazole topical cream .75 (derm gave)
- Apply Hyaluronic Acid hydrator
- Apply moisturizer (esthetician gave this to me, RNA /DNA extract from Salmon Roe and Sperm and PDRN)
- Apply sunscreen 
- Makeup

Pm:
- Neutraogena makeup remover wipes 
- Cleanse with Sulfacetamide
- Apply the Ordinary Azelic Acid (5 nights a week)
- (The other two nights a week) Apply Paula‚Äôs Choice BHA (I‚Äôve only used twice but I feel like it‚Äôs name things worse?)
- Apply Hyaluronic Acid hydrator
- Apply same moisturizer as morning 

[removed]
Def follow up with a moisturizer if you aren‚Äôt 
You should look into other bha products like the blackhead one from cosrx. Also in some cases those deep and stubborn blackheads need to be or could benefit from extractions by a professional. 
No way. If anything it releases good chemicals and reduces stress which is good for you/ your skin.
No. My face was flawless in high school...
Nope, you're good to beat it to your hearts desire...
Lol no, 
You do you
NO!
I definitely think it can. I know it doesn't effect everyone, but I think the surge of hormones released during an orgasm (especially testosterone-I'm a girl)  can cause the skin to breakout.

However, cause does not equal correlation. It could be that there is already an elevated level of testosterone in my body before I even masturbate, leading me to feel horny and carry out the act lol. It could just be that instead of the act of masturbation itself. 
I can hardly believe so. I masturbate quite frequently for years and it doesn‚Äôt cause acne. 
No
No.
Yeah, for me it does whenever I masturbate I seem to breakout out when I was doing nofap my skin cleared up a lot
i've tested this and i can say that it does for me. I've watched my diet and then busted a nut and brokeout the day after.
Give them a call, it can't hurt to talk to them about it and get it checked out in person. Laser is expensive and you paid for them to treat all of your scars.

If they can't see you right away, take clear photos of your face comparing the red skin to the normal skin. Also if it was missed, then in a few weeks' time the photos will show that there was no improvement to the scar.

And don't panic! If they did miss it, a reputable clinic should fix it for free. They may want to wait until the surrounding skin is healed though for safety. Good for you for getting laser! Hope you get a big improvement.
Im using cetaphil cleanser and moisturizer daily as well as epiduo everyday
how old are you? how often do you shave? 
It personally didn't work for me, but hopefully it does for you. Just be careful, because it can **extremely** dry out your skin. 

I once went to school without looking at a mirror first, because I hated looking at myself in the morning and seeing severe acne and redness all over (which became very frustrating and heartbreaking over time). Big mistake. 

I remember sitting down when suddenly a classmate loudly said "What the **** is wrong with your face?". The whole class went silent and shifted their attention towards me. I got up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. My whole face had dried up and was peeling ~~really~~ super bad.

I wound up going home immediately, it was that severe. Just be careful.
I think adapalene + 2.5% benzyol peroxide (basically epiduo) works so much better. I went from epiduo to tretinoin and my face is a mess now. 
Yes. But use as prescribed, or your skin will dry out. Bonus is it will also help prevent fine lines. :)
I used it for PIH,just be careful and use it as directed or you'll ended burning your face like I did
On both sides of my face, near my jaw line and up to my cheekbones, I have this red rash. It never goes away. They appeared after I gave birth to my son in 2015. I drink plenty of water daily and I have a skincare regimen which consists of face cleanser and moisturizer. 
I‚Äôve tried tea tree oil but it doesn‚Äôt seem to help. It‚Äôs not acne... and they‚Äôre not raised bumps. I don‚Äôt know exactly what this is. Anyone have any ideas? Advice on how to get rid of this?

Thanks!


Could be eczema or something. I would try the Bahi Cosmetics Sunflower Sweets Serum. It helped even my skin tone and fade my acne scars, and it really soothes redness and irritation. The before and after pictures are insane, it‚Äôs definitely a holy grail. 
does it itch at all?
It looks like malassezia folliculitis to me 
How soon after you gave birth did they appear?
Perhaps you need some medication? Hopefully you can go see a dermatologist to help you with that! But here‚Äôs my routine:
AM: Exfoliate in shower, Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser (also in the shower), Thayers Toner, Ole Henriksen Oil Balance Controller (moisturizer), Peter Thomas Roth UV Milk (sunscreen) to finish off. 

Around 11am and 3:30pm I take a minocycline pill 

PM: DHC Cleansing Oil 
Differin XP topical cream 

Also, try to increase your water intake! Hope this helps! 
How long have you been on this regimen? After youve given it some time (at least 3 months) and it doesnt work, I would go back to your doctor and ask them about epiduo. Epiduo actually cleared me up when I was younger but Iost my insurance and couldnt keep up with it sadly. But yes, it takes time. And stridex pads are fine. 
I started curology and started purging almost immediately. It was really discouraging to see a bunch of acne at once, making my skin worse than it usually was. However, I am so surprised to see visible results by the end of the first week. Retin-a is a harsher exfoliant so you will purge more! I would say keep fighting through it and if your purging doesn‚Äôt go away within 3 weeks, maybe reevaluate the treatment. 

Also I would use you TO niacinamide and zinc all over the face instead of as a spot treatment. It‚Äôll help reduce pores, control oil, help scars, for a brighter complexion overnight 
Are you male or female 
What is your daily dose? Low dose of 10mg daily should have lower side effects.
Adapalene cream, in all your face every night. Also I would recommend terbinafine to anyone with acne. Hope this helps!
I took a 6month course of accutane as well. I was giving a 1 month prescription of steroid pills for my acne 2 weeks before starting accutane. Most of my acne went away during those 2 weeks before I started accutane and I was left with a lot of scars and redness( a lot). Still I continued to go on accutane because I was scared my acne would come back since the pills are steroid pills. During the 6 month course of accutane it was horrible, my scars did not heal at all. I lost hair too, but my hair grew back after I was done with my course. My scars didn't get better until 4-5months after my course ended. Today is the day I am 6 months of accutane and my scar and redness is still bad but slowly getting better.

Have you tried aztec clay masks and tea tree oil?
Diet
That my chest
Your acne isn‚Äôt bad man. Trust me, there‚Äôs so many people with much worse acne on here that would love to trade positions with you. 
I don‚Äôt have much knowledge on specific creams and face washes you could use, but trying to eat more healthy shit, drinking a-lot of water, and trying to get enough sleep won‚Äôt hurt. Keep your head up, and don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it, it happens to everyone. 
I've found that when I'm using products from the doctor, it's best to have a really really simple routine. I would suggest ditching Clinique's lotions completely. They kept my skin in constant turmoil because nothing in those lotions helps your skin. I love the CeraVe daily moisturizer! It keeps my face so soft and smooth. I like the Murad sunscreen face lotion, I can't remember what it's called but it's in a little clear and orange tube 
How much do you take?
I‚Äôve heard this before but hearing you say this I think I‚Äôll try it!! thanks
Im trying zinc now. Someone on this sub saw great progress with it. And my ex did as well but I didnt believe it until he confirmed. Apparently, zinc kills the bacteria that cause acne. I just started it this week so ill let you know if it works. 
I‚Äôve had these bumps for months. I‚Äôm restarting my routine again. I‚Äôve been using just cleanser and a toner for the meantime. I also started using CosRx Blackhead Powerliquid as a BHA in November. Is it possible that this might still be my skin purging? 
Might be makeup irritation. Do you consume dairy regularly?
Do you eat a lot of greasy food? 
What‚Äôs your diet?
I totally understand this- on year 12 now. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve transitioned to prescription products, but those have made the most difference for me. It sucks and sometimes all I want to do is peel off my face and get a new one. But it has been slowly getting better, and I hope it does for you too. 
Have you looked into to Accutane? You sound like a good candidate for it.
I know it sucks. I used to have dreams about having perfect skin and I would wake up in the morning looking into the mirror seeing my face and feeling super discouraged. And I may never have the flawless skin and I may have to struggle with acne for the rest of my life. If that's the case, then I'm going to start learning how to love and care for myself despite how many pimples are on my face. And learning how to not put all my value on how I look but remember that there is so much more to life than having flawless skin. Don't be discouraged! 
Same, same, same. 17 years for me. 
if you‚Äôve tried many other types of prescription meds then maybe it‚Äôs time for accutane
Have you tried spironolactone?
I know some acne is linked to allergies,could it be something you eat or drink regularly?
Have you tried to figure out if there‚Äôs a reason behind it? I know mine is caused by a hormonal imbalance (PCOS) but the acne part only kicked in when I was around 35. I didn‚Äôt want to do accutane or meds (and a dermatologist was useless) so I researched and launched into an Asian Beauty routine. This tackled areas like damaged acid mantle, dryness, clogged pores etc. I use OTC cream (Differin) every night along with Stridex twice a week and a gentle exfoliant twice a week. 

The difference is huge! I‚Äôm not acne free and the roseacea is still a problem but it‚Äôs about 80% better and tbh, I‚Äôm happy with that given I didn‚Äôt have to go for meds. 

I think the main take away is we‚Äôre all on a different journey and the reasons for your acne and the correct treatment will be personal to you. You‚Äôll get ideas here and you should use them to figure out how best to help your skin.  Good luck! 
I think one step at a time would be best that way you know what one thing causes it so you wouldn't have to avoid a multitude of things,I know there's  allergy tests at the doctor,and it could also be vitamin deficiency. That's the tough part about acne ,so many causes lol
I was in the same boat until a month back and  then I discovered the keto diet. Its a low carb high fat diet, which has transformed my skin and body. For 16 years I suffered from hormonal acne and felt as helpless as you do right now - every single day. There are fabulous subs to help with this diet. Try it, you won't regret it.

Do u think your skin possibly has a damaged moisture barrier?
I‚Äôm female, I was on it twice, ages 23 and 24. I never got worse before getting better, and it did start working pretty quickly for me. 

My skin dried out like crazy, it made me literally constantly feel like I had dry lips and I would‚Äôve sold my body on the streets for chapstick if I had none on me (kidding). 

I heard nothing about endurance. I am a ‚Äúbodybuilder‚Äù (ie. I go to the gym with intentions of adding lots of muscle, no longer compete). However accutane dries up your oil, and so you need to really stay hydrated as it can cause problems for your joints as they will not be as well lubricated. 

Hope I answered everything I forget the original post lol. 

Edit - about your lips. I never knew of this product before, but purchase Aquaphor, it‚Äôs got a jelly or Vaseline consistency. Put on moisturizer on your face and lips, then chapstick, then aquaphor over top of lips or any really dry, flaky patches you have. 
I‚Äôm currently halfway into my treatment. The initial breakout was one of my biggest worries, as it is almost a given for Accutane users. For me, Accutane started working right away. I stopped getting cysts around the second week and stopped breaking out altogether within a month. I feel extremely lucky as my acne was horrible and I was dreading the thought of it being even worse.   The hyperpigmentation started fading in about 2-3 months. Maybe you‚Äôre a lucky one too! 

Joint pain was an issue for me for about 2 weeks in the first month. After that, it went away. But I‚Äôve read a lot of people that have suffered joint pain use fish oil capsules to lessen it. 

As for moisture throughout the day, I use hydrating mists. They don‚Äôt compare to using a moisturizer or an oil, but it does help a lot when my face starts feeling super dry and tight, and it helps when I start getting visibly dry patches and I‚Äôm out of the house. I use the Lumene Valo Vitamin C Glow Refresh Hydrating Mist. 

For the lips, I use the Vaseline Lip Therapy mini tubs (the Cocoa Butter one). I‚Äôm a lip balm junkie, and have so many from so many brands, but the Vaseline one is my favorite and the one I keep buying. 

Hope this helps! 
 I was on it and working out 5 days a week and in the best shape of my life! Maybe a little joint pain but nothing crazy. Sometimes feel tired more than usual but just take that in stride! You‚Äôll be fineüëç
1 month in. I had the same concerns about joint pains. Personally, it was somewhat bad the first 2 1/2 weeks, but it is currently getting better, thankfully. I feel a bit weaker than I used to be, and a bit more sensitive as well, but It's not so bad that I have to stop training in the gym. I do have to go a bit easier on leg day however. &nbsp; 
 
TL;DR: It can be a though start, but it should get better.
Dermarolling can help with indented scars 
Dermatologist for raised or pitted scars. Given the size of the scarring, some people do find dermarolling helpful but YMMV. Good luck OP <3
I am suffering from acne since 9th grade and also 22 years so about 8 years now, yes I would also like to stop breaking out.
I cut out processed fats and sugars. Not eating fast food at all, nothing fried. Only protein and greens.. as little glutton as possible  
That‚Äôs gunna kill me but I‚Äôll try it lol üòÇ 
I had (have) the same issue. Finally bit the bullet and saved enough to get to a quality dermatologist who put me on an antibiotic that FINALLY got rid of my little bumps. I still have a few blemishes but it‚Äôs nowhere near what it used to be. 

Also, your GP may also be able to look at your acne! 
**background info** I‚Äôve always had perfectly clear skin, but a little over a year ago I got a Liletta IUD and started developing horrible cystic acne on my chin and cheeks. I pick and pop the pimples (I know bad) and I have a pretty extensive skincare routine, which I‚Äôll put below. I saw my doctor and she said once I get my IUD removed my skin will go back to normal within a month or two. I have that scheduled for next week but I‚Äôm wondering how much damage control I‚Äôll need to do after my acne clears up. I have a lot of PIH and PIE but there are a few marks that I can‚Äôt tell if they are true scars. What do you think?

You probably want to discuss with your primary care physician using Accutane. I don't know what issues might arise using everything else in addition Accutane, but it's worth the conversation. If you need to see the result of what cystic acne looks like that goes untreated take a look at Danny Trejo.  He suffered from horrible cystic acne.
It's not true acne scarring but it will take at least 6 months to fade. 
Oils are definitely YMMV. I have oily, acne-prone skin and Rosehip oil has helped tremendously! I use it morning and night as my moisturizer but have heard it can be drying for people with dry to normal/combo skin.

On days I do a bentonite clay and activated charcoal mask, I use Marula oil and Tamanu oil afterwards. The Tamanu is thick so I only use it at night, you could also mix it with a carrier oil for everyday use. Jojoba oil is very light and sinks into the skin easily. 

There's a difference between carrier oils (olive, sweet almond, jojoba etc) and essential oils which contain volatile components of the plants they are extracted from (basil, tea tree, lavender, Rosemary). To answer your question, I've had excellent results with oil cleansing with (extra Virgin) olive oil and coconut oil and horrible results with almond oil. It truly depends on your skin type and the underlying cause of your acne. Most people strongly discourage coconut oil for oil cleansing but I've never ever had an issue. I have oily skin and my acne was largely a result of laziness in hygiene and makeup usage (not so much hormones, stress or diet, at least not as much) and switching over to a more thorough and consistent cleansing method of cleansing (not just relying on face washes) helped tremendously. I've also had wonderful, wonderful results with tea tree oil and recently started using a blend of olive oil tea tree oil basil and Rosemary as my oil cleansing method of choice to good effect. Remember, most if not all essential oils need to be diluted and carrier oils are what you use to dilute them. 
Essential oils like lavender, frankincense, geranium, chamomile and tea tree are my 5 favourites for making skincare blends. They all have antibacterial properties which are great for acne but also are great for calming/redness. 

The biggest thing with essential oils is to make sure you always dilute them properly (typically 1-3% dilution) with a carrier oil because the majority of essential oils are VERY potent and will cause irritation if applied directly on your skin. 

You mentioned jojoba oil. but rosehip, red raspberry seed, and avocado seed oil are all fantastic carrier oils for dry skin. 
My doctor said that oils do not penetrate the skin because the molecules are too large. What they do is act more like a sealant (according to her) for other products you put on your face. With that being said, I tried rosehip oil and have been using it for about a week. It hasnt made things worse. 
If you wear hats try cleaning the inner brims
Have you changed hair care products? Also, how often do you change your sheets and pillowcases? 
Retinol and AHA/BHA has helped me more than anything else. Nip+Fab glycolic acid extreme night pads are amazing and I‚Äôm a big fan of the Retinol Reface from Indeed Labs. If you‚Äôre going to be using strong actives, I‚Äôd use a hyaluronic acid moisturizer. The one I use is Neutrogena HydroBoost with SPF 15. This will also help with scarring once your active acne subsides.

Physical exfoliation gets a lot of flack on this sub but I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs crucial to my skin. I bought a Foreo Luna Mini 2 and I absolutely adore it. I can confirm that it makes my products absorb faster. If you shave, it will also give you a much closer smoother shave with fewer ingrown hairs (my boyfriend can confirm this). 

You‚Äôve probably heard to drink water, but I have to drink a quart a day for it to be effective for me. I also cut down on my black coffee intake and replaced it with green tea, as that has anti inflammatory properties and doesn‚Äôt spike your stress hormones like coffee does. 
Treat your depression and anxiety separately from your acne. I used to get caught in a vicious circle where the stress of the anxiety/depression triggered breakouts. 

Otherwise:
- Maybe get an oil-based cleanser, that helped a lot for me
- EXFOLIATE - a BHA such as salicylic acid will do wonders (after an initial purging period)
- Get rid of any products you may be using that contain fragrance or a high alcoholic content
- Do not fucking put salt on your face
- Moisturize in order to repair your skin barrier, especially if you're going to be using a lot of harsh topical treatments
I just want you to know that you‚Äôre not alone in feeling the way you do. I‚Äôm in a similar boat as you where my acne is severely worsening my depression and self esteem. 

Definitely seek help for your depression and anxiety. It might help you to get on the right track. I hope everything works out for you. 


You are not alone. You are never ever alone. 
Is your face dry prior to working out? That usually does it
Honestly couldn't tell you,it also could be what your washing your face with,you usually get that stinging with sweat with BP and SA
Do you have any products on your face before you work out? Even if you put sunscreen on that day, it could cause the stinging. 
I‚Äôm curious about this as well! I‚Äôve had mine waxed many times and even with sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin i never broke out from it. I‚Äôm wondering if the same would go for threading ü§î
No, I actually feel safer with it than with waxing or tweezing. The common misconception is that the consultant's saliva touches your skin but that's not so and it's actually pretty clean. However you may break out if your skin is very sensitive but that's true for any method of hair removal. Carry your own after care product - aloe is best - for them to rub in after the service, or just apply it yourself.
I almost never broke out from threading! Of course avoid getting them done if you're breaking out or your skin is being sensitive around your eyebrows (which I am right now). Afterwards, they usually put some type of lotion, but I don't and just put vaseline or anything soothing when I get home. 
I would say my skin is pretty sensitive and I never break out from threading. I get my brows and upper lip threaded about once a month. The threader usually wears gloves and only if she is SUPER rough when getting my hairs out so I experience a little bit of a breakout. Nothing like cystic acne, just the kind that you can pop quickly, doesn‚Äôt bleed and heels within a day. I put witch hazel on my face after threading and that helps a lot!
Waxing broke me out, not threading
omg i have the exact same type of skin on my nose!! they are bumps left behind from past acne. no amount topicals can fix this, i have also suffered from this for over 10 years. my dermatologist said they only thing that can make a drastic difference is getting laser
Do you exfoliate at all? What‚Äôs your skin routine? 
You might be over exfoliating but I‚Äôm not sure. Have you tried using aloe on your face? 
I‚Äôm 17 years old. I‚Äôve been clear for 3 years. Now I‚Äôm getting these big painful cysts on my cheeks and sometimes I get a huge cyst on my nose which takes at least a month to finally disappear. So my face looks basically the same as before I‚Äôve been using any treatment. 

Products I‚Äôve used:

- Benzoyl Peroxide (was really good, used for two years, but developed allergy)

- Zinerit (it was drying but I‚Äôve had the clearest skin when using it, now I‚Äôm resistant to it)

After seeing that I‚Äôve developed resistance to Zinerit I‚Äôve visited my dermatologist and first she prescribed BHA and metrogel which helped for the first two months. After this, I‚Äôve started breaking out again. After seeing me with my skin condition (which was a bit better than on the photo), she prescribed Differin 0.1, azelaic acid 15%, doxycycline. I‚Äôve been using these products for 13 days and I believe what I‚Äôm experiencing is initial breakout. 

I‚Äôve been eating paleo for 1 month to see the improvement, but it didn‚Äôt help. Now I eat mostly paleo (rice, beans, coffee are my exceptions) because it MIGHT somehow help and it's actually a lot easier to lift weights with the diet. 

My routine looks like this:

Morning

1. Baziron Control gentle cleanser
2. Azelaic Acid
3. (after 30 mins) Baziron Control moisturizer with SPF 15

Evening

1. Baziron Control gentle cleanser
2. Differin

First two days I‚Äôve had facial redness after using differin, but I don‚Äôt have any bad reaction to it (even dryness) right now.



Sorry for my poor English :(
Meanwhile use sunblock and s tonic. No sugar or dairy
What language do you speak?
Oh ok. Don‚Äôt picks because more scars will come along and don‚Äôt dry out  your face because your face will produce more oil. I will recommend to use a sunblock because is the perfect moisturizer. Apply aloe vera in the night or for 20 minutes 
By moisture i mean before you go out. Do you apply the cream in the day? 

The sunblock depends on your skin, if you have an oily face I recommend a gel base sunblock. 


You may be aware of this already but, given that this misconception is quite common and its influence can be very distressing, I thought it best to post to make sure. Real acne scarring is indentation and depression of the skin, caused by collagen damage, exacerbated by picking. Many also believe that red, purple or dark marks on the skin after acne are also scars. These marks, however, are not scars. They are actually what is known as post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), the skin's response to the inflammation that occurs when the body fights the infection that causes a pimple, and they will fade, usually within 3-12 months. Those that do remain can be treated topically and even through nutritional means. They should also be covered with UV protection, as this can worsen PIH. You may be saying that you are worried about real acne scarring but, given that you say that you are fairly new to acne scarring, thought you should know the distinction.
You are not screwed. Everyone does it, we just had to get better about it!

I will say I think picking made a big impact on my scarring. I have some boxcar/rolling scars that will probably always be there because I couldn‚Äôt stop picking. 

The good news is that you‚Äôre young and you can make a change! Make sure your skin is always clean and hydrated. This will prevent scarring. If you only have hyperpigmentation (red/purple spots where a pimple used to be) these will fade with time and with the help of certain skincare products. If they are textured, they will take more work. Laser treatment is an option, and I‚Äôve had good luck with microneedling (it looks scary, but is much more cost effective).

Remember that no one notices them as much as you do! 
Miderma makes a scar gel, it's moderately costly but I know Walmart sells an off brand version for significantly cheaper. It's helped my scaring around my temples and cheeks significantly, and I've even noticed that oddly enough it has begun to clear my acne as well. 
Don‚Äôt feel bad because everyone does it! That‚Äôs good you are aware while you‚Äôre still young. I regret it picking and popping all of my acne when I was younger. And now I‚Äôm left with horrible scars. I highly recommend acne patches! They prevented me from picking on mine and causing further scars. Nexcare and cosrx are the ones I use. 
I am sooo guilty of popping pimples. 

Just make sure you chemically exfoliate, moisturize, wear sunscreen, and try to stop popping!
Oh my gosh, I get the same thing! No clue about what the possible cause could be. I was thinking it could potentially be fungal acne for a bit but it didn‚Äôt respond to any typical fungal treatments. 

if you catch the pimple very early, you can put ice on it and then it won't break out.
sort of like putting ice on a sports injury 
I get those, too! Infuriating!

Sleeping is when your body heals so it could have an effect
I‚Äôm on minocycline for hormonal acne from birth control and I.T honestly works really well for me. I take I.T when I get s flare up then for about a week after and my skin has improved a lot. I have the birth control implant and soon after I got I.T I got the worst cystic and comedonal acne along my chin and jawline. My derm originally had me on Doxycycline, then switched me to minocycline last year. Minocycline seems to work better for me that the doxy and I like only taking I.T when I need to. 
I‚Äôm on mino for the second time right now! The first time it got rid of my cysts, and I nearly stopped getting those skin colored closed comedones 
cerave is pretty good,cetaphil is pretty delicate also
You should moisturize. That doesn‚Äôt cause acne. In fact, if your skin is not moisturized, your skin will dry and then overcompensate by producing an excess of oil. This will lead to more breakouts. 
Cetaphil makes good, gentle cleansers. Find one specifically for dry or sensitive skin. Also, tons of people use just water in their morning routine! If you‚Äôre gonna moisturize, make sure to use SPF! 
I been on spiro for several years. It's the only thing that helps me. I take 25mg everyday. 
This stuff absoloutly fucked up my face. I begged different doctors for it for over a year and finally got prescribed. Before I went on it I had a mild reoccuring cysts on my jawline. Within weeks my face was literally exploding with acne. I had to stop taking it because the breakouts were so severe they were scarring without me even touching them. Its been over a month since I stopped and I still have severe cystic acne all around the sides of my mouth and I'm going on roaccutane.

Can't really answer your questions but I'm just wondering how long did it take before you saw results?
Sprio worked for me but I had to stop it bc the side effects were too much :(
"She laughed and said there is no truth that dairy causes acne and told me to continue eating dairy products"

Everytime I read something like this, I just want to scream.  Dairy causes acne in many people.  In my case, 4 grams of dairy gives me acne.  Dairy can cause acne for three reasons.  First, it can cause an insulin spike.  Second, the calcium in the dairy competes with zinc for absorption and lack of zinc can lead to acne.  Third, casein can disrupt the intestinal wall lining.  

Diet should be the first place to start when dealing with acne.
Dairy definitely gives me cystic acne. No dairy=no cysts for me. I still have break out issues but not as extreme. 
I‚Äôve never looked up the science but I had horrible hormonal acne as well and my acne was, like yours, primarily located on my jaw and chin. Nothing worked until I decided to give Veganism a try and it was like magic how fast my acne stopped. I moved chicken and turkey back into my diet but I still don‚Äôt eat dairy and not only is my acne still at bay but my minor stomach issues that I had are non existent. It‚Äôs worth a shot! You‚Äôre not missing out on anything by not eating dairy if you‚Äôre eating a complete and healthy diet. 
I stopped have dairy in November 2017 and my chin has been clear since. In the past two weeks I‚Äôve had about five cups of coffee with a little creamer and bam i got a cyst on my chin. I still have acne everywhere else but I‚Äôm convinced my chin troubles were related to dairy. 
To answer your first question, no derm appoibtments dont take that long! 
Well that's frustrating, honestly you have to just give it up for a few months and look for any results, it definitely causes cystic acne for me but the alure of cheese is too hard to fight some days.
I avoided all dairy and all forms of sugar for a few months and saw zero improvement. I lost some weight, so that was cool,  but my cystic acne stayed the same. 
I can't speak to the dairy question (I've never had the willpower to try cutting it out) but 100 mg of Spiro absolutely changed the game for my cystic acne. My situation was similar‚Äîusually just one random one a couple of times a month, but never completely clear skin. I had a very minor purging period, and I haven't had a single cyst since then! I'd highly recommend giving it a shot.
In my experience, YES. Dairy free diet combined with Zinc supplements. 
Wow I can totally relate the the mirror habit.  I never ever look at my face when I wash my hands. And when I decide to do it (rare) i get real close and look at all the imperfections. It‚Äôs scary. I want to be able to just embrace what I‚Äôve been dealt with. I have a daughter now and I want her to be able to have confidence with or without acne. I‚Äôd hate for her to see her mom be so ashamed to even look in the mirror. Something I‚Äôm working on. Hopefully spiro will help .. I just started a  week ago!
I did the same thing! I still avoid looking at myself in certain lighting (looking at you, natural sunlight) because of my scarring.  Accutane is tough but worth it. You‚Äôll be looking at your lovely face again in no time! 

Since there‚Äôs such a stigma with touching your face if you have acne (and soooo many people feel the need to remind you of that when you‚Äôre fighting a breakout), that I basically stopped touching my face unless it was to apply makeup. If it itched, I taught myself to blow air out of my mouth towards the itch... kind of like when kids push their bangs out of their face by blowing air upwards? Don‚Äôt know if that makes sense. I can still remember the first time another person casually touched my face after I cleared up... I think I almost cried. I felt like no one wanted to touch me for so long that it caught me off guard! 

Good luck with accutane! I took two courses and am so happy I did. Stock up on sunscreen and aquaphor!! 
After realizing sugar is the worst thing I can consume for my acne and seeing it time and time again destroy my face, I have such an aversion to anything sweet. I used to love sweet things but now whenever I'm not expecting it and taste sweetness, there's no enjoyment, only flashing red lights yelling STOP EATING THAT!! Not exactly a coping habit but just interesting unconscious conditioning. 
Your skin looks amazing my man. This is probably just the regular little pimple teenagers get once in awhile. You should just get over the counter products for now, and drink plenty of water. It‚Äôs impossible to tell what products your face would react to better but you have to test around. Again, I don‚Äôt think this will be too much of a problem because your face seems alright. Don‚Äôt stress it. Also don‚Äôt pick 
Dude, your skin is fine lmao. 
Beautiful skin. Maybe try salicylic acid for those annoying forehead pimples.  
You‚Äôre face looks perfect to me!! No need to worry
Use a tonic and pick your face ! You are good looking man so don‚Äôt feel bad 
Flawless skin!

Using witch hazel as a toner is good. You can find it in the pharmacy by the hydrogen peroxide, and it‚Äôs very inexpensive. 

I‚Äôd suggest also incorporating the following in your routine: 

A moisturizer. CereVe pm is my favorite, but generally any gentle moisturizer is good. This will help keep your skin hydrated and healthy, and will help fight against future scarring. 

A sunscreen. CereVe has an am version that has sunscreen in it, which works well if you don‚Äôt want to mess with a bunch of different products. Sunscreen should be worn every day, especially if you‚Äôre on something like tret, accutane, or antibiotics which increase our sensitivity to the sun. This protects your skin while it‚Äôs healing and is really vital. 

An exfoliant. A chemical exfoliant will help slough off dead skin and promote healthy, even skin tone over time. I use Stridex in the red tub. Be careful when incorporating this into your routine, as it can cause irritation and dryness at first. Every other day use is a good way to start. 

A serum. There are TONS of serums that help smooth and diminish scars. I‚Äôm a fan of Vitamin C serums. Check out The Ordinary for good, inexpensive serums that can help. 

It sounds like a lot, but incorporating some/all of these products could really be beneficial in scar treatment. Here‚Äôs what it would look like in a routine: wash face, witch hazel, Stridex, serum, moisturizer, sunscreen. If you pick only one product listed, opt for a moisturizing sunscreen. Best of luck!!
ive used witch hazel for redness and it work well,also with inflammation, i used dickinsons which also had alcohol but i think theres one without alcohol,also theres thayers witch hazel which both product seem to be equally as good
Nothing helps clears my redness more than daily cardio. 
Are you using a dairy-based protein powder?  Whey protein can be a problem for some people.  Eggs might be a problem for some people. Maybe it is related to a supplement or food that you take the day that you lift.  Maybe you should keep a food log

Also, putting on muscle uses zinc.  Zinc supplements help with acne. 
Skinfood aloe vera soothing gel at Ulta. 
I like moisture thirst by clinique. It's a gel moisturiser that hasn't broken me out. I find creams too heavy on the face even though my skin is combo, I feel like they just sit there, I don't get that with gels. 
Are they discoloration scars or are they textured? 
oh man, look for products with vitamin c, azelaic acid, alpha arbutus, niacinamide, roseship oil and aloe vera. (Tip: All of these are at The Ordinary for cheap prices except for the aloe vera, which you can get a plant of from the mart). They all target scars, just be careful what you're using and when. I've tried these and my scars are fading! hopefully they will work for you guys too! Happy experimenting!
I hope so man, I currently have a bunch on my jawline areas and side of my head.  Just try moisturizing and waiting it out and if doesn‚Äôt get better if 4-6 months, I don‚Äôt know what to say /: Expensive doctor ways if you want quick results I‚Äôd say, but you‚Äôd have to have your acne under control
I've had moderate success with Vitamin E oil. I use it at night with my moisturizer. 

It works best on new scars, though.

I have the oiliest nose ever, and I haven't found a cure for it. Let me know if you find one!
Tbh if you're routine is working for the rest of your face then I wouldn't risk messing it up just for your nose. I would just try to keep it under control using blotting paper/translucent powder)mattifying primer cream. Maybe an extra strong toner just for your nose.
I have a really oily T zone and the only thing that has helped very slightly is hyaluronic acid as a serum. It moisturizes my face so that it ends up producing a bit less oil on it's own. But the change is small and I'm still on the lookout for something better 
Yes, you have to moisturize regardless. It aids the healing process of your pimples. Try to use a lightweight moisturizer. And you are not supposed to use an AHA+/BHA+ daily for it can cause over-exfoliation. This makes your skin combat current acne at a much slower rate .
Morning:
Cetaphil cleanser
Usually rotate between cosrx bha or aha
Biore sunscreen 
(Makeup: hada labo bb cream and maybelline pure mineral concealer)

Night:
Cosrx good morning cleanser (recently began using this and love it!)
Cosrx bha/aha depending
Cosrx centella blemish cream once every 2/3 days
Laneige sleeping gel

I use galderma benzac spots treatment gel 2.5% BP for new pimples.

I don't moisturize because I live in a hot and humid country and my skin honestly never feels dry. Woes of having oily skin :( should I moisturize? 
What has your experience with the dermatologist been like? What scripts have you tried?
You acne looks a lot like mine did. I got rid of it by cutting our carbs, dairy, and alcohol. Might be worth a try, I know how shitty it can feel. 
Simple wipes don't have salicylic acid!
I like the Equate unscented ones. I break out so easily and these are the only ones that don't break me out. 
When you use a product for too long on a DAILY basis, your skin might not react to it the same way eventually because it can grow a resistance to it. I do NOT recommend washing your face twice a day, I do it once in the evenings and just water in the mornings. Benzoyl Peroxide can be really drying so you should be moisturizing in the evenings. It works for some, but I don‚Äôt recommend the daily use of BP, especially when you are already spot treating twice a day. Always remember that our bodies are made to combat things that don‚Äôt belong in it, like the bacteria from pimples for example. So you have to try to focus on aiding your skin when it comes to it doing its job.


every time i hear about someone supplementing some vitamin and their acne just magically goes away I die a little inside. if only it was that easy
Really irritated my skin
Retin-A cream completely cleared my bacne.
Have you considered a skin allergy test? I‚Äôm from California, and I noticed that around fall and winter my skin would break out really badly. Then I moved to the east coast for college, and any time I visit home for winter break my skin immediately starts to break out.  

Things to look out for are redness, itchiness, dry/flaky skin, and smaller bumps all over your face rather than just in your problem zones. You should also check your neck and back, because if you‚Äôre breaking out there when you didn‚Äôt before, it probably is related more to your body‚Äôs internal response to your environment than your environment itself.  
Where in the states? It could be hard water?
I second the skin allergy test. When I was traveling in Europe I noticed my skin got horrible when I was in Paris for a bit. When I got home it cleared up. Dermo suggested it was something related to high amounts of pollution in the air in Paris. 
Are you taking any protein powders here that you didnt in Malaysia?
I agree about the climate. I live in Singapore where the humidity is great for my skin (even though it can cause some people to get oilier quicker). However whenever I've lived in the states my skin freaks out. It was ok-ish in NY during the summer when it was humid, but it got really really bad in California and Arizona in the Spring. The arid and dry weather caused a lot of clogged pores and acne that immediately cleared up when I went back to Singapore. üò¢ perhaps investing in a humidifier would help in restoring moisture to your environment. Also use a lot of moisturiser and regularly spray your face with a moisturising spray. 
Hey! Malaysian here! I think the most possible reason for this to happen is the climate. I love the climate here and NEVER had acne problems until I flew to America because the air was sooo dry. Apparently. I can‚Äôt use the same product in Malaysia. Malaysian products are made to suit people living in tropical weather. My advice is for you to change your routine. Maybe new moisturizer and get a humidifier? I wish I can help you with your routine.
"my diet was shit, all oily and deliciously greasy food, I ate chocolate and sugar, I completely stopped exercising,"

I think that your diet had fewer carbs in Malaysia than in the US.  Also, there is a difference in the use of cooking oils.  Malaysia uses a lot of palm oil for cooking.  The US uses a lot of vegetable oil (corn oil, soybean oil, etc.) for cooking.  I dont know, but I imagine that chocolate in Malaysia does not have dairy, while in the US, it probably does.  I think you should zero in on the differences in food between the two countries.  
Your routine is terrible. All of those products are damaging.
The rule of a thumb here is to always look for the ‚Äûnon-comedogenic‚Äù phrase on the labels. This means the product is clinically tested for not clogging pores and you are good to go here. 

Almost all of dermocosmetics available in pharmacies have lines for acne probe skin and they are usually safe, especially when the rule no 1 is taken into account. 

My personal favourote - Bioderma hydro for acne prone skin (with ceramides and HA), SVR (niacinamide) and Cetaphil. 

Edit - spelling. 
Congrats! It must feel so great to figure out your triggers and be acne-free!
I‚Äôm glad your skin is being nice to you (finally)! Your post reminded me that I want to go get some good quality fish oil capsules, and not just for acne m, either.
[removed]
This might be a completely ignorant question but I‚Äôve heard so many good things (and some bad) about fish oil! But my 1 question is do they really give you fishy burps?? Lol totally serious question cause I‚Äôve thought about adding them in my vitamin regime I‚Äôm just afraid of the fish-y after taste. 
Good on you for getting to the dermatologist about your acne. The only thing I would say from experience, is that if they put you on any kind of medication to ask them to be extremely clear about any possible negative side effects. Some doctors aren‚Äôt so transparent and tend to send you off with a prescription before you know exactly what you‚Äôre getting yourself into. I was prescribed Roaccutane for my acne, and although it did eventually get rid of it, there were certainly some downsides to the medication that I was not told would be a problem (these do vary a lot within the individual however). Good luck with everything!
TBH, dermatologists are better with other skin diseases. Acne is first and foremost an inherited condition of the follicles. Someone acne prone has skin that sheds at 5x more than someone non-acneic. Most derms will prescribe antibiotics or topicals that may alleviate acne issues in the short term but do not have or take the time to address the lifestyle factors (pore clogging ingredients, dietary triggers, medications, habits, etc) that exacerbate acne. 

Antibiotics are not meant to be taken long term and some can even have worsening effects on the skin when a probiotic is not also taken to replenish and balance gut flora. 

As far as product recommendations from derms, it is more often than not Cetaphil, not because it is a wonder product (because it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs garbage) ‚Äî it just happens to be a product made by Galderma, a dermatology/pharmaceutical based company (owned by Nestle, btw) 

I tried derms when I first had acne. About 10 yrs after I decided to go back to school to become an esthetician and then further trained and certified as an acne specialist so I could help others. I had acne for most of my 20s and early 30s and had tried everything. My frustration was the biggest push for me to pursue what I do now. Acne specialist estys have way more knowledge and time to spend with clients. I trained thru Face Reality. Best option I‚Äôve found. 
Do not expect immediate miracles. Yes, those do (rarely) happen, but for me, it was a number of months of trying different products/procedures recommended by the derm before hitting on something that really worked. Even if the dermatologist magically knows exactly which product(s)/procedure(s) will get your acne under control, it usually takes a bit of time after starting said treatment before your skin will be noticeably and significantly better. One part of my time regularly visiting a dermatologist that I pretty vividly remember was when I started a treatment (blue light therapy) at her office and my acne started clearing up... and stayed clear for months after the last treatment. That seemed pretty miraculous to me, and was a big boost for me- if I had found something that actually worked, maybe I wasn‚Äôt doomed to be acne ridden forever! I haven‚Äôt seen a dermatologist for my acne in a few years but at a time when my acne was pretty darn bad, it was definitely a good investment. Besides the products/treatments/procedures that one can‚Äôt get on one‚Äôs own, a dermatologist has a lot of knowledge and experience that we poor citizens lack. It‚Äôs their job to help your skin, and I do recommend trying to find a dermatologist you like and can afford because it can eventually have a big positive impact on your daily life.
don't be worried at all! you'll be seated in a doctor's room just like the ones where you get a check-up. in my experience, an assistant walks in and asks some basic questions, like what product you're using, where your areas of concern are, etc. she'll leave and come back accompanied by the derm, who has been informed of all the stuff she already asked you. he'll inspect your skin and tell the assistant what he sees (what kind of acne and where) and she'll write it down. it's kind of funny because what you always saw as "acne" the derm will be able to break down into a million different types. he'll be able to work out a prescription and loose (meaning you'll pick out the actual products, he'll just give a general idea, like "gentle cleanser") routine. and you'll be on your way! don't be worried at all. going to a derm was one of the best decisions i've ever made.
Depends. Do you have oily skin? I've had moderate to slightly severe acne and I recently started taking Accutane, which might be a bit too extreme for you, OP.

I'd suggest cleansing regularly to get rid of oil (if you do have any) and maybe using soap with salicylic acid. It helps. PM me if you need to know anything else! :D
Arent we all naturally opposed to acne.
Exacerbated, not exasperated. Glad you found a solution though!
Braun series 5 works pretty well for me
You should clean your razor in alcohol before using it. 
These could just be trapped/ingrown hairs from sensitive skin / poor shaving technique. They look almost exactly the same as acne ( tend to be more painful though ) . If you need any shaving tips feel free to message me :)

Not if you don‚Äôt want to. Sealing in the moisture doesn‚Äôt hurt :)
Continue for 1 more month
i've had PIH and ive used aloe vera for spots,usually saw improvment around a week 
Are there indentations or is it just discoloring? The discoloring is not actually scarring but it‚Äôs something to do with the pigments in your skin. I have this, and it usually goes away after a while (not fast enough unfortunately). I‚Äôm experimenting with a project to make the process faster 
What does your diet look like? My friend battled acne well into her adulthood. Turned out it was related to a gluten intolerance. Her acne looked just like yours. 
My current routine is
Am: wash with water then aloe vera as moisturizer
Pm: wash with water then apply 2.5 bp gel, wait 15 mins, apply aloe vera for moisturizer
The order you have is fine. The moisturiser first will buffer the epiduo and hopefully reduce how dry or irritated it can often leave skin. I did this when I first started using it, now I cleanse, epiduo then moisturise. 
I had the same thing and I actually started taking my face mask down my neck and onto my breasts when I do one and it totally helped! I currently use the Aztec Indian healing clay mixed with apple cider vinegar. It leaves you super red bc it pulls blood to the surface (which is good) so it‚Äôs def a nighttime thing but it works really well. I saw a difference after the first  mask. Good luck! üíïüíï
Try stridex in the red tub - start once a day or once every other day to avoid dryness at first 
Do they feel like cysts at all? Could be hidradenitis
Are you sure it's not normal? A picture would have helped.

I had 'acne' on my chest for 7 years because I was constantly squeezing at the pores on my chest and then the pore would get infected and I'd get a proper spot. 

Blackheads are not dirt. They are caused by the natural oils in your skin (which you can't and don't want to get rid of) going black when in contact with oxygen. Basically every single pore on your body is a blackhead it just so happens that some pores are bigger than others and you can see the black stuff in them.

Something white will probably come out of ANY pore on your body if you squeeze it enough. I'd say just leave your skin alone  it's probably fine.
i do the same with my boobs, but worse because i actually ‚Äúpop‚Äù the bumps (forget the correct term) around my nipples. it is sooo easy to get addicted to it since you can pop them like zits and white stuff will come out
They could be Fordyce spots.
Yikes, sounds like you‚Äôre drying out your skin so much that it‚Äôs producing excess oil in hopes of hydrating itself. I would switch out the acne cleanser for a hydrating cleanser and maybe think about ditching the toner unless you totally love it. 
A good diet is important. Severe acne could very well be the symptom of an underlying condition. Perhaps an intolerence to a particular food or material? One way to find out is by eliminating food groups one at a time and slowly reintroducing them while measuring the effects on your body and mental health.
I'm assuming the medicine you're talking about was accutane, in which case the side effects you're talking about are possible side effects. I took accutane for 6 months and only got dry skin, no other side effects. It varies person to person and if your acne is really bothering you that much it might be worth thinking about again, especially if natural remedies don't help. 
[removed]
Ive had bad jaw acne,but green tea complex helped clear it up,you can get the supplements at walmart 
Go to a dermatologist again, not a dietitian. People do take multiple rounds of accutane and venture out to try other meds that are available. If you are getting acne in the jawline then you may want to discuss other accutane alternative options like spironolactone.
You might want to try using sulfur soap, I've tried many pills before and antibiotics works best for me. My worst break out area with cystic acne is my jawline and under my chin. But I do get breaks outs on my chin and forehead too. But I find sulfur soap does help a lot in during acne out. You might want to research on fungal acne?

(I've got both hormonal and fungal acne h üò∞
Have you tried cutting out all carbs before? Carbs, dairy, and alcohol all give me acne and ill continue breaking out even if just one is still in my diet. It never seemed connected before I tried a total elimination diet because there's like a two week turnaround from when what you eat affects your skin. I had the same issues with acne all along my jawline so it might be worth a try. 
Accutane...  what are you waiting for? There‚Äôs no solid science to support food causes acne. 
If anyone's interested I've also uploaded progress photos as a separate post. There's very little on my profile so you'll be able to fond them there easily. 
PAULAS IS LIFE
Never could control my acne before her products
She is like my mom in my heart. Only time I get acne is when I‚Äôm being lazy :)
This is my holy grail that keeps my acnes at bay. Love it. 
It DOES work amazing- I use it all over my face daily except my forehead. I have to use a AHA/BHA Gel from Peter Thomas Roth because my forehead is my only acne prone are that requires an extra push
I'm using the same product, but the "lotion" version. Has anyone used both and seen had better results with one or the other? I haven't seen much improvement, but I think i'm still be in the purging stage. 
Where can I get some? 
I'm trying to upload photos of the difference in my skin but this sub won't let me, help?

You want to see this, trust me.
I use the purple PC bottle for my keritosis pilaris on my arms, it works wonders. Why didn‚Äôt I think to get face products! 
Even cheaper = Stridex Daily alcohol free pads. 2% SA and it is a leave on formula. Any formula that has to be rinsed off is hocum. There's also a Stridex 0.5% SA with aloe for sensitive skin.

[removed]
Did you try other chemical exfoliants, maybe also with the same concentration of BHA, that didn‚Äôt work as well as this product? 
How do you apply it? I use 4-5 drops, but it never seems to be enough. I use my bare hands because it seems that a cotton pad absorbs to much. Any tips?
I tried it and didn't work for me, made my skin really skinny that's didn't do any wonder for such price 
Wish my face wasn't so damn resistant to every topical product :\ i've had to switch to accutane.
What cleanser would you recommend with this product?
Does this particular brand have a variant for body acne?
Benzoyl peroxide should only be used as a spot treatment on active pimples. If you're using it all over your face and/or every day, cut down to once every other day at night and only on the pimples. You also don't need a lot to put on. Make sure the order you use products is like this - cleanser, bp, and moisturizer. 
NIACINAMIDE! Along with a good, non-fragranced moisturizer, a niacinamide serum got rid of the redness I had. The Ordinary has a 10% serum, and It works on me. 
I can't get my hands on it now tho. I miss it :(
I understand - if definitely changed my brain too... I‚Äôm currently using topical clindamycin 1% and Tretinoin .025% and having satisfactory results.. not the clarity and evenness of tone with the accutane, but my skin is improving all the time. Will probably increase concentration of Tretinoin at 3 month checkup.
Get off BP and go to derm for Accutane. 
But to get back to the original message. I was super red on BP and my texture and appearance was always trash... there is some redness with Tretinoin at times but once you get over the hump I find it to be much less irritating than BP, at least on my skin. 
Holy moly, now that's some incredible progress! Your skin is looking great. I have found using a type of salicylic acid serum has been the most helpful thing for me. I had pretty bad acne all on my forehead when in middle school and most of high school. I used a 2% salicylic acid serum and it did WONDERS for my skin. Recently I slacked off with using SA and the acne has started coming back. I'm getting back into good habits and a committed routine! 
Dang! That's a nice improvement, I'm happy for you. What's your routine? Do you use it twice a day? Day and night?
Really great seeing a lot of improvement! Keep it up! See
What product are you using!?
What's the difference between salicylic acid serum and salicylic acid?
Is the SA your using really drying?
Are you advertising? You've made two of the same threads regarding one product.

I'm glad it worked for you but I am skeptical.

Is this a leave-on treatment or do you rinse it off? 
The big one would be that Vaseline doesn‚Äôt moisturize. It just sits on your skin but doesn‚Äôt absorb, meaning that as your skin secretes natural oils, those oils are trapped underneath the layer of petroleum jelly to potentially get nasty and breed the acne bacteria. Vaseline supposedly doesn‚Äôt actually clog pores but your face‚Äôs natural oils can and will, if sealed under a layer of Vaseline.
If you use it before bed it might end up all over your pillow? 
I had the same problem with the contraceptive implant! 
My chin just exploded with deeeeep painful cysts it was a nightmare. (I also had terrible mood swings and bled almost constantly) 

I had my implant for about 6 months and didn't see things getting any better so I just had mine removed. 

I would sometimes try putting a warm cloth over it to help draw the cysts to the surface faster but it takes several days even so. 

I'm sorry to tell you that cysts can take weeks or even months to heal, and the sack under your skin may never go away by itself and will just continue to refill and cause problems. 
I'd highly recommended you go see a dermatologist whether you decide to come off birth control or not as cysts can give you pretty major scarring. 

Are you female? Acne on chin, jaw, and lower cheeks/ around lips is typically hormonal, at least for females. You might notice it get worse around your period, or tends to concentrate on one side of the face. 
What medicine did your doctor suggest for you? It sounds like spiro May help since it sounds like it may be hormonal acne. 
I'm 19 and had a crazy breakout about 4-5 months ago. in the past i have had acne throughout highschool and stuff that was persistent but never as bad as what i most recently had. getting to the point, i started off on monocycline and now I'm in my second month of accutane and I literally have no pimples, just redness and scarring. I went for it because i was extremely fed up. there are risks but its up to you. 
I was also afraid to use accutane but I had read that it was linked to chronic diseases like chrones and IBS so I never took it. I had tried everything from epiduo, retin-A, doxycycline,minocycline, none helped very much, actually after using epiduo and doxycycline I went off of themand months later my acne came back cystic which I had never had before. I now consume no animal products whatsoever, and I believe the key is to change your current products. Use only oil-free, no0n comodegenic or dermatologist tested. Ever since I swapped my products my face has significantly cleared. actually a few days ago I mistakenly used a face lotion with oil in it and my face was broken out  the next day. 
Hang in there!
Just know that accutane is not the be-all-end-all of acne products. I did it TWICE and still get horrible break outs. If I could do it all over again I would not have done accutane, it dried me out so much and actually gave me sharp hip joint pain the second time.
Double check any supplements you take and avoid anything with dairy or steroids. If Epiduo is helping, consider escalating to Epiduo Forte or alternating between Epiduo regular and Differin 0.3%. You probably know this but Differin is Epiduo without the benzoyl peroxide. 
No difference with the bar, but the Shea Moisture black mud mask does help with some of the cystic stuff and the redness (it contains some salicylic acid) 
It made my skin really tight and dry after washing and I know that isn‚Äôt a good thing.
It made my skin feel so dry and tight after using it once. Even the skin on my fingers were shriveled up. Then the next day my whole face broke out. I don‚Äôt recommend it. 
It is alkaline, so it may break you out even more. For me that was the case.
My first experience with black soap was very bad. This is when I was like 18 and never thought to research anything I put on my face/in my body. I bought the bar kind from the local beauty supply store and applied it straight to my face while in the shower. Boyyyyy that shit burned the hell out of my skin! But being 18 and stupid, I still continued to use it (btw, even though it would sting like hell, with continued use, the black soap did get rid of my acne marks). Fast forward to age 25 where I have much more knowledge of skin care, I decided three months ago to give black soap another try. So this time, I made sure to do extensive research with not only ingredients, but application as well. I shopped around for 100% all natural African black soap so I would have the purest ingredients to minimize any burning. I discovered that for my skin type, I cannot use black soap more than twice a week. So in between those two days, I'll use a different face wash with very minimal detergents as to not irritate my skin. Also, I discovered that I have to lather the soap in my hands first before applying. Before I use to apply the bar directly to my face (DON'T DO THIS) which was probably too concentrated and too strong for my skin type. With this new way of applying my black soap, there is no stinging sensation, no dryness or tight feeling in my skin, and it dramatically fades my acne marks.
fuck....i already have chronic dry eyes and im starting tane next week. this is really scaring me now
I‚Äôm a few years out from my first round of accutane and dry eyes is one of the few symptoms that have stayed with me all this time. They got a little better in the months following, but I assume I will never have the moisture level that I did before I started. I went from never using eye drops to using them everyday. And the inside of my eyelids get these weird dry skin patches that itch like crazy. 

Have you talked to your eye doctor about this issue?  I‚Äôm still able to wear my contacts, but my eye doctor mentioned that there are prescription eye drops meant to help with moisture levels in our eyes; they‚Äôre expensive and a hassle, but it may be worth looking into if it‚Äôs causing you so much discomfort. 

In the mean time I guess we both can buy stock in Visine. 
It will help pretty much everything in your body so do it.
[deleted]
I think it helps cleanse the body and keep the skin healthy in general. Since the time I have increased my water consumption (which is a lot, since I'm sipping water most of the time lol) I have seen tremendous difference, not just in helping the acne go, but I have a feeling it helped fade the red marks left by my acne to some extent, although I still have a lot of them. So, in short, yesss drink lots of water. 
I have been drinking a gallon of water for over two years every day and it has not helped my acne.
It will help but you have to drink a LOT. I drink a litre of green tea (which also helps) and 3-4 litres of water every day. When I was drinking the recommended 8 glasses, I didn‚Äôt see as much of a difference as I am now 
Well, I‚Äôm on accutane right now and it makes me drink lots of water compared to before and as my derm suggested for my acne, yes, it is helpful! 
Drinking that little water is harmful to every part of your body, including your skin. Drinking lots of water will help every part of your health, including your skin.
Hey friend,

23 y/o with acne here. I know how disheartening it can be, I know how frustrating it can be, I know the feelings of hopelessness and not wanting to date. If it‚Äôs any consolation though, I never mentally criticize other people with acne, and I‚Äôve never had someone I was interested in reject me because of it. Believe it or not we are seeing this shit as much worse than it is. If you‚Äôre a guy, it‚Äôs easier, there‚Äôs less expectation on you to have perfect skin. I find being a chick with acne is extremely difficult due to the societal pressures put on women to look healthy and young. If you need someone to vent to I‚Äôm here.

Good luck on your acne fight, stay strong üí™üèª 
I get it. 32 yrs old here, almost 33. Acne since about age 15. Got a brief break during later pregnancy and breastfeeding, but then it slowly crept back. I‚Äôm not willing to do extreme diets (dairy free, gluten free, etc) as eating disorders run in my family and I know that cutting out major ingredients can trigger diet obsession. Instead I just eat those things in moderation or when there are no other food choices at that moment. I‚Äôm a medical professional and I wonder if my acne causes my patients to not take me seriously at times. You are not alone. And you are NOT your acne. It‚Äôs just something that some of us deal with for whatever reason. It‚Äôs not your fault. My focus now is just being kind to my skin. I‚Äôm not overdrying, overscrubbing, or extracting my comedones like I used to. Also not wearing cover up makeup anymore. This is my skin people, embrace it! 
20 year old male here. Acne on my face was never worse than normal, but I had pretty bad cystic acne on my back and shoulders for a long time. Turns out my dad had the same problem when he was younger and he told me what helped him the most. He said that perfumey soaps and shampoo would aggravate his sensitive skin and cause him to break out. this seemed to be the only reason left for me, as I had tried prescription medication, diet changes, and every acne product on the shelf. I finally threw out the old spice and smelly shampoo and bought this all in one soap from a whole foods retailer in my town. I'm pretty sure you can find it anywhere. It's called Dr. Bronners 18 in one soap. It's fair trade and (I think) organic, multipurpose, and surprisingly cheap. You can use it for laundry, dishes, as a face and body wash, and even as an all purpose cleaner. It has a light scent that doesn't linger too long out of the shower, and it's the only thing that has curbed my breakouts on a major scale. I don't swear by a whole lot of products, but damn if they didn't get this soap right.
Same here dude. 31 as of January! I still get the occasional black heads, oily skin..so oily you can fry up a batch of fries, and scarring. I learned to accept that no ones perfect. Even the most "beautiful people" see flaws in themselves. You shouldn't let it discourage you. It makes me sad and I don't even know you. Just wanted you to know your not  alone and not to give up. If you've tried everything then just go back to basics, make sure your washing good, wearing sunblock, and moisturizing when needed. With time and new innovations you might want to try something new and different down the road. As far as your happiness in finding a partner, I hope you don't stop but continue. You will find someone who loves you for you, and will love you for more than just your skin.

This is my feeling exactly.  I'm 31 and have had acne since I was 11.  It really sucks.  It's amazing how crappy skin can effect  your life negatively.  I'm going to see a therapist to talk to them about how hopeless I feel.  Maybe this would be a good option for you too if you really feel bummed out.
Go to a dermatologist, tell them your acne affects your self confidence, they will prescribe you accutane. 
Are you male or female?
You might be experiencing perioral dermatitis. 

Try eliminating toothpastes that contain sodium lauryl sulphate and opt for one that also does not contain cinnamon. SLS triggers peri oral. Kiss My Face is a good SLS free toothpaste brand. 

If you use any type of lip balm do not use Chapstick. It is also pore clogging and can be irritating for some. 

Avoid cooking oils like peanut, canola, or vegetable and substitute olive oil instead. 


If you‚Äôre a lady I think you would benefit greatly from spironolactone! It aids skin by blocking androgen receptors in the chin/mouth area where males usually grow facial hair. It helped my skin tremendously 
You've probably heard this before if you've ever frequented this sub, but moisturizing your skin even thought it seems counterintuitive is extremely important! Make sure the packaging of whatever you buy specifies these 3 things: 1. That it's for your face only 2. That it's noncomedogenic (meaning it won't cause breakouts) 3. That it's NOT oil based.

Also, I don't know if you wear foundation, but for me, that stuff made my skin an oil slick no matter how "lightweight" it claimed to be. Another thing you can try are blotting papers and charcoal masks (not the painful ones that peel off).
Maybe you should try Indian Healing Clay/Bentonite Clay. Although I don't have an oily skin, I have read it helps remove all the oil or soaks it up, or does something, but it has helped many people. Besides it gives a glow to the skin and a lot of Indian people use it. Check it out.
What helped me was neutrogena clear complexion moisturizer, it's got SA in it so it helps set up that oil while keeping your skin moisturized! I also switched my makeup to bare minerals loose powder, with their primer underneath, does wonders for absorbing oil and their other loose powder, the mineral veil, I apply in my t zone throughout the day if I'm still getting a little shiny, makes it matte instantly! 
Well the only way to know if it's from your diet is by removing general food that triggers acne amongst us: dairy, soy, meat, highly processed food, white chocolate, peanut butter , wheat for some people and most of inflammatory stuff .

Try this and see how your skin goes 
hormonal is usually around the mouth and jaw line,could be diet
I would continue taking it once a day and give them a call and see what they want you to do. Maybe she sent in the wrong prescription thinking you were taking it twice a day
Usually AB lasts 3 months. But you can ask him again maybe he forgot this.

Also you will need probiotics since AB damage your guts
Yes it really works. How long it‚Äôll take to see an effect depends on the severity of the scar. It most likely will have little effects on deeper scars like icepicks but it will be more effective for smaller scars. 
Drink lots of water. It didn't get rid of my acne, but I definitely saw an improvement. 
Do you know what type of acne you‚Äôre struggling with? And what areas?
That's what I do. If certain areas of your face still get dry easily (for me, it's my eyelids), then continue the Vaseline. 
I put a huge dollop of sudocreme (zincccccc) on every night before bed and it usually helps stop a cyst in its track 
mario badescu buffering lotion ftw and also the drying lotion. istg they stop cystic acne from forming for me. OR if it already formed, it brings it to surface and easier to pop. 
Sometimes I wish I could take meds but in the child bearing years of my life it‚Äôs not an option. 
I am currently pregnant. üòâ i haven‚Äôt been able to be on any meds really for the last 3 years because of pregnancy, nursing and then trying to conceive this baby. We might want 1 more after this one so it‚Äôll be a while before I could even think about taking meds for it. 
Fortunately, getting pregnant and cutting out dairy has seemed to significantly improve my acne situation. Lol. 
I‚Äôm going to a derm on the 14th and this will actually be my first option. I hope they let me. 
Chocolate, milk, and eggs are the three that break me out. Dairy man
generally 2 to 24 hours after eating dairy (any dairy source) or too many carbs (any carb source).  my acne was mostly on the surface.  if i take zinc, i can eat more carbs without getting acne.  without zinc, i have to run my carbs really low to avoid acne.

one time, i took some pregnenolone (i was trying to address fatigue) and my glands deep under my skin swelled.  it took a week for it to erupt and another two weeks for my skin to go back to normal.
There is no science to support trigger foods... I used to have acne and now I eat whatever I want. You have unlucky genetics. You need a powerful regimen like Tretinoin or even Isotretinoin. Trust me... you can be on accutane and wash your face with pizza grease and you won‚Äôt break out... 
Nutella and alphabet cinnamon cookies from Trader Joe‚Äôs :( my 2 favs
Any junk food, sugar, dairy, and gluten 
My triggers are dairy, gluten,  sugar, processed foods, and vegetable oils
Dairy! It always shows up in 2-3 days. I love cheese. üò≠
Sometimes its just genetics, I think i read somewhere its like 81% genetics and 19% environment/ diet. 
Dairy 100% 
Milk, ice cream, cheesecake, whey protein, etc. My skin starts itching and I‚Äôll have multiple breakouts within 6-12 hours. Soda does the same as well. 
I avoid dairy and soy like the plague. 
Are they fordyce spots? They usually appear on genitalia but they commonly appear on the face as well, especially around the lips. They‚Äôre natural and benign. 70-80% of adults have them.
Are they closed comedones?
Yes stay the course... on accutane my skin was worse for 3-4 months then in the 4th and 5th month it turned around so fast! And now my skin is beautiful üßñ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Keep going friend. Brian Turner on YouTube was on Accutane for a year or so. It‚Äôs easy to lose hope but please stay strong! It will all be worth it in the end.
Keep going! Don‚Äôt lose hope!
Background: I never get it anywhere else but my cheeks and chin. My forehead has literally never had a pimple and I've been struggling with this for 2-3 years now. 

I cut out dairy a while ago and my skin saw moderate improvements, but I still get pimples consistently. I recently realized I eat a lot of gluten, (bread, oatmeal, pasta) so I cut that out of my diet as well on sunday but I still broke out anyways today. I mostly eat eggs, meat, and vegetables. 

I use a 10% BP cleanser in the shower and then use a mixture of rosehip oil and apple cider vinegar as toner. I've tried several moisturizers (even labeled for sensitive skin) and my skin gets very red after I used them so I think I'm allergic to a common ingredient.

Any help would be appreciated
Have you tried Accutane? I've been on all the medications, creams,  natural approaches and accutane was by far the only thing that really worked. Mind you, it takes dedication and it more than likely will make things initially a bit worse (not THAT much). I had mild acne like yourself.
[removed]
I've been using acne .org BP for almost 10 years now, and I LOVE it. Haven't tried any of their other products because my regimen is full. But I love how their BP is no-frills, just the active ingredient, and plays well with other products. 
Why are you taking it ‚Äúon and off‚Äù? It took a while to work for me after using it consistently. 
To add a bit more background:

I‚Äôve been taking Spironolactone off and on for the last 5 months. No topicals. No birth control. My skin improved until a few weeks ago. My husband and I started (and quickly stopped) the Keto diet. I was wondering if maybe it was the massive influx in consuming dairy? I love cheese.. so.. I took full advantage!

I‚Äôve used just about everything for my acne. The only thing that worked was Epiduo gel for a few years but I think my skin has grown tolerant now.

I do not want to go on Accutane as my husband and I are TTC. Spiro is bad enough! 

I do have a small cluster of spots that aren‚Äôt visible in the photo that have been there for about a month. It feels like that ‚Äúchicken skin‚Äù keratosis whatever-majiggy.

Current Skincare Routine:

I use my Clairisonic Mia once a day but (try) and cleanse twice a day with La Roch√© Posay Effaclar cleansing gel. I use Lanc√¥me‚Äôs Hydra Gel as a moisturizer in the day time.

I‚Äôve been using the Bare Minerals Blemish Serum in the evening for the last week and have noticed zero difference - if anything it‚Äôs made my skin worse. I finish with my Lanc√¥me Visionnaire gel moisturizer in the evening. 

I‚Äôm going to the GP this week to speak to them about my acne. Are there any other prescription treatments I should consider? I‚Äôve read about azealic (?) acid.

Thanks y‚Äôall!
good luck king
finished accutane about 6 months ago and let me tell you is it worth it! you can do this! My skin is 100% clear now.

Whats your dosage/routine?

Hope you are drinking ALOT of water
I know what some people are saying but moisturising will probably be the most crucial factor on Accutane. I‚Äôd ask your doctor again if you heard them right, because I feel as if you‚Äôre causing yourself a LOT of unnecessary pain that you don‚Äôt deserve due to misinformation.

I can‚Äôt wait to see you in  a few more months or so champ! Keep going strong and don‚Äôt lose that smile. 
also reccomed r/accutane

it's so good to see you smiling!
Amazing :)
Accutane worked wonders for me, hopefully for you too! Best of luck man 
From someone who‚Äôs had acne since age 9 (now 28) here is my advice: cut back on dairy, drink tons of water, use a face wash that doesn‚Äôt over dry your face (I use Cetaphil), keep your face moisturized (I use lush moisturizers), and the only topical acne medicine that‚Äôs EVER worked for me is Obagi Medical Clenziderm MD Therapeutic lotion. All the acne creams and face washes you I‚Äôve used over the years only dried my skin out and made it worse. It only took me 15 years to figure that out üò¢ I thought anything moisturizing was making my skin more oily and breakout. I have combination oily/dry skin but my acne is now gone for the most part. I hope any of this helps!
Get an app and track your period and your break outs. I didn‚Äôt think they were related either but it turns out I get bad break outs the same times every month. Usually a week after my period ends and a week before it begins. I‚Äôm thinking before and after I ovulate. I don‚Äôt know but I know it‚Äôs pretty consistent and it sucks because by the time the old ones are healing, new ones are coming up. 
[removed]
Are you using a moisturizer at night? Have you been eating different foods/ changing your pillowcase/ been more stressed than usual? Traveling can wreak havoc on the skin from what I‚Äôve been told so it could just be the stress of being in a new environment!
My acne was always worse when I used a bunch of different products. Your brand included. A nice BP wash (spectro acne care wash) and a simple moisturizer will go a long way 
Staying in the "normal range" is a very different range for everyone, so I highly suggest just doing what you're doing keeping it as it is and not worrying about bringing it up. YOUR "normal range" would be anything that is asymptomatic (not being dizzy, no fainting etc and also not so high that you're getting headaches or other issues). Low blood pressure is good, even great, It's when it's high (even a normal range, but high for you) that's an issue because it puts undue/unusual pressure on your veins and arteries which can cause issues.

I've always had low BP and often have new doctors give me a funny look when they see how low it is, but it works for me and I'm rarely symptomatic except occasional fainting spells if I'm not drinking enough and doing vigorous activity. Even being on Spiro 50mg I've been fine and it has dropped a bit, But still asymptomatic so it's all g :)
Maybe it was just my head, but I felt my cysts calming within 3 days of removal. I haven‚Äôt gotten any new cysts since and it‚Äôs been 3 months now. 
I was on the pill (Apri) in high school to be able to manipulate the timing of my periods actually (I was a high level athlete). But I kept forgetting to take my pill and I would take like 5 all in one day. When I actually started needing it for other reasons, that wasn‚Äôt gonna fly. I tried the patch for three months and I absolutely hated it too. I was always paranoid that it wasn‚Äôt working. 

Then I started NuvaRing, which I love. I‚Äôve been on it for about 4 years. It‚Äôs the best because you don‚Äôt need to remember it every day, only every month, eliminating a lot of human error and keeping your slim clear more consistently. 

No matter what BC method I was on, I had clear glowy skin. When I went off it, my skin erupted into painful cysts. My breakouts were catalyzed originally by a product, but I do believe it persisted due to hormonal factors. 
When I was a teen, I had hormonal cystic acne and topical prescriptions weren't working for me so my doctor recommended birth control when I was 15. Honestly, it took me a few years to find a birth control that worked for my skin AND didn't give me awful periods. Eventually I gave up on pills and I found that NuvaRing worked the best for my skin and I've been on it for about two years now. Birth control gives some people negative effects like heavier periods or mood swings, but it definitely helped clear my skin and I haven't experienced bad side effects. My oil production has also regulated itself with birth control. 

On top of seeing a dermatologist, I also would recommend going to a Gyno for the birth control as opposed to your general practitioner. Their specialty is catered more towards hormones and lady problems compared to GP's. 

I hope this helps!
i‚Äôve tried birth control and it did help with my acne, but i had to stop because it was giving me a lot of side effects. as soon as i stopped my acne came back soooo much worse, my skin is pretty much destroyed now and im going to accutane soon because of it
I think birth control is a temporary fix... It might fix your acne while you're on it, but once you get off it'll come back just as bad as it is now or even worse. 
I was on a birth control for my terrible periods and subconsciously wanted it to clear my acne. Which it did, however after 2 years of taking birth control I stared having health issues and had to come off the pill. For most of the time I was on the pill my skin was pretty clear, but my hormones went crazy once I stopped taking it, my break outs were terrible. It took months to try and get in under control. I suggest going to see a dermatologist instead, or research and try finding a skin care routine that can help balance your skin.
Also if you are a boy or a girl, helps greatly especially in terms of hormonal acne.

Are Clindamycin pads ones you use to wipe your face with and it leaves Clindamycin on it? 

I‚Äôd use

Cleanser
Clindamycin pads
Adapalene
Squalene
Eye cream
psychological side effects of accutane are anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. 
It's almost impossible to know what side effects you will have. Has anyone in your family been diagnosed/had symptoms of depression? Are you struggling with it? If you are, it's possible that Accutane could make it worse. My doctor said that the symptoms are often exaggerated, and of course they'll(your doctor) be checking up on you and you should try to check up on yourself.
Accutane is not a psychedelic, it will not(or at least, should not) cause you to have mind-altering things. 
I take Accutane, and my main symptom is dry skin and dry lips. Granted I've only been on it a week, but I haven't had extreme symptoms. 
Speak to your doctor abouut your concerns
I was fine when I was on it. Exercise regularly to keep your anxiety under control, it helps. Just be prepared for a change in personality when your skin is clear!
I took Accutane illegally and didn't have any mental side effects. But I read online that it's very rare to have depression and suicidal thoughts. I also read that short term memory is a possibility too  
Definitely discontinue use!!!! I experienced this too. Take a full, no product break for about 24 hours and then reintroduce a very very gentle moisturizer, maybe with a bit of tea tree oil mixed in if you‚Äôre concerned about CCs. 
What‚Äôs your routine/products? Take a break, but the right moisturiser would reduce the extremity of this.
Discontinue for a while. I‚Äôve had this issue before too. Use a good quality moisturizer in the meantime. Use the BP more sparingly now that you‚Äôve hopefully seen some results, like every other day even. 
What strength are you using? 2.5% is all you need, it works just as good as anything stronger but without the excessive dryness. Either way you definitely need a moisturizer in your routine. I would stop using it for a little bit until your skin can go back to normal then start over using very little BP. As your skin gets used to it you can gradually use more, but with BP you will always need a moisturizer. I would also recommend an exfoliator to help shed the dead skin and bring new skin to the surface, I use AHA. I recommend acne. Org products, been using them for years.
Discontinue for a few days and then slowly reintroduce it every few days until you can get to every other day. 
Sometimes when this happens to me I am able to LIGHTLY rub off the dry skin using my fingers in the shower.. don't be too harsh .. probably only some will come off at a time .. and the moisturizer I always use is cetaphil. 
use a light moisturizer first, wait 5-10 mins then use the BP..i recommend cetaphil face moisturizer.

BP was always a disaster for me... I use tazorac now 
I used this stuff and it basically burned my face. Stop using!!
You have a few options to decrease the dryness that comes along with BP
1. Contact therapy - put BP all over your face, wait 5-10 minutes, wash face, and then moisturize. Studies have shown BP only needs around 5 minutes on your skin to be effective. Personally, this is my tried and true method. 
2. Mix a tiny amount of BP with your moisturizer and apply after cleansing. 
3. Apply BP AFTER your moisturizer to lessen irritation. It will still be effective in killing the acne-causing bacteria. 

Grow a beard
Looks like you‚Äôre using too much BP. Cut down use and amount. 
I react to dairy, too.  About your username, are you actually allergic to meat?  Just some meats?  Where I live people get tick bites and develop an allergy to red meat.  I thought I had that, too.  But it turned out I had a histamine issue.  Aged meat produces histamine.  
almost completely dropped dairy 6 months ago and it‚Äôs only gotten worse, my acne is classified as severe (in conjunction with medication and a dermatologically engineered skincare routine, weekly light therapy, 60 or more oz of water daily, and a very clean diet). From what i have gathered from studying human-dairy hormonal correlation, dropping dairy from the diet is usually (but definitely not always) effective.
Just recently (as of 2 days ago) cut dairy just to see if my skin will improve. I was also taking biotin with my supplements and read all over that it will make acne worse for some. So we‚Äôll see after a month of dairy free if it was my issue. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs not. 
Totally agree with your last part

"It does not matter if or what I wash my face with"

I have doctor prescribed creams and great products, but my skin still looks like a battlefield even if I use the good shit to prevent them from coming
Same with me. I can‚Äôt completely dropped diary because I love cheese too much, but I do limit the amount I eat and my acne is sooo much better now 
You need to see a dermatologist. That's either eczema or a type of fungal infection. Also stop shaving there for a while. 
Please, im tired of hiding my neck all the time or if im hanging out with a woman im interested in and have to worry whether or not she'll look past my skin problem
Besides, this advice is coming from a black male. üòâ
Let me know if it works for you.
Could possibly be ingrown hair from shaving? If so, try getting a safety razor and shave that way for a while. Could also be eczema or something else, I can't tell. If it's not from shaving you should probably see a dermatologist.
Try a glycolic acid lotion/face wash! 
I use a lotion that has 10% glycolic acid in it, which I put on 3 times I week at night.
And a face wash or bar soap with zinc pyrithione in it, 2% is the highest dosage without prescription I believe. Amazon has great stuff!

Also, if you‚Äôre on a tight budget, i think the company Curology Can help you out with your skin issues. It‚Äôs $20 a month and they prescribed you a cream to put on nightly, made just for you, which they determine with photos of your skin issues and details about any products you‚Äôve used/are using and your skincare routine. I‚Äôve been using them since late November and it‚Äôs worked wonders for my skin issues. Definitely look into those things! 
Apply castor oil to your skin before you shave üòä
How is your diet?
Laser hair removal treatment on your neck. I‚Äôve seen before and after photos on some dermatologists websites for black men who get ingrown hairs on the neck. 
I‚Äôm a bit late but that ain‚Äôt acne. Please see a dermatologist or doctor. It looks like eczema. This could have a simple solution but we need a proper diagnosis!
most people think its ingrown hair bumps ive read everything here but it seems im getting mixed comments. i had this issue since 2007  (15 yrs old) the day i used someone elses razor to shave  it looked A LOT worse but i did everything i could to try to fix this, from shaving only once a month to using a product called Magic shaving powder which has to be mixed with water and put on the area where you want the hair to come off it helped a bit but now it still looks very ugly. its kinda annoying going to a barbershop and having your barber have a look of shock and disgust when he looks at your neck or feeling insecure around a woman you're interested in only to doubt you'll have any chance with her cause she'll find your skin problem gross , it doesnt help when you have severe self esteem problems. I still appreciate all the suggestions  you've all left me and i thank you all
BC and Accutane sis! 
I would not recommend using hand wash on your face as it's quite harsh and could irritate the skin, causing more inflammation. Try switching from cetaphil  since cetyl alcohol can be irritating for some people too. 
It looks like your acne is on the lower half of your face implying it could be hormonal. Birth control like Dianette (Co-cyprindiol) is usually prescribed for hormonal acne if you don't want to try Roaccutane (Isotretinoin). 
You didn't mention which topical prescription you have. If it's something like benzoyl peroxide + clindamycin adding a topical retinoid could help. 
Current routine?
24 years old male currently and recently stopped getting acne and left with acne scars. I stopped my acne from flaring up by using a biore face wash 2 times a day and a moisturiser  that works with my skin. I personally found it difficult to find a moisturiser that doesn't cause acne and after 24 years I finally found my solution. Try some moisturizers from Neutrogena which is what I'm currently using. I've personally tried retinol moisturizers creams from Amazon but found they irritated my skin and caused my skin to become red. Hope any of this helps. I had acne pretty much my entire life and it sucks and completely understand but don't worry and don't give up and keep trying different solutions until you find one that works with your skin. Good luck to you and best of luck! 

EDIT: I stopped taking topical treatments.
Elimating dairy is a big thing for A lot of people, however it didn‚Äôt work for me. 

Eliminating Gluten has been much more successful in my case. Everybody is different though. 

Also Eminence skin care products have proven to be helpful. I‚Äôve spend thousands of dollars on professional products and dermatologists, eminence is pricey but has been the most successful for me so far. 

Try cutting dairy and sugar out of your diet

I‚Äôm all about natural/moderate approach when appropriate but there‚Äôs no shame in the medicine game! You‚Äôll feel so much better and finally be able to think about more important things than your skin..
Spironolactone cured mine
Don't use accutane lol i think you barely started. 
Keto diet or if you want to go all in go carnivore for 2-4 weeks as a test. At least low carbs. You are what you eat and carbs often cause acne and a bunch of other problems

Have you looked in spironolactone? It really helps a lot of people with hormonal acne which jawline acne usualky indicates.
Girl, you and I have almost identical acne. From the comments, removing dairy didn't help a bit. Your acne doesn't really look cystic and cutting dairy mostly helps cystic acne. OTC's didn't work for me. Birth control didn't work for me either. If yours is related to hormones, BC or Spiro would probably help you. See a derm! I'm starting Accutane in about 3 weeks
[removed]
Since it hasn't been suggested yet... have you tried **YoDerm**? They are an online dermatology that connects you with certified dermatologists that can prescribe you the appropriate medications for your skin conditions. 

4 easy steps (taken from their website):

1) sign up for a consultation ($59)

2)Fill out a brief medical profile with pictures of your skin so your dermatologist can diagnose you.

3) Your dermatologist will create your customized treatment plan.

4) You can pick up your prescriptions from a local pharmacy of your choosing.

I love YoDerm and have experience very positive results since recommendations are made by professionals and are tailored to my specific skin conditions. I'm sure they can bring you the same positive results, if you do give them a try! :)

You will need to use really good products when shaving.

An oil to soften hairs, then some foam, and after apply some after-shave.

The Art of Shaving has some really great, yet expensive products.
Use castor oil before you shave
do you touch your mouth or eat greasy foods a lot? i used to bite my nails/cuticles and always got pimples right there. as well as when i eat super greasy foods like pizza and burgers. 
 I get these. I might be from drooling in your sleep, try and moisturize the area with lotion before bed to protect the skin, maybe switch up your toothpaste
I doubt it. I took it for a period of months when I was your age with no permanent side affects. If you‚Äôre this concerned I would recommend speaking with the prescribing physician. 
.....probably not. but please dont take it without doctor supervision
I can safely say that you are completely fine. People take it for months upon months upon months you know? It‚Äôs nothing to be scared of. You‚Äôll be okay I promise. Everything is in your head and the symptoms (apart from the eczema you said you‚Äôve always had) were completely normal. 
No
The billion dollar question! If you find the answer please do tell us! If it is swollen put ice. 
Current routine: 
Tetracycline oral tablets
Duac cream (clindamycin + anhudrous benzoyl peroxide) before bed
Vitamin D oral 1000ug
Wash face 3 times a day with luke walm water
And moisturize after shower
1 coffee a day, only dairy I get a day
No pizza or rubbish foods high vegetables etc
Cannot have accutane due to other medications
At a bit of a loss in all honesty 
(The pic is from a good week not as bad as normal)

Absolutely get her to a dermatologist before her problem causes permanent scarring. She shouldn‚Äôt have to become disfigured, how heartbreaking for a child that age to have to endure this. Good luck.
As someone else with sensitive skin, have you ever tried Azelaic Acid? I‚Äôm in the UK too, I can‚Äôt get it prescribed because I use Differin but I use a suspension from The Ordinary, called Azelaic Acid 10% suspension. I use it every other day and it is good for combating spots and redness without drying out the skin. 
Have you tried salicylic acid? 
Are you ever oily, or just dry all the time?
Get epiduo from your doctor and never ever touch your face unless you‚Äôre washing it. acne goes away perfectly even if it‚Äôs annoying now but scars might stay forever so don‚Äôt pop anything! Let it go away on its own
What‚Äôs your skin care routine? 
Incorporate prescribed retinoid in combination with an antibiotic if you have access to a doctor.

Additionally, utilise Vitamin C for the scars. This promotes collagen production.

If you don‚Äôt have a skincare routine, ask me and I‚Äôll PM you more details.

I‚Äôll be honest you look really good my man. If we weren‚Äôt talking objectively about your skin it‚Äôd fly right over my head. 
Hey man I don't have anything relevant to add, but you should check out r/curlyhair if you care to You seem to have really dry, frizzy hair like mine. I may be wrong tho it is just one pic. That sub has helped me so much
I‚Äôve found that for me having something else to do with my hands is good at keeping me from doing it throughout the day. 
Putty, slime, a fidget cube, a mobile game, something to keep your hands busy. 
I only pick in front of the mirror, and when I go through bad bouts, I'll put post it notes on the mirror. If you live alone, slap that thing right where your face would be and have it say something motivational, or Don't Pick!, or even make a challenge out of it (i.e. Don't Pick December, Frickin Stop Picking February).

If you do it away from the mirror, put a rubber band around your wrist and lightly snap it every time you start. Some people might say this method is a little too much or potentially controversial (self-harm if you do it hard enough), but picking at your face is a form of self-harm to a certain extent. Light rubber band snaps are the lesser of two evils and the marks either don't show or last a few seconds.

Also, I don't know your gender or if you paint your nails, but I'll often paint my nails if I feel like picking. You can't pick with wet nails, especially if it's a kind of polish that takes forever to dry (such as a clear gel topcoat).

Best of luck to you!
You're so cute 
i use the mario badescu acne cleanser and it works wonders on my face. for my more body-area acne (chest, back, shoulders, etc) i use the neutrogena clear facial bar. i would also steer away from using highly fragrances body washes! 
What have you tried so far? I‚Äôd be happy to leave suggestions but sometimes I‚Äôm stating the obvious.
Epiduo
Could be from pillows 
low carb paleo diet
1) Are you female?
I really suggest spironolactone-- you should try googling it to read fully about what it is/what it does. You should not take sprionolactone if you are male because it helps block the male hormones that causes jawline/hormonal acne. 

I had hormonal acne on my jawline and mouth only that got so severe in my early 20s that I couldnt smile or make facial expressions. Acne upon acne. It didn't matter WHAT I DID because whatever was wrong was inside of my body chemistry. I'm 26 and still have the issue and cannot stop taking spironolactone.

In my early 20s before I started it, my face actually got infected. I currently buy my spironolactone online, but cannot say where due to rules. You can also ask your doctor to prescribe it to you!

I'd also like to add that I thought my face would be messed up for life, but it cleared up and I was able to then help heal scarring, etc. 

I totally understand where you are at and good vibes.
I know how it feels, and I get why you want to hide away! But think about it, do you look at other people and get disgusted by their acne? Probably not. I think the majority of people know that acne is just a condition that some people struggle with, and almost no one looks at another person and thinks "oh gross, they have zits". Most people just don't care. :) I hope that provides at least a little comfort! I know I obsess over my skin as well, but then when I see other people with acne, I realize that I don't care and don't even really notice theirs.
That's amazing. I need to try that out!
Lookibg great! Clindamycin has really helped me too!
Congratulations! For the PIH/red scars what do you think worked? Or just the time? 
Nice transformation ;)
I use tretinoin cream already but what does clindamycin cream do? I might have to start using that!
What moisturizer do you use 

Are you taking anything oral such as birth control pills or Spironolactone? Your skin looks amazing by the way!!! 
i cut out most dairy products and saw some improvement by substituting almond milk, etc. it‚Äôs worth a shot to be honest 
Yes dairy causes acne.  Try switching to plant based milk.
Dairy is often linked to acne. I cut out dairy two weeks ago and I'm seeing results. It could be a coincidence or not but it doesn't hurt to try going dairy free for a while.
for some people, yes.  for other people, no.  you should take it out of your diet for a bit to see if your acne decreases.  i think a low carb paleo diet is the best way to go.  supplementing zinc helps, too.
I've been drinking more milk and incorporating yogurt to my diet I haven't noticed more pimples. So I would have to say no.
That‚Äôs a dark spot. Hyperpigmentation. The aftermath of a spot. Make sure to moisturise all the time; not just when your skin is dry. Trust me, it makes a big difference.

For the actual scars themselves: Vitamin C. There are many variations, I think The Ordinary have one. Any questions just ask :)

No. They are 2 completely different products.

Eurocin-A Gel is an antibotic that treats acne by killing the baceteria and since it's an antibiotic, over time, the bacteria will develop a resistance to it, thus making the product ineffective. 

Adapalene stops acne by causing your skin to constantly push the new layer of skin outwards. This prevents your pores from clogging up and forming the bacteria.

You can use both at the same time ( Eurocin in the morning and adapelene at night) 



Ulcerative Colitis is leaky gut.  The barrier between your digestive system and your bloodstream is broken so things that you eat end up in your bloodstream undigested.  Which is going to cause all sorts of problems.  I recommend looking into a specialized diet to treat ulcerative colitis.  You want to avoid eating foods which harm your gut.  
Sugar has always been the biggest offender for me. Id bet on that. Especially if you had a significant increase in blood sugar (ie ate a lot of sugar) as that increases insulin which increases sebum production and inflammation. If

dairy acne or vegetable oil acne.  Try a low carb paleo diet and see how it goes.
Maybe your moisturiser contains drying ingredients; alcohol and perfume. Normally once in the am is enough 
I know its annoying but sunscreen will help with the red marks overtime. And I mean sooner rather than later if you use it every day. 
Vitamin C serum.
> I just wanna see what my face looks like clear for once.

Same sis. You don't even know what my face looks like right now. It's terrible, and I'm struggling in all aspects of my social life. I'm so insecure that I don't even want to go out of the house. I'm sorry I can't help you more but I heard cooling it with ice (not directly) once or twice a week helps it calm down and normalize a bit, my sister often ices her face for 15 minutes every Saturday and applies sunscreen (50 spf) every day. Worked for her.
This is probably what‚Äôs called postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. I use tretinoin cream, which not only helps prevent/eliminate breakouts, but also is used to clear this hyperpigmentation. I‚Äôd definitely recommend looking into it.
Topical skincare with lactic acid OR vitamin c help a lot in PIH.
Have you been to see a dermatologist bro? They would be able to provide you with medication. 
I would recommend CeraVe face wash paired with a very simple moisturizer. Honestly you might not have to go farther than that, my skin is also very sensitive so acids and peroxides usually just dry it out and irritate it further. I recommend CeraVe because it‚Äôs not to damaging and as long as you repair it with a moisturizer you should start seeing a difference. 
My recommendation is acne dot org regimen. 
What‚Äôs your skincare routine like?
Find a wash and moisturizer that work for you. Wash in the morning and evening. Since you‚Äôre sadly just in that age, it‚Äôs not gonna go away completely. You will grow out of it, and i personally advise you to stay away from acne medication. It‚Äôs nasty stuff. Keep your nails short, hands clean and don‚Äôt pick at your face. If you do (we‚Äôre all human), make sure to wash your hands before and your face after. Most of what you have in the pic is discoloration from previous breakouts. You can use some bio oil before bed to help those fade. Hang in there!
There‚Äôs this gel by Christine Schrammek called gel super purifant. I‚Äôve been wearing it over night for a week and there‚Äôs been a noticeable reduction in spots on my face (I have acne similar to yours)

No pizza, no chips, no "bad" or "fun" food. Vegetables are your new best friend.

I recommend a low carb paleo diet and a little bit of zinc.  
I think eczema often has a leaky gut connection.  You should consider an autoimmune paleo diet to give your gut time to heal.  Antibiotics will mess up the gut flora.   Google eczema and paleo diet and also acne and paleo diet.  Maybe collagen and/or glycine as supplements for gut healing.
For acne supplements, zinc is the best.  Other people have found success with a variety of supplements.  The good thing about supplements is that unwanted side effects are very rare.  If they do happen, you can stop them by stopping the supplement.
Since accutane gives you dry eyes and skin, take the symptoms as information to not try it again.
Idk about actual collagen supplements but I know a combo of L-Lysine and Vit C helps assist with the formation of collagen. 

I‚Äôve been taking L-Lysine for 4 months and Vit C for one out of those 4 months. Idk whether it helped with my collagen (haven‚Äôt taken it long enough to see results I  suppose).
Some people do better with collagen, other people do better with glycine.  
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. It‚Äôs just that some people‚Äôs skin cannot handle Vaseline. What works for one, may not work for another, even the gentlest, non-comedogenic product.
[deleted]
Look up folliculitis it‚Äôs actually not acne. Saw this pic and it looks just like my forehead so I looked some stuff up and think it‚Äôs the most similar one. One of the treatments is the Nizoral mentioned above. I‚Äôm going to try it, let me know if you get results too!!
Wash your face with an olive soap bar it worked for me after one night
It looks like that is clogged pores. Do you wear makeup every day?
[removed]
The kind that doesn't exist.
Acne depends on a lot of factors.
How old are you?
Do you break out more a certain time of the month?
What is your diet like?
What is your current skin care regimen?
Do you use any prescription drugs or use any topical acne treatment?
Hormonal acne is more commonly on the chin, but it's not always isolated there, so that could be a factor. Do you have acne on both sides of your face, or is predominantly on one side? A friend in college had painful breakouts just on the left side of her face, and finally pieced together that she only slept on that side. She started washing her pillowcase more frequently and only using fragrance-free detergent with no fabric softener, and that helped tremendously. 

The only time I've ever had a breakout on my cheeks was after being in a really polluted city (Beijing). According to face mapping (which may be quackery, I'm not sure), there's a link between respiratory issues and your cheeks. So if you've been sick with a cold or the flu lately, that could also be a factor. 

Are you using moisturizer? Topical creams can dry your skin out and lead to breakouts. You might also want to read reviews of everything you're taking and see whether some have a worse breakout before it gets better. 
[deleted]
If you want profound results ask your current derm or PCP about BC and Accutane... 
Don't eat it, give it to a homeless, melt it and take a bath in it 
[deleted]
My friend said that her gynaecologist said that some people stop getting acne once they give birth . I think it was about people who have cysts in their ovaries 
Yes - you shouldn't be washing your face with hot water always. 
Id recommend just using the peroxide outside of the shower with a warm cloth. The cold shower won‚Äôt open up your pores. If you have to do your routine in the shower I‚Äôd say use lukewarm water 
Absolutely. 
It's just an antibacterial. You don't need hot water. The whole hot water 'opening your pores' thing is a myth anyway. 
Omg I thought I was the only one. This happens to me consistently. I don‚Äôt experience body acne *knocks on wood* but if I break out on the left I‚Äôll break out on my right the next week... if someone could explain this that‚Äôd be awesome! 
For the cysts I know that they never disappear .

For the rest I also break out approx on the same area. Always on my cheeks never on my forehead 
It‚Äôs the same for me. It‚Äôs like a mirroring zit pattern. My acne is hormonal so I assume that since my zits are on the lower half of my face, it mimics where a man‚Äôs beard should be.

And beards grow symmetrically so the zits are just doing the same. Like both are controlled by hormones but one‚Äôs just hair and the other is well, pimples. 
Definitely don‚Äôt use lemon juice on your skin. It‚Äôs way too acidic. Have you tried any vitamin C products? They can help with marks. Azelaic Acid is another good product to try. I‚Äôve had success in reducing red marks left from acne by using Alpha Arbutin. The Ordinary has all of these products but I‚Äôm sure you can try out other Vitamin C products as well. I know there are creams made with Alpha Arbutin and I believe iHerb carries Azelaic Acid products. 
I would highly suggest to stop using the lemon juice. It will throw your skin off balance. Use plenty of SPF to stop those dark marks from getting darker, they may be scars but they look  more like hyperpigmentation to me. 
Hmmm maybe the ‚Äúred marks‚Äù for you is what ‚Äúdark spots‚Äù is to me. Looks like scarring from acne. 

You might want to do a facial peel maybe like a glycolic acid peel.

To be honest, your face looks good though! 
Bio oil mixed with tea tree oil has helped me a lot! 
COSRX centella blemish cream was able to fade my red marks. I heard that vitamin C serums also help. 
 darling you gotta stop popping those.  You have got to give it time!
 darling you gotta stop popping those.  You have got to give it time! Accutane takes a while unfortunately  but the damage you're doing is expensive if not irreparable. 
Looks exactly like my fungal acne did. 
That‚Äôs fantastic - sounds like you have a good derm.
Oh yea, I‚Äôve had steroid injections for cyst before. And was on accutane.. Best results ever.
I had the same problems with the antibiotics. I told my crazy(but also very nice and highly intelligent) old dermatologist that it randomly started giving me hives and he basically told me that it was fine and to keep taking it.(Not a doctor and not giving medical advice)

Don't forget you can call your doctor's office for questions about your medications like this, or even talk to a pharmacist when you pick it up at the very least. He might move up your appointment, and he will at the very least advise you what to do in the meantime.

My derm 100% does not prescribe Accutane, and while I think that's a little extreme, I also think that your acne should be extreme or at the very least resistant to all other treatments before you consider it. 

My derm always does combo treatment, and the last round we tried was adapalene and a topical antibiotic(clindamycin I believe, also didn't give me hives). I would ask about using a combination of treatments, and definitely try a retinoid before you're too close to leaving for college and have to worry about the possible initial purge.
Visiting r/accutane would really help you. And the thing about accutane is that you don‚Äôt know what side effects/the severity of the side effects until you take it. It‚Äôs different for everyone. 
But do your research and have a serious conversation with your derm. And remember it‚Äôs YOUR decision. I personally wasn‚Äôt into the whole go vegan, give up dairy, heal your gut etc. bullshit. No other medications and topical work for me, and I knew I would be miserable by drastically changing my diet. So that‚Äôs why I decided accutane would be right for me. 
[removed]
could you read Loren Cordain's "Dietary Cure for Acne" and try that before accutane?  There are a lot of people who have had negative reactions to accutane.  Changing one's diet will not cause harm in the way that accutane does and you can always change it back if you want.
In terms of money, stock up on frozen veggies! They are very cheap and easy to make. I like to eat broccoli with cheddar cheese on top. For snacks, I buy bulk carrots and celery and chop them myself to save money. You would be surprised how filling celery with peanut butter/steamed veggies make you for cheap! 

I feel your pain, carbs really are the most budget friendly option but there is totally a workaround if you watch for sales etc. 
Gluten makes me feel particularly shitty. I have a friend in post med, I highly respect him and he denies the gluten stuff.  Its really hard for me to deny that it makes me feel bloated for hours after eating a sandwich or pasta. I currently eat 0 gluten. 

I've heard that forehead breakouts are gluten related. Though my pimples were never on my forehead, I really believe it has a negative impact on how I feel. Good luck to you and don't be afraid to commit 100%!
I've been having good results so far with Vitamin D(3000 IU target, including dietary sources) and fish oil supplements. My skin doesn't seem to be producing as much oil since I started taking it.

I also have an actual deficiency and I'm not 100% sure it's the supplements, but nothing else I'm doing has changed. YMMV.
I can't eat gluten either. In fact I can't eat any carbs at all sadly. Have you tried like gluten free bread or pasta and will you stay clear on that?
It exfoliates your skin
[deleted]
Everyone talks about cetaphil being gentle but doesn‚Äôt it have alcohol in it? I‚Äôve started using CeraVe though, and making some of these same changes, as I approach my mid twenties. I wish I had known I didn‚Äôt need to bomb my skin with sacylic acid and benzoyl peroxide and rough physical exfoliants... but chemical exfoliants have changed my life. Have you ever used glycolic acid, or any retinol? 

Edit: single word change. I goofed. 
I recently came to a similar conclusion about conditioner causing my back acne. I've started to tie it up in a cotton tshirt after I condition, and then doing a full body scrub with gentle soap. It's been really helping! 
I oil cleansed today for the first time and I swear I see a difference although I‚Äôm disappointed I didn‚Äôt get grits like the pics I‚Äôve seen
Show me the receipts... 
Are you resting your chin on your hand? I usually get small congested pimples along my jawline if I do that, and it usually doesn't go away for weeks. 
My acne is usually concentrated along my jawline, my doctor prescribed a clindamycin topical solution and it works really well!
Bit of background, struggled with acne since I was about 16 but lately it seems to have been getting worse. 

I was on benozyl peroxide for about 2 years from 19-21, which initially helped a lot, but before long my acne was back and worse than before. Eventually went off BP, and again my acne nearly cleared up. But it was false hope and it's just gotten worse again since then, don't think my acne has been this bad in years. 

Started a new regimen with face wash, BP and moisturiser twice a day so here's hoping this works, but knowing my history I'm doubtful.

For me acne always seems to concentrate itself in one spot, right now it's my jawline but in a months time it could be my forehead. It's always just in the one spot but moves around my face.

So...is accutane my only option now?
I would suggest googling acne clinics in your area.  Not a dermatologist that will just prescribe 
Meds.  Someone that will do treatments and teach you about products, ingredients and lifestyle changes.   I went to one where I am and it changed my life in ways a derm never did 
[removed]
Could be fungal acne
I'm not a big fan of antibiotics. Maybe its hormonal? Have you tried epiduo? I had the same kind and it took a while but it's worked for me. Am a woman though. 
How long have you been doing your dietary changes?
Have you considered the Acne dot org regimen and using their benzoyl peroxide leave-on gel? It worked very well for me. 
After studying skin for more than 20 years, your problems may stem from your product usage. What are you currently using?

Sorry but treating Acne is about Trial and error.

Looks like and in-grown hair to me
I'm 23. I had rather intense acne most of my teens (whiteheads), but it eased out when I was about 19. Since then I've had mostly clean face, sometimes some breakouts but nothing major or lasting. But now I got this pimple which doesn't want to go away. It started out as a whitehead, in november I think. I popped it after a few days. Then it started healing as a scab. It became bumpy and red. Then I scratched it by accident before it was ready to fall on its own and it looked like a crater for a while. There was some blood too. After that it smoothed out (mid december) and it stayed about the same since. It's smooth, kinda shiny, aches slightly when i touch it, aches very rarely on its own. Every few days it tries to dry but only a white flake forms which falls off after another few days and it still looks the same. Few times in dec/jan the inflamed area expanded and one or even two whiteheads appeared in close vicinity to the main pimple, but they went away quickly. 
I tried putting an acne gel on it for few days, washing my face thoroughly, and now I'm avoiding this area and when showering and nothing helped. I started drinking 2l water a day since sunday and I feel it helped with my face in general but not this pimple. 

Does anyone has any idea what this pimple is and how to tackle this problem? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
It's definitely not a scar. Apply a 10% micronized benzyl peroxide gel-cream at night after cleansing your skin. You can find this at Wal-Mart or Walgreens. Do this nightly for a week and see if it improves. Let me know. 
You‚Äôre supposed to use more of the 2.5% not going to a higher dosage unless you wanna risk dehydrating(damaging) your skin more. You your skin to be healthy and retain moisture at the end of the day. 
Def ingrown hair. 
Hi. I'm sure it's a combination of both product usage and puberty. To combat acne, use a mild gel cleanser such as CeraVe foaming facial wash. For acne, apply a 10% micronized benzoyl peroxide gel-cream at night after cleansing. You can find these products at your local Walgreens. 
Benzac blackhead scrub is great for clearing out blackheads, cetaphil cleanser is good for acne and gentle on skin. If your acne is mild you should be fine with just over the counter products, but if it worsens make an appointment with your doctor, I spent too many of my teenage years suffering without the help of prescription options out there.
I use it every morning and have been for about 2 years. I think it helps with my little pimples, not as much with my cystic ones and with the evenness of my skin tone. I have stopped using it and my skin just gets kind of ruddy and not as healthy looking. Someday I will stop using it bc it‚Äôs hella expensive but right now I will soldier on. 
Yes
Serum first, right as face is still damp but not wet. Moisturizer after that absorbs. 
I have a .25mm right now and just recently bought a 1mm for my scars (this is the recommended starting length for scar healing). I read a ton of reviews beforehand and everything was really positive about it and helping scars. The biggest thing I took away was to clean the needles consistently with alcohol and wait 4-6 weeks between use to make sure you dont damage the skin. Also dont use it on active acne. I'm post-accutane now so I'm just working on healing old scars. 

Its recommended to not go much higher than 1mm at home due to increased risk of damaging the skin and infection, but I didnt see any horror stories when I was researching them. Mine will get here in a few days. I'm excited to give it a try!
I personally would rather get it done professionally
Hi Reddit fam!

Firstly apologies for the uggo picture. 
I had a breakout 2 days ago and It has gotten considerably worse. 

When I wake up my in the morning I only had a few pimples but over the course of the day,  this‚òùüèΩ is what I look like. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening, and I have a feeling it‚Äôs food related. 

A couple of hours after waking up there was a lot of redness, which has gradually turned into a cluster of pimples on my left cheek.
The right cheek is totally clear. 

Any ideas what this could be? Too rich moisturiser? Banana every morning? Bad cleansing routine (though this is very unlikely). 

Since the pimples have formed heads, can I get rid of them tonight? 

Thank you so much for any help!

Routine:
AM - wash face with bior√© black charcoal cleanser.  (Today I used a Liz Earl cream cleanser)
Clarins double serum
Sisley Black Rose moisturiser

PM - wash face with bior√© again. Though now I have bought Kiehl‚Äôs midnight recovery oil (could this be the reason for breakouts)
Clarins serum
Sisley face cream 
Did you do any drankin or excess sugar consuming recently?
Serious - which side of your face do you hold your phone on or do you sleep on? 
Since they look like whiteheads, it may just be your routine.. Usually hormonal acne is along the jawline or chin area. Use a gentle scrub and a light acne wash. Change pillow cases!
Something similar like this has happened to me when my face‚Äôs moisture barrier was compromised. It was so dry and itchy, I had tiny pimples pop up seemingly randomly all over my face. Not sure it could be that.
Aztec healing clay mask and clean pillow case ‚ú®üòäüëçüëç
Looks like it may be hormonal, when its that time of the month I will literally  break out over night in the same area. Tea tree oil is the only thing I feel works for my hormonal acne, 
Obvious one - have you tried eliminating dairy and cutting back on sugar? That along with taking a solid probiotic has really helped clear me up since I was about 21 (26M).

Also if you‚Äôre stressed at all, try get it under wraps. Cortisol is released/higher when you‚Äôre stressed and that can also lead to a fluctuation in your hormones leading to more acne.
BHA will begin to WORK immediately, however, you will not notice optimal changes in the skin from any skin care product until you have gone through two skin cycles, each one being approximately 28-42 days depending on your age. 

First skin cycle your skin is acclimating; second skin cycle noticeable changes occur because of cellular cycle. 

*I‚Äôm a licensed esthetician/acne specialist.
8 to 12 weeks for max effect.
first couple weeks in its your first BHA, you might experience some purging
With the beard it's not that noticeable. Hope you can get to a point where you can see that it's not bad. Ppl on here will give you some good ideas to help it 
I also worry about my scarring, though it‚Äôs mild. I think you‚Äôre an attractive guy and your scarring is also mild. I know how depressing it can be, but it doesn‚Äôt detract from your appearance. Once the slight redness subsides, it will look even better. One thing that makes me feel better is that almost everyone has some scarring or something similar on their face. Most people don‚Äôt notice it or care about it. 
Acne scars are totally treatable. I don‚Äôt know what is your skin routine but BHA &AHA products will do the trick. It‚Äôll take time but it will work. 
Hi. I used to have severe cystic acne. I've more or less taken care of it with dietary changes. I still break out but only when I cheat. Unfortunately I have extremely severe acne scarring that basically depletes my will to live. That sounds extreme, but I actually consider suicide regularly when I think about how different my face looks than it used to. I have a condition that both causes my skin to be very elastic and makes me scar easily. What, if anything, can be done about scarring like this?
!remind me 1 week
Chemical exfoliants WILL help in the long run, and maybe consider researching dermarolling (not sure if that‚Äôs the right word but the roller with the spikes?) it apparently helps with rebuilding collagen which will help fill in the pocks. Cosrx makes great BHAs and AHAs that are affordable. Sunday Riley‚Äôs blue oil (can‚Äôt remember actual name but is literally blue) would also help with pigmentation and scarring, NaturalBeauty69 makes a great dupe for it which is available on Etsy if you‚Äôre looking for a more affordable option that SR (I use this and it is awesome and has helped my skin dramatically over the last few months). Honestly though, I know you feel very bad and self conscious about your skin, but just try to see the positives that your skin is clear now, and the scars really aren‚Äôt that deep or bad, and CAN be changed. Just try to keep positive and over time you will feel better about yourself, cuz no one deserves to feel that crappy. You got this!
Microdermabration (by a professional, not that at home kits) or a chemical peel will help minimize your superficial scars (scar tissue beneath the surface will always remain). Castor Oil is good for scars. You can mix it with a carrier oil, like olive oil or grape seed oil, because castor oil is very thick. It can penetrate the skin and promote healthy skin growth around scar tissue, minimizing its appearance. The Castor Oil isn't going to change your skin over night, it takes a while and is a daily process.
Thanks for the encouraging comments. It might be my warped perspective but I actually don't see much difference from what I have and what is considered severe scarring. That might be a warped perspective but it's where I am for now. I'll look into what's been suggested though and see what's best for me. I don't have a lot of money right now but am willing to save for procedures if I could see real changes.
face masks
It sounds like your skin care routine is good. But sometimes, hormones are a bitch and nothing will help. I was in your same situation when I turned 18 and got birth control (not sure if you are female), but I had the WORST acne ever for about three years. I just assumed it was my genetics. I got off the birth control, and now my skin is practically blemish free. I still use some acne products from my derm. I'd recommend seeing a different derm once more, if you are female try getting on a birth control, in combo with acne gels.

I will just mention two things that I have had luck with: Acne dot org regimen and Curology. Acne dot org is centered around using copious amounts of benzoyl peroxide, and Curology is centered around working online with a dermatologist assigned to you, and they prescribe a single bottle of a formula using 3 prescription-only medicines that is a topical cream. Acne dot org regimen can cost around $40-$60 to get started, and Curology is $4.99 for the first month/bottle.
Find a Face Reality specialist in your area. would love to include a link but can‚Äôt so encourage you to google. 
People do go on multiple rounds of accutane if the first round was not successful.
There‚Äôs a whole reddit forum for curious people getting into Asian beauty üåö I was an avid lurker once. I haven‚Äôt tried too many products, my skin type is sensitive mildly acne prone and easily dehydrated but still oily. I really liked the etude house moistfull collagen cream, and the lady kin cactus aqua cream was pretty good. But I like the etude house more, it‚Äôs more moisturizing. I‚Äôve mostly used creams with added essences and ampoules than just moisturizers. 
Some good alternatives are from the cerave brand, the daily moisturizer for normal to dry skin is a good staple, and the pm facial moisturizing lotion. I‚Äôve used both for sometime and liked both; I still prefer Korean skincare for the price and how lightweight the creams can be(and the ingredients).

Do you really want it? I‚Äôve tried it and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that great tbh. It‚Äôs definitely not worth $200. It does peel your skin so you‚Äôre replacing old layers with new really fast, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it helped my acne. I used it for a long time too like longer than 6 months. That‚Äôs just my opinion though....

What kind of skin do you have? 
I know this may not be useful or even realistic, but if you're doing any traveling in Europe, see if you can get it at a pharmacy. In my experience, some products that are prescription in America are OTC in Europe and cost wayyyy less. Although I don't know if you need a prescription for tretinoin in Europe anyway. You might have to see a dermatologist there, which actually might still be cheaper than $200 even without local insurance. 

This suggestion is only if you happen to be in Europe, otherwise it's obviously too expensive to go there just for cream. My insurance covered my tretinoin but it was still expensive as hell, I think around the $60 mark. It didn't do anything for me though. 
This can be overridden with a doctor's note, if the tretinoin is for acne and not for cosmetic reasons.  Your doctor and insurance should be familiar with this process.  Try again.  If it is for cosmetic purposes, then you are SoL, as your insurance likely does not cover cosmetic scripts.
Where are you going to use it for?
Have you tried Differin? I'm 29 and it's the only thing that's ever cleared my adult acne. 
Focus on your diet. Try vegan and take allergy pills 
I would meet with a dermatologist about it. Since you‚Äôve already tried antibiotics, it is the logical next step. I went on Accutane from June-December after I broke out last spring when I stopped antibiotics. I cleared up right away and while the side effects aren‚Äôt fun, it was absolutely worth it. My skin is great now and all of the side effects are gone.
looks like some cystic. are they painful?
No
Are you on Accutane currently? It can cause closed comedones at first. IMO the best way to get rid of them is glycolic acid, but you probably shouldn't use that if you're on Accutane. 
It does look in the second pic like they're surfacing. 
I‚Äôm on accutane on the moment, nearing the end of my course and it has no effect whatsoever on my closed comedones. My dermatologist said that accutane more often than not doesn‚Äôt always work on them (but everyone‚Äôs different so you could be lucky!) and I have to go on a topical after my course is completed...
Here comes the science:
1. Prescription Tretinoin (cellular turnover increases and pilo-sebaceous unit[follicle] becomes less prone to clog.
2. AHA/BHA - Cerave SA line, The Ordinary SA, and throw in a glycolic or lactic treatment in the mix as well. 
3. Pushing, squeezing, or ripping out oxidized sebaceous filaments may seem satisfying but it‚Äôs ineffective, irritating, and can worsen existing condition. Use multiple chemical exfoliation measures as indicated above for 3 months then reevaluate. ALWAYS start conservatively and titrate concentration upwards to avoid irritation.
Sebaceous filaments. 

Edit: Stridex in the red box. 
Google "fifty shades of snail how to reduce pores" and try that method. It's very VERY effective for me. You cleanse your nose, apply a BHA liquid and let it sit 15-20 minutes, then apply a clay mask over it. Rinse that off, apply an oil cleanser and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes and then start rubbing it the area. DO NOT RUB TOO HARD, you can burst blood vessels. If it works for you you'll start to feel "grits" (aka your blackheads) surface. You can try to extract those but it causes a lot of redness and irritation and since they aren't very deep, it probably isn't worth it. 
Strange suggestion here.. but it might work. I would suggest taking a cleansing oil (such as jojoba or hemp seed) and massaging it into your nose while letting skin steam (hop in shower, let face be in the steam). Then really massage nose again and try to see if you can wiggle any of those blackheads loose. I‚Äôm m an esthetician and use a technique like this to soften pores up enough to let impurities out. Good luck if you try it out! 
Google ‚Äúoil cleansing for grits‚Äù
 I know this is an obvious answer but I would go for an extraction treatment. Painful but it gets the job done. You can do it on your own but you need a proper tool and chemicals/serums (post-extraction) for it

Go to sauna it doesn‚Äôt look
Benzac blackhead scrub works a treat for me
Your best bet is to get an Rx from a dermatologist. 

Another good option is to get regular facials with extractions, but this can be expensive.

If you want a DIY solution, try the SkinMiso Nose Pack weekly, and use a comedone extractor to get all the blackheads out after the first step. I have blackheads on my nose and this helps me get it under control. 
is it the one that smells like watermelon?  don't use that , it will cause breakout
I got an allergic reaction from the pink labeled one for combination skin 
Incorrect. If you have an effective regimen, food should not negatively affect your skin at all... you may be sensitive to nitrates or other ingredients in the bacon that, AT MOST, cause inflammation which is not causative of acne in and of itself. You have acne because, like me, you have some unlucky genetics. 
pork has a lot of omega 6.  your omega 6/omega 3 ratio could be too high.  you could try eating more salmon, tuna and sardines to balance it out.  
alternatively, it could just be the brand of bacon.  if you tried organic and/or local bacon, it could be different.
Maybe it‚Äôs not eating bacon but the grease from cooking it. It‚Äôll get on your skin/clothes, try washing your face with a gentle cleanser after you cook. 
maybe try turkey bacon 
It's a nodule or cyst. I know you really want to pop or drain it, but please don't. These can scar very easily and trying to mess with it will only make it scar worse :( would you rather have a bump for a few days-weeks or a scar

Not to mention it can get infected quite easily

(I have scars from messing with cystic bumps) 
[removed]
When I get a pimple that hurts, I apply an ice cube to it for about a minute. That normally stops any pain I get from it.
Geez. Okay so I would say hydrocortisone cream for the swelling, maybe ice (usually doesn‚Äôt work for me) maybe BP. Most likely will need s cortisone shot at the Derm. 
Laser treatment and use sunscreen 
BHA exfoliant one or twice a week, daily sunscreen (potentially more than once a day). Time is for sure the most important factor as my PIH was much worse than yours and mostly faded within ~half a year. Maybe longer than you expected but your marks alright look relatively lightened so it may take less time. Would also recommend checking the skincare addiction Reddit as they have a more detailed help bar.
Vitamin C and dermaroller. 
Post-Inflammatory Erythema are the worst. Ask your dermatologist about prescription Tretinoin, starting with the lowest concentration and working upwards every 3-6 months. 
Tretinoin increases cellular turnover so it works to exfoliate the skin by speeding up the natural process of the tissue itself. This is your heavy hitter. You can use in conjunction with salicylic acid for added benefits. I recommend Cerave SA Lotion because you get the exfoliating benefits of SA without drying alcohol of other SA formulas. It‚Äôs actually very gentle and hydrating. DM if you have questions!
You need to go to a dermatologist to get rid of red marks. 
Moisturize your skin and maybe reduce the usage to every other day.
I've used this before and it did the same thing! It was WAY too drying for my skin. I use the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cleanser and love it! 
Were you moisturizing?
Yeah my skin gets really dry with salicylic acid washes. Right now I'm using just plain gentle cleanser and then lotion that has salicylic acid in it.
Are you able to post pictures? It could be fungal acne. 
A chemical peel is more effective.  Had both done before. 
Microdermabrasion is amazing! The whole process is quick and painless ( kind of feels like a tiny vacuum hose tugging at your face ) and your skin feels amazing and smooth afterwards. You may have a bit of redness afterwards but it will subside within a few hours.
If you have hyperpigmentation / acne scarring this will work wonders for you. I've only had two treatments done and it has lifted so much of my dead and dull skin off and helped to fade my scarring. 

I have to agree with the previous poster though, a chemical peel will be more effective with acne but it never hurts to give microdermabrasion ( or even both ) a try. Have a chat with your dermatologist and see what they have to say. Good luck :) 
It's not bad at all.  It stings for a few minutes and then your skin starts to peel off after a couple days. 
Sadly I've never committed to doing microdermabrasion the way it's meant to be done because of the cost. You need several treatments to actually see results, and in my area, treatments are about $120 each time. I've been told that I personally would need about 5 treatments, and I just don't want to spend that money. You can purchase at-home microdermabrasion machines for a couple hundred bucks, but I wouldn't trust myself to do it right. If you're cheap like me, you probably have to accept that it will take a while and you have to rely on chemical treatments instead. 
I wouldn‚Äôt say there‚Äôs a connection but if you have an intolerance of some kind it could be making your skin worse? Try finding a protein with stevia. Also if it‚Äôs a whey or soy protein that could be an issue 
dilute it with another oil (google "carrier oil") or you can give yourself chemical burns or develop an allergy to TTO :) source: did both to myself and I hate it
For most people, using tea tree oil by itself will give them chemical burns which is why the recommend you should dilute it with a carrier oil, water, or even moisturizer. There isn't certain amounts you should dilute it that I am aware of. Personally, tea tree oil did not work for me, even when I used it without diluting it. Always do a patch test to check if for allergies. 
Bump 
With a carrier oil
Dilute with witch hazel (10:1) so, if you were mixing a very small amount, you'd use 10 teaspoons on witch hazel and 1 teaspoon on tea tree oil
Try getting more sleep
Combination skin type. I used to also pick at my pimples- a habit I just stopped doing this January (it was really hard to stop). I usually sleep around 11-1 before having to wake up at 5 because of work and the internet. I've been stressed lately and here's what I use;

Simple moisturising foaming facial wash. (that green one with the UK's best on it)

For moisturizer, my sister bought me the iWhite aqua mosturizer thing that helps a bit.

I'm still using Adapalene, for four months now and actually at first, I thought it works. Then the holiday break was over and back to my cubicle I go surrounded with paperwork and maths.

Is it time to visit he dermatologist?
What really helped me was NOT washing my face as often and moisturizing morning and night. I wash my face at night in the shower and just splash water in the morning + sunscreen. 

Also cutting back on dairy and sugars helped slightly. 
pretty much killed my acne... only problem is that acne comes back twice as worse once you get off it.
I was on it, it helped for a little bit. Then during my third month it came back so badly! My dermatologist put me on low dose accutane now. I‚Äôm on my second week of one pill Monday and one pill Friday. Fingers crossed for better results this time 
Been on it for a few days now and it's already working, but I know it'll eventually stop working, just like my 4 month course of lymecycline did after 2 months. But hopefully it'll tide me over until my derm referral comes through. 
Was on 100 mg daily plus tretinoin cream along with benzoyl, clindamycin, etc, I felt doxy didn't do jack shit, so my derm put me on accutane
both are normal. 
You really should do more research about this before doing it.  I feel like if you had, you wouldn't be asking this question.  Be careful of infection.
It will eventually go away, but unfortunately as for now you're going to have a lot of dryness/redness. Keep moisturizing!
What adapalene brand are you using? I noticed a big change into less irritated with differin vs other brands, also i would probably recommend getting your skin adjusted to one of these at a time and not both, I‚Äôd suggest going with the adapalene first.
Edit: now i sometimes even use differin 0.3% and no irritation, the brand is awesome 
Stop for a few days and moisturizer a lot! Once it's better, maybe use it every two or three days then work up from there. Your skin will get used to it, just takes a couple of weeks. 
use less amount and use is 3x a week
moisturize
Microneedling
Looks more like pih than scarring, I would try vitamin c serum and daily spf.
I switched to sensitive skin shaving cream and it helped with this same problem. 
I'd say that's common for me. Have you tried using any kind of aftershave or astringent and moisturizing after you finish shaving?
 
I‚Äôve just started using alcohol and after shave,, I also bought a Panasonic trimmer hopefully it doesn‚Äôt have the same effect as a razor
Always use a clean razor blade and shave on  clean, moist skin. Use aftershave to kill bacteria and regularly exfoliate! 
Clean your razors too
I use a product called TendSkin‚Äîit's like a toner you use after shaving to get rid of razor burn and prevent ingrown hairs. You can get it off Amazon or from a beauty supply store. 
Ice ice baby to low the swollen! Don‚Äôt pick it! 
Don't pick it! 
Dude... don‚Äôt pick at it!! ice, ibprofin, cortisone shot at the dermatologist, or some cortisone cream from the drugstore... and finally sleep with a HCbandage on it. Baby it!!
Yes. Doxycycline is just an antibiotic but, it may or may not help. Now if it does, you will notice a month in. Unfortunately, doxy isn‚Äôt a long term solution. I was cleared 6 months ago from terrible cystic acne. My derm prescribed tret with it but i did not really like it due to sun sensitivity and redness. However, you might not have the same issue. Those 3 together are perfectly fine.
Woah wait you got scripts from an online doctor? Wuuut
This exists?
Yes. Thats exfoliating ;) 
Yes!
Legit just woke up hungover with a red face; all you can really do is cut it out or maybe drink more concentrated alchohol(idk if that works) but I've noticed a little bit less after only shots
Personal experience tells me that drinking beer doesn't contribute to a breakout (and even seems to make my skin look slightly better if moderate and combined with generous water consumption) whereas drinking anything else does, with sweet-ish or sugary alcohol types being the worst offenders (so, for example, wine is worse than vodka or tequila and cocktails are the worst).

Not sure if it's a personal quirk of mine so not sure how helpful I am being, but I thought I might share.
Excess sugar can cause acne in a lot of people. So maybe avoid sugary alcohol, try to drink more concentrated alcohol and a LOT of water! 
My layperson tip would be to just chug water any time you are consuming alcohol (of any kind). I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs been much (if any) good evidence to directly link alcohol consumption to acne, but there are several possible contributing factors to acne. A main issue with alcohol consumption is the bodily dehydration, which obviously causes more issues than just zits. With less water in the body, it can‚Äôt flush out as much of the muck (including the ethanol). There are other possible factors correlating to alcohol that may lead to pimples, but in any case, trying to dilute the alcohol as much as possible with glasses of water will certainly not hurt and will only help, whether it helps the future acne breakout, the ‚Äòmorning after‚Äô nastiness, or just bolsters the functioning of the liver during a drinking session.
* edit *
As far as actually stopping any acne related to drinking, the only way would be to not drink alcohol.  For the vast majority of people moderate drinking isn‚Äôt change a flawless complexion into a severely acne-ridden face, but it could potentially be a minor/moderate element of an acne breakout.
Drink lots more water
Alcohol break me out as well. Doesnt matter how much water I drink. Doesnt matter if its plain liquor with now carbs. I just can't tolerate alcohol and perhaps its the same for you. I substitute it with kratom and it pretty much serves the same purpose with more mental clarity and no hangover. Good luck!
Stouts really fuvk up my face its a bitvh cuz chocolate stouts were my shit also any alchol causes inflamation in the body which leads to assisting a break out
Milk thistle helps. In the vitamin isle. It helps your liver process alcohol easier. I always get acne between my eyes if I have a few drinks. 
I was on the Unblemish regiment for 6 months and while it did make a dramatic difference because my skin was so bad it still left a lot to be desired. I recently switched to the extra strength acne line from Paula‚Äôs Choice. It‚Äôs stronger than the Unblemish and is like a 1/3 of the cost. Time will tell, but I‚Äôve really liked the PC BP lotion...and much better than the R+F. I can make the sulfur face wash and toner last for 2.5-3 months using both twice a day, but the BP lotion only lasts 5-7 weeks if I use a tiny amount. 

Edited to add: I‚Äôm also using the Traditional Sulfur Soap - 10% sulfur bar. R+F is only 2-3%. 
I asked for the R+F facewash for Christmas. I started using African black soap right around Christmas and shortly after started using the R+F about 2x a week, and recently nearly 1x a day. My skin is doing better, I think. Sadly because I wasn‚Äôt patient I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs from the ABS or R+F. My sister is on her second order of the R+F unblemish kind and it‚Äôs working for her

We are both over 20F and have acne basically forever
I use the eradikate sulfur spot treatment and LOVE it so hopefully that cleanser is good too!
If you can get a prescription for it "Sodium Sulfectamide 10% - Sulfur 5% wash" is AMAZING. Worked better for me than anything else I tried and it was $20 for a HUGE bottle.
Good to hear your skin is doing better. You have to find what works for you. Everyone is different. 

Asepxia is pretty inexpensive compared to the R&F.  The philosophy product was great too bad it was discontinued.
I have seen some people suggest fidget spinners, stress balls, or putty. Things that keep your hands busy.
Try wearing gloves if nothing else helps. Wearing makeup helps me stop myself from touching my face as much. Keep your nails short and filed smooth. My fidget cube helps also maybe try wearing wrist jewelry to be an extra distraction to touch. 
Honestly, having acne has made me a germaphobe. I think about all the things I've touched during the day, and how I would never ever want my acne-prone skin to touch it. That usually is enough of an incentive to stop picking. Also I stopped allowing myself to stop and stare at my acne in the mirror for long periods of time, it reduced the sense of urgency to pick. 
I wish I knew. I just picked my face for at least a good hour earlier tonight and I‚Äôm feeling so awful about it and myself. 
put bandaids on sum fingers and just remember ‚Äúpopping them not only makes it worse but SPREADS the bacteria ‚Äú
Hey! I'm on Accutane now myself (last month to go!!). It's quite normal to get a flurry of a few spots after you finish, the drug will keep working for up to 6 months after you finish the treatment so all you can do is wait for now. After 6 months if you are still having issues I would go to your derm and talk about a second course, it's quite common for people to have extra courses. Hope this helps!

[Source: My dermatologist; r/Accutane]
Alcohol can trigger acne in a lot of people, if your skin is sensitive to sugary foods. Try to drink less alcohol and avoir cocktails and wine. Maybe try more concentrated alcohol so you need less to feel tipsy and also always drink a lot of water to keep you hydrated while. Alcohol causes dehydration so its not very good for your skin. 

And i think that the sulfur soap might be too harsh to use 2 times a day, its a bit drying. What is your skin type and is there any other steps in your routine that you didnt mention? Do you use moisturizer?? Are you more on the dryer or oilier side?? 
I used pretty much the same products, minus the moisturizer. For me Epiduo was just so hard on my face, and it broke down my moisture barrier quickly. I would recommend dialing back your dose (only apply it once a day if you were supposed to do it morning and night, or every other day if once a day was prescribed), make sure you only apply it to spots with active pimples, and don't use too much (I used a tiny, tiny dot for each pimple). 

If that's still not working, try switching to a heavier moisturizer. I love using 100% argan oil, personally. If that still doesn't help, talk to your derm; some people are allergic to the ingredients in the medication.
Glaxal Base! My boyfriend‚Äôs mom is a pharmacist and she suggested it to me when I had sensitivity from TactuoPump, and it‚Äôs amazing. You might need to go behind the counter at Shopper‚Äôs or Rexall, or it will be in the eczema section. Use sparingly as it supposedly is comedogenic but I personally didn‚Äôt break out from it. 
They should done a test to determine if it‚Äôs bacterial or fungal.  Treatment is different. There are oral antifungals and antibiotics for bacterial. Your doctor is negligent. What if it‚Äôs a staph infection? 

Ketoconazole is only antifungal. Pyrithione zinc is both antifungal and antibacterial.  Might be better to use a soap or shampoo with pyrithione zinc. 

Can you go back to the doctor? Tell them it‚Äôs not working.
[removed]
Where is the folliculitis? Body, scalp or face? Did the dermatologist do a culture test and determine it was fungal and not bacterial?

If it‚Äôs definitely fungal/yeast then the active ingredient in nizoral: ketoconazole is one of the treatment options. Shampoo on the face really isn‚Äôt ideal as it‚Äôs meant for the scalp which is 5x thicker than facial skin. You will dry out your skin and damage your moisturize barrier. You need a moisturizer that repairs and maintains skin barrier like Cerave.

If it‚Äôs on the body then dandruff shampoos are fine. 

If it‚Äôs on the face then look for products for facial seborrheic Dermatitis as they are also effective for fungal/yeast folliculitis. 

Ketoconazole, pyrithione zinc, selenium sulfide, sulfur, piroctone olamine and climbazole are some of the active ingredients to look for in a treatment. It‚Äôs best if the product is designed for the face and not the scalp or antifungal ointment meant for the feet.

Here are a few:

Bioderma Sensibio DS cream

Nutradeica

La Roche Posay Kerium

I made a post with a more extensive list.

Also supplementing with lactoferrin and a probiotic with lactobacillus paracasei ST11 will reduce the yeast/fungus on the skin. Check out my posts.
Hang in there, buddy. 
While you're waiting for accutane stuff to go through, give the oil cleansing method a try. It's helped me a lot. Also, hit up the folks over at r/skincareddiction. They have a lot of helpful tips and routines for dealing with stubborn skin. Hang in there!
Hey!

I am on Accutane now and honestly, it's worth the wait! So be in the knowledge that once it's prescribed you just have to wait for it to work its magic! :)

Unfortunately, as you're in the US there is no way to speed up iPledge but the bloodwork, once taken, will be cleared in a few days so that shouldn't be an issue.

I really hope Accutane works for you because I suffered from cysts too and now my face is 100% clear :)
I've struggled with acne my whole life. It was much worse when I was younger (your age), but even as an adult, I still get it. I used to wear my hair long to hide it, and wear lots of makeup. Nothing ever really fully hid it, so I just lived with it. Though even with acne, I've never had relationship issues based on the way I look. I think after a while I just pretended like it wasn't there. I also got into relationships with people that struggled like me. I'm in a long term relationship with someone who had it bad too, and still breaks out. We could definitely relate on that level, and I think that's important. I hate to break it, but there isn't really a cure for acne. You really just learn to live with it but it does get easier with time. Don't get me wrong, I have a few scars, my skin is permanently blotchy and oily and I hate not wearing makeup. But, I know others like me, and it's great to relate. Just take it one step at a time. I would also try to eat healthy, drink water and always wash your hands. These small things help with break outs.
try to diet change in the meantime. try to slowly cut out foods that are inflammatory. gluten, sugar, dairy, corn, alcohol, etc. should help some while you wait to see the dermatologist. struggling with cystic acne myself and trust me it is awful and impossible to cover with makeup. I‚Äôm on some meds right now , 2 weeks in.. waiting to see some progress but I definitely noticed the eating habits stopped a lot of new breakouts 
I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre experiencing this. I just want to say you‚Äôre not alone. I have spent years hiding my face behind layers of foundation due to acne and the scars/discoloration it‚Äôs caused. Even the thought of someone seeing me without makeup is enough to make me feel panicked. 

I‚Äôm currently on my 2nd month of Accutane. So far it‚Äôs been ok. Haven‚Äôt noticed much of a change in the breakouts yet. If anything it‚Äôs a little better.  But I do feel a little better emotionally, knowing that I‚Äôm doing everything I can to get rid of my acne (I‚Äôve tried every other medication/topical you can think of). 

It only took 1 month from the day I told my dermatologist I was ready for Accutane to start the medication. You need 2 negative pregnancy tests, one month apart, as well as some blood work to make sure your liver is functioning properly. It shouldn‚Äôt take several months to get started, and the ipledge stuff isn‚Äôt really a big deal. You just have to log on to the website and answer a few questions before your pharmacy can release your prescription each month.

I don‚Äôt want to say you should or shouldn‚Äôt try Accutane, but it sounds like you‚Äôve reached the end of your rope with it, and that‚Äôs where I was when I made the decision to start. Whatever you decide, just know that someone out there has lived with the pain and struggle that you have. Acne can be truly debilitating, but it can also be treated. Feel free to DM me if you need to vent or have any questions <3
Saline injections will speed it up. Even without it will likely resolve on its own but it will could take months. It's cutaneous atrophy.
It heals over time! Very cortisone injection I have had done that due to drastically reducing the pimple fast.
Lymecycline was the only antibiotic which gave me any results. For me, it was instant and lasted around 3 months allowing my face to clear. Unfortunately, your body will become resistant to it and if your acne is hormonally caused then it will return after the drug stops working.

For me, it was just one of four antibiotics I took before taking Accutane which really does do the job. It's good for the short term but if you issue persists I would talk to your dermatologist about raising the prospect of a stronger treatment.
I understand. As a woman there are the steps of the pill and possibly spiro along with antibiotics that a dermatologist will make you go through before allowing you to take accutane.
Looks like acne, sometimes they can be itchy. If it's really intense though you should see a dermatologist. 
See a dermatologist right away. I‚Äôve had itchy patches on my face that have been bacterial infections and allergic reactions. I can‚Äôt really see whether your bumps are leaking any pus (infection) but still, best to see a dermatologist to make sure. 
Get some hydrocolloid bandages to put on there and decrease swelling and then treat it. It's pretty bad right now but it can clear up. Clean your phone, change your razor and change your pillowcase. 
Yo bro, I know your case may not be that severe but please go to a dermatologist. Cuz who knows, maybe this will become a bigger issue in the future. And a person like me wouldn‚Äôt want your face to be ruined 
Over the past two weeks I‚Äôve been getting numerous pimples on one specific location over my chin. Not sure what these are or how I can stop them. I assume I used an unhygienic trimmer for my beard. Please help me out guys. 
Just put benzoyl peroxide on it twice a day
If its only in this area, it seems it could be because something irritated your skin and its less likely to be related to your diet... 

I'd say try not to pick, not to touch your face, change your razor/shaving cream. Try to think about what could have been in contact with your chin... is it constantly brushing against your coat? Is there some leftover toothpaste or whatever product you'd be using around/in your mouth?? 

I would also read about fungal acne. I dont know much about that but i know it can happen so it's a possibility. Good luck! 
Benzoyl peroxide! Find those pimple spot treatments that contain around 2.5% or 5% BP at drugstores. It works to shrink, harden and reduce the pain for those big ones, especially the one with the white pus. Don't get the 10%, it's too harsh.
Although I'm not sure you can use it without prescription,  clindamycin phosphate gel really helped disappear a few pimples in as little as 2days, check with a pharmacist and ask them if you can use it, if you really can't get an appointment for a derm. I hope it clears up, mate. Do update us ok? :) 
i‚Äôm not trying to be mean...but i don‚Äôt see where you are talking about? i don‚Äôt see anything there 
Try sudocrem, use it daily on affected areas and it  pretty much heals most indents and scars over time
[removed]
I did and I was fine, but make sure you‚Äôre using a good moisturizer and an SPF!
Yes vitamin d is indeed amazing.
I went tanning a few times. I know its bad... But it Did my skin wonders in only a few days.
Mushrooms are a really great source of vitamin D. 
I‚Äôve been on DIM for three months, then off for two weeks, then back on it for three months again. It definitely improved my skin and eased the symptoms of PMS, but it gave me the worst depression of my life - I had no will to live. It also absolutely killed my libido. I‚Äôve been off of it for a month now, and my acne is definitely getting worse, but it‚Äôs not worth it for me. I hope it works out for you, everyone reacts differently.
Also, to update this- I went back to just the DIM and have been having great results. I think I was just too hasty in giving it time to kick-in. When I was taking the DIM+CDG, I think my DIM amount was too low (it was only 100 mg of DIM). And when I tried to up the DIM to 200 and take 250 CDG, I got a headache. Went back to DIM only (250mg/day) and my skin has been great- not perfect yet, but the best it's been in a long time. I also take 22mg of zinc per day, and I've been taking a hair/nail supplement daily, as well. 

I'm honestly just shocked at the ability that supplements have to change your life. If and when my face it totally clear, I'll definitely update again (if not, at least in a few months, either way)! Good luck to everyone out there!

Careful with ethanol. It's technically skin-safe but unless it's combined with silicone it's incredibly drying. I'd seek out a different salicylic acid serum because putting it on and washing it off isn't going to do much. 
Maybe you could apply it only on spots and problem areas instead of your whole face? Also, you could patch test just under your chin to see how this will affect your facial skin. 
What is your skin routine ?
You could try this: Stop the BP for a while. Use a gentle cleanser in the morning and before bed, and follow this up with a light moisturiser. Do this for a while, and consider using BP only on pimples, with a Q-tip.
 
You could also look at other things like salicylic acid (Stridex pads in the red box) for skin texture. Keep in mind that you‚Äôll have to use sunscreen diligently if you use salicylic acid. Good luck! 
Same thing happened to me after getting an IUD (kyleena). I also did not want to get it taken out, so I went to a derm and got clinda and tretinoin which has been super helpful. Also, after the first 3-4 months, the hormonal acne started to slowly get better (serum hormone concentrations from IUDs are very high during the first few months to a year, then decrease by about half after a year). Also, since the IUD releases synthetic progestins I‚Äôm not sure how spironolactone would work. That‚Äôs because it helps decrease your body‚Äôs androgen production, but I‚Äôm not sure what it can do about synthetic progestins that may have partial action at androgen receptors (which is presumably what‚Äôs causing the acne in your case). That was a question I meant to ask my derm but forgot, if anyone who knows the answer can share, that would probably be helpful to know.
Is there any change in diet that may contribute to the acne ? I‚Äôm also on IUD. Did the doctor mention that patients would suffer this kind of side effects to you? 
Can you get in to see a dermatologist? I have heard people that say they have success with Spironolactone (prescription anti-androgen). If the acne is concentrated around your jawline and chin, then it's likely hormonal. I had the Mirena, which is similar and the acne just persisted. I got it out. Just my experience. Good luck to you!! xx
I‚Äôm having the same exact thing currently :( I finally just decided to give up. I‚Äôve had the liletta for over 3 months now and it has only gotten worse. Chest and back acne too. I tried drinking spearmint tea because that was recommended as an alternative to spironolactone. Didn‚Äôt really do anything :/ honestly I would only consider going on spironolactone if I had awful painful periods. Shouldn‚Äôt go on extra medication to control side effects of another. 

I‚Äôm getting mine taken out this week & starting trusty Loryna bcp (was on before) because luckily my periods are manageable.  Everyone is different.. you may adjust... you may not. Good luck!!
I think the common practice is to take a large enough cumulative dose over a relatively short period of time so that the results are semi-permanent to permanent. Did your derm prescribe you the maintenance dose? What's the reasoning?
I have been on Accutane four times. Each time my skin was great while I was taking the drug, but the acne returned a few months after. I have asked multiple derms to prescribe me a low maintenance dose like you've suggested, but none of them were willing to do so. Apparently there hasn't been much research on low dosages over a long period.

First off I would drop any make up & foundation and stick to a tinted sunscreen like elta md or a non comedogenic B.B. cream. Make up can really clog your pores...

I would suggest incorporating benzoyl peroxide and or differin gel plus cera v√™ pm as well as am...
If you use makeup but don‚Äôt properly clean off your makeup every night with a cleanser, it may be clogging up your pores. I would add a cleanser too! 
Try vanicream. It‚Äôs very gentle.
Try taking zinc and a omega 3 vitamin too
Go to a doctor and try Lymecycline and differin, it has changed my life. I waited years to get help from a doc and tried all different products on my skin and nothing would really help long term. Since I‚Äôve been on the meds all I use is Cetaphil cleanser and moisturiser which has changed my life, and my bank account. 

Edit: also vitamin D 
Differin, cetaphil or any non foamy cleanser works for this type of case. (But do check with your dermatologist tho, I can be wrong). If you have open pores which causes this, please apply toner for day and night. Keep cutting dairy and sugar products. And a good number of dermatologists would totally recommend using Vitamin C only at night for the acne (it‚Äôs legit!). You can apply make up for sure like for special occasion BUT always remember to remove it using makeup remover and apply primer before putting on foundation to protect you skin pores. (My Doctor was being very specific about it cause I have quite terrible acne before). This is the suggested skin routine.

AM
1. Facial wash 
2. Toner 
3. Very thin layer of AHA cream
4. Moisturizer
5. Sunblock (ALWAYS remember this too)

PM
1.  Facial wash
2. Toner
3. Vitamin C serum 
4. Very thin layer of AHA cream
5. Acne cream 

PS: I am using a product called ‚Äútdf‚Äù . I love it 

I had very similar acne that is starting to finally heal. I used Cetaphil gentle cleanser (not the foaming kind). So I rinse my face with water in the morning, then I apply a niacinamide and zinc serum from the ordinary, before I put on my Cetaphil lotion. In the evening, same thing, but before I put on my lotion, I also apply a retinoid 2%, after the niacinamide and zinc. It's the ordinary as well. They're super cheap. 

This worked and is working really well for me and when I saw your pic, I decided I had to post because it looked so similar to mine. 
Have you tried the buffering lotion by Mario badescu rather than the drying lotion? It's meant for deeper more inflamed acne and it changed my life! 
You need an exfoliant BHA/aha (check the ordinary or Paula's choice for cheap ones)
BHA is better than AhA if you have acne.
But how was your skin before buying this foundation ? 
You also need a moisturiser in the morning


Stop the make up for a month and see how it goes 
am: rinse with water
cerave moisturizer 

pm: ponds cold cream cleanser (i‚Äôve now thrown out & using miceller water from garnier)
cerave moisturizer 
mario badescu drying lotion on all bumps/pimples

i don‚Äôt use more because i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with my face...

makeup: maybelline better skin concealer 
just bought loreal infallable foundation (maybe thats it??) 

Have you tried changing your diet at all?
[removed]
What didn‚Äôt you like about other cleansers and what have you tried?
Hey guys, sorry in advance because I don't know how to upload the pictures. My skin is looking like this for 11 months now. It started as there patches in the upper part of my left cheek, and then it spread down, almost to my chin. The weird thing is that my right side of the face is completely clear! Nothing.

Some background info: 
- I have an copper IUD that I put last March.
- I follow a clean low carb diet, don't eat sugar and grains (3+ year)
- I'm using zinc picolinate supplement and just started vitamin D.
- BP 10% only burned my skin, same thing with Clyndamycin + BP (1%/5%).
- I use a Effaclar cleanser since March and CeraVe moisturizer since December.
- I sleep on both sides, and mainly on the clean side (right)
- I basically don't make phone calls.
- I tried BHA, which did improve a little bit of the redness and the texture of my face.
- sometimes if itches a little bit.
- I don't pick my face.


I've been reading a lot these past year, and I can't come to a conclusion. Tried a lot of things that I found here but nothing seems to help. Do you think that it's really acne?
It could be fungal acne. Did you do a course of antibiotics recently before it began?

Try using Nizoral shampoo as a mask twice a day (active ingredient you're looking for is KETOCONAZOLE). Leave on, undiluted, for 30 seconds-1.5 minutes and then wash off. It's super drying, so reduce chemical exfoliants and switch to a soft physical like konjac sponge, and use a good, non-comodegenic moisturizer after. 

If it is fungal, you'll see a reduction very quickly - mine was healing within a few days. Also, wash your pillowcases/pillows on HOT water, and put a fresh towel over them each night.

This shit is nastily hard to diagnose/get rid of.
Any new hair products, detergents?  Esp, fabric softeners
Has anything changed in your diet? Some people dont tolerate fats well. Like dishes that were cooked with a lot of added oil, nuts, butters, spreads, dressings, dairy... 

It could also be stress, or hormonal acne :/
Have you tried using a mild AHA? A friend had similar acne and AHAs cleared her skin up wonderfully. But make sure you use it only in the PM, and sun protection is super important with AHAs! 

You could also try researching fatty alcohols and if your skin is sensitive to them, they are present in quite a few skincare products. Good luck! 
I've definitely noticed this too! As someone who's recovering from an ED, I'll have the occasional binge of sugary foods. I always wake up feeling dehydrated, gross and with 5 new pimples on my face. 
I notice something similar, except I can eat homemade desserts  just not store bought ones. For me I think it‚Äôs a combination of all the extra ingredients and the fact that at home I use either raw sugar or coconut sugar. 

Diet plays a big role in my breakouts. If I eat too much dairy, processed/ junk food, and sugar I break out. 
All carbs, dairy, and alcohol cause acne for me but sugar affects me the absolute worst. Unfortunately for me, I can't even tolerate fruit due to the sugar content. 
You sound dehydrated. Drink water, wear moisturizer, and don‚Äôt forget the sunscreen. 
Go to the dermatologist if acne does not improve with OTC products.
I would also try reducing sugar intake, that is a big trigger for me. I recommend calamine lotion, that helped my skin so much with that tight, itchy irritation that a breakout would bring.
The charcoal cleanser and hemp oil could both be irritating your face. 
What kind of charcoal cleanser is it? It may have a high pH or be be too stripping of your skin‚Äôs moisture barrier, which will make the irritation worse.    
Try using a gentle cleanser and moisturizer without any fragrance or oils. Make sure the cleanser has a pH of 5.5. Try to avoid using products with fragrance, essential oils, dyes, and irritating ingredients like menthol and alcohol.    
Try adding in a mineral sunscreen (has zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide as the UV filters). Zinc in particular can help calm irritation. And sun exposure can cause irritation to worsen due to the generation of free radicals so you should use the sunscreen on a daily basis.    
Before going to the dermatologist, I would try using gentle products for a few weeks, and if that doesn‚Äôt help then you could have something like eczema or rosacea so seeing a derm would be a good idea.
I‚Äôd say the little things, here are just a few:
‚Ä¢make sure to wash your pillowcases somewhat frequently 
‚Ä¢ be gentle when cleansing face with a cloth, you don‚Äôt want to go too hard
‚Ä¢ if you are able to try to eat healthier foods 
‚Ä¢ drink a lot more water
‚Ä¢also, meditation might help. If you have any stress related acne meditation can help to calm down 
If you don't already it might help to intensify your skin care routine. Find a cleanser that you can use daily that doesn't dry out your skin. Incorporate exfoliating 2-3 times a week. Add a toner and a moisterizor that works for you. Depending on your acne/skin get a benzoyl peroxide or sacylic acid cleanser to use daily/every other day. Wash your face every morning and night. 
I know I hated hearing it, but the only thing that has worked for me personally is going to a dermatologist. Even that took a while and I wished I would‚Äôve just went sooner. I had done years of research and trying out products for nothing. Seriously, the sooner the better! 
Did a comment here get removed?
Hey‚ÄîI‚Äôve tried the Bioderma DS+ Cr√®me and DS+ Node Shampoo which both contain piroctone olamine, and I didn‚Äôt see great results. The creme seemed to make my skin worse, and the shampoo is very drying and smells awful. I‚Äôll probably try them again at some point just to try to use them up, but I was a bit disappointed.

Still curious about this ingredient though, if anyone had success controlling a malassezia-related condition with it in other products.

Shampoo one the face is a bad idea. I tried it even just the foam after a while it will dry you out. 

I use eucerin‚Äôs cleansing milk but the piroctone olamine amount is too low. 
I think the best bet is to either find a dermatologist who is willing to write a script for a custom made compounded medicated facial cleanser an ingredient that works for you or find a company similar to curology who makes adjustable medications.

I think curology‚Äôs pyrithione zinc niacinamide azeliac acid combo could work regardless of the almond oil.  I used Head&Shoulders conditioner with almond oil as a face wash and it worked. 
You should go to a dermatologist, they can help with icepick scarring if you have it. They can also prescribe tretinoin which helps with hyperpigmentation and can also smooth out texture (but doesn‚Äôt remove icepick scarring). You can also try doing peels at home (you can get those from MUAC) but you have to use those several times to see results. Another thing you can look into if you have icepick scarring is microneedling, which is done in clinics.

But if it is just hyperpigmentation then using sunscreen and actives like AHAs and tretinoin should be enough to fade it over time. 
Do not pop. Use a light cleanser don‚Äôt scrub, use a clean pillow every night and something that has worked for me is putting a and d on my acne spots over night because some of them look a lil scabby


laser treatments are expensive try using the cheaper route b4 you result to that 
if you are thinking about spending that much money go to the dermatologist and get a general consultation on how to properly treat your own skin at home üòäüòä‚ú®
It looks like you just have some hyperpigmentation going on, that should go away within a month or so. Just make sure you use SPF to ensure that the scars don't darken. I would look into microdermabrasion! 
[removed]
Hopefully it worksüôèüôè
Hey, I know it's hard to have bad acne that just doesn't go away no matter what you do. You probably feel hopeless, but I want to let you know nothing lasts forever. It'll get better and your beautiful on the inside, and your acne doesn't mean your not beautiful on the outside. All you see is your acne but that didn't mean that's all there is to see about you. Your beautiful.  Don't let it win. 
Word to the wise; accutane should be used as a last resort in all cases no matter how severe. The long term effects have been literally life ruining for some people. IMO it should not even be on the market. As a first line of defense, cut out gluten and dairy for a few weeks. If that still doesn't work, then seek more benign medication. 
Stop juuling if ur 14 Jesus. 
Post Inflammation from the acne, you just have to wait for that to heal now, drinking water a lot will speed up the process.
I use acne(dot)org products. There are different AHAs, acne(dot)org has a glycolic acid. Checkout it out, you gotta watch the videos on the website to see the instructions on how to use it. Their products are different than  most other brands. I recommend this brand to everyone but bearly see anyone else on Reddit post about it.
Try AHAs if you don't already. It's a powerful exfoliate that will help fade scars.
try using niacinamide (the ordinary has one for less than $6) OR vitamin C (Paula‚Äôs choice, the ordinary and Mario badescu are all brands that sell vit C). it‚Äôs important to ONLY use one of those at a time because they don‚Äôt interact well. I think what you have looks like PIE (Post Inflammatory Erythea) and those are the top two things I‚Äôve seen successful for PIE.

What is your diet? 
I definitely recommend not going to a naturopath, because their advice isn‚Äôt science-based. You might as well be using homeopathic medicine or taking a placebo pill. Maybe just try a different derm that specializes in acne or cosmetic dermatology? 
What does your diet look like?  Other foods can be a huge trigger. 
Go back to the dermatologist and discuss whether there is anything else that can be done. 
I was going to suggest birth control and a topical prescription, but I see now that would not work for you.

My cousin has very oily skin and persistent breakouts as well. He's in his mid-late thirties. He recently went to see a naturopath, and did an elimination diet that included dairy and other things. This seemed to help his acne. He thought it was maybe nuts (almonds, cashews, etc.) that was aggravating his acne.  He also swears by the Clarisonic cleansing brush. 
When taking accutane, did you reach the cumulative dose?? 

Also, is there a chance your acne could be fungal?
Your boss seriously said that to you? You should go to HR, that's so unprofessional 
Hey, have you seen myfacestory? I saw her on instagram, and although she has a very different acne than what I battled, still gave some good tips (she also failed on accutane), some of the tips included drinking celery juice on an empty stomach every morning, and her results have been AMAZING. On my part, I discovered my acne was fungal, it came at 27, I‚Äôm 28 now too, and yes, I know what it‚Äôs like seating on a meeting with a MASSIVE pair cysts on your face and people not looking you in the eye. It‚Äôs horrible. If it helps, i tried terbinafine (antifungal) in spray twice a day and differin 0.1  and 0.3%, i alter these late two at night. Also sulphur masks help a lot. Also reducing stress, if you have the chance to go to a neurologist/psychiatrist to get something for it, I also managed to see improvement after getting into SSRI, which rise the serotonin levels in your brain. There are also natural remedies such as 5-HTP that help boost your serotonin, lowering cortisol and other stress hormones. I hope this helps a bit.
Edit: I tried going on accutane but couldn‚Äôt resist the side effects and lasted less than a week
It‚Äôs horrible that you are going through this :( I managed to survive my teens with minimal acne only to get hit with it at 21 and again at 28. 
It really does a number on your self esteem. 
There‚Äôs no sympathy or  ‚Äúacne acceptance‚Äù. You get judged on your looks and no one bats an eye. As a woman I managed to hide behind make up but as a man that would have its own set of consequences :/
While it won‚Äôt fix things acne wise, try talking to a therapist about how this is impacting you so that the fall out on your life can be better contained. 
Like you said people will notice but that doesn‚Äôt have to be the end of the world. Maybe acknowledging it in some way in your relationships so that you can mitigate the impact? 
For some people it worked to bring it up in a humours fashion for others it was more as a medical condition :/ 

Treatment wise: have you had any laser treatments done? I had that with my accutane for my first batch of acne and it did wonders. The second time I had issues finding a good derm that would listen to what helped and it took me 3 years to sort it out with trial an error. 
Good luck 

I used to have horrible cystic in high school. What works best for is acne(dot)org regimen. Go check it out. It's a face wash, benzoyl peroxide, moisturizer, and AHA. I would recommend this to everyone. People say benzoyl peroxide doesn't work for cysts but it works for me. You have nothing else to lose, try it. 
Oh :( 
I'm so sorry for you and don't worry about the negative comments from your boss but acne doesn't define you.


Some stuff that are good for acne makes it worst at the beginning but you have to keep at it for at least 3 months (unless that's an allergy). 
What strict diets have you tried? It just concerns me that you say it comes back in a month when it takes a whole month for acne to turn around with a diet change. I can only be clear if I'm not consuming any carbs, dairy, or alcohol. If I have just one of any of those Ill break out. I know how bad adult acne can be and feeling like a teenager while youre trying to be professional. If you haven't tried a diet this strict please give it a try. Its given me so much relief from depression and social anxiety. 
Hi there I dont have alot of time as Im. Mama of a 3 year old! Lol so heres my imput I have massive cystic acne at 30 years old. Please explore the ordinary skin care and this are the ones i suggest acelaic acic a MUST so if you go to Google type in the ordinary skin care regimen for cystic acne they will give you the run down and you are not spending a car payment the entire set is less that 20 dollars and it has made an amazing difference what Ive noticed mpst is how firm amd bright my face is and I wish I could find a before photo of my forhead and crows feet because its a drastic change. Another suggestion curology has a free sample a months worth for shipping alone you can cancel at anytime with no bs.
Another FOODS YOUR GUT AND YOUR HORMONES! A miracle worker is DIM its a hormone balance so I started using this 6 days ago and I literally do not have 1 new cystic pimple and the ones I do are some how going down. NO DAIRY MY GOSH i eat a bowl of ice cream and wake up looking like a piece of pizza 

Diet causes acne. Creams washes and drugs dont work. It took me 7 years and 8 dermatologists to figure that out
My skin loves it too! I know it can be very irritating for some people but we must just have some tough skin lol. I was on Tazorac for years I think that had a lot to do with toughing up my skin.
I've used it for little spot treatments before getting my cream from my derm. But I have super sensitive skin and I can't use this anymore! It also creates a rash like surface wherever I put it. But if your skin isn't sensitive I can definitely see how this would work for a lot of people. 
Personally I have somewhat sensitive skin and tea tree oil really irritated my skin. I used it to spot treat some pimples and it made my skin extremely red and dry. But I have a friend who uses it all the time and she absolutely loves it! I think it just depends on the person!
I tried tea tree oil and it made me break out and made my skin super red the next day. I thought maybe it was something else, so I tried it again and it did the same thing. Personally it doesn‚Äôt work for me but if you been ok with it then I‚Äôd keep using it! Maybe dilute a little bit if you‚Äôre concerned
Working well for me as a spot treatment. I've been doing stridex pads and then a q-tip with tea tree oil on pimples. I try I leave it on to dry for as long as possible and then follow up with a good moisturizer. Helping so far
after you moisturize, use a thin layer of Vaseline as an occlusive to seal in moisture. this is usually done at night. use sunscreen during the day as last step. 
Vaseline doesn‚Äôt moisturize the skin, but it acts as a barrier that locks in whatever is underneath. So use a moisturizer (I like to use argon oil or jojoba oil because my skin reacts well to them) and then put a thin layer of Vaseline on top before you sleep to help it stay put throughout the night 
You can use it, but I recommend how the others suggested. Use a moisturizer but put Vaseline to ‚Äúseal.‚Äù Maybe you‚Äôre using BP too often? Are you applying it all over your face or only on acne? Everybody reacts to everything differently so maybe it‚Äôs being applied too often!
Yes! Im doing it now, but only the areas where my skin is really dry. I wouldn't use it in my whole face tho. But for example, I forgot washing my hands once, and got benozyl in the eyes, vaseline was really effective after that. 
I‚Äôve been using a&d over night‚ú®....was prescribed the benzoyl peroxide and I‚Äôm in the same boat
I'm not sure what your approach to managing your acne was before you saw your dermatologist, but I had a similar experience. I followed all of their instructions, used an over-the-counter face wash they recommended and a clindamycin toner and Epiduo (benzoyl peroxide) for spot treatment every night. I progressively got drier and drier and noticed that I wasn't seeing an improvement but it was actually making it worse. I came to the conclusion that my face was so damaged that I'd destroyed my skin's protective barrier. I didn't go back to the dermatologist, but instead switched to a super, super gentle face wash by Acure called Sensitive Facial Cleanser and moisturized with argan oil. My acne basically disappeared after three weeks. Granted, I've had acne for years and may have just "grown out of it," but I know for certain that the routine my derm prescribed me was making things worse.

It's up to you if you want to keep seeing your derm, but if you do then I would highly recommend using argan oil on your face to moisturize. It's a light oil so it doesn't clog pores, but it is very moisturizing. You can find it in the natural beauty care section at target or whole foods, and you just apply a dime-sized amount and thoroughly disperse it across your face. If that doesn't work, try coconut oil which is heavier. Definitely don't use vaseline anymore, because that's petroleum-based and guaranteed to lead to breakouts. I hope that helps! If you want some more alternatives to what the derm recommended, I have a few products I like, but every person is different so what works for one person may not work for another.
That doesn‚Äôt look like acne to me.  More like keratosis pilaris which you get on your arms and legs.   You can try to exfoliate either with a gentle chemical peel, or  a scrub whilst using an exfoliating glove! 
I've had a lot of success with my body acne using a combo of cetaphil cleanser and neutrogena body clear scrub. My skin is 'dehydrated' type if that helps. I use cerave in the tub as moisturizer.
I have the same thing, but it hasn't been bad enough for me to address. Although my family doctor years ago said it was folliculitis and should go away with an acne body wash. Maybe that's what you have? 
[removed]
Is your skin dry or oily? 
Amlactin lotion look it up 
It‚Äôs keratosis pilaris. Use Amlactin in the green bottle
yes! it makes a difference. Also, using it as toner helps too 
My experience with green tea has been fine.  Nothing huge or anything, but my skin does become more glowy and bright! 

I‚Äôve had sucess with drinking Peppermint tea instead :)
Can‚Äôt hurt to have it so go aheaf
Boil the green tee , i would use 2 tea bags to 1 cup so it can be very strong and then once it‚Äôs boiled i would let it sit in the pot for it can absorb any left over nutrients and then put it in the refrigerator to cool down and then just put it in an empty spray bottle. Its really refreshing and hydrating and helps calms redness. 
[removed]
Drank it for 2 years 5 days a week because of work, and I still have horrible cystic acne. Oh and I have tried spearmint tea too. üòñ

I'm currently on antibiotics again which seems to work best
It did help with my hormonal acne to a large extent! So 2 weeks before my period, I will consume it regularly 
Probably the brand i was drinking but it made my body very very oily.
I have taken accutane twice, but only because I was an idiot and didn't fully complete my first round correctly. I see great results again and no side effects other than dry lips. 

I have had 2 dermatologists tell me that certain kinds of acne can only be cured by non-topical medication like accutane or antibiotics. I believed this when I heard it because that's what my acne has felt like, incurable by everything other than accutane. Maybe those derms are right, and maybe you and I have that kind of acne, and maybe accutane is simply what we both need, and maybe multiple times in our lifetime. To me, it's completely worth it, acne has made my life way more miserable than any pill has 
Do you happen to have any pictures of your skin before? I also have a derm appointment coming soon and since my acne is hormonal/cyclical I took pictures at its worse because it would have calmed down by the time I have the appointment.  

Just describe to them what kind of acne you usually deal with and what your most constant trouble is. 

It would suck for you to go through so much work and products just to make your skin worsen again :/ 
Tell them your routine and point out if it's the kind of acne that, say, gets worse during a certain time of month or after eating certain foods. Also describe how worse it gets without the treatment and what type of acne it is.

Once they hear what you use and see the results, they'll be able to estimate on their own how it would be without the treatment sans you having to ruin your skin. 
I would say yes it is a good thing but no do not extract them. Be patient. Don‚Äôt up your aha/bha use either because you could damage your moisture barrier. Just be patient and take it slow. Also have you tried sulfer? Sulfer helps me just as much as an aha or bha does, if not more. 
Breakouts on the forehead tend to be caused mainly by stress. Which is a vicious cycle, since acne leads to more stress. A couple of supplements to consider would be Ashwagandha root and vitamin C. Both help control cortisol (stress hormone) levels in the body. I take both and it definitely helps. Also consider vitamin D3. Also, most importantly, don't stress yourself out!! Obsessing and worrying over it makes it worse. Try meditating as well, meditation literally saved my life!
What‚Äôs your diet/routine like?
I can‚Äôt say this enough times in this subreddit, try fungical treatment. Terbinafine or ketoconazole. And Differin. Google simpleskincarescience and acne. 
Aztec healing clay mask, keep your hair away from face. And do not touch it‚ú®üòä
Mine is way worse tbh.
Oh geez
What is the full list of  ingredients for the mask
If you think that it‚Äôs the turmeric breaking you out, if stop using it. Turmeric isn‚Äôt typically an ingredient that causes breakouts. I make homemade turmeric masks which have actually improved my acne. Maybe it‚Äôs the other ingredients? 
How often are you applying it throughout the week? Really should start at twice, MAX three times a week with no-mask days in between each application.
[removed]
Hi. You want to make sure you only apply this mask 3 to 4x a week and every other day. For instance only on MWF or TTS. Also give it some time youve only been using it for a week so maybe your skin is adjusting to something new. Tumeric has many benefits if used correctly. It helps to even out skin tone and give you a glow. There is more information on qlishedivinehair youtube channel.

You really need to start chemical exfoliation daily. The bacteria are living in your forehead creases. The exfoliation will smooth out the lines. Just, Whatever you do, DO NOT USE any type of SCRUBS 
SPF!
Honestly I got botox for my wedding (it was free for me) and it cleared up my forehead skin so well. I can only assume it is because it wasn‚Äôt able to wrinkle anymore. Definitely not the initial purpose but a great secondary effect! Idk how old you are but just putting it out there 
Zinc!!
I take Evening Primrose Oil and Flaxseed, not sure which one's actually working but after a month of taking them I have no acne on my chin, even while on my period.
I had the same problem when I was using Epiduo, which was prescribed to me to be used once daily on both acne and acne scars. I once stopped using it for a week or so and noticed an...improvement? When I had the occasional breakout I'd put some on and it would help, but daily use encouraged breakouts. I eventually came to the conclusion that it was drying my skin out so much that it was damaging my skin's barrier, though that conclusion is anecdotal. Later on, I also switched from the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser for oily skin (recommended by my dermatologist) to an all-natural, super gentle cleanser by Acure, and that further improved the issue. So in general I think I was just imbalancing my skin, making it overcompensate with oil, which then led to breakouts. 

I hope that helps you! If not, maybe your dermatologist will. However I stopped seeing mine because despite several recommendations, they only seemed to make the problem worse. Just food for thought.
What‚Äôs your full routine?
Try using the BP just in the PM, or even try alternating days. Sometimes BP doesn't work with everyone, so it is good that you know that so whenever you see your derm you can get a gel that doesn't have that. 
Sulfur does what BP cream does, while being less irritating.
What type of acne do you have? Hormonal? Fungal? Depends on that. And if you wanna use benzoyl try finding a lower ph, around the 2.5% since anything higher is meant for body and even then they all do the same job 
Try figuring out the root cause, weather it be some type of food your eating or if you have stress. For me I figured out eating sugary foods and foods high in bad fats caused outbreaks, and as soon as I gave them up my face would clear up in a couple of days/weeks depending how severe I had it before. And stress is also a big factor, if your usually in a stressful environment or relationship that could effect your hormonal levels and cause them to fluctuate, which also causes out breaks. In all honesty peroxide works best for some cases, most of the time it's not that well for hormonal acne tho 
Try tea tree oil, it has been shown to be just as effective as benzoyl peroxide. (It works for me!) Add a couple drops on a q-tip and apply twice daily.

Looking for the same answer! Let me know what you find out. 
Spironolactone cured my severe cystic acne
I just went to a holistic doctor for my acne about 2 months ago. They ran allllll the tests including hormonal, allergy, and a gyenocological exam. They were shocked to see that everything was completely fine, they actually never identified a cause. I was glad to see everything was good, but devastated that this mystery acne was staying a mystery. Although it cost a shiny penny and involved a lot of needles, I was glad I did it, because now I don't have to wonder if I have some imbalance somewhere. Now I know I don't need to be concerned about my hormones or liver/kidney damage or whatever. 

HOWEVER, that holistic doctor did recommend some wacky, herbal treatments that had me question their legitimacy. They recommended echinacea shots, vaginal ozone therapy, and turning gluten free. These were obviously not based on my blood work, because my blood work didn't indicate I even had a problem. Look up those treatments, they are of dubious validity. Really really research the suggested treatments they give. Blood tests are objective, but holistic recommendations are a bit more gray 
I find out mine was caused by fungi and a depleted inmune system regarding my skin, also bad circulation. I did research on my own though and visited different doctors to address each of these topics, it‚Äôs like 95% better, I can go out without makeup.
Ps: at first I thought it was hormonal since it would be at ir worst during ovulation and menstruation, but turns out only fungi can do something with your skin oil. You can have oily skin and NOT have acne #mindisblown
I've never been to a holistic doc for my acne, but I've done plenty of my own research and I can tell you what's worked for me. First off, I discovered that I was going about my acne all wrong, only trying to solve it using topical medicines. Literally nothing worked. The supplements I take now that have drastically improved my acne are Ashwagandha root, vitamin D3, vitamin C, Magnesium Glycinate, and fish oil. Also, for immediate relief of some redness and swelling acne causes, try using Emergen-C as a facial mask (seriously!). Use one packet and add just drops of water until it becomes a paste. Gently scrub onto your face and leave it there for 15-20 mins.
What are the diet changes?  What foods do you eat?
I went to a gp who then referred me to a gynaecologist and though not confirmed yet, she suspects that I have pcos. Got my blood work done earlier this week, awaiting the results.
Yeah, just make sure they back up those claims with actual peer reviewed medical science, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt take anything they say seriously especially if it involves ‚Äúchakra‚Äôs‚Äù
I'm not a doctor, but I have had customers who used my handmade soap and they said it worked well enough to stop taking acne medication. Feel free to PM me if you want more information cause I can't post links here.
That means you need to go see your doctor about your acne, and make sure to tell them about this. They'll prob give you acne antibiotics and if that doesn't work maybe accutane? 
I would be weary. I went on antibiotics for acne twice and both times I ended up with a bacterial infection in my stomach. 
I would get on probiotics asap. Antibiotics will definitely kill the bacteria for a little while but it will come back with twice the force.
I was prescribed antibiotics for my acne and was on them for nearly two years. Worked like a charm. But then I went off them after speaking to a naturopathic doctor and what ended up happening was a 6 year rollercoaster of severe acne (worse than what I had to begin with) and a damaged small intestine. I'm still not completely better. 

Not saying this is the case for everyone but just be vigilant. 
No the BHA can cause a purge of the stuff underneath. Keep at it. It should clear up in 2-4 weeks. If it doesn‚Äôt then maybe reassess. 
No, but google "fifty shades of snail how to shrink your pores" for a really good temporary solution. 
The only things that have helped mine are Thayer‚Äôs witch hazel and dermaplaning, but boy do they come back fast! 
Blackheads have always been the most stubborn of my acne. What's worked for me is taking supplements. I take vitamin C, vitamin D3, fish oil, and magnesium glycinate. It's definitely improved my skin quite a bit. Also, you can actually use Emergen-C powder as a facial scrub. Use one packet and add just drops of water until it becomes a paste, gently massage into skin and leave it there for 15-20 mins. Also, be patient with the supplements, it can take a month or 2 to really see improvements. 
Incorporate a BHA like Salicylic acid into your routine - The Ordinary's 2% Salicylic Acid Serum has done wonders for blackheads and large pores on my nose and cheeks

I use it to take off my makeup and moisturize when my skin is particularly dry. It works well for me and doesn‚Äôt break me out. YRMV. 
I don‚Äôt know how much it works for clearing acne but I have been using this for about a year now (5 drops in the morning and at night) and it doesn‚Äôt make me break out at all. This is the only moisturizer I have used that worked and didn‚Äôt cause crazy breakouts.
I bought jojoba oil last year and used as a moisturizer and it was amazing! My skin defintely got much clearer after each use.  Will def buy more when I can. 
Try benzoyl peroxide
Products I use:

COSRX galactomyces 95 whitening power essence;
COSRX advances snail 96 mucin power essence;

Sunscreen

PM:
COSRX galactomyces 95 whitening power essence;

Tea tree oil to spot treat

This surge of acne started a few weeks ago right when my skin was doing SO WELL for the first time in years. Super sad and discouraging ):
From my understanding, BP can cause you to purge and tea tree cannot. When I purge, it‚Äôs usually around areas where I usually break out or places where I know I have little bumps. The BP might be helping those zits that are hidden underneath come to surface quicker.
You need to see what your diet looks like.

Scars are normal if you break out. It goes away with time.

Right now you have to focus on not getting pimples anymore.

You need a cleanser (micellar water is my favourite)
An exfoliant: BHA/aha check Paula's choice or the ordinary
A moisturiser (if your skin is oily you need to find what brand works better for you)
And a sunscreen


For the diet I personally eat very clean (I'm a fit chick also the following food trigger acne on most of us ): no soy, no meat, no dairy Low gi food.

I take: 
Supplement with zinc
Omega 3 and probiotics 
Nothing can fix extreme oiliness unless you go on accutane. While you do say you were on accutane before, some people do go on multiple rounds if the first round was unsuccessful. Also, keep in mind that extreme scarring can only be addressed through things like laser therapy.
Have you maxed out on the dosage of your meds? Usually they start with a lower dose of spiro and move up. Spiro made my skin super oily and gave me acne in places I never had it (and a month long period) until I started taking hormonal birth control (Nuva Ring) with it. 

Zinc has also been proven to lessen oiliness and help acne heal faster. It works so well for me, but I‚Äôm one of the unfortunate people whose stomach it upsets sometimes. 

You could also try a mattifier like OC-8 or Milk of Magnesia (which is super cheap) at night or under make up (it has a white cast). 

A lot of people rave about the Aztec healing mask you mix with ACV, it will dry your skin up some, but my fave is still Queen Helene‚Äôs Mint Julep Mask. Both are really cheap, so you might give them a try. 
I have really oily skin and I've found washing my face with a cleanser that cuts through the oil helps. I use a  benzoyl peroxide cleanser and a good moisterizer helps me with my oily skin throughout the day.  I use origins ginzing moisterizer. 
If she has one of those x5 mirrors, TAKE IT AWAY, those things are THE WORST. You think your skin is okay and look in one of those suckers and see all the crap and then you can't help but try pop/pick. I can control myself as long as I don't look in one of those mirrors. :|
Another golden rule I like to follow is ‚ÄúIf it is taking you longer than a minute to pop, put your hands down and escort yourself out of the bathroom.‚Äù
Cosrx pimple patch are great for this. 
She might have csp. Check out r/compulsiveskinpicking
Remove all of the mirrors in the house for a month
Popping pimples isn't necessarily bad it just needs to be done in the right way. It might help to get her some extraction tools. You can get a set online for like 10 bucks. 
Popping pimples that are surfaced rids the body of the infection faster and accelerates the healing ‚Äî IF done properly. To safely pop a pimple first wash your hands. The pimple must be a whitehead and you must use a sterilized needle to break the tip. Then wrap a piece of tissue around your pointer fingers and gently squeeze. When the infection is out, use tissue to grab the contents off your face ‚Äî do NOT wipe the area and spread the bacteria. Lastly treat the small wound with some witch hazel. If done correctly, you should have only a small red dot left after the extraction which heals within 2 days. If a pimple is NOT ready, I‚Äôve found that  putting makeup over it and maybe treating it with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to dry it out helps me to not pick at it. As for the scabs, fresh aloe vera is a fantastic wound healer! I hope this helps your girlfriend! I have a lot of experience with picking as a fellow sufferer.
Mostly likely Fungal acne. 
Acne on the forehead is usually caused by stress. Try taking supplements, I take vitamin C and Ashwagandha root. Both have helped quite a bit. Also, try meditating, you'd be surprised how much it helps your skin and overall health!
Vitamin C!
Yep
For me, I apply to my face while it‚Äôs wet and using my hands
Same. I make sure to take care of my face first since I also moisturise my body but the body cream I put on my body is not good for my face 
Sponge would be sorta pointless imo, since it'll soak up some of your moisturizer. If you're worried about touching your face you could get one of those silicon sponges to apply it, since those don't absorb product and they're like $1.
Cute
Pray your heart out over and over. Let the most powerful take control of the situation. God bless you.

Could be hyperpigmentation? I had a blemish on my nose that left a flat red mark just like that after it healed. It took about a year to fade for me. Unprotected sun exposure will increase melanin production and prevent it from fading over time, similar to a scar. You might try  AHA (glycolic acid) on the spot at night under a moisturizer. Just make sure to wear sunscreen during the day because it increases your skin's photosensitivity.

Also, dig the username, my dude. Killer tofu.
It can be a cyst. Cyst can last for soooo long 
This is likely not acne, but folliculitis. I had the same thing and it‚Äôs caused by clogged pores. Buy Nizoral at the drug store; it‚Äôs dandruff shampoo that fights off fungus. Apply it to your forehead dry and leave it on for 5-10 minutes, twice a day for a week or two. I guarantee it will be gone. 
Every morning when I get up my forehead looks nice and clear. However as soon as I even put water in my face it goes quite red and angry. Does anyone know what this might be, I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs a skin sensitivity to my products or even just tap water. Currently I use as a base routine:

COSRX good morning cleanser
Klairs supple preparation toner 
Klairs Rich Moist Moisturizer

Once a week I will also use an aha for exfoliating and maybe every other day before the Klairs toner I use COSRX BHA Skin Returning A-Sol. 

Does any one have any ideas? As I had mentioned, throughout the day it completely dies down and you can hardly see it halfway through the day or when I wake up. Oh, and I‚Äôm 26. Combo, dehydrated skin. 
I think any Vit-A gel/cream is supposed to do both? I was given Differen (Adapalene) a long time ago and it worked great for spot treatment and fading. I'm now on Retrieve (Tretinoin cream), which is also used for wrinkles/etc. It depends on your skin type - I'm olive-skinned, so when I do scar they go dark and tend to be very pigmented.
We‚Äôre here for you! Question - have you checked the comedogenic rating of all your skincare products‚Äô ingredients, and those of your makeup? I suggest scouting cosdna. Secondly, patience is a virtue, but I‚Äôm a big fan of the 10-day rule. If it‚Äôs not working, try something different (especially w cystic acne, the pain is a real...pain). Lastly, have you picked up a cheap benzoyl peroxide from the pharm? This can help w some of the smaller breakouts until you can get to the bottom of things. 
It sounds like it might be hormonal. Give the spironolactane some more time. It says your gyno prescribed it but you might want to also look into getting a dermatologist to monitor your dosage of this drug.
you are using over the counter products. Go see a dermatologist and get yourself some Retin-A.
Given it‚Äôs along your jawline and cheeks, could it be your laundry detergent (pillows) or shampoo/conditioner? 

And BP works for me too, maybe try another brand?
Hello over 30 cystic acne friend! I feel your pain. Mine is at bay but it takes some effort. Step one, STOP USING TIDE laundry detergent. Just stop and use the most gentle eco friendly detergent you can 
- always wash your hands with anti bacterial soap before you wash your face or even touch it 
- remove your makeup with an oil free gentle wipe. I like aveeno. 
- wash with a salicylic acid no SLS cleanser. I like Paula‚Äôs choice extra strength. If you can afford it pick up a Luna Foreo for at night. Morning is fine just the cleanser
- use cheap old salicylic acid pads like clearsil in the pm 
- 5% benzoyl peroxide cream in the pm
-aveeno clear skin salicylic moisturizer am/pm
-use cosdna website for all foundations and products 

I hope this makes sense. This routine has helped me and any friend who has struggled with acne in their 30‚Äôs. Not fool proof but has been amazing for us. Any questions please ask. I did study as an esthetician years ago but don‚Äôt do facials or skin care anymore. This has just worked for me after years of trial and error. And I‚Äôve tried EVERYTHING from high end to drugstore to spa brands.

Yes, the fact that your period is irregular is probably due to hormonal imbalance. Not sure what type of doctor did your blood work, but you might want to get a second opinion. Results also can depend on what time off the month the blood work is taken.
Yes
I have the same exact face as you! I say yes! I got a referral to a dermatologist the other day put got put on a sulfur face wash so we'll see how that goes. 
I don't know - a lot of the doctors here can prescribe the same things as a dermatologist, unless its something like Isotretinoin/Accutane? I'd also do some research into diet/dairy/nutrition to help :)
Buy a shower head filter
I dont think iron deposits in the shower will cause acne as acne is caused by clogged pores/bacteria. Consider getting a shower filter to see whether that makes any improvemeent.
It depends. I was on it 3 years ago and about a year after I was off, I started getting pimples again.  But I realized those were from things like me touching my face and such, not the angry red ones I got before accutane. 

Some people need a second course to clear up completely. Which does suck because it‚Äôs taxing on your body. 
I finished about a year ago and i do still break out quite a bit, not as terrible but it still happens
within 6 months of coming off of it i was slightly breaking out, and a year later it was almost as bad as before i started. however i was under an immense amount of stress at this time, and had hormonal changes. it‚Äôs now been close to two years since i‚Äôve been off accutane and now that my stress is managed, i have a solid skincare routine, and i‚Äôm on a form of the pill that helps my skin, my acne is only mild. i am sad that my nearly perfect skin that i had at the end of my course didn‚Äôt stick around, but i wouldn‚Äôt go on it again.  it‚Äôs also worth noting i was in a low dosage for a year and a bit which can make recurrence of acne more probable 
Are you a girl? It sounds like it could be hormonal if it comes every month.
This is what I was going to post about in another subreddit. I have one that I‚Äôve had for years and years, it never truly feels like it goes away even if it‚Äôs not seen from the surface. I was wondering if it needs to somehow be extracted by a derm as well!
i get cystic pimples when I have my period. They're the bane of my existence. Two years ago one was so bad it looked like a mound on my face. I waited a few months for it to go away and when it didn't I went to see a dermatologist. He ended up needing to drain it several times because I had waited so long to see him, it had hardened. He was able to do it, but what he had me do as well was apply a hot towel for several minutes several times a day to loosen the hardened cyst and help bring it to a head so he could drain it. He also had me apply a spot treatment of clindamycin and triamcinolone acetonide after the hot washcloth or cleansing.    

Now I do this whenever I have a cystic pimple. Hot washcloth from the microwave (not too hot to hold) for 5-10 minutes every night with the spot treatment until it comes to a head and I can lance it and put a hydrocolloid bandage on it overnight. Makes it go away so much faster.    

For you I would try the hot washcloth for a week or two every night and see if that improves it at all. If it does I would just continue with that because for deep ones, unhardening it allows the body to remove it and actually get the immune system to work on it. Going to a dermatologist for this can get really expensive if you need to go several times for drainings. It might end up being what you need to do, but waiting on that stupid cyst cost me hundreds and hundreds of dollars. I needed to go back about 10 times.    

I hope this helped and that I wasn't too confusing. If you have any questions feel free to reply or to PM me. I know how frustrating the cystic pimples can be.
I had the worst stomach cramps/pains when I started on Accutane - I literally only lasted for 1-2 weeks before I said this is ridiculous! I ate mine with food too, and lots of water, but it still really disagreed with me. My derm said it's a potential side effect. I stopped and decided to try and approach the problem more holistically, but lo-and-behold, there are some things you can't control (like birth control hormones), so I have just started in Retrieve (0.05% Tretinoin cream) instead.
I've never heard of stomach pain as a side effect, you should definitely speak to your doctor about it
40mg/day is a really large dose, if the the pain persists tell your doctor, he might lower your dose to 30-20 mg.
Wish I could tell me past self to bot take accutane.
If you have not used OTC products containing Benzoyl Peroxide, use them first and see how it goes.
Clay masks might help but the most effective thing would most likely be a topical medication. 
Hello, how old are you? Your skin seems very aggravated. I would suggest not touching it or picking at it, as that only prolongs the problem. A clay mask could help but I only advise doing it 1x a week max. It can be very drying to the skin. I would suggest a honey mask, and best to get local honey raw and unpasteurized. 

I used to have skin similar to yours. I still have my own share of acne woes but it has morphed into different issues. 

Have you ever been to a dermatologist? We can all give you advice on here but the best thing to do is to see a professional. Topical treatment is fine but acne is caused by various things and you have to combat from the inside as well as the outside. It could be a sensitivity to food you aren't aware of, stress or hormone related etc. 

Good luck and don't get discouraged! It's all about finding a routine that works for you as well as eliminating or changing various factors that could contribute to skin health! 
Your skin looks very dry and angry, no offense, but I think rebalancing the oils will help a lot, I wouldn‚Äôt do clay masks very often because they can dry you out too much which would be bad in your case. Try diy mask with honey, a pinch of turmeric, and yogurt or a little bit of green clay. I‚Äôd use a natural and non comedogenic oil like tea tree diluted in grape seed or jojoba oil as a moisturizer and daytime treatment (google how to do this!!) Lastly, if you can‚Äôt see a derm try Curology, it‚Äôs more affordable and you can cancel for a few months so you don‚Äôt get a new bottle each month and would only resub when your current bottle is out. After battling adult acne since age 17, at 23 now, I‚Äôve had great luck with my custom rx through them as well as a natural acne skincare set from an organic skincare line on Etsy, NaturallyBeautiful69 (strange name but they are awesome!). Also try out a gentle cleanser like cetaphil or CeraVe. You don‚Äôt want to strip the skin of its oils, but rather cleanse it so everything is balanced. Hope this helps and ask away if you need more help!

Routine?
If you‚Äôre going to use clay masks, use the Indian Healing Clay one mixed with charcoal. Most people use apple cider vinegar in theirs, but I find it strong, so I use water. Really detoxes the skin and brings everything to the surface, pulls out all the gunk. 
yea Aztec clay mask is great. Don‚Äôt agitate your skin, don‚Äôt touch it and keep your hair clean and away from face‚ú®üëçüëçüëç hope this helps yo
You mentioned gender on the internet. Ruuuuuuuuuun :D but yes it might help in some cases
I don't agree with the others... this is severe scarring acne. Doxycycline may help, but I would definitely suggest seeing a dermatologist for retin-a. If these don't help in 3 months, accutane 
Doxy and topicals will clear it up over time most likely 
Are you female? If you are, have you noticed any pattern to when you get this acne? Mine ls always worse just before my period. Magically calms down afterward.

If it's following the pattern of your cycle, then you know hormones are adding to your trouble. I'd definitely get a dermatologist to look at it. 
Hi, acne like this is completely normal around your age! However, there are things you can do to help. What other products do you use? Things like face wash, moisturizer, etc. 
[removed]
In grown hair? I'm dealing with one right now. Use some exfoliate, like glycolic acid
Excuse my ignorance but, what is DIM?
I used to take spironolactone for my hormonal acne but I was having issues with it like light headed/blacking out and chest pain so I decided to take a more natural path! Just like you I read a bunch about DIM and it seemed like a miracle pill I haven‚Äôt had hormonal acne at all like before but I haven‚Äôt only been taking DIM I‚Äôve been doing a combination of DIM, L-lysine <‚Äî *my miracle pill* and magnesium as well as b12 also my holistic doctor recommended me to start taking primrose oil pills and I did a lot of reading and people that suffer with hormone issues like acne swear by it! So maybe look into that too? Good luck! 
Hey I am in the same situation. I have been using since late October and finally I am seeing some results not miraculously but i can the improvement. I take one pill as it indicates the jar. 
If you have hormonal acne, you may want to go to a doctor to rule out any other medical conditions and also to make sure your hormone levels are ok.
Well the improvement is gradually. Nothing good happens overnight except getting
Pregnant haha! My acne is hormonal because it triggers when My period is happening. Or when I overdo it with the sugar but I have managed to reduce my sugar intake so I think. How many times do you go to the bathroom to poop?
I am also desperate to get off my acne I Am eager to have the laser treatment so I can disappear the scarring and spots of my face. But if there is something that I have learnt with acne is to have patient. 
Baking soda isn't good for the skin

Some people swear by clay mask so you can check it out.


Your routine should include a cleanser that doesn't dry your skin, an exfoliant (BHA/aha) , a moisturiser and sunscreen 


You can do clay masks 2x a week 

Check r/skinscareaddiction  and r/diybeauty
Great üëçüèæ 
Look into topicals like benzoyl peroxide (BP) or salicylic acid. They do not require a prescription.
A benzoyl peroxide cream was what was given to me in high school for my occasional acne, and you can find different formulations of it in the drugstore. It‚Äôs a common product to try early on for mild/occasional acne. Higher concentrations of BP should generally be used as spot treatments, but a lower/less drying concentration of the stuff could be used on the entire face overnight... as long as you‚Äôve established that you don‚Äôt have any bad side effects from it other than the usual manageable skin dryness. Benzoyl peroxide kills the bacteria they caused acne lesions and the slight drying effect may also help with pimples.
Salicylic acid products are also popular and can easily be found in the drugstore. Salicylic acid helps prevent pores from becoming clogged and trapping the acne bacterium inside the pore to fester and become a nasty pimple.
A number of people have also noticed success with washing their pillowcases much more often- some will wash them every time they use them, and there‚Äôs even an acne fighting pillowcase called SleepClean (it must have certain antibacterial properties, I would think).
Look for a gentle facial cleanser- Cetaphil is popular, easy to find, and treats acneic skin kindly while still cleansing. Very similar to Cetaphil in all the above ways is the CeraVe cleanser- I‚Äôve used them interchangeably.
Origins spot remover. I was shocked at how tiny the bottle was at first but you only need a tiny amount. It really is for just occasional bad ones, definitely not for full on break outs as it is very drying but it definitely works!

La Roche Posey Effaclar Duo (I use the version without benzoyl peroxide)  is my favourite salicylic acid product and the most effective for my skin plus it doesn't dry it out. 
Try changing your lip balm if you use one - the wrong ingredients can wreak havoc!
on the back is best
used to sleep only on my side but retrained myself to sleep on my back because I was in a similar situation to you. I honestly can't tell if it helped, but it hasn't hurt.
on the back is best for sure. every time i wake up COMFY AF on my sides with my face in my pillow it irritates the acne on my skin.

You may want to change out your pillowcase more frequently to see whether they help.
I always sleep with my left side down, but I haven‚Äôt noticed that side breaking out more. I also think it‚Äôs important for you to tie your hair up when you sleep (or wear a headband if your hair isn‚Äôt long enough. I found that when I kept my hair down, I was touching my face a lot more in my sleep (my face cream would get on my hands), and I would start breaking out on the sides of my face and my forehead. So then even if you‚Äôre a side sleeper, your hair won‚Äôt cause you to break out.
Some chin acne can be caused by eating greasy foods. Try to cut down on these foods or wash your chin area after eating them. 
Start w topical - what do you use for skincare? A good benzoyl peroxide wash, toner and moisturizer may help, along with changing your pillow cases every night.

Okay so I can‚Äôt see the pictures because I‚Äôm on mobile and I can‚Äôt click the link but anyways...I‚Äôm not sure what Palmers Cocoa Butter product you‚Äôre using but you might want to switch to a different moisturizer. I‚Äôm pretty sure cocoa butter is comedogenic so I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend it for your face. (It would be great as a body moisturizer though!) Switch to a moisturizer that‚Äôs more suitable for acne prone skin. While you‚Äôre looking you can always run the product through cosdna and it will show you if it contains any comedogenic or irritating ingredients. 
UPDATE:
Went to derm got prescribed some antibiotics (doxycycline) and a benzoyl peroxide cream (Epiduo).

Derm said use the cream + cetaphil together. Antibiotic taken daily. 

Should begin working within a week so lets see
2 weeks in so far, big changes already, really is a wonder drug regardless of the side effects 
Was on accutane two years ago. Went really well, minimal side effects. Long story short, skin was perfect until I got off birth control in April and had acne again by October. Went to a derm (different because I moved states) and she said Accutane does nothing for hormonal acne and put me on Spiro. This was in December and I‚Äôve maybe seen some improvement in cystic acne on my jawline. I would definitely do Accutane again. Even though it‚Äôs come back, it seriously improved my quality of life and self esteem. 
I did. Was on accutane for about 8 months. The only thing that helped my skin clear but had the side effects of dryness and obvious redness on my face (everyone kept asking me why I was so sunburnt all the time). 

I had to quit however as it gave me complications with my liver and my blood tests were indicating levels well above the ranges I was supposed to be in. Now I'm just hoping that even though I stopped in the middle, my acne problems are gone.
I just started it a week ago. It has made my acne different. I've actually gotten more broken out since starting but its better than before. I make videos about it and post them on YouTube! Visit my channel I'm Bear Zodo on there. I talk about what its like every day. Going through it is a rough trip though!
I am getting my first round of accutane on 22nd, hope that after 5 years of acne I will get rid of it... Don‚Äôt be pesimistic about the side effects, you can cancel the plan any time during the routine. 
I was on accutane a year ago for about 8 months. My face was sooo clear literally not even one pimple on my face for months. Once i got off my face was still clear for the first two months then i started getting a few pimples here and there. My acne has come back a little but not nearly as bad as before and it's usually manageable with OTC products. However, accutane did nothing for my hormonal acne and it's still something i struggle with currently when that time of the month comes around i usually get some pretty bad breakouts around my jawline which sucks. But for t-zone and cheek acne, accutane worked wonders! 
I was on it for 1.5 years, it worked amazingly for me and my skin totally cleared up after 6 months. I had constantly chapped lips, very dry skin and very dry eyes which made it impossible to wear contact lenses. 

After about a month of stopping treatment my acne returned as it previously was. I was then put back on accutane for 1.5 years and the same happened again, no luck! 

It works for some people, it doesn‚Äôt for others. I have also heard about the possible side effect of depression and suicidal thoughts, so it‚Äôs definitely worth researching and finding out if it‚Äôs worth risking these side effects before you try it. 
I‚Äôm on accutane right now, and it‚Äôs literally been hell. Had mild/moderate acne and got on 40mg/day, and on the 3rd-4th week started to get an IB, and it got worse than I‚Äôve ever had. I got big painful cysts on my jawline, and when they went away I got a ton of whiteheads on my cheeks which have been there for a few weeks. My jawline is still swollen and red all the time. It seems that it‚Äôs getting a bit better now in my 3rd month, at least I hope so. 
Besides the horrible breakout, my skin bleeds daily (was way worse a month ago), I have to change pillow sheets every 1-2 days because they‚Äôre full of dried out blood and pus, my skin itches like hell and burns everyday.
The side effects have gotten a bit better when I got proper products for cleaning and moisturizing my skin, so if you get on accutane make sure you get that right.
I know most people get through it without big problems, but from my experience try other options before accutane. If I could go back I would never get on accutane. I‚Äôm just praying that it‚Äôs gone before summer and there is no bad scarring. 
I've been using it for a week now (30g), no big changes on my face but my back hurts a lot.
I ordered it online without going to a derm so my experience is different but it did work well. It took my acne away in about 2 weeks then I continued to take it for about 4 months and stopped. It came back in 8 months then I did a 2nd round for 6 months. It eventually returned. In the end, I changed my diet and it worked well for me. If I knew I could've changed my diet I wouldn't take Accutane but I was desperate and it was a quick fix. I don't have any long term side effects. But I did get dry skin, chapped lips, week on week off bloody noses, small back pain that went away, some stomach aches, and no psychological issues. Also I did research, make sure you eat a full meal while taking Accutane, a meal high in fat helps. It allows your body to absorb the drug a lot better. 
Stop using toothpaste on your face immediately! It sounds like you could also be over-washing your face and stripping it of oils, therefore making it produce more oil and leading to acne. You need to establish a routine that‚Äôs gentle and hydrating for your skin. Avoid any products labeled for acne, they are far too harsh and drying. Use a gentle hydrating cleanser and a good facial moisturizer. With your type of acne, I would suggest using benzoyl peroxide. If I were you my routine would look something like this. 

AM 
- Rinse face with water OR use micellar cleansing water on a cotton pad 
- Moisturize
- Apply sunscreen

PM
- Cleanse face with gentle hydrating cleanser
- Let face dry and apply either 2.5% or 5% benzoyl peroxide ALL OVER your face
- Moisturize

This is going to be a good start for you. If you don‚Äôt see any improvement after a couple weeks please see a dermatologist. By that time you will have a routine set and the dermatologist will be able to help you add additional treatment. 

As for product recommendations, I would suggest - 
Simple Micellar Cleansing Water
Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 30 Sunscreen
CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser
Neutrogena HydroBoost Gel-Cream Moisturizer
Neutrogena Stubborn Acne Daily Leave On Mask

If you have any questions please feel free to ask! There‚Äôs more I can elaborate on. 
Go to a dermatologist OP. OTC options work better for those with mild to moderate acne.
Cut out dairy if you haven't already 
What‚Äôs your usual routine
You need a real routine. At the bare minimum, cleanse, tone, moisturize. As many have said you're most likely over-washing so try just a micellar water in the morning. Strongly recommend CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser at night. An AHA/BHA toner is great for acne and try a moisturizer for sensitive skin. You could also try a serum with salicylic acid at night before you moisturize. Stop putting toothpaste on your face, it can actually cause breakouts, and try and see a dermatologist. You may have cystic acne and that needs professional treatment. 
Toothpaste? That‚Äôs the one thing that breaks me out.

It‚Äôs got pore clogging chemicals in it
This looks like more than just a breakout. there‚Äôs something going on causing your skin to behave this way. We don‚Äôt know your diet or lifestyle, I‚Äôd say the first step to progress is visiting a dermatologist or naturopathic doctor! Good luck :) p.s I also agree with the dairy comment, it‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs trigger, but it‚Äôs worth a shot to eliminate and see what happens! 
Acne can be triggered by so many things :( it could be too much dairy, too much added sugar, too much fat/oily food, stress, lack of sleep/water, the cold weather... 

I think what would help you is to wash your face less. I cleanse my skin with warm water in the morning, pat it dry and then apply moisturizer. Before i go to bed i oil cleanse with hemp seed oil and "steam" my face with a hot washcloth, then i moisturize with argan oil and rosehip oil. My skin feels and looks better since i stopped using cleanser in the morning. The oil cleansing method can work really good if you find an oil suited for your skintype. 

Also you could try to remember if something changed in your life in the past 2 months. Did you start eating new stuff/or did you stop eating your were used to? Are you more anxious, lacking sleep? If you can find a few things that changed it can give you an idea of why you're breaking out more.

Hope this helps! 
Good Lord!! See a dermatologist ASAP!!!
You'll be fine.
Just wanted to update - it‚Äôs been over a week and nothing at all happened. Thank you to those who helped me feel better :)
I love this cleanser! It smells weird bc of the sulfur but it‚Äôs very mild. I‚Äôm not a doctor, but I don‚Äôt think this would do enough for my acne alone. Good start though!
Only prescription that ever worked for me. Wish I‚Äôd discovered it 15 years earlier.
My family has pretty bad acne in our genetics. My sister has been using this and something else, not sure what, but her face is looking the clearest out of us 3 kids at my house. 
Lmao please
Try aloe vera. Btw id kill for your skin
Those clairsonics haven‚Äôt worked for me. I bet there are people out there that found success with them though.
I use an off-brand Clarisonic once every few weeks to exfoliate. I have very sensitive skin but it also dried out easily. My usual skin care routine is just nightly makeup removal and gentle tone with witch hazel, since I didn‚Äôt plan on daily use I found no need to spend the extra hundred dollars on a Clarisonic. Mine is a spin brush I clean it after every use and use it weekly for when I deep clean my face (masks, pore extraction, steaming and exfoliating) I really enjoy the spin brush for exfoliating reasons but if your skin is sensitive like mine I wouldn‚Äôt use it on a nightly basis 
I purchased one just over a month ago, and after using it twice a day I can say it seems that there have been some minor improvements in my skin (or maybe it's the placebo effect). i have pretty moderate acne and I've been breaking out less now compared to when I didn't use it. when I do use it, my skin feels like it's getting a deeper clean than when I use my hands. I'll continue to use it and see what happens (but mostly because I spent a lot of money on it) 
I‚Äôm not sure whether you have PIE or PIH (you can google it, PIH is of a darker color, PIE is red) but it could be helpful to exfoliate with BHAs and/or AHAs, try what works best for you. And use sunscreen daily to prevent the marks from getting darker :)
when you say deep is it an indentation? if its just a red blemish id try retin-A
Believe it or not, most people don't care. Acne is a common condition, I have acne and no one says anything or cares. Yea they might make comments in their head, but don't worry about that. 
Regardless of light, NO ONE notices your acne more than you. They may see it, but I guarantee they don‚Äôt care about it as much as you. Unless they‚Äôre super shallow. In which case, who cares what they think? üòâ

Try not to be too self conscious. Added stress won‚Äôt help. It‚Äôs hard! I struggle with this too.
People usually notice it's there, but unless it's incredibly severe cystic red volcanoes all over your face nobody's gonna give you a second glance. 
I agree. It doesn't even register to me what people's skin looks like.
What do you think when you see other people w acne? I only think about it once and thats it 
I have really bad facial redness, which I think people notice more than my big pores/whiteheads. To be honest sometimes I see someone with worse acne than me and I feel a moment of surprise, but never judging them or thinking they‚Äôre less attractive. All I can do is hope other people see it this way, too.
Paracetamol is addictive tho right? I don't think this would be good. Plus I know tolerance can be a problem with it so you'll have to tale more when you need it for something else which could damage your liver.  
I'm really sorry things are so bad for you right now. In terms of the swelling can I suggest some ibuprofen, an ice pack and some people have even suggest putting camomile tea bags on it? 

I know things seem like they're unbelievably terrible but I promise things do get better, try and get back to your doctor and try more treatments, I tried so many before my acne got better!

Can I ask what your current routine is?
You're not alone. Many acne-sufferers feel this way. I am 27 and have had acne for over half of my life, about 15yrs now. I don't even remember what clear skin felt like. I took Accutane in high school and that helped make it less severe but it never went away entirely. 

What I can tell you though is, most people really don't care how you look. Yes there is a misconception that people with acne don't wash etc. But I think that is held by a minority of people or those who are uneducated about skincare. Majority of people are so worried about their own appearance they won't care about yours. Even if they notice I don't think it changes their opinion of you. I have had terrible skin forever and still managed to date, have jobs, go to college, and have two beautiful children. 

So as bad as you feel sometimes, just remember life is so much more than how you look. You can still do so many things. And the people worthy of your time and affection will love you no matter what. It is hard to not feel down, believe me, I know. Acne involves a ton of trial and error. So never give up hope! The solution could be out there for you.
Pictures?
Ive heard about Medarma working for some. But trust me $80 is nothing compared to whats out there.
Used the exact same routine, for a while it worked, I loooooved clindamycin phosphate but my skin seemed to build a resistance to it
Do you sleep on your side with that cheek on the pillow?
Could be your phone? Make sure it gets wiped down regularly. And try not to press it to your face. 
Could also be a bronzer/ blush you're using there, a lot of makeup products can trigger acne and that looks like the exact spot you might put bronzer in 
New hair products? New detergent? 
does that mean it will be much cheaper?  I have the aczone version from allergan which I haven't used at all because I am scared i will be dependent on it since it is so expensive.  Also, what are your experiences with aczone?
Sucks it is still expensive. Dapsone is such an old, but timeless, drug.
Life.
My period, dairy, lots of processed sugar, stress. :) 
Dairy, blunts and lack of sleep.
Touching my face 
Everything 
Stress. It's always stress. 
The week before my period
Carbs, dairy, alcohol, and nicotine. Basically anything that causes an insulin spike.
Dandruff 
Hair gel, not excercising, not washing my sheets, not washing my hands before I wash my face 
Gluten, dairy, my period, stress!!
My allergens and food sensitivities, stress, PMS 
My period, dairy, too much sugar, hydroquinine, not cleaning my phone every day.
Chocolate :(
Snacks, but mostly chips.
Not washing my hair everyday, commuting (air pollution), not changing pillowcases every week, sleeping on my side (where my face would touch my pillow), touching my face, not sleeping enough hours. 

And of course, I break these everyday. :‚Äô(
BANANAS  (in smoothie form)
Stress, eggs, dairy, meat, processed oil, high omega 6, sugar, masturbation, washing face and destruction of moisture balance
Everything 
Touching or picking at my face 
Sugar does it every time... üò≠
Products with parfum/fragrance (haircare, skincare, bodycare) and drying/harsh products, lathering agents such as sodium lauryl sulfate, hormones.
Period, diary (have an allergy anyway) and too much sugar, touching my face too much and not washing my make up brushes at leat once a week! 
Diary is the main one but sugar and touching my face 

Make sure you wear sunscreen daily!!!! It‚Äôll prevent scarring. Also when you get off of accutane look into some products that contain ‚Äúwhitening‚Äù ingredients such as:

niacimide(sp)

Arbutin

Licorice root 

Vitamin C serum 

Also using an AHA exfoliant once a week will help fade scars. 
I went in accutane when I was 18 to help fight persistent cystic acne. 

However, I had a recation like yours (only way worse and all over my back and chest). Instead of helping my skin I was covered in scabbing cysts to the point where my derm put me on steriods and dapsonse (which is what is uses to fight leprosy) all whilst on accutane. 

My skin got so bad I couldnt sleep without bleeding all over my shirts. It came to the point where my derm recommended me to attend a dermatology conference so that the best derms in my city could observe my extreme condition. I was in constant pain, became a recluse, lost all self esteem and fell into a deep depression. This persisted for about a year.

After no success I eventually determined that the derms didnt have any idea what the fuck they were doing. I decided to research and be my own doctor. 

I have since completely changed my lifestyle. I now cook all my meals, fast for 20 hours a day, eat mostly slvegtables in Coconut oil and fish. 
I meditate and do the WIM Hof Method daily to combat stress and reestablish natural hormone levels (and just for fun). 

My skin is completely clear now, and after returning to my derm they refused to believe that my rejection of their methods and refusal to use any medicines or creams helped (I guess ignoring my success cause it went against their preconceived notion of skin health)

Anyway. After having what is probably the worst acne Ive ever seen by far and countless hours researching and experiments its obvious to me that the body has evolved for millions of years and thus developed a way of healing itself naturally. Medicines and products do not help. 

Im sorry to go on with this rant but acne and accutane absolutely ruined 2 years of my life. 
On a happy note, I have since learned a lot about the body and the mind through the struggles and am now happier and clearer than ever. Since it seems you may have a similar experience to me I figured Itd be worth me sharing all this. Good luck brotha and let me know if you have questions
Definitely accutane but quit diary completely and stay away from high sugar foods
I‚Äôve been watching some old KUWTK and she had a lot of acne hidden under makeup several years ago. It is reassuring to know that millions of dollars can‚Äôt keep pimples away forever. 
I totally felt this today after having a bad bout of breakouts. If having every tool money can buy doesn‚Äôt fix it, then maybe it‚Äôs okay. Trying to love myself regardless! Wishing you happy skin. 
Right?  At 34 - after a life of SUPER clear skin - I've been having to deal with some pretty serious hormonal acne and boy does it SUCK.  Tretonin has helped get it under control, but even with that, I still have bad weeks.  There's nothing I can do about my hormone imbalances!  Reality bites.
Link?
Moisturizers aggravate it even more (cetaphil and cerave)
Did you mean a comedone extractor? They have them at most drug stores in the section with tweezers and what. I thought it was the greatest thing ever and went crazy in front of my magnified mirror popping every pore. I just couldn't stop. I didn't realize the damage I did until later and now have a patch on my cheeks of pitted scars and huge pores. I try not to use it except for blackheads in weird places like the side of my nose but they're probably best left with a professional. 
There's something called pore vacuums, which are used more for blackheads. 
Black face is unacceptable 
[removed]
Hmm a couple of those raise red flags for me - try looking them up on Cosdna. For a cleanser I would recommend the Aveeno Foaming Salicylic Acid cleanser, it‚Äôs a real beauty!
Thank you.

This is a new brand (local)so I doubt it will be on codsna 
Hi! I'm currently in the midst of transitioning to a whole foods, plant based diet as of today. Hardest thing right now is trying to cut out fried and sugary foods -- about how long did it take you to see a change in your skin?


Are McDonald‚Äôs fries vegan? I heard they were seasoned with beef fat or flavoring of some kind.
Acne can be part of your hormones, if nothing works you can get antibiotics from your doctor. Remember, progress in Acne takes time.
I was in a very similar spot dude and I get it. Im 21 and starting work in the professional world sucks when you have the face of a 16 year old. I've been able to clear my face though by cutting out all carbs, dairy, and alcohol. Yeah it sucks but if you're acne is as bad as mine was, its 100% worth it. 
Over ear headphones or earbuds? With over ear ones you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem. I‚Äôve never heard of acne inside the ear, so my guess is something is irritating it or you have an allergy. Have you ever had a rubber/latex allergy? That could be it.
It‚Äôll be like the hard plastic earbuds. Apple‚Äôs earbuds are a good example, but my ears will react also when the earbuds have the silicon attachments. It‚Äôs acne, straight up blackheads in my ear.
acne.org sells a 16 oz bottle I believe. It'll last you a long time.
Yeah buy online; ebay or iherb
Don‚Äôt buy 10%
I used it unsuccessfully, gave it two months and saw no effect. I feel like 3 months would be a more reliable indicator but I‚Äôm impatient haha. I did try calcium d-glucarate after for high eostrogen and found that helped within a couple weeks. 
I feel you sister, I am 28 yo and I finished a jar(each jar lasts 3 months) already and finally it is giving results. I am taking the second one and  hopefully it will last. Also cutting  sugar from my diet and baking my own deserts using stevia (I mention this in case sugar is your weakness). 

I am
Not on the other side jus yet but My face have improve because when is that. Time of the month I still get blemishes but now I get 3 and they don‚Äôt hurt like they used to 
I go 3-4 times a day but I also eat 100g of fiber a day.

And yes bad digestion affects acne
Topical steroids is what my dermatologist prescribed for me. 
[removed]
I‚Äôve had scalp folliculitis for years. I recently decided that I would try and irradiate it as well. I bought a shampoo for dogs and cats and it is working super well, almost cleared and minimal break outs. 
I purchased form amazon (Canada). 
 Veterinary Formula Clinical Care Synergy Antiseborrheic and Antidandruff Medicated Shampoo
Having been around the block in regards to birth control (3 different pills, now Nexplanon), my gyno preaches that it takes your body about 3 months to get used to a new medication (like BC). I'd say give it the three months required to acclimate to the new/different hormones present from birth control, then if your acne hasn't gotten better, switch to a different birth control that's great for hormonal acne like Yaz or Ortho Tri-Cyclen (Your doc will have suggestions too). Any pill with a  formulation that contains a low amount of androgen can be used to treat acne! Which are you on right now if you don't mind me asking? 
Have you changed any of your makeup routine lately? Specifically blushes?
Nice V taper
Quite the "enhancement" m8 ;)
What did you do to get rid of the bacne?
So you workout...did you notice any side effects with taking accutane on your workouts? I weight lift daily and am scared that accutane would screw with my training 
Are you using anything for scars? If so, what?
Wow those are expensive! (No judgement.)

I just bought the paulas choice 2% bha exfoliant liquid. I haven't tried it yet but it's got great reviews. Also it's less than 30 bucks. 
I personally have more success just buying stuff individually. That way if you react or something‚Äôs not working you can identify it, plus each product is specialized  so you can use it as necessary (e.g at different times throughout the year you might use less moisturiser, but still want to use the same amount of BHA). 
 What I mean is, buy a lotion or whatever that is just BHA, and buy a separate moisturizer. Masks can be good but I don‚Äôt know much about that specific one :)
Almost looks like some kind of sensitivity or an allergy. Finding out what it might be though... it could be anything; laundry detergents, shower products, the cetaphil, food, anything. 

Cetaphil makes my hubs break out, but only on his back. You could cut things out one at a time for like a month and see if there‚Äôs any improvement? Good luck  
This looks like irritation. Cetaphil cleanser is too drying and you may be allergic to aloe. Find an oil-based, fragrance free cleanser and a moisturizing serum (or just some unrefined grapeseed, black seed, broccoli seed, or prickly pear seed oil)
It‚Äôs not even like cysts or anything

Its like my skin just looks bad and dirty i dont know :(

My current routine is cetaphil cleanser and a LOT of aloe vera for moisturizer
I find toner can be very irritating and drying. However US toner are all alcohol, and the products might be more delicate in this brand. Try reading the ingredients and looking up some of that stuff to see if it could be the cause. 
Check out the ingredients on cosdna - should give you a good idea. 
it‚Äôs all about the ingredients...those look unnecessarily expensive yah
It could be fungal! I had really stubborn acne on my cheeks and near jawline and I finally tried Nizoral and it has cleared up significantly in just three days. What are you currently using on your face? 
Giving some insight here's everything I've tried:
-washing face 2 times a day with shower soap, hand soap, or common glycerin soap.

-Benzoil peroxide creams

-salicilic acid

-sulphur products

-absolutely no touching whatsoever

-sodium bicarbonate rubs

-sleeping on a towel

-antibiotics (not accutane)

-Rehydrating with hand cream, face cream and several others

-pure aloe Vera

- eliminating dairy 100%

- eliminating chocolate


Try grabbing a gentle cleanser like Aveeno‚Äôs Foaming Salicylic Acid, a gentle toner like witch hazel and a moisturizer like jack black‚Äôs clean break oil free moisturizer. The fungal product could be worth a try too, throw it all in, but try to stop using random washes and creams on your face. 
Try dandruff shampoo 
I believe there is a link between stress and acne but I‚Äôm not exactly sure how exactly stress can lead to the actual pimple. 

So having frequent panic attacks absolutely may trigger acne. I wish I could give you all the details about this but I‚Äôd suggest going to a doctor and seek help for getting your panic attacks under control and maybe it‚Äôll help clear it up if that‚Äôs the thing that‚Äôs causing it

Good luck I‚Äôm sorry i couldnt give exact details but hopefully I answered the question 
Have you tried eliminating triggers from your diet like dairy, sugar, gluten, etc? I had really bad acne too but I cut out dairy about a month ago and it has made a WORLD of difference. I‚Äôm not 100% strict, like I had cheese in my sandwich a couple days ago and it made me break out but the pimples were really small and went away fairly quickly. I‚Äôm trying to get fully off dairy (it‚Äôs hard but seeing the difference on my skin is a strong motivator). Now I‚Äôm mainly dealing with fixing the scarring and texture issues. 
I too, gained acne as I‚Äôve aged; it was never this bad in my teens. 

Instead of benzoyl peroxide maybe try niacinamide serum? I‚Äôve heard depending on skin type, people benefit from one or the other. 

Niacinamide works well for me and I have combo skin, dry only mostly in the  deep winter and mostly oily in deep summer. It‚Äôs very fine (like you can nearly see through it) and sensitive skin too. 

The ordinary is the company I use. It‚Äôs the niacinamide and zinc formula; super cheap too. 

Edit: also since it‚Äôs gotten so cold I‚Äôve been using dr. Jarts ceramidin liquid and if I get REALLY dry like this last week I use calendula cream; which you can find on amazon or at Whole Foods for sure. And I swear that calendula cream extra helps against acne somehow. Might be placebo but my skin has been so clear this week!
Stop the foaming face wash. It is drying your skin out which can create or make acne worse. Stop the Benzoyl peroxide. I have helped hundreds of people cure their acne and not one of time was it accomplished by using that stuff. 

Please list the specific toner and moisturizer you are using.

Also please understand that the routine you listed has not done anything to treat the underlying cause of acne. If your acne went away while on doxy, then its bacterial. I see nothing here that will treat bacterial acne (including the benzoyl peroxide) in the long term.
2% seems high! I think most products I‚Äôve seen have usually been 1% and even that is pretty drying. I‚Äôd definitely try to dilute it somehow like maybe use a liquid serum on the bottom layer; maybe hyaluronic acid? Then which ever one is less heavy - your moisturizer or this lotion on top. OR perhaps just use this lotion exclusively for spot treatment?? 
I don't like this, it is far too harsh and irritating for someone with acne. I counted several irritants and comedogenic ingredients. 

I would advise against a moisturizer until your acne is gone and instead find a moisturizing serum with oils high in linoleic acid. 

Moisturizers have a lot of fatty alcohols, silicones, and thickeners which are all bad for those with acne. A serum doesnt usually have those in them, and if they are formulated properly they should contain ingredients that deliver moisture into the skin, which is more effective than a cream.
Hey- my ex would use a tinted sunscreen close to his natural skin color!! It gives good enough coverage to the point where discoloration won't be noticeable to others, plus the added benefit of sun protection! 

It's not exactly makeup, so they may make you feel more confident while using it!! 
I use a BB cream. At first, it was a bit embarrassing admitting that I used it but hey, it beats being extremely self conscious all day. 
Manuka definitely helped smooth out my scars! 
Yes you can. Make sure it us non comodegenic 
Absolutely! If your skin is flakey, apply moisturiser! Ringing affirmative :)

Dry skin can actually cause acne because the ‚Äúflakies‚Äù clog your pores. 

Just make sure the moisturiser isn‚Äôt pore clogging
B12 has never made me breakout and I've taken A LOT, are you sure that's the cause?
Hi, licensed Esthetician and certified acne specialist here ‚Äî

If you are deficient in B12 you won‚Äôt break out but for those that are already efficient it is an acne trigger and not a recommended supplement. Same with biotin. 
You could try Tamanu Oil
I was on roaccutane AND anti-depressants, and I began getting cystic acne for the first time for ages, but I was also incredibly dry in my face and this shitty skin period went on for a year.

After a year, my skin was clearing up, but my sex drive also dried up. My ability to orgasm disappeared. I was getting reaaaal itchy in my vagoo from the dryness and my vagina kept tearing during sex xfrom the lack of lubrication. 

I couldn't deal with the no fap lifestyle so I quit, but my acne levels are manageable with differin now. I get a bit spotty during my period, but that's it.
After being on Accutane for about 6 months I've had a great success story with it, first few months were rough but now almost all my cystic acne has cleared up only leaving some slight scarring. 

For anyone not on it yet, it should be noted while everyone gets different side effects for me it was limited to dry lips/skin and ony slight mental effects. No depression or anything, but i did find that very small thing would upset far more than they would have normally. ie I cried when I stubbed my toe once during the first few months. (It seems ridiculous now but at the time it seemed like life was over)

Overall, i have had great success. But be warned that everyones story is very different. As this is my first course i cant say if its going to come back but i can hope!
My acne is WAY less active since concluding my first course last July. Now my main issue is some wicked scarring, which I guess I can call a success, although it doesn't always feel that way.

I also don't feel like I'm "out of the woods" just yet - with every minor or occasionally moderate flare up I have a nagging thought that things will revert back to their old ways, and this relief from *constantly* breaking out is only temporary. Which definitely sucks.

But having freedom from the repetitive bashing of my self esteem has given me the chance to address the other issues in my life, two of which are anxiety and depression. 

The hardest part with this is that I'm just so hard wired at this point, it's second nature for me to think negatively when it has anything to do with myself, it's normal to want to pull away from anything outside my comfort zone, away from anything unexpected, and to not put myself out there and start dating again.

But I've done so much. I drove across the country. I started a new life in a new place where I knew few people. I've done things many wouldn't have the guts to step outside their comfort zone to do. But it's not any easier now than it was then, and I guess part of me really hoped it would be by now.

I'm trying to reprogram the way I feel, the way I think, the way I live my life, and it's very unsettling a lot of the time. 

I think the worst part is thinking all along that all I had to do was get rid of acne, if I could just get clear skin, everything else would take care of itself. But the reality is that putting my acne in remission has allowed me to pull the curtain on these far bigger issues in my life.

Maybe that's why I'm not out of the woods just yet.

I know this is probably way more than you wanted, but it was very cathartic for me to reflect on the progress I've made since making the decision to try accutane, so thanks for posing the question, and I hope this wasn't all for me and you or someone else might gain something from it.

Best of luck to all on their journey to clear skin.
The first course worked for me for three months. Then my acne came back and stayed through the second course. 
I finally found a dermatologist who explained things to me. I've been RXed minocycline a few times and noticed no results. She told me that she only uses mino in conjunction with another systemic treatment (accutane, spironolactone, BC) because it helps mostly with redness and inflamation. I think it helps a little but with infection too. But if your acne isn't a bacteria issue, it's not going to help you. 

I really don't understand why its so overly prescribed for acne (other than dermatologist getting kickbacks from manufacturers, I would imagine). Ice never heard anyone having much success with it. 
Didint really work for me.
It‚Äôs an antibiotic so it kills the bacteria. I got drowsy taking it so I had to stop :(
i saw noticeable change after being on it for 5 months, the problem is you can't be on it for a long time. Acne got worse after stopping so now I'm on accutane. 
In my experiences all of the creams work exactly the same, as far as face wash, however, I have only used a few. I would recommend just using the cream and a regular face wash but that's me. 
Most cleansers just aren‚Äôt on your face long enough to really have an effect on acne. The point of a cleanser is to remove any dirt and excess oil from your face, so as long as it‚Äôs not  super heavy and drying cleanser, any will be fine. If you want to help remove acne or things of the sort, it would be much more effective to look for benzoyl peroxide treatment creams, 2.5% is the best place to start. 
It's more effective and less drying as a spot treatment. BP in a cleanser or toner is just gonna dry you out. If you use it selectively on pimples overnight it can really reduce the size. 
Only logic I can see is staining your comforter / sheets
I used to leave it on overnight and wake up with redness and dryness beyond belief. My doctor kept recommending it but in the end I had to give up and move to antibiotics which did the job after 6 months 
I've never washed off my BP - woops
I would like to know the answer also 
i do this with epiduo because the sun deactivates the retinoid. from what i know the retinoid helps the BP soak into the pores/ opens the pores more.
Hi I‚Äôm a Certified Acne Specialist and Licensed Esthetician. Forehead acne is often attributed to a lack of water intake and lack of leafy greens/fibrous foods and/or (if closer to hairline) hair care products. 

If you wear hats or play sports that require a helmet, that can also be an issue. 

 
Yes it could, but it really depends on you. You could try cutting it out for 3-4 weeks and see if it makes a difference. It could also be a combination of sensitivities. I know gluten eggs dairy sugar additives ‚Äúflavors‚Äù yeast extracts and alcohol (amongst others) cause me to break out. But it took me 10+ years to narrow it all down. 
Have you thought about haircare products you might use that could be responsible? I have to be so careful of shampoo and conditioner, as well as any products I use on my hair in case it touches my face. 
generally when a food that you eat causes acne, the acne will appear 2-24 hours after you eat the food. you can correlate which foods cause acne in you
lots of foods can cause acne: grains, nightshades, legumes, eggs....individuals can differ
I'm definitely not an expert on this, but in my personal experience dairy has had no effect at all. I literally drank two glasses of milk after reading an article telling me it was bad for my acne and well, nothing happened.  My forehead acne is mostly due to hormones, and I find that the best solution is to really clean your face well even when you didnt put on makeup (I use micellar cleansing water since I absolutely hate the feeling of cleansing oils). Also don't touch. Don't.
Habe you tried cutting all carbs? Or do you drink much booze? I used to have terrible acne but I cleared it up by cutting carbs, dairy, and alcohol. It only works if I cut all three though; going back to using just one of those ensures a break out. (This is from almost two years of testing what works and doesn't work for me)
Hi everyone. Sorry if I‚Äôve stuffed this up, this is my first proper reddit post. (Whoot!)

27F.

I‚Äôve struggled with these bumps on my chin, and now on my forehead for a long time. Years. I also struggle with deep blind pimples on my chin and jaw area. They make me feel pretty miserable. 

I wash my face morning and night with Cetaphil Gentle Skin cleanser. Tone with La Roche Posay Serozinc and moisturise with La Roche Posay Effaclar Mat. Of an evening I moisturise with Manuka Doctor Apr Nourish restoring night cream.

I apply Sunscreen every day using La Roche Posay 50+ comfort anthelios xl. 

A couple of times a week I‚Äôll go in with The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% +HA 2%
And The Ordinary Retinoid 2%. I have also started using the Nip Fab Glycloic Fix Night Pads on the nights I‚Äôm not using other treatments.

Am I overloading my skin? Should I just calm he hell down with my routine?! I‚Äôm thinking of making an appointment with my doc to enquire about my hormones, and if that could be the reason behind my spotty skin. 

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. 

Love from a spotty aussie. 

Ps: sorry for the potato quality pics. 
I got the same thing once after using an exfoliant that my skin didn‚Äôt like.  Rub some Vaseline on and try not to touch.
What type of skin do you have ? Dry, oily or combination? 
I‚Äôve seen multiple posts on these bumps and no one has said what they are.. I have them too and it‚Äôs very frustrating!!
I thought rash too...ease up on harsh products and try some hydro-cortisone.
This looks like perioral dermatitis. I used to get this rash on and off, in the same spot as yours. I ended up having to take oral antibiotics to get rid of it. I would recommend seeing a derm and mentioning that you think it's PD. Whatever you do - DO NOTTTTT use topical steroids. This actually makes PD way worse. Google it and you will find many helpful sources that explain what exacerbates it and how to avoid future flare ups.
These suck. I have them in the same area, around my mouth/jaw/chin. 

The only thing that's made a notice difference for me was my Dermatologist prescribing a retinoid cream. I can't remember what percentage/strength mine is but after about 4 weeks it started to improve. 

The down side is each one of these tiny bumps came to a full-fledged pimple with a white head, one by one, week by week. That part sucked. But they are finally going away. 

The upside is that the retinoid cream also helps shed skin so any redness or hyperpig you might notice when them coming to a head will likely fade as well.

Also, side note - I had used Cetaphil for years but ditched it this year for CeraVe gentle everyday cleanser. Idk what chetaphil did to their formula but it seemed (to me) to become very weak in clearing dirt, oil, or makeup residue yet it was irritating my eyes and eye lids a ton. Could just be changes in my skin or body but I'm loving the CeraVe cleanser. 

Edit - please ignore spelling/grammar, my autocorrect is a bitch. 
The mods are probably going to send me a cease and desist here pretty quick, but my skin was literally saved by checking all my skin products on cosdna. Some people love it/others don‚Äôt agree, but after spending a small fortune on skincare designed for ‚Äúacne‚Äù (looking at you Clinique), it turns out some of the ingredients were doing more harm than good. Maybe give it a try?
I'm my experience massively helped 
yes.  it has been in the scientific literature since the 1970s and has the same effectiveness as accutane. jarrow zinc balance has a good zinc/ copper ratio
Zinc didn't help me with having less acne but it did help a lot with it healing faster which resulted in less acne pimples at the same time.
it didn't really help me to be honest. I took a zinc and copper supplement and I didn't really notice any difference. 
At home you could dermastamp (not roll) and you need 1.5mm or above. If you wanted, a doctor may suggest Infini RF. I do not recommend lasers for this scar. There is a surgery called subcision that raises up the scar bed, but the textural issues will have to be improved through resurfacing of some kind
Laser treatment
Nothing topical ever worked for me either. I cleared my acne through diet by cutting carbs, dairy, and booze. Now acne's different for everyone but if you feel you've exhausted all other options, maybe give it a try. If your acne is as bad as mine was, it's 100% worth it.
It is great that you are willing to try a lot of products out however you need to switch if it is not working for you. I am nutritionist and used to have bad acne and loss a lot of confidence so i started doing my own research into this with a more natural remedy. Instead of treating it externally, I started to detox myself from the inside with safe nutritional supplements that dramatically minimised my acne in two weeks and. After one year, I have not had any pimples and it felt like a miracle. I have suggested this to a lot of my peers and have helped them out a lot and hope to help you out as well. Message me as I would like to know more before suggesting you products. 
Showing off the gainz 
you should get one of those exfoliating towels because a loofah wont do enough. dont scrub too hard or everyday. do it around 2-3 times a week just so youre not scrubbing all the healthy layers off of your skin. what i do is i exfoliate in the shower every few days and on the days i dont, i use the loofah instead. and i never have a problem with back acne because of this. hope it helps!
 I would get a chemical exfoliant and use a spray bottle to spray your back at night. Just an idea. 
Getting off the gear will get rid of the acne
Don‚Äôt let that hot water in the shower run too long. Either bring the temperature down or turn around more often.
There are many body washes with salicylic acid, you should try one of those
I use Skin ceuticals pore refining cleanser made for combination or oily skin and I think it helps reduce oil (not a lot but), and I think it does help clear my pores. It worked much better than other cleansers.

I think that many acne products have acne causing ingredients in them, at least that is my impression from looking on this sub.
Here's kinda what I said to another post:

Step 1: Your skin feels tight from your cleanser because the PH is too high. Get one with a PH around 5. Get a gentle, boring face cleanser from the drugstore.  Something from Cetaphil, Cerave, etc. 

Step 2: Toner. Witch Hazel's a good option. Pick one with ingredients that calm redness and irritation.

Step 3: Exfoliate. Only do this a couple times a week. Over exfoliation will lead to even more problems so don't do it. Stridex pads in the red box are an affordable BHA. 

Step 4: Choose an acne spot treatment. What works for everyone varies. Lots of people swear by Benzoyl Peroxide Cream, yet it has no effect on me. Everyone's different. Some options are: Sulfur, Tea Tree Oil, BHA, Hydrocolloid Bandages, Neem Oil, etc.

Step 5: Moisturize!! This is super important, your skin produces excess amount of oil because it's dry, and trying to overcompensate. I recommend Nature Republic Aloe Vera Gel. Any moisturizer's good just avoid ones with acne treatments, this step is meant to moisturize and hydrate only.

Step 6: Sunscreen during the day time! This isn't necessarily aimed towards helping your acne, but it will help your skin.

Lifestyle wise:

Change pillowcases often.

Drink water.

Try cutting out different types of foods and see if there's any effect. Some people have controlled their acne by avoiding sugar, dairy, etc. 
In some cases (for me personally) the only thing that worked was getting antibiotics from the GP. I'd go see a dermatologist and if they say you don't need anything then great they can advise you. If not then can give you the help you might need!
switch to BP 5 percent or 2.5 percent.. studies show that BP in lower concentrations have the same good effects, but less drying.  BP gel is much more effective than the wash, the wash doesn't stay on your face long enough to help.  if i were u i would switch to BP 2.5, then switch the Bp wash for a gentle cleanser, you don't want to strip away your skins protective barrier by using 2 high concentration BP products.
I‚Äôm interested to read the replies on this. I‚Äôm always getting spots/cysts in same place.
I only lanced a cyst once (one of the first times I got a cyst because I didn't know any better) and it left a big dented scar in my left cheek. I haven't lanced one since. I know some people do it with some success, just my personal experience. 
My cysts will always come back in the same spot. For me, it caused a flat scar and you could see where I punctured it. Everytime the cyst comes back there is always acne around the cyst, then the cyst will erect again. Good news is it's alot weaker and will heal faster then the last times it will come up. This is just what I've come to find though.
You won't be able to get rid of the pits with just oil. You should use a micro derma needle roller, gently rolling over your face after cleansing. 
Using the oils together should be fine, but don't drown yourself in it. Vitamin serum with the oil sounds great!
These will all do nothing for pitted scars. Maybe the vitamin C would help hyperpigmentation. 
From my experience of using Rosehip and Tamanu, it has only helped with the leftover red marks. Pitted scars will need other methods
I really like salicylic acid for minor pimples. If you have something worse Differin is available at drug stores now. 
looks like it to me - I would recommend an AHA lotion (Amlactin is a good one) 
Look up acne scar treatment places near you 

Edit: I‚Äôm no dermatologist but those look like box scars or rolling scars 
There‚Äôs actually a debate as to why dairy causes acne. One side believes it is the hormones in dairy. Otherside believes it‚Äôs cause of the high iodine content of dairy. 
I‚Äôve heard its a casein intolerance, which is milk protein. 
Yep gave up all dairy and my acne significantly improved went from maybe 20 spots to like 3 or 4

Dairy has naturally occurring hormones in it in order for the baby cow to grow into a fully grown two-ton animal... It is not meant for human consumption. I would recommend cutting out all dairy entirely and you will notice significant changes in your skin - guaranteed.
There are no hormones in dairy products other than the naturally occurring ones that all animals have.
Those are closed comedones. Try your best not to squeeze them. Regular use of a bha exfoliant should help. 
Small closed comedones like that could be fungal acne. If it's just on your forehead...Does your hair usually touch your forehead? Do you wear a hat/helmet for sports? 
You also said you workout often. Try washing your face as soon as possible to see if it makes a difference with new breakouts since sweating could be an issue. 
You should try using bha every other night and steaming twice a week with some extracts like tea tree oil in order to open those cloged pores then use CLEAN equipment or go to the clinique to pop them. Right after steaming u should use any kind of clay mask though. To prevent u had better use a mild cleanser product, better to do double cleansing like AB. As i‚Äôve tried and it worked ( since it is too polluted here i cant get rid of them 4ever T.T)
 Goodluck <3

Sr for late reply üòì they wont get out at once so it may takes u weeks
I‚Äôm on my 4th month (out of 6) on 60mg/day and my skin is about 60-70% clearer than it was before it started and so much smoother. The only side effects I have had is dry lips, the occasional nose bleed and joint pain (that went away as soon as I started taking fish oil capsules). Hope that helps! 
It worked while I was taking it but my acne returned a few months later. That could be because my acne is hormonal though. What did stay was dehydrated skin and dry lips even if I wear lip balm all day and night. 
It works for a lot of people though so don't be discouraged. People in my family have taken Accutane and it's done wonders for their skin. 
I went on Accutane about 7 years ago.  In my opinion it was most unbearable.  The dryness that occurred was painful and a daily stressor.  I took it for as long as I could before I gave up.  The acne came back once I got off it, but for me it was better than dealing with the dryness and pain.
It's up to you whether you want to see a dermatologist or not. There's no real "point" where you should go see one. A visit can't hurt, and I'd say your acne does warrant one.
21F and didn't have much acne on my teens. I started breaking out a couple of months ago (think I might have caused it by adding way too many stuff to my routine at once), tried treating it with tretinoin (0,25mg/g) first then benzoyl peroxide (2,5%) and even though they got rid of much of the acne, the breakout continued. My skin is kinda sensitive to harsh products so I discontinued use when I started to feel burning in the area. It feels and looks much better now, though. I'm optimist I'll be able to treat this with OTC products. Should I absolutely see a derm or is there still hope?

My current routine is (AM and PM) washing with Vichy's Normaderm Deep Cleansing Purifying Gel, spraying some thermal water, then moisturizing with either Effaclar Mat by La-Roche Posay (PM) or Mineral 89 by Vichy (AM). Also I wear makeup almost every day and remove it with micellar water, and use sunscreen diligently.
It couldn't hurt to go, but it probably won't be as useful as you think! Mine was much worse than yours when I went, and all they did was prescribe me antibiotics and pretty much say "It could be anything"

Might as well make an appointment though, since it can take months to get in. So if it keeps getting worse, you'll have that to look forward to!
I think you should visit one. Also switch to non comedogenic products, they are good for acne prone skin ... well atleast works for me. 
Hi ! Of course you can go to a dermatologist! I went for less than that because I had acne for years and it‚Äôs the best decision I have made :) 
I felt like I tried everything, and the only thing that helped is a real doctor ! Good luck, I really hope it will go away for you too :)
(But don‚Äôt worry too much either, your skin is definitely not that bad ! )
Have you tried cutting out dairy?
One way to stop all that redness is to drink water as much as possible. Also, try cleaning your pillow sheets, bedsheets, etc. Use a hot rag when washing your face.

Try to avoid touching your forehead with your palms, instead use the back of your hand (this helps a lot, especially if you exercise and have to wipe the sweat off your forehead).

Hope this helped!
What is your age, diet (vegetarian yes/no, if no, how often do you eat meat and dairy, etc), and current skin care routine?
I‚Äôve never encountered this source before, but I see that one has to pay to become a member of his site in order for this guy to reveal the secrets of conquering acne. Since he says straight up that he is not a medical professional in any capacity, I would certainly not give him a dime. Somewhere on that site I saw that my ‚Äòsatisfaction is guaranteed‚Äô, which brings to mind countless infomercials and leads me away from wanting anything to do with whatever arrangement he‚Äôs peddling.
No it does not sound reliable.
Garlic is anti-inflammatory so I would really doubt it has a negative effect. Soy is hard on hormones, so if your acne is hormonal, it might worsen it. I‚Äôve also heard flax can have a negative effect on hormones. 
No, flax seeds contain beneficial Omega 3 fatty acids (linolenic) which is great for healthy skin. Soy contains phytoestrogens, but this is not going to cause acne. What *will* cause acne is a diet high in estrogen-containing foods such as dairy.  And the idea that garlic causes acne is ludicrous. 
hummus is made of chick peas not sesame seeds.

If you are doing something to cause bleeding, then stop. Dermarolling is damaging your face, and since you have acne your skin is already damaged. You are preventing the healing process, and preventing your body from forming the necessary components for treating your acne and keeping it from forming.

And alcohol is drying, irritating, and again destroys your skin's protective barrier.

Stop dermarolling, it is a dangerous skin care scam that is not going to help you, it is only going to harm you.
Try grape seed oil instead, its better for acne due to its non-clogging fatty acids

This looks like a good moisturizer, who makes it?
You don‚Äôt need to use anything specific. Every persons skin is different so I‚Äôm not sure who told you that you have to use argan oil - you don‚Äôt. If this moisturizer works for you, great! If it‚Äôs not hydrating enough, certainly add a couple of drops of the oil that works for you!
I read here that I need to use oils like argan oil etc. I'm having a look at my moisturiser now that I know a bit more and the list of ingredients looks interesting.  
I'm just wondering what you guys think and also if I need to mix it with argan oil.

The bottle says "aloe vera gel" but aloe vera doesn't come very first in the ingredients list at all (water does so I figured out it wasn't a big problem )
It didn't work for me.  It did, however, bleach all our towels and eat away at the metal stoppers in our sinks.  
  
The only thing that worked for me was Accutane, and now doing chemical peels.
Have you looked into Curology? I started using it like 3 months ago and I only get the occasional pimple now and then. My skin was so bad, I was at a point where I wouldn‚Äôt leave my house because I just hated my skin that bad. Not sure what kind of acne you‚Äôre struggling with but I would recommend you read more about it! Let me know if you have any questions! 
Proactive is like the equivalent of putting battery acid on your face i highly don‚Äôt recommend it‚Äôs known to give terrible chemical burns and they last and I no longer use it because of it. 
It's not a miracle treatment but it may help slightly or potentially make it worse. Hasn't really helped me. A good quality diet and exercise has helped me the most, more than any topical treatment. Try looking into gut health and bacteria because if you eat crap your body is gonna show it on your face. Especially for me. You are what you eat.
The three step kit was too irritating for my oily/combo skin, but their pore refining mask (sulfur based) worked wonders as a spot treatment. You may need to experiment a bit to see what works for you topically, but what you put inside your body makes a big difference, especially water. Every little bit counts, drinking one extra cup or bottle of water a day is better than not having it, don't feel intimidated by the people who drink a gallon a day, just add what you can. Ditching processed food and taking vitamins will help as well, but try these things out and see if your skin improves. Sometimes medication is necessary, but nothing will clear it all immediately, hang in there, best of luck.
Hello. I did use the Proactive set with Benzoil Peroxide last summer. If you stick to the routine usage of it and a balanced good healthy diet, it surely will help.
Be careful to use a small amount when you use it for the first time, vecause BP may iritate your skin. 
And careful with the clothes and pillows because BP bleach...
Good Luck.
It made my skin so irritated and broke out. But my boyfriend uses it and it makes his face smooth and clear. We have very different skin though, his is oily with little acne and mine is dry with medium to heavy acne. 
You can try it but I would be cautious and pay close attention to your skin. If it's starting to irritate it then your skin is speaking to you saying it's not right. 
No. You shouldn't wash your face with benzoyl peroxide, tone with benzoyl peroxide and treat with benzoyl peroxide. It's a very harsh chemical and it strips all the natural oils and healthy pH from your skin. Get a nice foaming cleanser, an alcohol free toner and maybe spot treat with Proactiv and you'll get much better results. 
your going to start getting resistance to it after a while, meaning the antibiotic won't be effective.  Which is why your only doing it for 2 months. I don't know why she didn't tell you to start with a topical first, such as benzoyl peroxide or saliycic acid.  usually you try topicals first before doing oral antibiotics.    If i were you i would stop the oral antibiotics and try some topicals first, if it doesn't clear up, then do oral antibiotics.  oral antibiotics will make your acne worse in the long run, its going to be a huge trial and error kinda thing where you gain resistance to a specific antibiotic, so your derm will switch you to another one, which may or may not work. And that cycle continues. :(
Hey there, sounds like you have had quite a journey with acne :( You have not mentioned this in your detailing of your treatment and dealing with acne, so I ask, what does your diet look like/include? Many acne sufferers including myself have found noticeable improvement from cutting certain things out of their diet like all dairy, oils/oily/fried food, sugar, and more. I do not know if you have tried influencing your diet? I apologise if you have. Do you exercise regularly? Healing from the inside is always the best way. Do you take any supplements? Zinc and b vitamins have been known to improve acne, and both of these are vitamins that many people are deficient in. Happy to help further! 
I drink a gallon or so of water per day and I noticed it didnt really help with breakouts or anything but it REALLY helped with my oily skin. I used to have a really greasy forehead and now that i drink lots of water (tapwater is literally no different) it is completely matte, no shine. Same w/ the rest of my face. Definitely worth it
Continue to drink water! I started drinking more water because I found myself always hungry and read an article about how sometimes people can mistake thirst for hunger. An unexpected advantage was clearer skin. In weeks that I find myself to busy to drink as much as I‚Äôm supposed to, I really notice the difference in my skin. I will break out wayyy more and my skin will be much less radiant 
Definitely keep drinking water. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to drink a gallon. Your water intake is really based on your weight and sometimes age(there are loads of online calculators). Drinking water didn‚Äôt clear up my acne drastically, maybe a few minor zits here and there but it definitely improved my skin texture. I was less dry in the morning after washing my face and I don‚Äôt get as oily in the afternoon. In my opinion, it‚Äôs an aide and not a cure. 
Depending on where you live, filtered tap water is actually cleaner (at least in most places in the US) than bottled water. We have very strict regulations on our water that are not always prevalent in bottled water, which costs more, anyway. 
Check the color of your pee. It should be light enough but not crystal clear. Dark yellow means you don't drink enough

And water is always the answer so keep on drinking 
As everyone else is saying, this is a habit to get in to for life. It's not just for skin health and potential reducing your acne severity - properly hydrating yourself is something your entire body will benefit from for the rest of your life.

What do you drink besides water? Lots of juice? Pop? Coffee, milk? Alchohol?
start the acne dot org treatment before this gets any worse.  Benzoyl will take about a month to start working(in my experience).  The first couple weeks will be really bad, your skin is gonna flake like hell but its worth it.  Once your skin gets used to Bp, it will get alot better from there.  Don't forget to moisturize after.  
Eating habits? Any kind of skincare routine?
Try a gentle cleanser with benzoyl peroxide (bleaching) or Salicylic Acid (like Aveeno‚Äôs Foaming cleanser), a gentle toner like witch hazel and a moisturizer that will not clog your pores (I use Jack Black‚Äôs clean break oil free moisturizer despite being a girl). Swap pillow cases often.

.5mm does nothing but maybe product penetration. You can do it more than once a week. You can use any products before or after. 

For help with pitted scars, use 1.5mm or more. This is done only once monthly. 
Hey, I had that same issue. You could have used my face for a mirror. The only thing that worked for me is changing my diet. Eliminating sugar and dairy is where you should start imho.
I‚Äôve struggled with the same issue for such a long time! Ironically, one of the only things that helped me was not using cleanser in the mornings. I just use a wet washcloth to wipe off the excess oil when I wake up and after a week I started noticing that I didn‚Äôt look like I was soaked in fryer grease by noon like I usually do. I would also recommend niacinamide serum (I use one from The Ordinary, it‚Äôs less than ten dollars and a little goes a long way). Niacinamide helps reduce sebum production and it‚Äôs definitely made a difference in my acne and oil secretions. 
I have the same issue. I try and use face wash made for clearing up oily face. I could look at the name of it tonight and get back to you. I try to wash a lot but it gets dry so I use face lotion to counter it. 
I am prescribed Epiduo that has rentin-a. My skin got obnoxiously more oily. I quit using it and it went back to my normal oily skin. 
Have you seen a dermatologist, or do you have the ability to see one? It sounds like you might be a good candidate for accutane. 
I used to have the same problem but I've gotten my skin under much better control oil-wise within the last year or two.

-It doesn't sound like you wear makeup, but one of the first things I tried under mine to slow down oil buildup was the Too Faced Primed and Poreless skin smoothing face primer. Even if you're not wearing anything over it, it might help keep shine at bay. 

-I struggled with acne for a long time, and so I started using a 3-step system from Clinique called  the Acne Solutions Clear Skin System. The product I noticed really helping with oiliness was the Clarifying Lotion. It's not really a lotion, I would consider it more of a toner since it's liquid, but it helped SO much around my nose where I got the most oily. I used it twice a day as recommended until it actually started drying my skin out, when which I balanced my skin out again with a good moisturizer. 

-For moisturizer right now, I'm using the Clinique Pep-start Hydroblur Moisturizer. It's designed for oily skin and it claims to help keep oil at bay. It's the only moisturizer I've tried that really does, plus, it doesn't break me out. 

I hope one of these helps! Oil sucks. Best wishes!! 




I heard water makes your skin look more clearer and less oily. You should try and drink a gallon a day.
Have you tried tea tree/ lavender oil?

Despite it being an other oil added, it really helps me. Apply very lightly and I normally put some thick moisturizer  on over it
Using a mattifier always causes my acne to lessen. I like OC-8 (without the acne meds) and Milk of Magnesia (under make-up or at night).

Double cleansing with oil (like disolves like, afterall) has helped too. I like a mixture of castor oil, safflower oil, and a drop or two of teatree oil (if you aren‚Äôt using it to take off eye or lip make-up). You rub this on your face for about 5 minutes (I often feel junk that gets dislodged from my pores). Next, wipe it off with a warm washcloth. Lastly, I wash with my regular face wash Avene‚Äôs Clean-AC. After, complete your skin routine as usual.
It also really depends on the weather! I used to live in a very, very, VERY humid country and my skin was usually unbearably oily by noon. Now I live in a very cold, dry part of the US... my skin is now normal/combo, slightly oily in some parts but nothing unmanageable. 
I have also struggled with extremely oily skin (along with severe acne). It began when I was in third grade. I tried everything - over the counter, prescription, topical, supplements, home remedies, et cetera. Nothing worked. 

Last month, at age 31, I found a dermatologist willing to prescribe spironolactone. It has been a total game changer.  Within three days, my skin went from an oil spill to NO OIL AT ALL. I am still shocked at when I look at my face throughout the day and at bedtime. There‚Äôs no oil at all, just a healthy glow. It‚Äôs definitely something to discuss with a dermatologist!
A dermaroller causes microtears- use a dermastamp instead. 

Also, .5 will do nothing for scars. You need 1.5mm or more. Yes you can put that oil, but the best would be either vitamin C serum or a retinoid 
Hey, I‚Äôm not sure about the dermaroller but a product I found that has drastically improved my pitted scarring is organic, unrefined, Tamanu oil that i get on amazon for $15. I‚Äôve been using it daily, as needed and my skin texture has never looked better! I definitely recommend it because my scarring was like, all over my face and I set up some appointments for surgery to get rid of it, but I‚Äôm postponing it because it‚Äôs working so well. 
Unless you're going through a dermatologist or skincare specialist you're not going to have any luck with dermarolling. The needles on the rollers available to the public are too short to penetrate your skin deep enough to change anything. You would probably have better luck with laser treatments for pitted scarring!
I‚Äôm 20 y/o female and my story is basically the same as yours. I went through every oral/topical treatment my GP gave me to no avail. Then I stopped using everything and my skin was clear for about 2 years while I was at uni then all of a sudden it came back so much worse! I was put in birth control (which didn‚Äôt work) before I was finally put on accutane. My skin definitely wasn‚Äôt as bad as some people who went on accutane - in no way was my acne severe but it was extremely persistent (which is reason enough for a prescription!). Accutane is deffo a last resort drug (really important to do some research - the accutane subreddit is amazing) , so exhaust all other options before deciding/pushing to be on it (if that‚Äôs what you decide to choose) !! I‚Äôve been on it 4 months now and literally complained the other week on the accutane subreddit how my skin wasn‚Äôt clearing then 2 days later I woke up to a 60%ish clearer face and it‚Äôs been improving ever since :)
Have you discussed spirolactone with your derm? This helps if your acne was hormonal. It's worked great for me and way less side effects and work than accutane. May be work bringing up to see what they think.
oh wow i didnt realize they still made this. im 30 when i was in 7/8th grade i did natures cure with pill and spray. i remember one of my friends complemented my skin. i cant recall results though.
I've been using Nature's Cure for the last 19 years and it's the only thing I've found that consistently works. I haven't taken the pills in a very long time, but the cream still largely does the job. I am now looking at changing up my regimen though, maybe I'm not as consistent with applying the cream, but I still get random outbreaks and want to see what else will work for me. Really thought I'd be done with acne by my 30s.
It's really helping me. Mix it into whatever moisturizer you use at night for easy application. 
I love it. It has made my face less oily throughout the day.
It works well, though you don't want to apply it directly onto any acne as it can cause the size of the spot to increase. Aside from that, I think it works wonders. 
I‚Äôve found it incredibly moisturising and calming after I‚Äôve done my skincare routine, just mix a couple drops into my moisturiser and then I‚Äôm ready to go :) it‚Äôs non-comedogenic and completely natural so why not give it a go :)

It got worse for me in college but better right after. I learned to wash my face every night and use Clearasil, but honestly I think you just grow out of it
It got worse for me in college, but I‚Äôm only 19 so it might get better by the time I graduate. Even if it goes away I‚Äôm worried about pitting. My epilepsy medicine (lamotrigene) seems to make it worse as my acne has become significantly redder and more painful all over my face since I started taking it. I‚Äôve tried everything from topical creams to antibiotics to dietary changes and sometimes it works for a while but my acne always comes back. It‚Äôs changed forms a lot in the past 7 years; I used to break out a lot on my forehead and nose and then for a while I was breaking out on my cheeks but now I‚Äôm breaking out on the sides of my face.

I‚Äôve interned before in a field where I‚Äôm one of  the youngest, and it‚Äôs really disheartening seeing a lot of the beautiful older girls with perfect skin and knowing that I have to conceal my flaws with makeup to look professional, and that I‚Äôll never be as pretty as them no matter how hard I try. To be honest, my acne has significantly worsened my depression because I already feel really ugly and worthless and the acne validates those feelings.

I probably want to adopt kids because my acne is so bad I wouldn‚Äôt want to pass it on to my kids. Nobody deserves to feel like this or look like this so I don‚Äôt want to subject a child to terrible skin in a world where looks matter so much and bullying/harassment are so prevalent.
I think there‚Äôs something to be said for the anti-fungal/dandruff shampoo. I‚Äôve had better luck washing my face with antibacterial soap than I have any brand of over-the-counter face wash! Glad you‚Äôve found something that‚Äôs helping you!
I already have Head & Shoulders and Selsun Blue and an anti-fungal ointment. Would those be as effective? :/
I use the cream version - ketoconazole - once a day and it works wonders! 
I've been wondering this too. I have a LOT of allergies (unable to get shots as I'm moving around too much atm) and I've noticed my acne gets way worse at the height of hayfever season. Asked my derm about it and he neither confirmed or denied any link. 
I don‚Äôt believe so. Although allergies and acne often have similar triggers and result in similar outcomes - inflammation.
I use benzoyl peroxide and moisturizer on my face before bed, don't i need to wash that off when i wake up in the morning?
>oils high in linoleic acid

Do you have examples ?
I can‚Äôt find a moisturizer without all that stuff... do you have any recommendations. 
I feel like this is definitely true, but dermatologists disagree.
Absolutely yes. It's because sweets can trigger something in the body and make you break out more. I'm not too science based but I know it spikes up one of the hormones in your body and once the spike occurs, it makes the skin flare up

For me also: I ate about 4 ferrero rocher chocolate balls and gained two deep bumps on my chin. Chin pimples is related to the whole hormone thing 
I've got fungal acne. Sugar breaks me out real bad. Like nearly every where on my face.

My brother doesn't have fungal acne, he eats a lot of sweets and he doesn't get one pimple. 
You should never experience a chemical burn from BPO. If skin reddens or becomes easily irritated it either hasn‚Äôt acclimated to the percentage of BPO, there‚Äôs an allergy (this is rare but happens) or ‚Äî many OTC acne products are also formulated with irritants or pore clogging ingredients (best to check those) that could be the culprit. 

The sensation one typically feels while acclimating to BPO is an itch or itching sensation as the BPO is oxygenating inside the follicle. (Bacteria can‚Äôt live in the presence of oxygen)

I‚Äôd check the ingredients decks and compare formulations. You might just be acclimated to the product, also :)
Kate Somerville anti bac clearing lotion is gentle and gets the job done. Pricey though.
put an ice pack on it and take ibuprofen 
Yo my man! I got the same thing in both earlobes, never discovered if they were acne related or not but they sure do hurt when they get inflamed
I think that other reply was for acne and PIH (dark spots.) if you have actual indented acne scars, it's a bit more difficult. 

At-home treatment will take a long time, no lie about that. But, it will over time produce results. For starters I would recommend getting a prescription retinoid from your dermatologist or general practitioner. These slough off skin and actually increase normal collagen structures in the skin. 

For treatments, alternating TCA peels (you could purchase from Makeupartistschoice) and a dermastamp (NOT DERMAROLLER) at 1.5-2.5 mm length will help. Do one treatment one month, do the other the next. 

TCA peels need to be worked up to very slowly, starting at 12.5% and gradually moving to 30% over time. 

These together resurface skin while also forming new collagen 
1. Cut dairy (change diet)
2. Moisturize  
3.  Benzoyl peroxide cream
4. Wash face with cleanser twice a day at most 
5. Apply vitamin C serum at night ONLY
6. Be patient, don‚Äôt touch you face
7. If everything fails, see dermatologist 
Ps : if you need help for which product to buy, message me 
vitamin C, chemical peels, Retin-A and its derivatives are all proven to work.


Oh god! Sorry. That was a mistake. Exfoliate with AHA and BHA once or twice a week (depends on skin type)
What about prid? It might bring everything to the surface 
Excuse the dark lighting, but it makes it a lot easier to see. It's been on my forehead for three months, I'm currently on accutane too
It's never had a head, and I've tried a ton of different things. Iced it, hot compress, cortisone shot, never touching it, moisturizing it constantly, even tried cutting it open sadly. Had two cortisone shots and it came back both times. 

What do you guys think it is and what are some home remedies to make it go away?
I had something like that once and I put a gob of neosporin on it whenever possible and it went away in a few days. Could have been a coincidence. 
This looks bacterial and hormonal. Do you sweat a lot?

What is your current routine?
I also had forehead acne, what worked for me was antibiotic. I used erythromycin 2% & Benzoyl peroxide 5%. Erythromycin  costs me ‚Ç¨70, I'm not sure if you want to start with antibiotics but it works for me extremely fast.
Do you use any hair products (gel, spray, pomade, etc.)? It looks like this could be causing it. If you can stand it, try going a week or so without using any and see if your skin improves. 
[removed]
Do you still eat soy ? It triggers acne for some of us. Same for peanut butter

Some people have succ√®s with apple cider vinegar +water (I'm trying this now)

Supplement with zinc and fish oil pills

Right now I'm trying probiotics too for 3 months

And camomille tea+sea salt 
Your body needs EFAs (essential fatty acids) in order for your skin to naturally desquamate (shed) as well as reduce internal inflammation, which often goes hand in hand with acne. 

An acne skin is shedding up to 5 layers of skin cells a day where as a non acne skin sheds one. 

There are two EFAs specifically (linoleic acid and alpha-linoleic) that are not synthesized in the body and need to be obtained either in diet or in supplement form. 

It can be challenging to get enough of these EFAs in a vegan diet since the best source of an omega 3 is fish oil. 

Vegan options generally include flax (ground), chia or hemp but if the omega 6 ratio is too high it often makes acne worse. Even poor quality fish oil can make it worse. 

If you are able, I highly recommend adding an omega 3 by Nordic Naturals. I‚Äôm a licensed Esthetician & Certified Acne Specialist and it is the #1 supplement (and brand) I recommend to my clients. You can find it at most vitamin shops and grocers like Whole Foods or Sprouts. 

An optizinc will also help significantly reduce inflammation and help clear acne in tandem with the right products/routine. Just be sure to take with food otherwise it can upset your stomach. 
Give it time. Some products take 2-3 months to see results. Don't give up just yet
Are you applying BP EVERYWHERE and not just spot treating?
Advice? Don't be a vegan. Try world carnivore month.
CereVe pm is my go to 
neutrogena hydro boost gel-cream. it‚Äôs amazing for my dry skin and doesn‚Äôt break me out!
Cerrave pm and am
Nivea creme is cheap and it just works great.
Weirdly I‚Äôve had the best success with biore aqua watery essence spf sunscreen as a moisturizer
Nature Republic Aloe Vera Gel
Hear me out on this: 100% raw unrefined shea butter. Use it at night, it's a miracle worker. It's completely non-comedogenic. Do some research, but it's the best thing I've used on my skin yet! 

Aside from that, DML lotion has been my go-to for years. 
Thanks!
Definitely check ingredients on a comedogenic site if you‚Äôre partial to breakouts, but I use Jack Black‚Äôs Clean Break Oil-Free and it‚Äôs a life saver!
I would look into leaky gut syndrome and Candida overgrowth 
Yes. Almost everything starts in the gut. I would recommend reading the book Clean Gut
Yes! I have gut issues as well and I knew that my acne was connected to it since I have experienced with my diet a lot and have come to a conclusion that my body can‚Äôt digest or tolerate foods like dairy, white carbohydrates, sugar or if i consume loads of gluten.  The thing is if i eat stuff like pasta or white bread my skin breaks out the next day with red inflammatory spots.  And i‚Äôve read that gluten can cause digestive issues as well as acne, but I don‚Äôt want to cut that out, except for the white carbs. I was also thinking of buying probiotic pills but now eat fermented foods instead which are better.  I‚Äôve tried drinking ACV shots and herbal teas to heal my gut and they‚Äôre quite effective, but not that much sadly. 
Most definitely.  When I realized that I was lactose intolerant, I noticed any time I had dairy my acne would flare up. It never correlated until after I found out. Any intolerance a body has will cause some sort of reaction, be it skin, mood, etc. 

Obviously for me, avoiding the food intolerances  gets rid of 80% of my acne, the rest is just small blackheads/whiteheads that I treat with salycic acid. 
I came to the exact same conclusion today.

I often have headhaches, and it comes with stomach pain. when I go to the toilet it goes away like 30 mins later.

My skin seems sensitive to my diet as well (dairy, meat, soy, white chocolate).

I read today that we were supposed to go to the toilets 3x/day (after each meal), when I always thought that once/day was really good.

Now, I'm thinking about adding probiotic pills. I can't find kefir where I stay. What are the good sources of probiotic foods/fermented foods ?
I feel like I could get all the benefits zinc could give me already. It isn't enough; I still break out.

Oh, I didn't know that raw honey was good for the gut. I'll buy some again


I notice good results when I eat a good diet high in veggies and low in sugar and processed foods and sugar. 

Just drinking more water also has helped as has taking probiotics (Yum Yum Dofilus). 
I've been using bp for months now and it's completely cleared up my skin and I literally lather my skin in jojoba oil to help with dryness. My excessive use of moisturizer hasn't affected my treatment at all, only has helped with my dryness! 
Yes, I use acne(dot)org products, and the instructions are yo use two full pumps from bottle, one pimp is about the size of a quarter
I think it depends for each person. In my case I use moisturizer when I see that my faces is really dry ( usually every other day ). The moisturizer I use is based on water and not other chemicals that can enhance your acne. Hoped it helped. Cheers. 
Totally. Use as much as it takes. You may also try a facial spray (Mario Badescu is inexpensive and my favorite) to carry with you and use throughout the day. 
absolutely!! i personally love the Cetaphil DermaControl SPF30 moisturiser as it doubles up as a sunscreen. alternatively, i use aloe vera gel (make sure it's 99%) because it helps to soothe pimples along with moisturising. just make sure the moisturiser you use doesn't contain any acnegenic or comedogenic ingredient otherwise you're back to square one
NO. 

You can use a hydrating gel, like aloe, but do not want to use a ceramide moisturizer with BPO. It negates the effectiveness of the ingredient. It can also cause the BPO to irritate eyes or skin on the neck. 
Hey there, I am on the same medication regimen, but different doses (Doxy-100mg; Spironalactone-100mg; same Tretinoin dosage).  I'm about 3 months into my treatment and unfortunately, I have not seen any significant improvement in my consistently inflamed acne. However, I do have a couple tricks and products that have helped with the flaking that comes with this combination of prescriptions, which I have found to mostly be the result of the Tretinoin.

I use the Tretinoin every other day or every three days instead of every night (not sure what your doc recommended). Also, before I apply the Tretinoin, I moisturize twice as much as I usually would ‚Äì it seems to help with the flaking.

For a good moisturizing product, I use the Neutrogena Hydro-Boost gel cream ‚Äì it‚Äôs a little expensive for a moisturizer ($12-13 for a small container), but it works and it feels extremely refreshing.

Hope this helps and I hope this medicine regimen works for you!

I use the Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid pretty much every day. And then maybe twice a week I use a konjac sponge. Occasionally if my skin feels extra congested I‚Äôll use No7‚Äôs microdermabrasion exfoliator, but I mix it with my normal cleanser and use it very lightly. 

My skin prefers acid exfoliators over physical ones. Less irritation = less acne :)
You only want to use a chemical exfoliant, never a physical exfoliant because physical exfoliants will tear down your skins protective barrier, strip sebum (causing clogging when your body make more to compensate), kill live skin (which can only be replaced a certain number of times), and create microscopic cuts on skins surface which give bacteria a home.

I recommend a chemical exfoliant that can be applied every day, contains alpha (lactic acid), beta (salicylic acid) , and poly hydroxy acids (gluconolactone, lactobionic).  

Feel free to PM me if you want specific product recommendations
It has to build up in your system. Your dose is very low for your weight, but the doctor usually starts at half dose for the first month, so they will likely double it next appointment. 

Most people don't see results until month 3 or after. I didn't have side effects until month 2+
[deleted]
I‚Äôm on accutane now. We are similar in weight and my dr started me off on 40mg. I didn‚Äôt really have any side effects the first month. I‚Äôm halfway through month two and my derm doubled my dosage and let me tell you, I definitely am feeling the side effects. 

I‚Äôm going through my initial breakout right now so I can‚Äôt speak to results but I‚Äôm optimistic it will work. 

Some recommendations. La roche posay products are excellent once you start getting dry. Also take a fish oil supplement. I got really sore joints and that really helped. And of course, make sure you‚Äôre drinking plenty of water. 

Good luck :-)
I‚Äôm on month 4 taking 80mg rn, I‚Äôm around 120 pounds. Side effects are just lip and skin dryness and joint pain. I‚Äôve definitely noticed my foreheads clear but I‚Äôve got a lot to go still. Hang in there! 
I promise it will start to change!!!! My skin, like most others, got worse before it got better. I didn‚Äôt notice dryness until month 2, and even then it wasn‚Äôt very dry until month 4. You‚Äôve got this! Also, some others have recommended cetaphil cleansing and moisturizing, which is what I recommend as well. 
It‚Äôs only been a week!!! It will take months for results. It will start getting dry probably within another week or two. And accutane is different on everyone, you might not even get super dry. 
Ice it! Stopped my latest one in its tracks. Ice it as often as you can today and it may never develop. Make sure you put the ice cube in something, a cloth or ziploc bag and not directly on the skin. Good luck 
Have you ensured your acne doesn't have a hormonal or fungal cause? If it has either of these, antibiotics topically or orally, and accutane will not put it into remission. 
what about acid peels? while they are very dangerous!!! i do them at home but followed up with lots of research and slowly upping the amount of acid used. also not a good idea if your constantly breaking out. i break out every now on then. its just alot of scarring. good luck!
Same here. I‚Äôm a shell of who I used to be with no confidence. I‚Äôm not myself and I don‚Äôt try to pursue women because all I can think about is how I‚Äôm not the best version of me I can offer and that I don‚Äôt deserve romance etc. I‚Äôve struggled for 7 years with this and it‚Äôs completely destroyed my personality. I‚Äôve always avoided accutane trying to fix it some other way with no success and now I‚Äôm realizing the emotional affects I‚Äôve experienced and am experiencing are so much worse and ever lasting than any accutane side effects would have been.
While you may be stating that you have let it defeat *you*, permanently, I have something to say to you and anyone else feeling that way: time heals all wounds, and I too felt this way at more than one time in my life. 

It breaks me to hear you say you skipped out on prom, but I remember what that day was like and 100% don't blame you. 

So you lost a few battles. Acne knocked you on your ass a few too many times. But you're still here. You're making posts to aid other people going through the same rough waters you and many others have.

And that means something. 

Time may not heal your acne, or your scars, and you will never really forget all the times it made you want to hide. But it will, eventually, heal the emotional wounds, the emotional scarring, left by acne. You will, against all odds and in due time, accept the shit card you got dealt, and all the consequences that come along with it.

You sound like you are already on your way there, whether you realize it or not, and so maybe this reply is more for others out there, feeling defeated.

To anyone reading this, and an important reminder to myself:

DON'T QUIT. DON'T STOP FIGHTING. PERSEVERE. 

And above all, live through love and compassion for yourself and those around you.

Wishing every one of you better luck in the New Year.
Sounds like a hormone inbalance which is totally normal for your age. Look its hard on all of us that went through it. I'm really sorry you feel like this. I did too. I actually did go through with accutane and it did help. But do your research. Your acne will fade and time will pass. You'll slowly become the person you were always meant to be. But never let acne get in the way of your life. 
I'm really sorry you feel like this and that it has gotten to that point. I can relate to you in some aspects. I will never know how you truly feel, but I can say that a lot of us are in/have been in the same shoes as you and just know that you're not the only one who has feelings of defeat. 

I've had acne since grade 9. It started in grade 9 and moving forward. It was moderate to moderate severe at times, but as a woman, I am able to wear makeup and that helped me. Let me flash back to last year, 2016. I had severe acne. Really bad. I mean about 29 pimples on my face, all over. Places I never got. cheeks, chin, temples, bridge of nose. That changed me. To this day, it still scars me to be honest. I shower in the dark still (I use nightlights because I can't stand to look in the mirror right after I shower, it's just red and shit). I still can't look at people in the eye properly, due to scarring and even texture from last year. I have even refused a lot of social situations because of my insecurity. So yes, I totally see that this STUPID skin condition called acne can really suppress what you truly want to do. It's gotten to a point where I don't let myself date or really give chances to dudes

Recently, I mean like last week, I finally allowed myself to have some fun with a guy. Make out and all that stuff. I was HELLA insecure! (I'm 22). It's been years that I've let someone get close to my face, let alone a guy. So therefore when you said find supportive people, that really reminds me of my situation. I don't think the guy cared so much about my skin as much as I did

My point/take away: I'm trying to reinforce what you said in your last part -- that we should say fuck you to those people who feel the need to pinpoint our insecurities and flaws. There will be 10 people in a room who will stare and give dirty looks, but 2 will accept you and look past that. So in this life and moving forward, we should only associate ourselves with those 2 people who will not judge us

I wish you best of luck with your skin journey. I never believed I would find light at the end of the tunnel :) It takes time to heal from psychological damage from acne, but I believe that one day these things will become a thing of the past
I‚Äôve had moderate/severe acne since I was 12. I‚Äôm 30 now. I‚Äôve tried everything throughout my life and nothing has ever cleared my skin. I finally started accutane six and a half months ago and I still have acne. It feels helpless and it has ALWAYS controlled my life. I don‚Äôt know any other way because I‚Äôve never experienced clear skin. Just know you‚Äôre not alone. 
Per week, at least twice but no more than 5 times a week depending on how you‚Äôre exfoliating. Using your hands is perfectly fine. I am also using Benzoyl Peroxide for acne treatment and I‚Äôve found that gently rubbing the flakes off during a shower helps a lot and does not cause any unwanted effects. Just be sure to be as gentle as possible and like I said, no more than 5 times a week to avoid excess irritation. If you ever get your hands on an AHA, that‚Äôs an exception - you *can* use this everday mixed in with a moisturizer. Just use a pea sized amount. 
Good luck to you :)
Idk about permanent or not, but i think it's sorta cool bc of the shape lol Illuminati confirmed
I had a very similar looking scar when I was being dumb and tried popping when it wasn‚Äôt ready. It took about a month to fade away. It shouldn‚Äôt be permanent.
It looks like it will be permanent but will lessen overtime. Your skin looks like a great candidate for at home dermal rolling. Use a dermal roller in conjunction with a niacinamide based serum and the scar should dramatically reduce :) 
Keep it super moist and put scar cream on it., even. Wear thick moisturizer or Vaseline or paw paw ointment on it
Wow, my skin looked exactly the same and I cut out dairy and got that result too! What‚Äôs your current routine?
Great stuff! Cutting out dairy was the best thing I ever did for my skin and my body in general. Horrible stuff.
What kind of food do you eat without cheese? I don't drink milk anymore, I drink almond milk. But to cut cheese out of my diet would be so hard, it's in almost everything I eat.
Awesome transformation! Fruit actually gave me a problem tho (weird I know, I guess cause of insulin increase). Try cutting fruit for a bit and see of it helps! 
Great job! Your skin looks great! May I ask how long you dealt with acne before you got cleared up?
Wow congrats! I will take a look into those products, are they expensive? Also do they help with scars?
Do you use sulfate free shampoo? I found most of my body acne went away when no longer using products with sulfate. 
that‚Äôs such amazing progress for a few weeks! congrats! your skin really looks great!!! 
What type of acne did you have? I suffer from mainly cystic acne around the chin area, which topical treatments seem to do nothing for as it must be from the inside. Can you suggest what it might be in the dairy? I'm assuming it isn't the lactose as that wouldn't likely be expressed in the skin - it must be be animal hormones?
You look like a big bag of MONEY! 
No. 
Vaseline always makes my acne worse. I like Cera-Ve and Eucerin Redness night cream (can use it during the day).
I totally understand, except I'm 27 and only finally just got on accutane. So after 14 years with acne on and off I hope that it'll be gone in 6 months. People don't understand how much of a negative impact acne can have on you. So beyond fed up with it now.
It‚Äôs honestly the absolute worst. I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôve tried every single topical from my derm, have spent thousands on otc supplements and products, been on 3 courses of anti biotics, tried every diet I can think of (and still am on a restrictive one on the off chance it MIGHT be helping because I can‚Äôt just give up) and the end result of it is I have a face full of painful cysts that never really go away no matter what I say or do and scarring so bad I don‚Äôt know if it even matters if the acne goes away at this point (which I don‚Äôt think it ever will anyways). 

I would give anything, absolutely anything, to just have normal skin and not avoid going outside because I feel like a leper all the time. The worst part is maybe that in addition to being disgusting, acne is seen as ‚Äúyour fault‚Äù. I cannot count the number of times I‚Äôve getting basic ass useless advice from people because clearly I must be doing something wrong to have acne this bad, and if I just washed my face every day and changed my pillowcase it would go away 
This was me 9 months ago. I‚Äôm 23. I got on accutane and haven‚Äôt had any acne for the past five months since midway through my course. 1000000/10 would recommend. I am so much happier now that I‚Äôm clear. 
I can completely relate. I‚Äôm 27 and have just now reached the point of normal skin after a decade of battling painful and deep cysts. Doxycycline, spironolactone, clindamycin and retin a have seriously changed my life. So yes, you are not alone, you are not diseased, you are not to blame. I know your frustration and pain and just want to say try by to let it control your life. I know I know, easier said than done but still. You are not alone. 
[removed]
Yes, it will go away. Go to your dermatologist and discuss what to do. If it‚Äôs bad enough, talk to your derm about Accutane. 
Could be stress? Stress can affect your micro-biome quite severely which might be making you breakout 
What kind of stuff have you tried so far, like skincare wise? If it‚Äôs been going on for a while and you have the means, I would consider seeing a dermatologist if you‚Äôve tried a bunch of other things. 
ever since i was around 12 ive had really bad acne, especially cystic acne. almost every week a new cyst pops up all inflamed and painful and gigantic and i dont know how to get rid of them. sometimes they get to be bigger than my thumb nail! the one i have currently in the photo showed up yesterday and when i woke up it was bright red and painful. usually when the pain goes away for the most part i try to pop them but i can only get so much out each time and usually wind up popping them multiple times before they start to disappear. any tips at all would be very greatly appreciated as i am so tired of being embarrassed to show my face at school every day.
Really depends on how your body reacts. I‚Äôve recently gone on an elimination diet and finally gotten rid of most of my acne so far. I suggest you start by going plant based (vegan). If you‚Äôre unlucky like me you need to go further than just getting rid of meat, dairy and eggs. You can try eliminating in any order by going whole food, no gluten, no wheat, no refined sugars, low glycemic index foods, low FODMAP foods and so on. Hope your acne gets better soon :)
?
Hey, having acne should not affect the areas of your life and your confidence.

I break out all the time. I still go out, get hit on. Try to find better jobs, think I'm a great person and that I should not take shit from anyone.

Hope you will feel this way too even with acne
[removed]
I am 34 and I‚Äôve had I‚Äôve had it since I was 12. I still have it but it is much, much less severe. The difference for me is not feeling self conscious 100% of the time. I just live my life. I don‚Äôt try to hide myself or my face. It‚Äôs awesome. Even when I do have acne spots and my skin is looking rough, I don‚Äôt care as much. I think most of this came from treating my anxiety and depression rather than acne, but really same difference!! 
I'm not a doctor but I don't think you should start both at the same time. I waited a good three months to let my skin get used to Differin before I started spot treating with BP. Also generally you should use BP at night because it makes you super photosensitive. And finally, be prepared for Differin not to completely get rid of hormonal acne. For a LOT of people, myself included, it works on everything but hormonal jawline breakouts, I had to go on the pill to clear those. 
I use differin and I get the burn sometimes. Make sure you super moisturize before you out it on! It definitely helps, I get the burn when I don't moisturize as much 
BP is for at night, not during the day. Sweat mixed with BP will burn, it won't with Differin. 
I‚Äôll be honest, I began developing acne in 7th grade and ever since I went through a number or name calling and laughs. I never got used to acne.  I would wash my face twice and and shower everyday, I was hygienic but nothing could get it away. A month or two before I started Accutane I resorted to using shea butter, tea tree oil, a mud mask, a sheet mask, two face washes, a prescription ointment and holding and ice cube against any red areas on my face as a last attempt to reduce redness on my face before school and work. I did all of this every single day with little results. 

Sometimes I rub my hands on my face and it still feels abnormal when I don‚Äôt feel bumps and whiteheads. One moment I remember Post-Accutane is when someone touched my face. It was a simple gesture but it made me realize that, in the last 4 years I couldn‚Äôt remember anyone touching my face. Overall my life is way better than it has been in a long time.
So is all that progress just from 6 months of just accutane and no other treatments (no creams,no face washes,etc)?
Edit: Disregard question. I'm new here, I thought Accutane was a cleaning system, not medication. Lol
I‚Äôm on accutane right now man, this stuff is really inspiring. 
I‚Äôm going to start using that. Can I add you on snap?
salicylic acid is good
Please don‚Äôt make the mistake many people (including me) make - spending a small fortune on OTC products hoping that one will work. Trust me I have spend years testing out a bunch of different products and routines from big name brands (Clean and Clear, Neutrogena etc). Most of the time, these products helped a little bit, which made me keep using and buying it. Big waste. My acne only started to clear up when I went to my doctor (just my general one, I don‚Äôt have a dermatologist) and she prescribed me Benzaclin. Took a few weeks but my skin has never looked better. So please, if OTC products just aren‚Äôt working go to your doctor.  
If you got it from ulta (and im pretty sure Sephora) you can return it if you are dissatisfied with the product. Not everything is a HG for everyone :) 
I feel the same way. It‚Äôs never done much of anything for me. I honestly feel like some of the hype is from the tingly feeling it gives from the menthol. A lot of people buy into the ‚Äúif it tingles it must be working‚Äù thing.  
IF your acne has not improved with OTC treatments, please go to the doctor. Attempting to treat acne that does not go away on its own or with OTC products will only result in more unnecessary scarring for your skin.
From my experience anything deep fried, things with high glycemic index (lots of simple sugars), and dairy 
Thank you very much! I will try to limit those.
DAIRY. Also very high sugar foods, like bread/pasta, but not all carbs! Carbs are not bad for you! They are good, but you need to eat the right ones (whole foods like veggies and fruits).
For me it was Anything that's fried, high in sugar, caffeine, dairy, processed food, 
Instead drink plenty of water, eat veggies, fruit, and foods high in fiber. 
Please keep us updated with results! 
Good luck! 
Acne really depends on how your body reacts to foods and I‚Äôve recently gone on an elimination diet and finally gotten rid of most of my acne so far. I suggest you start by going plant based (vegan). If you‚Äôre unlucky like me you need to go further than just getting rid of meat, dairy and eggs. You can try eliminating in any order by going whole food, no gluten, no wheat, no refined sugars, low glycemic index foods, low FODMAP foods and so on. Hope your acne gets better soon :) 

***Also consider changing up your products you use for your face and body. A lot of people think that using acne products will rid of their acne but even though it works it will also cause more acne overtime. You can check your products (if it‚Äôs well known) on the website ‚ÄúCosdna‚Äù
For how long do you leave it on ?
Is it worth doing to an already existing cystic pimple? 
I'm glad I used Accutane, as it was the right choice for me at the time, but there are obviously good reasons to have reservations about such an intense treatment. As far as my sex drive, I have always had a low-ish libido, but no noticeable difference before/after. I actually didn't experience any of the mood swings or other effects either, my skin dried up (and my acne cleared obv) but that's about it. 

HOWEVER, this should have been obvious to me, but I didn't realize at the time: it's not always a permanent solution. My skin cleared up beautifully for about three years, then got worse again. It's now been seven years since Accutane and my skin is much better but definitely not what I would consider "clear" by any stretch. And if your insurance doesn't cover the cost, it can be a very expensive temporary solution. Also I'll probably die of liver disease eventually...? Ah well. For me, in high school and feeling hideous, Accutane was what I needed. But the biggest disappointment was definitely the short-term results.
r/accutane


It helps so much. I never noticed any of the bad side effects except dried skin. There obviously are potential bad side effects like every other drug has, but they are extremely uncommon. 

However, there is risk with taking it so she probably shouldn‚Äôt be on it unless her acne is very severe
I‚Äôm not the best authority on this subject,  as I end up crying out of anger and frustration from my acne almost every freakin day, lol, but every now and then I think about this quote from Andy Warhol:

‚ÄúWhen I did my self-portrait, I left all the pimples out because you always should. Pimples are a temporary condition and they don't have anything to do with what you really look like. Always omit the blemishes‚Äîthey're not part of the good picture you want.‚Äù
I struggle with this daily. I put my hair in front of zits on my cheeks, I cover it up with makeup, I hide and try not to have people look at me for too long. But what my girlfriend told me that I think is  SO important is that people aren‚Äôt looking at you to find your flaws, and because you spend so much time in front of a mirror analyzing your face, you see so many more imperfections that the average person doesn‚Äôt see! So when I complain to my gf about my face she says ‚Äúonly you see that! Everyone else sees a wonderful, beautiful girl!‚Äù (She‚Äôs a sweetie, I lucked out). Essentially: trust that people aren‚Äôt as shallow as you think they are. ALSO what I‚Äôve found is that people are so anxious and nervous about the thing THEYRE self conscious about, they won‚Äôt even notice your blemishes. The more I don‚Äôt think about it, the more the zits go away and the more fun I have! Good luck! You‚Äôre awesome and a temporary state doesn‚Äôt define you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
It's probably one of the hardest things ever, because it's right there it's your face, what people see first wherever you go, I've dealt it through comedy mainly just making people laugh let's their guard down and people see past your imperfections to see who you really are but it doesn't always work. I eventually got like 90% clear so that itself is the biggest confidence boost. I still have scars but they're slowly fading away. 
Everyone gets it. Most people have it, those who don't are probably a minority, make fun of them for being weird. ^/s
Honestly it's impossible for me to be confident or comfortable with acne. It drove my social anxiety and depression so high I was willing to do anything to get rid of it. That lead to my discovery that carbs, dairy, and alcohol were causing my acne and cutting them out cleared me up. Restrictive diet suck but if you've exhausted all other options (like I had), it's definitely worth a try. I'm so truly happier now in life even with the temporary disappointment when the boss brings in donuts.

Covering with make up makes it look worse in my opinion, it is tempting though. 

I think you need to put yourself first in this situation. Just think that the less make up you put over it the quicker it will heal/go away. Forget what everyone thinks. No one probably cares anyway - I know I don‚Äôt when I see people with acne. 
It‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt help. 
My guess is that you're experiencing an allergic reaction but of course I can't be sure and I'm not a doctor. I think it's safe to say that you should stop using what you have been using. 
Tea tree oil is highly inflammatory. What happened was that by applying the tea tree oil you broke down the outer membrane of your keratinocytes (a type of skin cell), which not only causes the swelling and bumps, you in turn destroyed the part of your skin that is designed to protect against harm. 

The black african soap is way too alkaline for skin. You are raising your skin's pH which will lead to acne.
OMG ALL OF THESE ANSWERS ARE WRONG! Tea tree oil undiluted can cause chemical burns. In order to apply it safely, it must be diluted down to 2-3% in a carrier oil, such as jojoba, grapeseed, almond, etc. You probably got a chemical burn.
Also where the fuck are the mods for this sub, horrible advice is always given here.
Make an appointment with a dermatologist if you can and I know it's easier said than done but don't pick! 

Use rosehip seed oil to moisturize your skin and help your scars and browse this sub for things other people have used
Stop washing your face 5-6x/day. It makes it worst!!! It dries your skin, and you skin counteracts and produces more sebum. That's why you look oily.

Go back to 2x/day . I like micellar water. 
And moisturise !

Seriously, keep on living your life. You are still a great person I'm sure regardless of what your face looks like. 
I don't think that you love x because he/she has a perfect skin
Tretinoin takes a while to work, I‚Äôve used it before and it cleared my acne for a year until it came back. Now I‚Äôm on it again. Give that time! You can go to r/tretinoin for more questions about Tretinoin, they are very nice there! 
Do you have a skincare regimen? Steps you take every single day like wash, moisturize and use sunscreen? That's the first step to taking control of your skin. You're right about the dial soap- your doctor has no idea what he's saying if he's telling you to use dial soap on your face. The ph of dial soap is WAY too high for your face and it obviously will dry you out and ruin your skin. 

For face washes, something ph balanced is what you're looking for. My favorite is Vanicream gentle cleanser or Neutrogena ultra gentle cleanser. If your skin is oily, use this in the morning and evening before bed. If your skin is dry, you can skip it in the morning and just rinse with water. You absolutely need to use a moisturizer and a sunscreen during the day (please tell me you are). If you need suggestions, let me know. Consistency is key! Don't miss a day!

Unfortunately your doctor is right about the tretinoin cream. You do have to use it consistently to see results. That doesn't mean you have to use it every single day because it can be drying and irritating. You can use it every other day, or every third day and work up to every other day, but it will take several months to see results because of the way it works. 
I‚Äôm definitely not an expert, but I have heard sooo much success from people who have used Accutane. I have two friends who both went on it for about 6 months, and their acne is gone. GONE gone. I‚Äôm sure they still do things to keep their skin clean and healthy- like washing their face and having a bit of a routine. 
I know Accutane has a lot of side effects but maybe is worth bringing up to your doctor? See if he thinks it can help you? 

If you don‚Äôt totally trust your doctor, there is never any harm in getting a second opinion. 
Spironolactone is a good option‚Äîit functions as a testosterone blocker, and is often used with OCPs or as a single agent in the treatment of hormonal acne. 

OCPs, though, are first-line, so you should be prepared to tell your provider why you don‚Äôt want them‚Äîthey will help determine if spironolactone is a good option. You should know that spironolactone isn‚Äôt recommended for pregnant women (birth defects and risk to pregnancy cannot be ruled out). 

In terms of topicals, retinoids and antibiotic creams are the next step from over-the-counter formulations. If you have good insurance, these preparations may be cheaper than over-the-counter options! They are for me. I pay about $15 every 6-9 months for my topicals. 

I had a lot of success with spironolactone + topical retinoids, but I also use OCPs. Overall had a 95+ % reduction in acne. 
Differin has helped my hormonal acne a lot! 
21 F, not on birth control. I think if you fast for a few days on juice and then maybe a few days on water that will help. I suffer with horrible hormonal acne and I recently did a short water fast and my skin was literally glowing. I think a lot of it is our diet so if you can lower the inflammation then that helps. I use an Organic detox firming peel by √âminence that I got off amazon for 123$. It‚Äôs pretty pricey but it‚Äôs cheaper than going to get chemical peels every month for close to the same amount. I also use tea tree oil as a spot treatment and apply coconut oil religiously as a moisturizer. I used to think it broke my skin out but it actually turns out that it helps a lot. It‚Äôs anti inflammatory and helps with my dry, sensitive skin. This is just what has helped me keep things at bay though. I know everyone is different but I do believe a lot of it is intestinal related. Many people have clogged guts  so whenever the waste gets reabsorbed back into our bloodstream, our skin shows this. 
looks like closed comedones to me.  stridex in the red box will help, if you don't normally breakout in the cheeks dont use the topical creams on it.
make sure you wash your face after you workout :)
Does he have a beard? Could just be friction cuz your skin is sensitive from Accutane. 
[deleted]
I think just moisturize that area well? 
I like cerave PM but I use it during the day, too. Toner is The Original glycolic acid 7 percent (can oder on beautylish online). My wash I love is cetaphil gentle skin cleanser. I also use contact therapy of benzoyl peroxide for about 10 min in the morning then wash it off.

OP, you need to go to a dermatologist.
accutane
I‚Äôm not sure if your talking about the pores on the apples of your cheeks? If so, those are sebaceous filaments. Best way to maintain them is by using a BHA. Strides in the red box and PC BHA are both popular options. 

I also have huge pores and tons of sebaceous filaments. They have considerably minimized in appearance after I started putting effort into healing my moisture barrier.
Your skin looks dehydrated, like you‚Äôve compromised your moisture barrier. That can happen if you‚Äôre not gentle with your skin sometimes. The face wash is probably a big part of that. If your skin feels dry after you wash, that‚Äôs a good indication that the face wash is doing more harm than good. A good moisturizer and spf during the day are super important!
This happened to me when I started washing my face twice a day. So based on that I think you could over washing. Once I stopped my skin became less dry and my pores much smaller. Your bone structure is amazing by the way holy cow. 
I had a acne cyst on my cheek and my dermatologist injected it to make it go away but now I have a discolored indention:(
Is there anyway I can fix it?
I have a gluten sensitivity, Im pescatarian, and rarely eat dairy (except this month I have been eating a ton of cheesecake and cheese :/ )

These are typical breakfast options:

Smoothie:

Almond milk, any fruit/veggie/greens I have at the time, GOL protien powder, Spirulina, GOL super greens powder

Oatmeal:

Almond milk, oats, chia seeds, coconut oil, coconut sugar, fruit/granola/nut butters as topping

Toast:

Gluten free bread, nut butter or organic fruit preserves, bananas

Hard boiled and scrambled eggs

What I have when I have no time to cook:

Rice cakes with peanut butter

Gluten free waffles
Oatmeal, almond milk, pea protein, unsalted almonds, flax, chia, sunflower seeds, sliced banana, berries, and stevia.

Also.. there is non-dairy yogurt.. I like ‚Äúso delicious‚Äù.
Oatmeal for me! It's pretty simple and easy, I add fruit( banana, berries) some honey, cinnamon and seeds( chia seeds and/or flax seeds. 
You need to see what works for you. If you're having acne problems, obviously cut out dairy. I used to eat eggs and bacon, but have seen better results eating oatmeal and toast. My current breakfast is obviously more carb heavy, which can break some people out, but like I said, figure out what works for you.

If you really want a sure thing no-acne causing breakfast, I think maybe the best thing would be some kind of fruit/veggie smoothie, obviously without dairy.  
This is what I like to have for breakfast! (I also avoid dairy)
One egg white, bowl of fruit and banana, chia seed pudding (made with almond milk)
Acai bowls! Blend up a frozen packet of acai berry pur√©e with a banana and a bit of almond milk, top with sliced fruit and granola! The best!

Also, avocado toast (you can use gf bread if that‚Äôs your thing). 
Oatmeal made with almond milk, topped with banana or berries! Wash down with water lol
I have this as well, I'm currently doing treatment for my acne and since starting in October I've seen it start to disappear, 

I don't know if this is a new thing for you, or if it's been around for a long period of time. If it's the latter, ask your doctor :)
They look like closed comedones. That‚Äôs when the acne is sort of under your skin and doesn‚Äôt come to a head. Salicylic acid is usually pretty good for taking care of those. You couldn‚Äôt try something like Stridex pads in the red box a couple of times each week to see if it helps. 
I have this too! I think mines milia??
Same I stopped trying to drink milk despite everyone say it's "good for height/calcium" whatever.  I always get stomachache anyway even if it's lactose free
Cutting out dairy was a blessing
Yes!!!! 
I don't eat dairy and I still have awful skin :( 
Yes, the flakiness can go away, although it is unlikely to do so on its own. Experiment with different moisturizers, or maybe go to a lower concentration of BP. 2.5% is just as effective as 10%, but less irritating. 
Yes, as your skin gets used to the dosage it goes away, of course with the aid of moisturizers, I recommend moisturizing as much as you need, it can't hurt as long as your moisturizer is acne friendly.
Marshalls has a lot of good and inexpensive options
Antibiotics only help with bacteria. If you have hormonal acne a medication that is intended to kill bacteria will have no affect on the  chemicals (i.e.) hormones in your body, will it? Hormones are not bacteria so a medication for bacteria will have no influence.

Absolutely do not go on an antibiotic. All this will do is create a resistance to antibiotics in the future. Some of the acne on your face that is bacterial may subside, but only while you are taking the medication. Once you go off of it, the acne will come back, and it will come back with a vengeance because now you have also killed off your body's own beneficial bacteria whose job it is to kill off harmful bacteria. 

If you need real suggestions for products feel free to PM me.
One time I had a bad cyst on the bridge of my nose near my eye that made my eye swell up like someone hit me. Needless to say I went to the dermatologist and they took care of it for me. I know they gave me a cortisone shot and drained it. I'm not sure what lancing is? It was painful but it was flat within a few hours. It took much longer for it to actually heal though and for the scar to fade. It was totally worth it!
No, but I do get high frequency treatments from an aesthetician in my area and find them very effective for preventing cysts from forming and decreasing healing time (by at least half if not more depending on how often I ge them). I *highly* recommend getting high frequency treatments regularly if you have cystic acne. Cheap, fast, and effective when done regularly (I go 1 to 2 times a month normally, once a week (or more) if I get a bad one).
This is just one data point, but I use cetaphil gentle cleanser, and I really like it. I live in a region with cold winters, and my face cracks really easily‚Äîthis stuff is the only cleanser I use in the winter because my skin doesn‚Äôt dry out!  

It doesn‚Äôt feel like a traditional soap when you use it‚Äîit‚Äôs very mild, almost like a lotion that washes off and leaves your face feeling clean. 
I‚Äôve used Cetaphil before and didn‚Äôt like that it doesn‚Äôt get that foamy. I‚Äôve used Cerave foaming facial cleanser for years, as recommended by my dermatologist, and love it. 
Any cleanser that foams is going to be too harsh. Avoid cleansers with sulfates because this will dry your skin out. If you have oily skin, this will cause your body to compensate for the loss by making more oil. The problem when your body makes more oil in haste to replace the oil that was stripped is that the new skin oil (sebum) will be high in oleic acid. Oleic acid is inflammatory and clogging. 

I would recommend an oil-based cleanser because this will not strip your skin of its natural oils, but will dissolve the excess oils on your face.

A good rule of thumb is to:
1. Not trust manufacturers labels. It will say gentle because if it said "harsh stripping cleanser" no one would buy it. 
2. If your skin feels dry, or "squeaky clean" thats bad. You lost your own skin oils which are needed for your skin to protect itself, and now your body will make clogging oil to compensate.

Also over cleansing is a main exacerbator of acne. 
I use the Gentle Skin cleanser twice a day and I love it. I have very acne prone skin and this does not break me out. A while back I damaged my moisture barrier via over exfoliation, and this stuff never felt stripping and it didn‚Äôt sting my face (unlike their Daily Facial cleanser, which stung horribly). It doesn‚Äôt lather or foam, but my skin still feels clean after using it. It certainly works for me!
Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser has changed my skin for the better, 100%. 
It itched and stung my skin when my eczema flared up. Try to get a sample to try beforehand.
Can I recommend a cleanser that is equally as inexpensive and also found at drug stores - Seba Med Gentle Hydrating cleanser. I have tried so many cleansers and all have my skin adverse reactions. This one returned my skin to its natural PH balanced state and didn‚Äôt leave me dry or flaky - but still gave me a clean feeling. If you‚Äôre using drying products on your face, a gently Hydrating cleanser and a good moisturizer are a must!
Cetaphil is the product I‚Äôve used for around two years. I‚Äôve used it through seven months of Accutane and different acne meds since. It‚Äôs great because it doesn‚Äôt dry you out but it still cleanses nicely. I pair it with the moisturizer from them too as that works beautifully on my skin, even in chilly and dry Maine winters. 
This is very insightful. I‚Äôm curious to know what your routine is? What specific products you use to maintain your skin acne free. Also, in your opinion, how much does diet affect your skin? Of all the things you mentioned, how would you rank them in order of importance? 

Thanks!!!
Can you name the cleanser you used ?
Thank you for the advice! Can you tell me where you can purchase these certain types of exfoliates and cleansers? I read your routines in the comments, and I'm curious; do you use sunscreen INSTEAD of moisturizer? I noticed you said moisturizer dries out your face, but I don't seem to have that issue. Could it be the type of cream I'm using?

AND last question, I have a sunscreen/argon oil in one spray, but it seems to make my face even more oily. Could it be that I'm using too much at once? Thanks again!
Daily chemical exfoliation is SO IMPORTANT when it comes to adult acne. Until I introduced glycolic acid I was having no luck with my adult acne. 
Doxycycline is an antibiotic, so it is improving your acne by killing the bacteria that is causing it. The problem is you don‚Äôt want to take antibiotics unnecessarily because it‚Äôs killing all the bacteria in your body including the good and necessary ones in your gut. 
I‚Äôve been on spironolactone for about 2.5 years and it changed my life within a few months. I hardly break out at all, only a little here and there with my period. My new dermatologist wants to wean me off of it because she doesn‚Äôt like the rat tumor studies associated with it. I‚Äôm not very concerned about that based on my own research, but I agreed to start cutting my dose in half to see what happened. After reducing my dose of 50mg to 25mg for a month, I already felt like I broke out worse than usual during my period. Maybe it was all in my head, but I know my skin and typical breakout patterns pretty well by now. I started taking 50 again and am going to tell my doctor that I‚Äôm not comfortable being taken off of spiro yet. I love my skin right now and am so scared that changing anything about my routine will mess it up. 
Both of these medications alter the way your body works. Spiro alters your kidney function (flushing water out while retaining potassium). Doxy alters your gut biome (killing bad + good bacteria). It's hard because these medications really do work for acne, but its up to you whether you're okay with the long term issues they might cause. 

I personally feel that there are always more natural ways to control acne in the long run. Spearmint tea has been proven to reduce androgens in the same way that Spiro does (albeit at a slower rate) without altering kidney function. Probiotics might do a lot more good for you in the long run than an endless supply of antibiotics. Just food for thought, but I know how much of a struggle it is to question a medication routine that seems to be doing amazing things for your skin. 
Try a Salicylic acid cleanser and a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment, followed by moisturizing. For me BP didn‚Äôt work until I added SA, as the SA unclogs your pores so the BP can really get down in them and kill the acne. Also SA will help reduce redness and inflammation. 
I was so scared to go to the dermatologist, but you have to remember they're here to help you. It's not scary when you finally sit down and talk to them about it. You're throwing money down the drain and if you just go ahead and go, you'll be wondering why you didn't do it sooner. Dermatologists won't put you on Accutane first rattle out of the bag, if that's what you're scared of. My derm tried a lot of different stuff with my very very stubborn acne, and Accutane was never even mentioned. I got put on an antibiotic routine with Tretinoin applied every night and my acne was gone within two weeks. The anxiety of your first appointment is so worth it when you finally see your clear skin. I wish you the best of luck :) 
In the same boat with you right now.. I know I really should go to a dermatologist but I'm ashamed and embarrassed
I saw 7 dermatologists. Thats right, 7 different doctors. I was on Accutane, Humira, Predinsone, Bactrim, and about every anti biotic that exists. I tried every cream, retina, pro active, tazorac...etc. None of them cleared my skin. I cleared it when I started researching the link between diet and acne myself. I subsequently drastically altered my diet and lifestyle. Discovering how much food impacts your health changed my life completely, and now that Im clear Im almost grateful that acne got me into functional health. 
I didn‚Äôt really get a choice in whether or not I was going. I was only 13 when I was put on Acutane BUT the derm was right in prescribing it. I vote you head to a dermatologist, and if it doesn‚Äôt work out, let them know. They always need feedback and it‚Äôs their JOB to help you.

22/female

Currently:

Both AM and PM routine: - wash with Alba Acne Dote Deep Pore Wash - wipe my face with a cotton ball sprayed with lush tea tree toner water - apply Yes to Tomatoes Daily Acne Repair Treatment - apply clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel

About once a week I'll use Lush Ocean Salt to exfoliate

My skin is full of deep/clogged pores which I can't ever seem to get rid of

Any help/advice is much appreciated
I used to use Lush Sea Salt scrub on my body and it even felt rough for that. Your face may be way too sensitive for that scratchy, chunky sea salt!! Things that helped to improve my skin include mixing together tea tree oil and jojaba oil to get rid of acne and then using rosehip oil as a moisturizer to get rid of scars. Tea tree oil can also be used as a spot treatment. I went to a dermatologist about a month ago and got on oral and topical medication and my skin is slowly improving - maybe try going to a dermatologist if you haven‚Äôt done that yet. I know that there are also (pricey) facials you can get done to deeply clean out your pores and get your skin to start healing. Maybe look into those too. Try not to pick and try to stay confident! :)
looks hormonal to me (cheeks and chin usually are). Spearmint tea is great. But derm would probably prescribe something like spironolactone. Good luck! 

You need to go to a dermatologist. OTC medications and lifestyle changes can only go so far. 
If your doctor recommended it to you, give it a try! If it irritates your skin do not use it but you have to try. Also any face wash can irritate your skin if you leave it on too long or use too much 
This is what I used to use!! It'll clear you up in no time! It didn't make me dry and flaky, but the Clindamycin does sting a little. 
Most of them are scars, so surgery would help those, but accutane would also help all your other pimples may even help the scarring 
Laser treatmeant for the scars it's about $300-$500 though.

it looks like acne
Not sure what‚Äôs causing it but I have some tips on how to get rid of it:

For your skincare routine: (3 steps) 

CLEANSER: Go for a cleanser that has an ingredient called Salicylic Acid (will say on the front or on the back under medical ingredient). Salicylic acid basically unclogs your pores, and makes pimples less red and inflamed. If you‚Äôve used a product with this ingredient before or you know you have somewhat tough skin, go for one that has 2% Salicylic acid. If you‚Äôve never used it before and have sensitive skin go for one that has 0.5% Salicylic acid.

SPOT TREATMENT: Go for a spot treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide kills the bacteria in your pimples. I recommended using a Salicylic acid cleanser as without it, your pore will he clogged and the benzoyl peroxide won‚Äôt be able to go deep enough. Avoid the ones that have 10% benzoyl peroxide. It‚Äôs just unnecessary as lower percents work just as well. So I recommend going for a 2.5-5%. 


MOISTURIZER: It‚Äôs really up to you here. Just make sure it specifically says ‚Äúnon comedogenic‚Äù or ‚Äúwon‚Äôt clog pores‚Äù or something of the like. Make sure to let the spot treatment completely dry before putting on moisturizer.  


Now where to buy these? You can just go to your local drug or grocery store. The brand I recommend is Clean and Clear. I would stay away from their premade routines/packages of 3 as they only have 1 acne fighting ingredient, not both. Each product of theirs sells for $12 CAD. 


Note: Your skin will be irritated, dry etc. At first as your skin is getting used to the new ingredients. Make sure to moisturize and tough it through the first 1-2 weeks of irritation! Also, if the benzoyl peroxide isn‚Äôt working, I recommend trying the product ‚ÄúGrease Lightning‚Äù from Lush. It‚Äôs main ingredient is tea tree oil, which basically acts as a mix between Salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (it‚Äôs a spot treatment). 

Feel free to ask any questions!
Is there any reason in particular that makes you hesitant? Dermatologists are specialists in skin so they definitely know what they‚Äôre doing when they prescribe items. Diligence and routine is key and it may take months before you see results. 
There could be swelling that could keep it slightly raised
Bruh i got acne at 12
Don't forget to pop the whiteheads
I bought an aloe vera based moisturizer and I noticed also that it worked well on me. Other stuff don't hydrate my skin enough.
I also bought an aloe vera toner (to use after  cleaning my face with micellar water) to see if this could help too


If I were you, I would apply it after cleaning my face day and night.
Do you use another moisturizer ? Is it sticky ? If it is, I would live it on for a while while eating breakfast for example (If I need to go to school/work but I would live it on if I stay at home that day) and then wash it off with water only and put my moisturizer. In the evening I would let it sit the whole night. 


Whatever method you choose, keep at it for 2-3 months and see how your face reacts.
If you get new pimples stop
Hey that's really horrible and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. There's the loads of advice in this sub's top posts on preventing acne but you've already seen a derm and gotten prescriptions, you just need the chance to use them and time for them to work.

Skin takes a long time to heal, and it sounds like your mom really isn't getting that. Let alone the weird obsessive thoughts she's having. Might want to try posting this to r/relationships for advice on how to get her to calm down?
Your mother is abusing you. Tell someone.
That's pretty harsh... any way you can tell her how awful she's acting? To leave you alone?
This sounds miserable :( I‚Äôm sorry you have to put up with this. I feel like a solution may be that she needs to be educated on what you are going through. Has she been to the dermatologist with you? Maybe having her sit through an appointment with you and hearing what an actual doctor has to say may convince her that her methods are not helping and that you need to be able to follow through with a prescribed treatment for once. 
How old are you? Your mom‚Äôs behavior is NOT normal or okay. And it needs to be addressed ASAP. 
I would suggest telling your online dermatologist from curology that you aren‚Äôt totally satisfied! A lot of people go through a couple prescriptions before they‚Äôre happy with their skin.

Just started taking probiotics twice a day about a month ago... skin has never been more clear... whether this is due to overall better lifestyle changes or just the probiotics is still TBD.. regardless I think the pros heavily outweigh the cons and that probiotics should be a necessity for everyones supplement routine ! 
[removed]
Oh they took away my link. Check out simple skincare science‚Äôs blog. He has a great article on probiotics for acne. 
I‚Äôm scared that this will dry out my skin :(
Careful! A dry face will cause your skin to produce more oil to compensate, so unless you‚Äôre using moisturizer you can break out more. 
Anything with AHA and BHA should make them smaller! Also try niacinamide.
I think benzoyl peroxide would be a great start! :) I‚Äôm not sure what your current routine is, but I would probably start with a routine that looks something like this. 

AM
- Rinse face with water
- Moisturize
- Sunscreen 

PM
- Gentle hydrating cleanser
- 2.5% benzoyl peroxide treatment all over
- Moisturize 

I would slowly introduce the benzoyl peroxide every other night, even if you think your skin can handle it. You could also try putting the BP on AFTER your moisturizer. It will still be effective but it will lessen the initial irritation. Once you have this routine down you can start slowly adding other products to deal with acne scars/hyper-pigmentation if that is a concern of yours. 
I've been using a salicylic acid cleanser + benzoyl peroxide cream combo for years.

Money saving tips: Always buy generics, only the active ingredients matter. You don't need Neutrogena when Target brand works fine. If you find after your first tube of benzoyl peroxide that you're having good results, order from Amazon. You can get a 3 pack for the same price as one tube at the pharmacy.

Bleach warning: benzoyl peroxide reduces redness in your skin, and it also bleaches anything and everything you touch. Get dressed first, then put it on, then wash your hands with soap or you'll bleach your towel. At night you pretty much have to use white sheets or you'll bleach your pillowcase.

Dryness: when you first start this your skin might dry out. Use a bit less cream and if needed buy a non-comedogenic moisturizer like Cetaphil. 
Not sure what‚Äôs causing it but I have some tips on how to get rid of it:

For your skincare routine: (3 steps) 

CLEANSER: Go for a cleanser that has an ingredient called Salicylic Acid (will say on the front or on the back under medical ingredient). Salicylic acid basically unclogs your pores, and makes pimples less red and inflamed. If you‚Äôve used a product with this ingredient before or you know you have somewhat tough skin, go for one that has 2% Salicylic acid. If you‚Äôve never used it before and have sensitive skin go for one that has 0.5% Salicylic acid.

SPOT TREATMENT: Go for a spot treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide kills the bacteria in your pimples. I recommended using a Salicylic acid cleanser as without it, your pore will he clogged and the benzoyl peroxide won‚Äôt be able to go deep enough. Avoid the ones that have 10% benzoyl peroxide. It‚Äôs just unnecessary as lower percents work just as well. So I recommend going for a 2.5-5%. 


MOISTURIZER: It‚Äôs really up to you here. Just make sure it specifically says ‚Äúnon comedogenic‚Äù or ‚Äúwon‚Äôt clog pores‚Äù or something of the like. Make sure to let the spot treatment completely dry before putting on moisturizer.  


Now where to buy these? You can just go to your local drug or grocery store. The brand I recommend is Clean and Clear. I would stay away from their premade routines/packages of 3 as they only have 1 acne fighting ingredient, not both. Each product of theirs sells for $12 CAD. 


Note: Your skin will be irritated, dry etc. At first as your skin is getting used to the new ingredients. Make sure to moisturize and tough it through the first 1-2 weeks of irritation! Also, if the benzoyl peroxide isn‚Äôt working, I recommend trying the product ‚ÄúGrease Lightning‚Äù from Lush. It‚Äôs main ingredient is tea tree oil, which basically acts as a mix between Salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (it‚Äôs a spot treatment). 

Feel free to ask any questions!
That looks almost fungal. If you were to use an OTC zinc ointment/ antifungal cream or even Head and Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo daily for a couple weeks it could be gone entirely, or at least seem less raised/ irritated.

i have the same problem,, have you had any luck recently?
Killer jawline bro
Ignore my hair. 
This is really mild and you shouldn‚Äôt worry. I would suggest that you go to a dermatologist and see what he/she thinks is right for you. I prefer u do that because i wouldn‚Äôt want your condition to get worse just in case 
It should probably go away with time if you don't breakout anymore.

you can also use papaya and turmeric :)
Not that noticeable tbh but if it really bothers you, laser treatment helps. I think it's about $309-$500
Thanks guys!
ive heard to always use a light moisture with spf if possible. anyways i wake up with so much oily skin you can fry an egg on it. i think its due to certain meds im taking. but i always wash with cetaphyl wash and their lotion. try not to wash so much in a day. i wash my face two three times a day. and use those napkins at mcdonalds as oil blotters throughout the day. if you overdry your skin your oil glands could kick into overdrive 
bp complelty cleared my forehead
If you want to try stimulating collagen production, I would suggest getting a dermaroller instead of using random sharp tools that damage your skin more, especially since they are not made for skin. You can find videos and advice on dermarolling on YouTube.

Definitely let the area heal before you mess with it again. Put a triple aid like neosporin on the scab & use a blister bandage (hydrocolloid). Ask your doctor about a prescription retinoid if you are really concerned about scars. It helps skin cell turnover. Also try to stay out of the sun and wear SPF if you can because sun damage can increase redness and make scars worse. Good luck to you!
The manner in which your acne is localized in a specific area can be very telling to a dermatologist. I had recurring blemishes around my mouth and my derm determined it was fungal. I‚Äôm not saying yours may also be fungal, but it does look like it could be from something in particular.
Try putting hydrocolloid bandages on hem to suck the puss out. I prefer corsx pimple patch. 
The pattern looks like impetigo to me. You may need antibiotics to heal this. Hang in there!
Really localised around the nostrils, seems kind of odd. Do you pick OP? What are you doing to exfoliate?
staph naturally lives in a lot of our noses and can cause similar pustules. wash your hands after touching your nose or blowing your nose. don‚Äôt idly pick at your nose and the touch your face. 
My breakouts were similar, they stopped when I cut sugar, even fruit. Im not sure why but its worth a shot
Nixoderm,cosrx acne patch, and some topical antibiotic and glycolic toner by the ordinary really helps me
I saw a post very similar to this and they said they fixed it by fixing their sinuses. It was an infection of their sinuses that was coming on to their face. Do you have sinuses infections?
It really does! Especially when you think about all the oil, hair products, etc that get on our pillowcases just from everyday use. 
It wouldn't hurt to go especially if it's covered through your insurance. Maybe your dermatologist can give more insight on to what caused the flare up and what to avoid in the future so that you don't get it again or have it progress. 
Well, was the cyst the reason you decided to go to the derm? regardless, just explain this situation to the derm, if you go, and the derm should get that.
One day I realized that consuming any kind of dairy (milk, yogurt, ice cream, cheese etc.) in any amount made me break out on my chin with cystic pimples.  A few days after I stopped consuming dairy I broke out on my chin but it cleared up quickly and I haven‚Äôt broken out on my chin since. It‚Äôs been over a month and I‚Äôm very happy with that. I‚Äôm still struggling with the acne on the rest of my face but at least I got one section cleared up!
Everyone is different. I know you're looking for a specific answer, but everyone truly does have a unique set of circumstances, and so positive results can take days to weeks to months for each individual, depending on a ton of variables.

Personally, I eliminated dairy from my diet and gradually saw better and better results over several months time.

 *However*, this did not do the trick. I was definitely still missing something. I have since seen further results after eliminating all grains containing gluten, as well as exercising some serious will power when it comes to satisfying my sweet tooth. Refined sugars add fuel to the fire - they increase inflammation and sebum production, two of acne's best friends. Gluten can increase inflammation in the body as well, which is absolutely something to consider removing or limiting in your diet.

What I'm trying to say is be patient, and don't be disheartened if removing dairy doesn't give you flawless skin. It may be just one piece to solving the puzzle of what will give you clear skin.

Wishing you luck!!

I started this recently and about a month is when I'm seeing improvements. Getting ready to cut it completely after seeing surprising results from cutting ice cream occasionally and milk in my morning coffee. 
you see the diference when you go back to dairy within 2 days I breakout if I eat 2 slices of the laughing cow.

a little  cheese on pizza is okay (once in a while). But feta (with cow milk, not goat) in a Greek salad is too much for my gut apparently
I stopped dairy for 7 months and noticed no difference whatsoever...I guess it all depends on you
It will take some time. This was really long ago but I remember it taking a few months, since all the accumulated "damage" has to cycle out of your pores. You may notice a reduction in oiliness before clearing, though.

Going dairy free helped my chest and back a lot but my face needed additional intervention, although I never went hardcore dairy-free (only cut out whole dairy products like milk and cheese, didn't comb through labels and avoid all ingredients).
Weird 
Bananas are healthy af and don't spike insulin. Eat them whole and you're good. It's probably some other change you made like less dairy. 
exfoliating!!! this helps so much, and use a toner afterwards. get an exfoliating glove for the shower 
My doctor said those are closed comedones and gave me Tretinoin cream, which have been shrinking/bringing them to a head for me!
I used to have that on my forehead and I have some on my cheeks. I found that stridex pads, the ones in the red box, cleared my forehead and is eliminating the amount on my cheeks. Best of luck! 
Please don't use tweezers or any other metal instrument on your face. This is something only professionals should do as it could lead to severe scarring, which will be much harder to get rid of than any type of acne.
I currently use Kiehl‚Äôs oil free wash twice a day and dove men‚Äôs lotion after
Those little bumps are milia, or milium cysts. They‚Äôre very hard to get rid of, in my experience. They don‚Äôt go away on their own like regular acne. Websites advise that you go to a dermatologist or aesthetician to have them scraped/squeezed but if you‚Äôre like me and don‚Äôt have the time or money try pricking them just barely with a sterile lancet (the kind used for diabetes testing) and squeezing them out with tweezers. I am currently trying to remove a few each day because once the area gets swollen I can‚Äôt really get any more out. 

EDIT: I realize now this isn‚Äôt great general advice. I‚Äôm just parroting what I‚Äôve read when I Googled ‚Äúhow to get rid of milia‚Äù and what I‚Äôm trying right now. But everyone‚Äôs skin is different and mine doesn‚Äôt scar that badly, so i shouldn‚Äôt have written this like it will work for everyone. Sorry. 
Is that a study or something or a guess?
Anyone else have their cystic acne get a lot WORSE when they started taking vitamin D? Because that was my experience. 
My vit D was tested and it was very low. My doc decided to prescribe a 50,000 IU supplement to be taken once a week, pretty much indefinitely. My skin has never been so clear. I was attributing it to my new skincare regimen, not the vit D addition, but it‚Äôs possible it made a big difference. Over the course of this year I also maxed out the amount of spironolactone I‚Äôm taking (200 mg daily) but the big difference wasn‚Äôt noted until after the vit D addition.

I did minocycline as well and everything was gone in 3 months. Unfortunately 4-5 months after my treatment my acne came back (it went from bad to mild acne though). After that i did a course of tetralysal but it didnt help at all (my acne gort even worse) and now i'm on accutane. I hope your acne will be gone forever but if it comes back i would start accutane directly.
The aztec clay broke me out even worse with cystic acne. I recommend just sticking to Paula‚Äôs choice 
If you have oil and skin flakes you may have dehydrated skin, and could see an improvement in both after a week or so of using moisturizers.

If you're getting new cysts your current moisturiser may be too thick or applied too heavily. Try to apply a thin layer after your shower and avoid scrubbing your face under hot water.
Sounds like you have dehydrated skin! Your skin is producing more oil to compensate. Do everything you can to repair your moisture barrier‚Äîmoisturize twice daily with hydraloric (no idea how to spell it lol) acid. People have even suggested putting on an occlusive (vasaline or aquaphor) at night. Just keep your routine simple and moisturize! 
I would buy a set of dry cleanser/moisturizer and a set of oily cleanser/moisturizer. I know it‚Äôs a lot of product but then you could use the proper type based on how your skin feels. Just an idea, not really sure. 
I had this same issue with the COSRX cleanser too. The main cleansing agent is a coconut oil derivative, which is pretty comedogenic and might be what's causing the whiteheads for you. I suspected it and stopped using it for a week and my skin cleared up, so maybe try that :) 

What‚Äôs your routine?
Nice !!!
[removed]
Keep on keepin on!
I do the same ! works like a charm 
Everyone be careful when you do this.. If you wash your clothes with fragrance It could potentiate your acne even more
use la roche posay gel cleanser and apply benzoyl peroxide to the acne area each night

Winter can be rough on the skin and especially when you are already dealing with eczema. A few things we have done at home include changing from soap to a sulfate-free and paraben-free body wash. We prefer the charcoal wash when Shinkafa has it in stock. We slather a combo of their body cream with natural SPF and body oil with loads of healing properties, after showering/bath. We avoid chemicals in our personal care. Seems to have worked. Sorry to read about the troubles you are having. Hope you find something that can help. Hang in there. 
Cetaphil is weird. Sometimes I can tolerate it, sometimes it feels like mayonnaise. 

Neutrogena makes a light lotion with 2% salicylic that doesn't block my pores, but YMMV. It's only 5-6 buck though so maybe worth a go?

I'm currently test driving some Kiehl's lotions too, so far I like the night cream best. It's really heavy but it soaks in overnight.
I love embryolisse lait-creme concentre and keihls ultra deep facial balm. Applying a serum before moisturiser and adding a few drops of facial oil also really make a difference when you're extra dry. 
I like Cera Ve and Eucerin Redness‚Äô night cream (it‚Äôs thin enough to use during the day too). 
I use First Aid Beauty's Ultra Repair Cream and it's easily the best moisturizer I've found for dry acne prone skin (and it's reasonably priced). During the winter, I add a couple drops of Josie Maran Aragon oil at night to help with extra dryness. 
Just listen to your derm man; they know way more about this stuff than you or some random people on the internet.
I had acne.. One thing that stopped it completely.. was simply stopping masturbating.. haven't had any acne since.. Left some scars that im dealing with.. Doing some single needling and derminator.. scars have reduced by 50-80% since i started treating myself.. And I dont use any potions and lotions.  The skin heals itself.. Get sleep.. Sleep is KEY at recovering faster and just keep it at bay.. I cant stress sleep enough.. earliy hour sleep.. 9 pm.. even 8... You're a good looking brah.. Hope any of this can help you.
You really need to have a doctor remove it if you don't want it to come back. Cysts have a sac, and if it isn't removed, it will come back. 
Go to the dermatologist dude,

dont waste your time on over the counter treatments, sure they may work if you get lucky, but i know how much acne affects ones life and its not worth playing that risk. 


Hang in there man. I had it like you but not on my cheek, "just" on my forehead and Chin. I used epiduo ( benzoyl peroxide) and it worked. Didn't have to change diet or go on accutane. Hope it gets better. Good luck!
Go to a derm!!!! I had this type of acne and its gone now! They put me on acutane, and it changed my face! 
Make sure you‚Äôre using sunscreen as apart of your daily routine since you‚Äôre using the benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid! Cerave has a nice A.M. moisturizer with spf 30. I also recommend finding a low ph cleanser and a toner maybe one with glycolic acid. 
Maybe try chemical exfoliation. The Stridex pads in the red box are an inexpensive cult favorite. Only use these a few times a week though.
Getting a curology prescription completely changed the game for me! Either that or see a derm 
Have you seen any improvement so far? It took me about 5 months to see *major* improvements with a similar regimen of benzoyl peroxide gel and salicylic acid face wash.
[removed]
Get into the Cureology regimen, and use the Orange Neutrogena face wash twice a day on your face, AND for your hands before apply your Cureology, and washing your face. AND WASH YOUR PILLOWCASES.
Buy this - use it as directed with a silicon mask applicator. (Can be used as a spot treatment too!)

-Peter Thomas Roth Therapeutic Sulfur Masque
-Erborian precision mask applicator 

You should also consider an oil cleanser - it literally pulls the dirty pore clogging oil out cause oil attracts oil. Shiseido Perfect Cleansing  Oil is the bessssst! Very good for sensitive skin that is dry, oily or combo.

Last but not least, consider trying a dif moisturizer. Most likely you can find something that will react better w you.

Don‚Äôt forget to use a toner!

All the things are avail at Sephora, BUT if you are looking to explore a moisturizer/toner, I suggest going to Nordstrom cause their beauty experts are the bomb and typically trained estheticians :) These peeps and products have helped me more than any derm - wack! 
I would stop using the St Ives. It causes mini teara in the skin and could be spreading bacteria around. That stuff can be pretty awful on acne prone skin. I would try glycolic acid from The Ordinary.
Hello! 
I don‚Äôt think what you‚Äôre experiencing is purging. Purging only happens when you use an active in your skincare routine. (And based on what you wrote, you don‚Äôt have any actives!) 
How long do you usually stick with a routine for?
I would moisturise day and night. Acne prone skin usually lacks hydratation. Do you drink enough water ?

What do you call exfoliating every other day? Once a week is more than enough
DO NOT ever wash your face with st Ives apricot scrub. Not only is it aggravating your acne, it causes micro tears in your skin which leads to premature aging. 
See a medical professional!

Ugh I get these too. No matter what they turn into annoying cysts. The only consistency I found was what I was eating, you can be sensitive to certain foods without actually being ‚Äúallergic‚Äù and it causes symptoms like this when you consume them. 

Best way I keep them under control (since I don‚Äôt exactly know what food is causing, other than it‚Äôs when I‚Äôm not eating my healthiest) is some kind of topical aha/bha- can be a mild astringent or lotion/ gel. If I do end up picking at them, I can‚Äôt usually minimize the size and clear them pretty quickly by icing it and then using a sulphur product to draw it to a head. 

Hope this helps. 
Try putting it on, then wiping the white residue off with wet fingers (assuming it‚Äôs just the edges). Also I just wanted to say, 2.5% works just as well as 10% for most people, but is less irritating! Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre fine with 10% though :)
What I‚Äôve found is that you don‚Äôt want products that GO ON clear. They tend to not fully sink in and it makes your skin look really shiny. Try creams that go on white, but when you rub it in it becomes invisible. I‚Äôm pretty sure Clean and Clear Persa Gel 10 is good. 
ice to decrease inflammation, use neosporin on a bandaid and leave it on overnight. 
I get these from time to time and I've always preferred warm compresses to cold. The heat loosens up the gunk inside so it can shrink or come to a head, you have to encourage it. I've had several derms tell me this. And not to discount the other commenter, but neosporin has always made the surrounding skin of where I've applied it break out more as it's comedogenic. 

Burt's Bees has a blemish stick with tea tree oil in it that works great on cysts and you can apply multiple times a day. But definitely try warm compress (not too hot, don't burn yourself).
Not sure what‚Äôs causing it but I have some tips on how to get rid of it:

Feel free to ask any questions!
I have! I did a glycolic acid peel, it helped me with both, I got it at my dermatologist's office. It helped even out tone (dark spots) a lot. It takes a few days to fully see the results but I recommend!
Yes :) glycolic acid will help with dark spots and acne, salicylic acid will help tremendously with acne, including closed comedones 
I think I'm going to do this, I got rid of most of my acne but my forehead is completely red :(
I did a good handful of chemical peels at my dermatologist. They did help, just not enough for me to keep paying to do them. In my case the improvement wasn‚Äôt enough for either myself or my dermatologist to continue. For others it may have been the holy grail of acne treatment, but I continued to try other treatments. I can‚Äôt speak to any of the at home chemical peel products, other than to say that they are by necessity less effective than a chemical peel performed in a dermatologist‚Äôs office. If you‚Äôve not found something that works well for you yet, it‚Äôs worth a try. I also can‚Äôt speak to dark spot reduction since that wasn‚Äôt a problem I particularly needed to have addressed, but my dermatologist did mention that chemical peels were generally good for that.
Awesome and thank you for your post.  Quick question:

Did it help with the oily skin issue and/or acne?   I am 40 and my acne has moderated a lot, but my damn skin is just so oily.

Thanks.
Hey there.  
Was it suggested to you by a doctor?  
How come you chose the 1300mg one?  
Can you post a picture of it, please? I can‚Äôt find the 1300mg one in my country and I don‚Äôt know if this 750mg one is the one.  
For a 18y/o would two of pills of 750mg be enough?  
Thanks in advance! 
I‚Äôve tried it a handful of times but never consistently enough to be able to give any useful feedback on the experience. Obviously moisturizing after applying the H2O2 is important, unless you‚Äôd rather apply the peroxide for a period of time then wash it off (and even then I‚Äôd still moisturize). Theoretically hydrogen peroxide would suppress the acne bacterium on the skin before it has a chance to cause many nasty lesions, but for moderate to severe acne hydrogen peroxide alone isn‚Äôt going to cut it.
Someone please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but hydrogen peroxide actually doesn‚Äôt kill bacteria! When you get a cut and you ‚Äúclean‚Äù the area with hydrogen peroxide, the fizzing is not actually the death of bacteria; rather, it‚Äôs a chemical reaction due to the bacteria being catalase positive. The fizzing action confirms that there are indeed bacteria in the area, but simply applying HP will not kill any microbes :) again please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong!
Yes, it turns scabs whitish and didn‚Äôt prevent acne. Also, it makes my skin sting and dry. 
Nooo don't use it. This is one of those old wives tales and internet myths that make people cringe!! Don't use it. It's horrid for your skin. 

If you want to help your dark spots, invest in AHA (glycolic acid for example.) You can get a serum or lotion of it, or peels if you research them well 


If you have indented scarring, you need help from a dermatologist 
DO NOT DO THIS THING !  wear sunscreen every 80 min or so if your out and that will help with pigmentation, also corx pimple patches are great while sleeping or just lounging around at home. Use a mild retinol serum or cream, this will help with cell turnover , I think cerave has a good night cream with retinol they also have a cream and face wash with niacinamide which is really good at toning down inflammations.  

Okay! Thanks guys, I will stop with the idea.
Don't do it
Technically you have to pop them to use the patch or poke a hole in them. Because in my experience. If there isn't a hole to the pus, the patch won't suck out anything. But when there is a hole, holy hell do they work! I had a golf ball sized acne cyst on my forehead. After piercing it and putting on patches every night. It eventually disappeared. For smaller pimples you shouldn't need re applications. Maybe one or twice. Put them on when you go to bed and take them off in the morning. Read reviews because some don't work at all. Good luck :) 
Yesss, I put a patch on my acne and whitehads wothout popping and it literally takes the headaway.

Yes they‚Äôre pretty great. But you do have to have some white head exposure for it to actually pull everything to the surface. They‚Äôre phenomenal though. I haven‚Äôt picked at mine in weeks since getting them. 
I can give you a tip for doing this cheaply. Wash your face with a decent facewash and cover your whitehead with a thick layer of Vaseline before bed. In the morning, the whitehead will simply be soft enough to be washed off. Be sure to always moisturize your skin to keep your skin soft so it exfoliates all the garbage instead of building it up in a pimple.
Yeah, I had acne like that on my forehead and it turned out to be fungal. Got a prescription from my derm and it was gone in like 3 days. 
Dickinson's Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner and The Body Shops tea tree oil has helped me calm the little bumps on my face that are too small to pop.
strong glycolic and salicylic peels
Have you thought about looking into whether or not it could be fungal? 

If it is, traditional acne products might not work. You could ask your doctor! 
It's very drying. If you are going to use it, try to use it alongside a very good moisturiser
stridex is better.  I wouldn't use noxzema classic clean if i were you.  Ppl like it because they like the tingling sensation, which is caused by menthol, which is actually bad for your skin.  I actually bought the classic cream last week, and I just found out that its bad... rip

Look into the app Nurx, they can prescribe you BC through the app and offer prescriptions with no insurance for as little as $15 a month.

**Concerns:**

Still have acne, I'm assuming hormonal based off the concentration on my chin. Would love recommendations, whether it's skincare recommendations or lifestyle in general. I'm at my wit's end, will try almost anything.

The acne around my hairline is new, I think it's because I recently switched leave-in conditioners. Anyone have a good leave-in conditioner that doesn't irritate acne-prone skin?
Have you considered birth control for hormonal acne?
Okay you NEED to cut back on the products. I recommended a Salicylic acid cleanser, benzoyl peroxide spot treatment, and whatever moisturizer you want. You can add a toner in there too. 

The amount of acne products you have will cause the reverse effect. You can do a little research into what too many acne products can do. 
Hi. I don‚Äôt post regularly on Reddit but felt compelled to once I realized how drastically my skin improved after experimenting with home remedies. I cannot for medical reasons take accutane or antibiotics. I don‚Äôt know what compelled me to make this, except that I have been experimenting for years with various combinations of things to no avail.

This is like... the cheapest, most simple recipe. I just boil a cup of water, pour into a cup containing one bag of chamomile tea and a teaspoon of sea salt. Let steep overnight. I keep this in a small glass jar in the fridge and apply like a toner with a cotton ball on my face at night before applying moisturizer and in the morning under moisturizer and makeup.

I kind of kept telling myself this was just another throwaway remedy. But I took the photo on the left in March 2017. The photo on the right is from December 2017. I don‚Äôt get multi-headed puss-filled whitehead clusters, and when I do get a zit it goes away immediately.

It feels too good to be true, after years of struggling with adult acne.
Loooking good
First I want to say congrats that's incredible.

However, I feel obligated to say this will work but because its antimicrobial which can have an effect on acne, however I wonder if this is sustainable over a long period of time. I'm referring to the salt not the tea. If you can include more hydration and moisturizer with this to counteract the dryness over a long period of time, what does your skincare routine look like out of curiosity?
Great results!
How long did it take you to see results, though? Sometimes I wonder whether I quit things too soon..
[removed]
I believe that moisture and proper pH balance really is important in the struggle against acne. When I started using highly moisturizing Asian beauty products in my regimen, my acne completely healed. The main toner that seems to keep my skin happy is the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner. 
Hello

So, I tried to use your method for a week but I got new pimples.

I thought that I could use one tea bag and bottle it up for the week, but I read the same experiment with green tea on acneestein and the guy says that you have to repeat the toner every day because the stuff contained in green tea are only effective for like 6-8hours so I expect camomile to be the same.

Also I bought a new toner and ate a little bit of dairy. I stopped using the toner to see if that was the problem and I'll pay more attention to dairy too.

Last night I made some tea let it sit a bit and applied it. This morning some pimples dried out.

I'll update you in a week or 2 :)
I mean at this point you could try drinking lots of water, like to the point where your piss is clear.
[removed]
Accutane has been amazing!
Antibiotica?
Have you tried going dairy free?
if you don‚Äôt feel like you need to take it, don‚Äôt do it, especially since you say your acne is pretty mild. usually people take accutane for mod-severe acne. and definitely the side effects and warnings of the drug are pretty disconcerting, too... if i were you, i wouldn‚Äôt even bother with it
I'm on accutane right now. I'm on month 6, way over my cumulative dose. I started with severe acne, and I still have mild acne. I think it works less well on mild acne ironically. Anyway, if your acne doesn't bother you, you really shouldn't go on it. 

My side effects right now: chapped, cracked lips. Sides of my mouth are cut open and infected, they are chronic wounds bc no matter what I apply they break open when I open my mouth. Dry, red, swollen eyes. Joint pain and stiffness. 
Ask about tretinoin (also called Retin-A).
Don't do it if you have any doubts, the side effects are scary for someone that has never been on it. I'm in the same boat except I've already been through one cycle when I was a teenager and suffered no side effects besides dry lips. I'm going to go another round so I can stop taking Tretinoin and hopefully that will be the end of it all.
I use the Mario Badescu drying lotion and I‚Äôve found that it works really well! I‚Äôll put it on any pimples I have before bed and they are usually gone or significantly smaller when I wake up
Benzoyl peroxide worked for me
I think you can get them at the drugstore
Make sure you exfoliate, or no spot creams will be able to go deep enough to clean the pimple. Go for a Salicylic acid face wash to do this, and for spot treatments I‚Äôve found any benzoyl peroxide Clean and Clear one works for me ($12 CAD at drugstores)
I think I have a somewhat similar situation where I have this dark red blackhead under my eye. When I squeeze it, a small bit of sebum comes out; the rest is a bloody fluid. It doesn't go away. 
Same. Let me know if you find an answer 
I use cosrx pimple patches on pimples that I pop before I go to bed. It sucks out the pus and most of the time, the area will be closed by morning. I do use a comedone extractor to pop them to limit how much scaring I get after 
Weird. I had something similar happen to me. I was taking these daily gummies that are biotin ‚Äòvitamins‚Äô for skin, hair and nails. I noticed my nails and hair felt great but my skin was breaking out really badly. Didn‚Äôt happen all at once, but it was more of a gradual change. Previously I had no acne issues.... Anyways, I asked my doctor about the issue and she said that if my skin change was a result of the biotin vitamin, a reaction would have happened a lot sooner. My doctor said she didn‚Äôt suspect the biotin gummy as a cause of the acne. I stopped taking the biotin but my skin remained problematic so the doctor put me on Differin. Skins finally getting better, but it‚Äôs taken a few months. 

Not sure if helpful. 
The problem is they overload it with like 2000% + the daily value amount which is overkill. The same thing happened to me, I recommend taking a Vitamin B Complex that contains 100% the daily value so you don't go over, and that's only if you aren't already receiving them in your daily diet.
Do you pick your nose a lot or trim your nose hairs? There's an infection that's pretty common to get in that exact spot from both of those things. Generally goes away on its own, but if it's recurring, a doctor can give you an antibiotic. 
Show us the kitty..Just for scientific purposes of course 
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my cat or the fact I‚Äôve been growing my hair out, my hair touches my forehead all day and is usually itchy for some parts of the day at school. I have a feeling it‚Äôs a combination of my hair touching my forehead and maybe my cats dander in my hair or something 
It's most likely from your hair touching your face. Try keeping it away from your forehead and see if it makes a difference. I'd say it's cat dander if you had it in other spots of your body but the forehead is one of the last places cat dander would get lol unless you rub heads. 
We have all been there! Whenever I break out I feel awful about myself and get real down in the dumps. Appearance is important to everyone. 

The way I feel better about myself is I remind myself that other people around me are going through the same thing and that more often then not I am not even fazed by their acne because I have a relationship with my friends and other peers for who they are themselves. Think about it. When your friend or the girl sitting next to you has a few pimples do you treat them any different? At the end of the day they are still your friend and the acne fades away. 

Also I get myself into a skincare routine so even if it doesn't help my skin much I am in the mindset of improving my skin. It keeps me on my toes when I can see improvement here and there. This too shall pass and don't be self conscious with your girlfriend she likes you for who you are. Don't let your acne get in the way of your relationship! Acne is something everyone experiences at least once. If you keep consistent with your dermatologist things will get better! Wishing you the best!
:(
I know how you feel, I am on accutane too and I feel terrible, it's my 3rd month and it's getting only worse. 
Anyway, diet may be your problem. I made some allergy tests and it turns out I can't eat gluten, milk products, soy, bananas, eggs and tomatos. I think you should do allergy tests as well. 
Be strong!
hang in there bud, it really does get better over time. have patience.

It might sound dumb , but if your using a lot of product, try to minimize or even quit using it. Go natural, just water and moisturizer.
Not everyones the same obviously, but it really helped me get less acne
Ps. try drinking less milk, it can really fuck with your skin.
Depression causes acne well fuck me I'm depressed because of the acne, what a vicious cycle.
The testosterone spike in adolescent is a huge one and many believe the fluctuation during certain days of a girls cycle causes acne due to the levels producing oil/sebum to block pores.  It‚Äôs obviously also a very prevalent cause in adolescent/young males 
Active lifestyle and regular exercise. I believe working out and exercising is very important, a common belief if that sweating helps release bad toxins thought the sweat. Also I believe regular exercise helps with good blood flow and that helps with the health of your skin.
Air pollution. When my daughter was born my husband decided that we had to have air purifiers so the baby wouldn't breathe in "poison" (we live in steel mill country) and because he was a new father I let him do it, I thought it was sweet. Well after a month, I couldn't believe the difference in my seasonal allergies, the quality of my sleep, and the difference in my skin. It seemed to just be less dirty in the morning. We take one everywhere we travel now, it's a must. 
Shouldn't smoking be on the list?
>Ingesting inflammatory foods, (especially foods with a much higher omega 6 content, this includes commercial oils such as vegetable oil, soybean oil, etc)

I had this with peanut butter but I don't know if it was because the peanut butter I was eating contained added sugar. 
I also stopped canola oil. 

I have a question: I buy canned fish sometimes and I can't always find the ones with salt water only soybean. I remove the soybean oil obviously when I eat. Is it still an issue ? I manly eat Omega 3 stuff and I supplement with fish oil .
I don't experiment breakout after eating that fish.


Oh, you forgot soja .

I also heard that a lack of fermented food was bad for acne. I'll try to buy keffir and see if it works.

What's hard water ?

And for the make up, I was neglecting the toner and I thought that micellar water was enough but it isn't
I would add sugar and dairy to the list. Unless the anti inflammatory foods was a catchall. These two I found had the biggest impact on my skin. Sugar increases insulin levels which in turn releases hormones that contribute to hormonal acne. 
 I like Vaniply ointment (by Vanicream) for localized dryness, as a moisturizer/protectant. It has a matte finish, unlike Vaseline, and thus can be worn during the day.
Mario Badescu buffering lotion is the only way I‚Äôve gotten my cystic acne under any control. It‚Äôs $20 at Ulta. I use this in combination with aveeno complexion care face wash, and vitamin c/collagen serum twice a day. Make sure you‚Äôre removing any makeup at night! 

If you‚Äôre having any other acne issues, you should look into the rest of  the Mario Badescu skin care line. They‚Äôre a little pricy, but the work phenomenally. 
I would try ice, but if it doesn‚Äôt improve you may want to ask a derm 
[removed]
Omg u need to see a dermatologist now. If you don‚Äôt have one go see your regular doctor and they can make a referral. If you don‚Äôt get rid of that it‚Äôll permanently damage the tissue, which means you may get frequent cystic pimples there. It can also lead to permanent scarring. 
Went from omnivorous diet to a plant-based one, definitely helped a ton! 
Plant-based is always a good place to start. When I go a few days consuming lots of fresh juices, green fruit/kale smoothies, salads, etc, my face is spotless. Basically, eating fruits and vegetables (mainly vegetables) help a TON. I break out when I have things like candy and white bread.
Dad diagnosed celiac; I tried a gluten free diet and it eliminated my cystic acne (as well as smaller breakouts on face and back). The diet SUCKS so, every time I inevitably slack I end up with a breakout and sometimes a cyst develops. 
Eggs won‚Äôt help with their high leucine content and an ability to increase the enzyme TOR
Went from meat eater to vegetarian and no dairy. I still eat fish though. 
I restricted my dairy and sugar intake(things like cheese, yougurt, ice cream, and sugars like candy, pop) and woahhhhhh did it make a difference. I luckily haven‚Äôt had any painful cystic acne since. Even when I got my time of the month I didn‚Äôt even break out which is normally unusual.
The biggest diet change I introduced and continue to maintain was to stop consuming all alcoholic beverages (I do rarely eat dishes which were cooked using wine or the like). I don't expect most people to go to those lengths and I honestly didn't make the change in order to control my acne, but I imagine it has been a piece of the puzzle resulting in seriously ratcheting down my acne.
Dairy, Sugar, and consuming only foods that my ancestry ate. 
Organic red meat, chicken, dates, fruits that are low gymeic and lots of crusifirous veggies. Drank 3 Liter of water. Almond milk and no coffee or teas. 
Low-carb has an almost immediate effect. 
Pescetarian, only fish
After my third round of Accutane I was kind of expecting it to come back again, but I think a combination of the Accutane and my age(27) has just meant I stayed clear.
[removed]
Nothing beside drinking enough water and 3 cups of green tea a day.
I can't live without cheese... :( guess my face is permanently screwed
Yeah I think eating probiotic yogurt would be better, I would always just grab those yogurt tubes for kids for convenience for work and I'm pretty sure those are full of sugar. I've also been trying to drink more water which I think definitely helps as well.  And thanks!! I still manage to get blackheads on my nose and chin and I'm still trying to get rid of those but mainly the big pimples have pretty much gone away. I've also been trying to drink more green tea as I heard it is good for the skin. What other changes have you made that you didn't mention in your post??
My sister has acne on her forehead everytime she has bangs.

If your hormones are fucked up, try to look at your diet.
No dairy, no soy 

Eat fish 2x at least or supplement with fish oil (Omega 3 only!) . I do both 
Not sure what‚Äôs causing it but I have some tips on how to get rid of it:

For your skincare routine: (3 steps) 

CLEANSER: Go for a cleanser that has an ingredient called Salicylic Acid (will say on the front or on the back under medical ingredient). Salicylic acid basically unclogs your pores, and makes pimples less red and inflamed. If you‚Äôve used a product with this ingredient before or you know you have somewhat tough skin, go for one that has 2% Salicylic acid. If you‚Äôve never used it before and have sensitive skin go for one that has 0.5% Salicylic acid.

SPOT TREATMENT: Go for a spot treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide kills the bacteria in your pimples. I recommended using a Salicylic acid cleanser as without it, your pore will he clogged and the benzoyl peroxide won‚Äôt be able to go deep enough. Avoid the ones that have 10% benzoyl peroxide. It‚Äôs just unnecessary as lower percents work just as well. So I recommend going for a 2.5-5%. 


MOISTURIZER: It‚Äôs really up to you here. Just make sure it specifically says ‚Äúnon comedogenic‚Äù or ‚Äúwon‚Äôt clog pores‚Äù or something of the like. Make sure to let the spot treatment completely dry before putting on moisturizer.  


Now where to buy these? You can just go to your local drug or grocery store. The brand I recommend is Clean and Clear. I would stay away from their premade routines/packages of 3 as they only have 1 acne fighting ingredient, not both. Each product of theirs sells for $12 CAD. 


Note: Your skin will be irritated, dry etc. At first as your skin is getting used to the new ingredients. Make sure to moisturize and tough it through the first 1-2 weeks of irritation! Also, if the benzoyl peroxide isn‚Äôt working, I recommend trying the product ‚ÄúGrease Lightning‚Äù from Lush. It‚Äôs main ingredient is tea tree oil, which basically acts as a mix between Salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (it‚Äôs a spot treatment). 

Feel free to ask any questions!
Never herd of this before in my life, but I don't see why it would be a bad thing. If you need a thin cloth maybe try a paper towel?
If scaremongering is sharing my experience, then so be it. 
When I took accutane I noticed a huge difference in my mood. Before I probably had mild depression but after it worsened. 6 years later and I still feel like affects me. Not that it happens to every one. But it‚Äôs a risk that you take. 
I think it's hard to differentiate between the depression caused by acne, and the depression caused by accutane. I did read a study that said that individuals who had depression prior to taking accutane were less likely to have their depression worsen on accutane. 
Not proven, but it's a potential side effect. One of which has been added to the massive list of potential and possible side effects.

Edit, I have depression anyway and I took isotretinoin (Ranbaxy) which is exactly the same as Roaccutane and it did nothing to my mood. These things are listed as a possible side effect only, not a guarantee. Stop worrying yourself. If after a few weeks you feel depressed, stop taking it. 
It could honestly Just be your hormones changing. As we get older and leave the teen years our bodies are changing. I recommend trying to stay away from eating refined and processed sugars. Buy some stridex pads which should help too. I also recommend going to see a doctor if you‚Äôre able to and talk to them about possibly starting birth control if it doesn‚Äôt seem to start letting up. 
if its deep cysts, shows up around period/stress, skincare doesn't respond to it, around mouht/jaw area
What‚Äôs your gender and age?
Biotin in a multi vitamin won't  contribute to acne, only mega dosing it on its own would. 

The reason why biotin is said to possibly make acne worse is because it's a B vitamin (B7 I believe) therefore it's competing with other b vitamins for absorption, including pantothenic acid, which is naturally protective of your skin. Deficiencies in pantothenic acid can result in acne in those prone to acne. That doesn't mean to supplement pantothenic acid though because it would just cause similar problems. 
 Just stopped taking biotin for this season! So far I haven‚Äôt had any Large pimples. I had at least 4 last week and it was driving me nuts. 
If you are posting a progress pic, please include your routine.
Congratulations! :) You have beautiful eyes btw
You know, because I know it‚Äôs so depressing  to live with a all on red face, I am so happy to see that you‚Äôre done with that. Seriously, congrats 
Amazing girl!!! So happy for you
Dude that's incredible. What is/was your routine?
Accutane?
Your lucky people keeps making fun of my acne and calling me disgusting at least yours is going away
Amazing progress! Loving it!

Do you think Accutane helped with the scarring as well or was that mainly from time passing? My acne is fairly under control, but I am struggling a lot with bright red discoloration and texture issues.
What's the span between these two pictures?
Wow, looks way better now congrats. Did you just let it fade away?
[deleted]
Your skin is glowing! Congratulations!
How long did it take for it to go away
Im going to try
[deleted]
Just started accutane a week ago, so far only mega dry skin and rashes; but I can already see a great improvement! 
Would fuck you anyway 
No routine? Mods please. 
Sounds like you might need to have it lanced. I would try to get an appointment with a general surgeon. You might have a pilonidal cyst. If you do it's a good idea to see a doctor as soon as you can or else it can start to tunnel which is very hard to heal. 

Maybe try a sitz bath with salt until you can see someone. 
Nigga u on ur period 
I used la rochay posay toner and due + moisturiser. It helped me a lot. I read somewhere that this toner slowly removes the top layer of our skin as you use it. So gradually old scarred skin just keep on coming off and new one keeps growing. The new skin that is left open is very sensitive so moisturiser is important. Duo+ acted both as a moisturiser and scar eraser.  Sorry english is not my first language but I tried. Toner can react with some people's skin so be careful about it. But it was fine with mine. Hope it helped. 
I've been using The Ordinary Aha/bha mask product and it's cleared up a lot of my scarring. It's their best selling product and for good reason. Best not to use it more than twice a week however. 
niacinamide! 
I found a cream from Shoppers Drugmart called Retinol Reface. I have found it has really helped with my acne scars. Make sure you use sunscreen because this does make your skin more sensitive to uv rays.
try color correcting your acne marks before putting on the concelear. since you said you had red marks on skin im guessing you're fair skin, so use a green color corrector  so you can cancel out the redness on your face then apply concealer in small amounts to build coverage. This is just a temporary fix but if you want something to help you in the long run start wearing sunscreen spf 50 everyday doesnt matter if it rainy, foggy or sunny. By wearing suncreen you are protecting the damaged skin from turning darker when the sun hits you. Also ask your doctor for retinal A cream 0.025 percent  this will help strip the dead skin which is causing the red marks and help generate new skin cells . PLease wear sunscreen when using this medication because if you dont you will be more likely to develop sensitivity when being in the sun that can cause harmful effects like skin cancer since you are fair to tan skin. 
I‚Äôve been using Pond‚Äôs Clarant B3 Dark Spot cream. I actually really like it and noticed a difference, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting since it‚Äôs only about $7 at grocery stores! I use it twice a day. I also spot treat more stubborn spots with Murad Post Acne Lightening Serum, which has taken a couple of weeks (about 5) for me to notice a difference, but I think it‚Äôs worth the cost and wait. This serum can be really drying so I usually wait until after my Pond‚Äôs cream has soaked into my skin before applying Murad. 
To be honest you should get neither.  To treat your nose, which are much more likely to be sebaceous filaments btw ( can‚Äôt post links but look them up) you should use chemical exfoliation.  An effective way to do this is to use a BHA (beta hydroxyl acid).
Clay mask, pore strips (although satisfying) won't give any long lasting effects and may do more harm than good overall. 
I have these as well but I‚Äôm not sure what they are. I‚Äôm thinking SFs but I have them all over my forehead as well :(
try cutting out ALL ADDED AND refined sugar (fruit sugar is only acceptable) and also dairy (DISRUPTS THE HORMONES CAUSING EXTRA PRODUCTION OF SEBUM OIL) this will help the inflation of the pimples on the forehead . For cleasing get few drops of tea tree oil in a cloth and dilute with water you should then rub it on the forhead NOT HARD VERY GENTLY then apply moisturizer that is light and is suitable for oily skin. Try also increasing your water intake to at least 2-3 Liters a day this will help flush out any toxins. Make sure your lean proteins are grassfed or organic not the kind where animals are fatten up with hormones. Also stop wearing hats this can cause dirt and oil to get trap on the pores causing it to be inflamed.
Dickinson's Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner and The body shops tea tree oil has helped calm those little bumps (i get them a lot around my cheeks). I've also had people tell me that exfoliating helps. Cutting sugar can also help. Most of the time, my acne gets worse when I eat a lot of sweets.
What kind of scarring? Atrophic / hypertrophic / PIH / PIE?
Do NOT dermaroll while on Accutane, and do NOT dermaroll within 6 months of finishing your accutane course. The best thing you can do for your scars is to moisturize your skin and to not touch it. 
Papaya 
If you are tired, go to the dermatologist.
It'll get better don't worry. At 16, your body is going through hormonal changes and your hormones are out of whack. Don't lose hope, you will get through this :)

not cystic.  its an inflamed whitehead.  I had one like that literally 2 days ago.  Just put some BP on it , thats what I did, this morning it had dried up into a scab-like thing and I could flick it off.
