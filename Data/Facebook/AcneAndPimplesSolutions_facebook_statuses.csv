135818293109976_2059500704075049,"PRACTICAL WAYS TO MAINTANING RADIANT SKIN- #MBMB- A lot of people have complained about how hard it is to juggle everyday life plus trying to maintain a glowing skin....they say, it is impractical to take 2 litres of water a day when they are jumping from buses from place to place and on the move hustling and at other times, how difficult it can be to get DIY home remedy materials for masks, scrubs etc and would just prefer a ready-made product to slap on their face and fiam...works its magic...trust me, I totally understand and can relate because I've been there! So how do I make my skincare routine work despite schedules, ups and downs and on the move? 1) First off, see your skincare routine as part of your lifestyle rather than seeing it as a routine a skincare coach asked you to do to get a fine face... When you see it as a lifestyle rather than a routine, it helps your brain process it as your new way of living, rather than a chore, so it is easier to adapt to it and even if you fall short sometimes, you can still shake it off and take up from where you stopped, so see your previous lifestyle giving you bad skin as a bad lifestyle and you need to step up and change your lifestyle to give you the radiant skin you desire, also, taking care of your skin is ultimately taking care of your health as it benefits your overall health and mood, what goes on on the outside is a reflection of what goes on in the inside...image is everything. 2) To make hydration work for a busy person on the move, for a woman, you're in luck, you can dice up different hydrating fruits, keep in a ziploc bag or a ""takeaway"" plate and keep in your bag and when you get the chance, take it off and eat! If you work in an office and have a fridge, lucky you, just put there and leave to chill then eat For men, you can eat some fruits before you leave the house, once you wake up, you can quickly prepare your fruits (which you must have bought the night before while coming from work) by dicing them while other members of your family are in the shower, dice up and keep where you will see it so you don't forget and get to remember when you're already in the cab. Also for men, you can during your break time, get some fruits around and eat during your break time, wash with a sachet of pure water, wash your own hands as well and eat. Or you can just occasionally buy sachet water and drink up. It might seem a bit difficult to adapt to but it can work then it gets easier! Whatever your occupation, you can either make eating fruits or water work, are u a teacher? Get a bag of pure water and keep in your class behind your chair, are you a petty trader in the market, you have pure water sellers around you, so it can work, are you a banker, you have water dispensers everywhere, it can also work or just get your bag of pure water to last you 2 or 3 days and as for peeing a lot, no one can stop you from peeing, you will be flushing out toxins and looking healthier than most and your skin will thank you. Just make sure an hour to closing from work, you stop taking water so you don't get the urge to pee when in the bus on the way home, especially if you live in a population dense city like Lagos with the killer traffic jam, that won't be a nice experience but you see? You can make taking water or taking fruits work whatever your occupation. Just be committed. 3) You can make exfoliation work, I mean, this is the laziest part of any skincare routine, to use sponge twice weekly and at night and use soap and water other days and night..,I mean, if this isn't easy to stick to, I wonder what is? You can choose to give your skin a treat occasionally by switching your exfoliating materials, this week you could use sponge and soap, next week, avocado oil and sugar and the next coconut oil and baking soda, etc, just to keep your skin getting variety. 4) Moisturizing on damp skin is a hack that will make you look glowy and hydrated, regardless of skin type, again, this is pretty easy to adapt to, I understand you will feel a bit mushy when cream mixes with water on your skin but it quickly settles into your skin and you will love the result. For muslim ladies and men who have to perform ablution 5 times a day, that is, partial washing of their body parts before praying, Ladies can carry in their bags travel packs of their creams and sunscreen and slather over their wet skin, in fact, getting to do this atleast twice a day during 2 and 4 o'clock prayers will mean you get more advantage than those who just do this in the morning, your glow will be all over the place, after 4 o'clock prayer, you don't have to do it again for 7 and 8 o'clock prayers since you will still shower and apply night cream. Moisturizing and hydration are key to getting the glowing skin that you deserve, for men, if you layer with serum or body oil and moisturizer before leaving the house, you should still be good, especially if you use body oils, I am a guy and when I'm going out and have already layered by applying moisturizer first then body oil, even if I perform ablution, my skin isn't left dried out, most especially as I hydrate often. 5) For masks and DIY materials at home, you can also make this work, Do you have rice at home? Get some and blend, keep in a dry nylon and take when needed, Do you take oats at home? If yes, get some and blend or take to the public millers and dry mill, if you don't take oats, you can buy, a pack is about 500 and it will last you for close to a year. Do you occasionally eat fried eggs for breakfast with bread and tea? Once you pour the content, keep the shells and scoop the egg white left and apply over your face, you can make this work and use to uproot whiteheads and tighten your pores...if you don't eat eggs often, approach a mai suya and ask for fresh egg shells that he just cracked, put in a nylon and take home to use the egg whites, it's not very ""tush"" but abeg, you must look frosh abi? You can make it work. You just have to get creative. So tell me what challenges you have with adopting healtheir ways to improve your skin and let's brainstorm together what you can do to make it work...as a guy, if I can make it work, then you have no excuse...male or female.

135818293109976_2048642685160851,"JUICING FOR RADIANT SKIN, #MBMB- Hey people! Today, I will be giving out tips on juicing to achieve radiant skin! To achieve beauty and radiant skin is beyond what we put on our skin, when we are afflicted with blemishes, sun burn, acne, hyperpigmentation, dry skin, etc, what people tend to ask is what cream or beauty product to apply that will clear them almost like magic but forget that skincare is not all about what you apply topically but also what you ingest into your body...afterall, you are what you eat right? I've always preached about hydration as one of the ways to get supple, radiant and glowy skin, I've also talked about the practical ways to make hydration work for those who lead busy lives and how to make taking tons of water daily, fun by infusing fruits and vegetables into it. In an extension of that is this topic which is juicing for beauty. This simply means, a cocktail mix of different fruits and vegetables blended to be consumed in other to achieve flawless, radiant skin otherwise called smoothies. Healthy smoothies are great in delivering great nutrients into your cells to rejuvenate weak and dying cells and plump them to give you that glow you need, boost your energy and improve your skintone. Think of your cells like thin, glassy disks of water, when you deprive it of water and nutrients, they shrink and deplete and show on your skin as dehydrated skin drained of colour and looking older than your age but once it gets flooded with a healthy mix of rich nutrients, they plump back to life, become active and show on your skin looking radiant like one whom God has his or her back. Before I give out various ways to juice and what combination of fruits and veggies to juice, let me state that you get the most out of these smoothies when you take them on empty stomach...this is vital in clearing space for the nutrients to go straight to work, so the notion that taking fruits after meal to help digest is actually wrong, once the juice meets with the food you've eaten combined with the healthy bacteria your stomach secretes to help digest your food, it instantly begins to decay thus you begin to belch and feel bloated but when you have your fruits 30 minutes at least before meal, you get the most benefits from the vitamins and nutrients which seaps straight into your cells and leaves your skin looking lovely. So here are different ways through which you can blend your veggies and fruits and drink mostly at night or first thing in the morning after taking water. You can blend and refrigerate to take later but consume all within 24 hours and make another when you need it. 1) Half cup plain coconut water, two frozen ripe bananas, previously peeled & sliced.
One cup chopped pineapple,
One cup chopped mango,
Two cups spinach or kale.
And full avocado butter
optional: 1 Tablespoon ground flax or flaxseed oil. Blend and drink up. 2) Half cup greek yoghurt (unsweetened yoghurt), two chunks of watermelon (those triangle cut watermelons), half cut of cabbage, some water for easy blending, a tablespoon of coconut oil and a dash of black pepper. 3) Four carrots, two cucumbers, kale, handful of waterleaf, one single leaf of bitter leaf, one green apple, a thin chop of ginger and garlic and a squeeze of one lemon, blend and drink up. 4) One pineapple, a handful of red grapes, one squeeze of orange, some lettuce, one small beetroot and a dash of black pepper, blend and drink. 5) Steep a bag of green tea in hot water, get this water and blend with carrots, diced guava, mango, avocado and plum, blend and drink. So essentially, you get a blend of fruits and vegetables and have it blended, the black pepper is to enable the juices seap easily into your cells, the coconut oil is to jazz it up and give you so much energy, including adding its own nutritional benefits. You can add nuts and seeds into it, just get creative and drink up your smoothie to clear skin.

135818293109976_2058563270835459,"HOW TO EFFECTIVELY LIGHTEN DARK BODY PARTS- #MBMB- Dark knuckles, black elbows, dark knees, black bottoms, does these seem familiar to you and have been battling with it? Dark body parts are always distressing to anyone, causing them low self esteem and frustration but do not worry much as there are ways to lighten them to get even with the rest of your body. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, it is vital to know that preparing the skin for whatever product, organic or synthetic is important in achieving great results and how do you prepare the skin? Hydrating a lot and exfoliation and lastly moisturizing. The skin in those dark places are usually harder than the rest of the skin thus our negligence in concentrating on those parts when we exfoliate leads to a build up of dead skin cells which then darkenes because it is of course an accumlation of dead skin concentrated in those areas, so learn to scrub those parts specially when you exfoliate and also slather on creams when you moisturize so it can gradually clear and even out..treat it like a stubborn child always crying for attention hence taking special care of it. Also, if you use lightening products, as dark thighs  are close to the private part making them sensitive areas, DO NOT use products containing harsh ingredients. Your lightening products should contain alternative lightening ingredients like Sepi white, Alpha arbutin, Kojic dipalmitate, or gluthathione, etc as harsh chemicals might irritate those areas and get you skin irritations that might require a visit to the doctor as trapped heat might also aggravate the condition. To lighten dark parts using materials in your home, starting with... NECK- Get 2 teaspoons of Licrice root powder, a teaspoon of turmeric, a teaspoon of powdered milk, enough lightening glycerine to form a paste, mix and apply over your neck, leave for 20 minutes then wash off. KNEES AND ELBOWS- Get irish potato powder, about 2 tablespoons, Cucumber powder or Juice, about 2 tablespoons, a full lemon juice, a tablespoon of milk and a tablespoon of orange peel powder and use to scrub these areas with fingers, leave for 15 minutes and wash off, do this often to achieve even and fair knees and elbows. SUN TAN REMOVER- Get a tablespoon honey, 2 tablespoon aloe gel, 2 tablespoon rose water (or enough to make a paste), 2 tablespoon lemon juice, one tablespoon gram flour, half tablespoon rice flour, mix and apply on darkened areas to remove sun tan. DARK KNUCKLES- Get 2 tablespoon irish potato powder, half tablespoon turmeric, 1 tablespoon baking soda, half teaspoon sandalwood, cucumber juice, mix and apply on knuckles. BOTTOMS- Get 3 tablespoon of oatmeal powder (blend your regular oatmeal into powder), a tablespoon of rice flour, enough lightening glycerin to form a paste, 2 tablespoon castor oil and mix into a cup of yoghurt and apply all over your bum for 15 minutes, wipe off with a towel soaked in hot water then wash off. Do this consistently and it will gradually even out. For faster hacks, once done with the masks, just apply a lightening oil before moisturizer like almond or carrot oil to trap the goodness you've input into those areas. OUR SKIN HACK FOR TODAY- Blow dry your cream with a blow dry mtachine to make it warm then apply over damp skin!

Warts are those rather unsightly skin growth caused by viruses. Most come from the virus HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) which infects the top layer of skin and causes it to grow rapidly creating a wart. They are usually ugly and cause embarrassment to whoever has them especially if obvious. So what are the natural ways to getting rid of them 1) IMMUNITY-Boost your immune system. Since the warts are caused by a virus, boosting the immune system will help your body get rid of them on its own, boost your immunity by getting enough sleep, and taking immne boosters liike vitamin c, turmeric, multivitamins, fruits and veggies. 2) SALICYLIC ACID- The use of saliicylic acid helps to shrink warts and clears it off, you could do this by getting aspirin tablets, crush them, add a little water to form a paste and apply on the warts and do this consistently. 3) THE USE OF TEA TREE OIL OR APPLE CIDER VINEGAR OR GARLIC- you can apply any of these and bandage it with a duct tape to suffocate the wart, doing this frequently will shrink the warts and cause the warts to fall off. 4) BAKING SODA- As with above, you can add a little water to baking soda to form a paste and scoop over the warts, as baking powder is an alkalinizing agent, it will help kill the topical causing virus of the warts and dry it off. 5) BANANA PEEL- Rubbing the insides of a banana peel also helps todimish warts but you have to be consistent with it. OUR SKIN HACK FOR TODAY- To clear wrinkles with items you can easily source at home, get vaseline, almond oil, avocado (oil or butter), egg yolk, mix and apply over your face.",Abdulmajeed Adagiri,1/23/2018 8:14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

135818293109976_2014712108553909,"SPF- IDEAL SUNCREEN FOR SENSITIVE SKIN #MBMB- Sunscreen we have learnt is vital in arresting your looks. It is one single routine that literally preserves your youthful glow and takes it thus far into your older years. In my previous post, I detailed recommendations for sunscreen for those with oily skin and ofcourse, other skin types were asking me when I will post their own recommendation so today's post is for those with sensitive skin. As we can deduce from the word sensitive, products for such people has to be natural sunscreen as they may react adversely to chemical sunscreen. if you're looking for a natural sunscreen to protect your precious skin from the harsh rays of the sun and not sure what products to pick to protect you, here are recommendations for those with SENSITIVE SKIN but before we go on, a breakdown of what natural suncreen is. So, what does ""natural sunscreen"" mean?  When you hear someone talk about a natural sunscreen, there's a good chance they're talking about mineral (aka physical) sunscreen, which is one of the two main types. The other is chemical sunscreen, and they work differently.
Physical sunscreens use ingredients such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, which are minerals mined from the earth (hence the ""natural"" nomenclature). They work by creating a physical barrier on your skin that blocks UV rays from the sun. Chemical sunscreens use ingredients such as oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, and homosalate to absorb UV rays once they hit your skin. Both types get the job done—as long as you're wearing at least SPF 30—but each has its plusses and minuses. Chemical sunscreens need 15 to 20 minutes to start working, so you need to apply them before you leave the house, and they break down and wash off if you're sweating or swimming, so you need to reapply every two hours or whenever you get wet. Chemical sunscreens can also be more irritating to people with sensitive skin. Some people are freaked out by the idea of using chemicals altogether because zinc oxide and titanium dioxide aren't absorbed into the skin, mineral sunscreens tend to be less irritating to sensitive skin, which is why they're often used in baby formulations and since they don’t absorb UV radiation, they don’t break down in the sun the way chemical sunscreens do, but it is still important to reapply every two hours or more frequently if you’re swimming. For most people, the biggest issue with mineral sunscreens is the color. Mineral sunscreens can be white and chalky, and leave the skin looking ashy or pasty but today, many sunscreen producers use micro or nanoparticles in order to formulate lotions that go on clear (or at least clearer). Here are the list of sunscreens for sensitive skin. 1) Supergoop! Skin Soothing Mineral Sunscreen with Olive Polyphenols SPF 40, 2)Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry-Touch Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 3) Goddess Garden Sport Natural Sunscreen 4) Babyganics Mineral-Based Baby Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 50, 5) Promise Organic Baby SPF 30 Sunscreen Baby Lotion. OUR SKIN HACK FOR TODAY- Want clear skin always? Form a habit of not touching your face especially after stepping out of the house, if you must, use a tissue or wash your hands. Your hands carry a lot of germs and bacteria and when u touch your face, the germs rest on your face and get sucked into your pores.",Abdulmajeed Adagiri,1/5/2018 11:35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Buy watermelons and cucumber, kale and different leafy vegetables and store in your fridge but let's work with cucumber and watermelon, take and eat two full cucumbers and a chunky cut of watermelon with 2 cups of water everyday before stepping out of the house and that should get you enough hydration through a day of 9-5 job. Note that you might pee a lot though, So you either cut into pieces and keep in a ziploc bag and take to work or a plastic plate so you eat at work so you don't have to stop your cab driver to pee and get other passengers grunting irritably, lol. Note that these works best before breakfast or 2 hours after breakfast. Never eat fruits after a meal, the popular saying it helps to digest food is wrong, you take fruits and veggies on empty stomach to allow the vitamins seap straight into your cells, taking it immediately after food reacts with the food and starts to rot leaving you belching and feeling bloated.  2) MOISTURIZING- Too tired to shower and moisturize after a long hard day? I wouldn't do this but for a lazy or busy person, you do what is known back in boarding high school as rub and shine, lol, take your soap, wash the parts visible to people, your face, neck, arms and legs, apply body oil or serum on those wet parts and apply moisturizer, leave to sink in and go to bed, make sure to apply lip balm (not lip gloss) to keep lips moisturized. 3) BANISH PUFFY EYES- Use two pillows when you sleep, an elevated head will help the excess fluid around your eyes drain down while you sleep or get  Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Puff Eye Roller and apply around the socket line only. 4) NEVER SKIP SUNSCREEN- No matter how hasty you are to get out of the house, never forget sunscreen, once applied, you're covered and protected from premature aging, try SkinCeuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50. 5) ALWAYS REMOVE MAKEUP- Yes you're tired or lazy or both, never jump into bed with your makeup on, invest in Neutrogena makeup wipe towelettes, this is is also used by Kim Kardashian-West on those days when she's too tired to cleanse, it takes everything off and sweetly too without leaving you dried out. 6) USE NIGHT CREAM- If you have invested in healing moisturizer, you could use as night cream, else you could invest in products containing retinol to heal your body while you sleep, try RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night.

IN YOUR 20s- This is the time to arrest your look and literally freeze it in time so you stay looking that way virtually forever, think Halle Berry, think Nicole Murphy (Eddie MurphyLs ex-wife), Gabrielle Union, then the lead character in the American series Single Ladies season 1, they are mothers (and singleton)who managed to have arrested their 20s look and carried it into their 40s and 50s (i particularly used black women so you can relate), what did they do in their 20s that made them retain that look despite life's ups and downs, kids, being in the spotlight, dealing with breakups, etc? It is SPF...yes, sunscreen, now in your 20s is when to invest in a good sunscreen to protect your skin from damage. Black people tend to believe they are black and black don't crack, that's a lie, granted we have melanin to protect us but it doesn't safeguard it from damage. Sun rays is one of the biggest culprits for the breakdown of the skin's elasticity thus if you see a woman selling wares in the sun plus a lady who barely sees the sun as she goes to work before the sun rises and back after the sun sets, there's a major difference even if both don't necessarily use expensive products. Invest in SPF now so when your friends are 50, you'll be 18, lol. 2) IN YOUR 30s- Layering your moisturizer should be your major rule in your 30s, as your skin produces less and less collagen and natural body oils to keep your skin supple, you need to help yourself by layering, this means, you moisturizer immediately after shower...yes, while your body is still wet, leave to sink in then apply body oils or serum then SPF, yes, layer layer layer, don't worry about looking too shiny or weird, this is one of the secrets of the Korean and Japanese people, just choose your moisturizer based on your skintype and get ones with hyaluronic acids to release moisture into your skin. For daytime, moisturizer goes first, followed by body oils or serum to lock in moisture and at night, body oils or serum first then moisturizer, this is to counteract the effects of a modern and busy lifestyle, healing you while you sleep. Do not forget, lol. 3) IN YOUR 40s- Take enough water, as women especially, as your eggs age and your body starts preparing to shut down fertility and get set for menopause, you need to trick your body into believing you're still fertile, the more fertile a woman...or man, the fresher and younger they look, so take alot of water, invest in collagen edible powder and take often and vitamins and try to steer clear of stress as much as you can. 4) IN YOUR 50s- Here, if youu've been sticking to the rules above religiously, the gains are all too beautiful, google images of Halle Berry and Nicole Murphy to see what you might look like at their age. So here, maintenance is key, add exercise to your routine to keep your blood feeling fresh, eat alot of oily seeds and nuts like tigernut, coconuts, walnuts, cashewnuts, bananas to keep your lady parts (and male parts) moist and feeling like your teens, alot of watermelon seeds, yes, eat watermelon with the seeds and trust me, with all these secrets above, your friends will be asking if you sucked out the souls of little babies to stay young, lol. OUR SKIN HACK FOR TODAY- Follow all the rules above while still young and that will be one hell of a hack.",Abdulmajeed Adagiri,12/29/2017 23:41,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I've spent hundreds on face peels, micro dermabrasion, Obagi products, skin needling the list goes on... with little improvement. I have to tell people about this product I have found called Delishable face oil- it is completely natural, essential oils, homemade and in my personal experience it can stop spots and literally reduce them to nothing over night, it closes pores and has reduced my scarring dramatically. I am NOT a seller of this product I just feel it could really help people and wanted to share as I know how depressing acne can be... I would add that alongside the face oil I have also stopped consuming dairy which I am sure has helped cure my acne long term. I was on lymecycline daily for 18 months... I now don't take antibiotics at all!!! I urge people to try it!! I think it's about £5.50 for 5ml or £10 for 10ml get in touch with Michelle Hinam or find the Delishable page on Facebook/etsy/insta. It has given me so much confidence, knowing I have that bottle to reach for if I feel a bump coming which rarely even happens nowadays! I also put it on before using make up which seems to stop pores clogging foundation.

I was diagnosed with acne Rosacea and had to much yeast on my skin causing demodex mites. My dermatologist took a scraping of my face and I had loads on my skin. Don’t worry everybody has them on there face and you can’t seem them but some people have more than others which can cause skin to break out etc. I have tried doxycycline, lymcycline, metrozindale, financea gel and face wash, dalacin topical lotion, metrogel, mirvaso gel the only thing that helped with my pustules and acne was a cream caused soolantra gel. It is used mainly for Rosacea but it’s now being used for pustules and bumps. I would also recommend looking at allergies and diet as I had a leaky gut causing all sorts of breakouts. I would also look at hormones by having a blood test as this could rule out certain things. I had high testosterone and was diagnosed with pcos syndrome. it may only be that you do generally just have acne but it’s best to rule out any other things as well.",Danielle Chiddy,11/14/2017 20:09,3,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

I went vegan with a focus on fruits, veggies and starch based foods with no oil and keeping fat intake low. I found my skin to be the clearest it ever was. Nowadays I am still eating vegan for ethical reasons and for health, but am less strict on not consuming oil and junk food so I still get breakouts (probably stress related too) and have more scars to heal up.

I had dark spots from where I had bad acne and I've found that Vitamin C Serum is helpful for fading these spots and scars. I would make my own serum for a couple of years because I found it was too expensive to get the one I wanted. So I now have my own brand of Serum for helping with acne scarring and fading dark spots. I've been using this for about 4 months and love it! It's oil free, paraben free, silicone free, alcohol free, vegan, not animal tested, and only has the essential ingredients to be effective.

No one ever warned me that I would not outgrow my skin frustrations.

I thought acne was something that I would struggle with in my teen years and then outgrow. Nope. Into my late 30s I was still struggling with it. And then, suddenly, I found myself struggling with sun damage, fine lines AND acne, all at once! That was when a friend helped me finally crack the code and I have had my skin care under control ever since.

Come on over to my group and grab a free copy of the steps I used to keep my skin under control for good!

Eat more dry fruits 3) Full sun protection is must with black umbrella nd zinc oxide broad spectrum mineral sunscreen 4) shud stop or reduce all sexual activities like sex, masturbation, porn watch etc till cure bcos heavy nutrient loss occurs due to these nd without nutrients ur skin will damage more nd high nutrients is must for new skin generation. So if u want fast result its better to stop sexual activities totally now. 5) Dn apply any cosmetics as it stops the new skin production.

When charcoal goes through a special heating process, it becomes activated, making it more porous. Activated charcoal is known to absorb up to double its weight in impurities. 

The power of activated charcoal helps unclog pores, taking skin beyond everyday clean. As a result, your complexion looks clearer and healthier, and pores appear minimized. 

This Deep-Cleansing Charcoal Mask that purifies with the power of activated charcoal, cleanses the skin, and reduces shine. 79% of women and men confirmed that “skin looks clearer after use. Contains honeysuckle and navy bean extracts shown to target the appearance of skin discoloration and help soothe skin. Suitable for all skin types.

Over the next week or so, I am planning to talk about 8 common steps that lead to acne breakouts. And more importantly, to provide ways you can fight back at each step!

Comment below to be added to my group to follow along! 

8 steps in the chain, means 8 opportunities to stop acne!

Step #1 in the chain:
is the overproduction of sebum by sebaceous glands. This creates an irresistible food source for bacteria, so you definitely want to cut it out as quickly as possible!

You can fight overproduction of sebum by using a gentle skin toner morning and night. Look for one with WITCH HAZEL AND ALOE BARBADENSIS.

Witch hazel is an amazing natural cleanser and anti-inflamatory agent (92% of Acne.org members would recommend it to a friend.) that reduces sebum production and clears out bacteria.

And Aloe has some potent skin-healing properties. It is anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal!",Barbara Cook,3/31/2016 21:09,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0
