Someone introduced me to tweezers and my bumps have dried up on their own. Tweezing takes care of the  hairs from the roots. New growths get weaker and weaker and with time, they won't even come out anymore. Unlike shaving that promotes increase in the hair growth. Get a pair of tweezers and use them consistently.
