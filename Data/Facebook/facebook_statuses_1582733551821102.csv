Learn how to get clear skin with this simple home remedies... 

Aspirin: The salicylic acid in aspirin is a go-to for acne treatments, and the aspirin can dry up pimples and reduce inflammation. To take advantage of its benefits, form a paste by mashing aspirin in a little water, or dissolve four pills in 2 tablespoons of water. Apply it on your face every night

Mint: can help remove pore-clogging oil. To help clear acne before it begins, mix 2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh mint with two tablespoons each of plain yogurt and oatmeal (use a blender to pulverize the oatmeal to powder). Leave the concoction on your face for 10 minutes, then rinse off with water.

Honey: antibiotic properties can help improve acne. Apply a teaspoon of honey to affected areas, or make a mask by mixing 1/2 cup of honey with 1 cup of plain oatmeal and leaving it on for 30 minutes.

Steaming: is wonderful for your skin at any time, but particularly when you have pimples. The steam will open your pores and allow your skin to breathe. This helps get rid of oils, dirt and bacteria trapped in the pores that can cause infection or inflammation.
Fill a large container with hot water and allow the steam to come in contact with your face for a few minutes. Rinse your face with lukewarm water and after drying, apply an oil-free moisturizer.",Betty Vien Etong,2017-12-13 06:03:54,45,13,2,43,2,0,0,0,0,0

1582733551821102_1601637573264033,"#BENEFITS_OF_CHARCOAL!

Charcoal is one of the most disregarded products at home. We only see the need for it when it is time to set fire for Banku.
However, if you really need first aid, charcoal is something you need to have on you all the time. You might not know this but it is one of the most medicinal products you can have at home due to its poison extraction ability.
In case you never gave it much attention, this is the time to do so. Here are *13* benefits of charcoal you never thought about.

1. *#Preventing_Odour*.
Does your shoe smell bad? Just get some charcoal & put it in them. Do you have any bad smell in your room? Drop some charcoal where you suspect the smell could be coming from. Does your fridge or freezer smell? Put a piece of charcoal in it. Do you have strong body odour? Just make a powder out of charcoal & use.
Charcoal is very good at getting rid of bad smell. Ever wondered why your parents always scooped out the ash from the coal pot to pour in the hen coop or toilet before sweeping? That was to get rid of the odour.

2. *#Keeping_Food_Fresh*.
If you want your vegetables to be fresh all the time, just make a solution out of charcoal & leave your vegetables in them. Thank us later.

3. *#Removing_Toxins_From_Food*.
These days, people complain about the use of fertilizers on plants & vegetables, making them unwholesome & poisonous. If you have charcoal, you don’t need to worry about this. All you need to do is leave the vegetables in a charcoal solution overnight & it’ll take care of the toxins. If you suspect any food contains too many chemicals, just drop them in a charcoal solution for some hours & you’re good to go.

4. *#For_Teeth_Whitening*.
If you want to whiten your teeth, pay no attention to all these adverts on whitening chemicals & technology.Just get yourself some charcoal & grab hold of a plantain stalk. Make a powder out of the charcoal, mash the tip of the plantain stalk, dip it into the charcoal powder & brush your teeth with it.",Betty Vien Etong,2017-12-22 05:55:34,39,7,3,37,2,0,0,0,0,0

1582733551821102_1588647124563078,"Uses of avocado oil

•Prevents Sun Damage

•Fights Signs Of Aging

Avocado oil has benefits not just for a sun-damaged skin but any skin that shows the signs of natural aging like wrinkles, dryness, and flaccidity.

Vitamin E and lecithin in avocado help boost the collagen in the skin, giving it firmness.Vitamin E and carotenoids also prevent inflammation and keep wrinkles from showing on the skin.The fatty acids in avocado oil penetrate into the second layer of the skin, moisturizing it well and preventing aging-related dryness and wrinkles.

Just dab some cold-pressed organic avocado oil on your face at night and wake up to hydrated and smooth skin in the morning.

Tip: Mix 2 tsps of avocado oil with 1/2 tsp castor oil for cleaning away makeup. This is a safe and gentle alternative to the harsh alcohol-based makeup cleansers that disturb the acidic balance of the skin.

• Reduces Dark Circles

•Helps Hair Regrowth

Apart from its monounsaturated fats like oleic acid that moisturize the scalp, avocado oil contains vitamin D, which is crucial for the generation of new hair follicles.

Apply avocado oil onto your scalp and massage well.

•Fights Dandruff

•Avocado oil can also cure dandruff caused by psoriasis.

 •Improves Nail.

•Lowers Risk Of Heart Disease

The fatty acids and the plant sterols in avocado oil make it good for people with high cholesterol. 

•Fights Inflammation

The bulk of the fat found in avocado oil is oleic acid. Oleic acid reduces inflammation in the body. 

• Improves Symptoms Of Arthritis

 avocado is the fruit to eat to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis, a painful condition that causes inflammation of the joints. Besides oleic acid, the carotenoid lutein and vitamin E in avocado oil can help alleviate symptoms with their anti-inflammatory properties help lower the risk of joint damage.

•Increases Absorption Of Certain Nutrients

It helps to drizzle some avocado oil on your fruit salads or cook your carrots in",Betty Vien Etong,2017-12-08 10:07:20,38,12,5,38,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ingredients

4tbs of organic unrefined mango butter
1tbs of organic refined shea butter
2 tbs of organic safflower oil
½ teaspoon of arrowroot powder (optional)
5 drops of roman chamomile essential oil
3 drops of bergamot essential oil 

Instructions

• Put the shea and mango butter in a glass or metal bowl inside a pan filled with water on low heat so they start melting slowly.Once melted add the safflower oil and mix well.

•Put the bowl in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the temperature of your freezer. You want the mixture to not be completely frozen but thick enough so it is not liquid.If its a soft paste then its ready to whip!Then take it out of the freezer and start whipping with an electric whip on low speed.
• Add the arrowroot powder if desired. This is optional but will help have a light feeling and texture on the skin. Begin whipping your mixture on low speed until it becomes fluffy. Once the mixture is fluffy, increase the speed to medium until it becomes whipped to the desired stage.

• Add essential oils if desired at the end and whip for 1 min or less.Your butter will have a very fluffy and light consistency, like a nice whipped cream!",Betty Vien Etong,2017-12-14 04:58:30,13,2,0,13,0,0,0,0,0,0

1582733551821102_1599310780163379,"DIY BANANA OIL 

Banana oil is an essential incorporation of various moisturizers, creams, hair masks and scents. It is ideally processed at factories. However, you can also make real banana oil using banana peels at home. 

METHOD

•Cut fresh banana peels into small chunks. Place the chunks in a plastic bag. Gently hit the bag enough times with a mallet to bruise the banana peels.

•Put the bruised chunks of peel in a glass jar and fill with sweet almond oil. The almond oil will help draw out the oils in the banana peel. Place the lid tightly on the jar. 

•Shake the jar then place it in a warm window sill for two weeks. Give the jar a shake periodically throughout the two weeks. If the scent isn't strong enough,

Place a new batch of bruised chunks of banana peels in the oil. Allow it to soak for two more days then strain the oil again, back into the first jar.

•Continue the process of soaking consecutive batches of banana peels in the same oil, alternating the jars, until the desired strength of banana aroma is achieved.",Betty Vien Etong,2017-12-19 12:28:53,17,3,1,17,0,0,0,0,0,0

•Banana oil is good for dry and flaky skin. It deeply nourishes dry skin by restoring the normal PH level of the skin. It also repairs chapped skin and moisturizes the deeper skin layers too.

•Banana oil offers sun protection to the skin as well. It armours the skin against dullness, dryness and darkening caused due to sun exposure. It can also reverse the effects of sun damage alongside preventing them from happening.

•Banana oil is an amazing anti-ageing therapy against premature skin ageing. It reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles on the face. It tightens the skin cells and tissues by triggering the formation of collagen fibers in skin. This ensures that the skin becomes younger, radiant and supple once again.

•Banana oil tones the skin and makes it blemish-free too. Thus, you can flaunt an even complexion that is free of blemishes, age spots and pigmentation with the regular and controlled use of banana oil.This makes your skin tone better than before.
