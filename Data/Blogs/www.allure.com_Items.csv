""Skin cells stick together inside your pores, blocking the opening,"" explains Zeichner. The white you see at the top — hence ""whitehead"" — is the blocked pore. Oil trapped beneath it mingles with grime and bacteria, causing inflammation and the red, swollen bump that ultimately makes a pimple. How to Handle It: Consider salicylic acid your secret weapon. ""This beta hydroxy acid helps remove excess oil and exfoliate dead cells from the skin\'s surface to keep pores clear,"" says Zeichner. Try Clinique\'s Acne Solution Clearing Gel , a two-time Best of Beauty winner that packs both salicylic acid and sea whip extract — an ingredient with skin-soothing properties — to help counteract the dryness sometimes caused by salicylic acid. The formula does double duty: It works as a spot treatment for mild to moderate acne and as a nightly allover treatment for pimple prevention. And since it dries clear, you can wear it to fight zits whenever, wherever.', 'Hormonal Acne What You\'re Seeing: A sudden sprinkling of zits around your chin and jawline. What\'s Going On: Do you tend to get these at the same time every month — say, just before you get your period? Because these are the work of fluctuating hormones, says Joshua Zeichner , a dermatologist and the director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Hormones can put oil production into overdrive, and having an excess of it means that it’s more likely to settle in your pores and cause zits. How to Handle It: Pair two of the best-known acne-fighting ingredients, salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, in the week leading up to your period. (If you\'re feeling bloated, now\'s the time to do it.) The combo can help prevent hormonal acne from happening in the first place. Zeichner suggests following a salicylic acid wash, like fan-favorite Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Pink Grapefruit Facial Cleanser ($7), with a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment, such as Murad Acne Spot Fast Fix ($22). If you\'re still seeing zits, ""visit your dermatologist to discuss prescription options, like birth control pills, oral spironolactone — which blocks oil — or topical Aczone 7.5 percent gel,"" says Zeichner. ""It\'s shown to be particularly effective in adult women without causing irritation."" Oral contraceptives level out those hormone fluctuations, keeping your oil production normal and your skin clear.']",e0c9050672ba9b5ad5f52f4c25bf0d5760c4070f,a1f1-4db4-aeed,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.allure.com/gallery/the-best-treatments-for-every-kind-of-acne

['2018-03-24 00:00:00'],"[""But First, a Little Background on the Microbiome Fueling the probiotic skin care movement — the raison d'être for our vital blanket of bacterial goodness — are the native bugs comprising our skin’s bustling microbiome. There are more than one trillion bacteria living — crawling, snacking, metabolizing — in and on our skin, representing roughly one thousand distinct species. These essential bugs exist to fight infections, thwart environmental damage, boost immunity, regulate pH levels , and keep our skin plump and dewy. (Here’s where you run and dump all your miscellaneous antibacterial wipes and gels into the trash.) They also share a complex connection with the vast colonies of microbes inhabiting our intestines — so much so, that exemplary gut health has become a sort of beauty goal of late. It’s currently the insider’s secret to clear, luminous skin — and the driving force behind our kombucha obsession. The fermented tea is, of course, teeming with probiotics: the live bacteria and yeast that support and replenish our natural gut bacteria. How do these belly bugs affect our skin? When we ingest probiotics from kombucha and other fermented foods (kimchi, miso, kefir), or in the form of supplements , they join the endogenous bugs of our gut, adding to the eclectic mix of microflora that’s required for a healthy intestinal barrier — and that diversity, we’ve learned, is everything in this realm. See, when something threatens our harmonious balance of bacteria — like a routine course of Cipro or junky eating habits — nasty germs can multiply and crowd out the good guys, which inevitably damages the lining of the intestines, causing toxins once destined for excretion to leach into the bloodstream. This ignites a firestorm of inflammation that impinges on every organ, but most visibly, our skin: We’re talking breakouts, rashes, rosacea and eczema flares galore . Diversity is also critical for the skin’s microbiome. “The greater the variety of bacterial species on the skin, the healthier its barrier will be, and the less dryness, inflammation, itching, and stinging you’ll experience,” says Bowe. Aiming to help foster this rich and disparate microbial community are the latest probiotic skin-care formulas. While some contain live cultures (aka probiotics) to buoy skin’s innate supply of bacteria, others include prebiotics — compounds that feed existing skin bugs, helping them thrive. Loads more products rely on postbiotics, the beneficial extracts that living bacteria give off when put through a fermentation process that revs up their metabolism. (Some of these by-products are natural antibiotics, capable of killing germs that contribute to acne and infections; others can spark healing without the usual need for an instigating injury, which is what microneedling does.) Non-living pieces of bacteria, called lysates, and all the useful stuff they secrete, fall under the postbiotic umbrella, too. Just as important as the type of biotic in the bottle — be it a whole living organism, broken-up bacteria, bug food, or a by-product — is the specific strain, as each species has its own unique properties and purpose. And there are a lot of them — all with utterly tongue-twisting names. Then, of course, there’s the question of evidence, with some brands being better than others at conducting clinical trials to back up their benefits. The products here, all hand-picked by Bowe, represent the best of probiotic skin care: Boasting scientifically tested bacterial components that nurture the microbiome, they offer swift relief from a slew of skin troubles, but never feel basic. Beautiful textures, clean scents, zero pilling — bugging in only the best possible way. facebook dialog Pinterest Best for Dry, Itchy, Eczema-Prone Skin La Roche-Posay Lipikar Balm AP+ Intense Repair Moisturizing Cream Bugs on board: Prebiotic thermal spring water and Aqua Posae Filiformis (APF) Dr. Bowe's take: “ Eczema sufferers have imbalanced skin microbiomes, marked by an overgrowth of itch-inducing Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. When staph proliferates, it kills off friendly bacteria, setting the stage for eczema flares. But this cream can help keep staph in check. It contains thermal spring water, which functions as a prebiotic, or a fertilizer-type ingredient for bugs. The water’s unique characteristics, including its pH and selenium content, have been shown in clinical studies to cultivate the growth of healthy strains of bacteria while keeping bad bugs, like staph, at bay. Supercharging the formula is APF, a patented version of the waterborne bacteria Vitreoscilla filiformis , known for improving severely dry skin. The brand took this rare bacteria and strengthened its properties by growing it in their thermal spring water. The APF is a heat-killed strain, which makes it a postbiotic. It provides long-lasting hydration and reduces the occurrence of flare-ups in dry skin.” $20 ( Shop Now ) facebook dialog Pinterest Best for Dry, Itchy, Eczema-Prone Skin Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream Bugs on board: Prebiotic oat extract Dr. Bowe's take: “This cream contains oats, which act as a powerful prebiotic, feeding the skin’s bacteria, and encouraging a robust microbiome. The new scientific studies supporting this product are incredibly convincing. (Most companies make probiotic claims based on individual ingredients tested in a lab — they’re not actually testing final formulations on human skin as Aveeno did.) In a multicenter, randomized clinical study involving men and women with mild to moderate eczema, subjects using this Aveeno cream (versus an un-fragranced placebo lotion that did not contain oats) experienced improvements in skin pH and barrier function (that is, the skin’s ability to hold water and block irritants), as well as a dramatic hike in hydration (266 percent!), all of which translated to fewer eczema patches and less itching. The cream took just 24 hours to restore a healthy skin microbiome — and that newfound equilibrium sustained even after the cream was discontinued for a full week. If it worked this well for people with eczema, it should save anyone from dry, itchy, inflamed skin.” $14 ( Shop Now )""]",451ee7f6a9f4ad6ffd81eb1325d91bd98d7f084c,a1f1-4db4-aeed,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.allure.com/gallery/probiotics-skin-care-products

,"['For the cover look (shown here), makeup artist Diane Kendal warmed Banks\'s skin with bronzer and a dusty-rose blush. She tapped on metallic copper and champagne eye shadows, created a subtle cat-eye shape with black cream liner, and filled in Banks\'s lips with nude lip pencil and a swipe of sheer gloss. The look can be re-created with the following: Eye Shadow in Notice Me Nudes, Clean Glow Blusher in Roses, and Colorlicious lip gloss in Candylicious by CoverGirl. To keep Banks\'s waves from collapsing while they cooled, Normant wrapped each curl around his finger and pinned it to her head with a no-crease clip. A hefty dose of hair spray kept the style intact, even through multiple brushings. facebook dialog Pinterest ""I prefer doing comedy over drama,"" Banks says.

,"['Melatonin How it works: Melatonin is a hormone your body produces naturally that helps you prepare for sleep, so it can be helpful to take a melatonin supplement (a chemically produced version of the hormone) if you know you\'re going to have trouble falling asleep. ""It changes your internal clock and gets you ready for sleep, but it doesn\'t make you fall asleep,"" says Michael J. Breus, a fellow of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. That means it doesn\'t yield instant results, either; he recommends taking the supplement 90 minutes before bedtime. Pros: It\'s convenient. In the U.S., you can pick it up without a prescription at pretty much any supermarket or drugstore. As with all supplements, it\'s smart to talk to your doctor before taking it. Cons: Breus recommends taking a dose of between 0.5 and 1 milligram, but that\'s not always easy to find. ""About 90 percent of what\'s available is an overdosage of about 10 to 20 times that much,"" he says. Most of the supplements available contain at least 3 milligrams. Taking too much [melatonin]https://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/melatonin-3-mg-240-capsules/vs-1615){: rel=nofollow} has been linked to nightmares and can also be a contraceptive, Breus says. Try it: Look for the lowest-dose version you can find, and use a pill splitter to cut it even smaller if necessary. facebook dialog Pinterest Getty Images Valerian Root How it works: This calming natural sleep aid has been called nature\'s Valium because it mellows you out. But it\'s not entirely understood why. ""We still have more to learn about this herbal supplement,"" says Harris. ""The mechanism of action and the ideal dose still need more research."" Its most common form is a liquid extract you mix into water, but you can also find it in other forms. Pros: It\'s thought to be generally safe, says Douglas Kirsch, a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School. But he recommends discussing the option with your doctor to make sure it doesn\'t interfere with other medications or health conditions you may have. Cons: The side effects, if any, are typically slight headaches or digestion problems. Also, ""it tastes horrible and smells even worse,"" says Breus. Even if you take it in capsule form, it can leave behind an unpleasant aftertaste. Try it: Valerian root has been shown to be more effective as a sleep aid when paired with hops, Breus says, so consider taking it with a hops supplement, too. (Sadly, a pint of Blue Moon won\'t work.) facebook dialog Pinterest Getty Images Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc Supplements How it works: You know how people drink warm milk as a sleep aid? They\'re on the right track: A large dose of calcium (larger than you\'d get from drinking it) aids in the production of melatonin. A supplement of 900 milligrams helps the brain harness the amino acid tryptophan (which helps make melatonin), explains Breus. Together with the calcium supplement, Breus recommends taking magnesium and zinc supplements, since the three work together to help maintain sleep. Pros: They\'re an all-natural way to promote sleep. Cons: Be careful not to go over the recommended dosages, especially if you\'re supplementing zinc, since excess can lead to a dangerous accumulation of copper in the body and become toxic. Try it: Look for 300-milligram supplements of magnesium and 8-milligram supplements of zinc.']",43edb52181c62a8cd883a64ecaa293c583503e49,a1f1-4db4-aeed,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.allure.com/gallery/how-to-fall-asleep-faster?intcid=inline_amp

,"['Sleek Bangs Kerry Washington It looks all one length, but a few delicate layers just below the collarbone keep Washington\'s cut from looking severe; the bangs should begin about an inch and a half from the forehead and span from temple to temple, Northwood says. Like Munn\'s, this cut\'s clean, sophisticated lines are more flattering on a round face. ""It\'s a look you need to own,"" he says. ""And it definitely requires some straightening, so if your hair is supercurly, know that there will be a lot of styling involved.""', 'Allover Layers Ali Larter Allover layers are ideal for fine, wavy hair—they make it appear fuller. Plus, it\'s a cinch to style. ""All it takes is a little mousse, and you can let it air-dry,"" says Josh, who loves John Frieda Frizz-Ease Curl Reviver Styling Mousse. ""Or, if your hair is curly, use a diffuser."" He does have one warning: ""If you\'re someone who loves to wear her hair up, be prepared for lots of loose pieces, since this style is so layered."" facebook dialog Pinterest Long, Loose Layers Rose Byrne Thick, curly hair types will love Byrne\'s sexy, disheveled layers. ""They frame the face nicely, and because they\'re below the chin, they thin it out a bit,"" says Josh, who recommends keeping layers longer in the back. ""Anyone can pull this off, but those with rounder faces should ask their stylists for fewer layers. Otherwise, it will make the face appear wider."" To style, wrap sections of hair haphazardly around a curling iron (we love T3 SinglePass Whirl Professional Styling Wand ) and clamp the ends quickly with a flatiron for a piecey finish. facebook dialog Pinterest Piecey Curls Carey Mulligan Short, wispy layers add body to Mulligan\'s fine hair. ""It looks so airy and lightweight, plus her grown-out bangs blend in perfectly,"" says Northwood. Ask your stylist for a shoulder-grazing cut and soft, scattered layers (the shortest pieces are concentrated in the middle) with an off-center part. ""With the loose, easy curls, it\'s much cooler that way,"" he says. After you\'ve curled, Northwood suggests dabbing Pureology Colour Stylist Cuticle Polisher Shine Serum on the ends. ""The finished look is piecey but polished—not messy.""']",17e92375c77706c60a0231e02be8397dcedfcc40,a1f1-4db4-aeed,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.allure.com/gallery/best-medium-length-haircuts

,"[""10. Deal With Gray. It starts innocently enough: One minute you're plucking an errant silver strand at your temple, and the next, you've locked yourself in the bathroom, eyes tearing up as you yank out more of them than you can count. Before the situation gets out of hand, try a semipermanent dye (which will cover grays) all over your hair. It's gentle and washes out gradually, so you don't end up with obvious roots. To cover grays between coloring sessions, use a temporary tool that deposits liquid color. ColorMark is a lip-gloss-like wand you can use on single strands; for larger patches, try TouchBack Temporary Hair Color Marker, which has a thick tip that allows you to draw it on like a marker (both wash out with shampoo).""]",e28e53c180dd9e56b29cea1359308dfb4fbe7b29,a1f1-4db4-aeed,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.allure.com/gallery/how-to-color-hair

,"[""Bold Eyes and Lips That adage that you can't wear color on your eyes and lips at the same time is about as outdated as not wearing white after Labor Day. And while it's not the simplest thing to pull off, it's most definitely possible. And Kim and Henao set out to prove it with this look. The trick is to vary the textures and intensities. On the lips, Henao applied a matte crimson color, the Mattified Lipstick in Marooned. On the eyes, a blend of a shimmery cream and powder, both from the MetalliShadow Crème + Powder in Scarlet Eclipse. Henao tapped the burgundy cream all over the lids, up to the brows, and even along the cheekbones. He then brushed the matching powder on top of the cream, giving it an iridescent finish, and lined Kim's eyes in black."", 'Matching Brows and Lips If you think colorful brows won\'t work IRL, consider this: The first time we met Kim, she\'d tinted her brows with purple eye shadow. Paired with clean skin and lips, it looked really freakin\' cool. We decided to amp it up even more for this shoot, matching her lips, too. To make the brows really vibrant, Henao colored them in with the Edgiest Kohl Shadowstick in Violet Taboo, then dusted on the purple powder from the Kendall J Palette. ""Using the cream first gives you more coverage than if you only used a powder,"" he says. For the lips, Henao broke out a vibrant orchid lipstick, Mattified Lipstick in Smash.']",51f385dd4cdb5f4a9ecc21aefa99fe8708665a95,a1f1-4db4-aeed,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.allure.com/gallery/irene-kim-estee-lauder-edit-beauty-looks?intcid=inline_amp
