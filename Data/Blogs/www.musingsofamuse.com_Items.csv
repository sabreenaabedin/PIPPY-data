"['About the Muse Who is this Muse girl anyway? Around the Internet I’m simply known as the Muse. A Muse of makeup maybe..the Muse in Musings perhaps? Could be anything. Who am I really? I’m just an average, everyday, general cosmetic junkie that plans to take over the world. You can join me and my minions on our quest for cosmetic nirvana by reading my uber awesome, fabulous blog! In all seriousness………. I’m a native New Yorker. Born, Bred, and Raised (but traveled far from home on many a fine occasion seeking new and exciting beauty products from distant lands…it’s true just check my blog for reviews on products you may have never heard of!). When I’m not moonlighting as the Editor here at Musings (Wow! Editor sounds so bloody important doesn’t it?) I have a real job, in the real world as an Insurance Broker, underwriting commercial and personal policies. I own and operate my own office with my older sister and together we are a legend in our own minds (I’m positive other people think we are legendary as well but I haven’t met one yet! If I do I’ll let you know!). I also enjoy pina coladas and getting caught in the rain…. When I’m not posting tons of reviews, testing new products, and playing around in the comment box with my awesome readers you can find me at some high end counter looking for the next awesome cosmetic find. I’m also a geek and come with all the excess baggage geeks come with such as attending crazy conventions, playing stupid amounts of WoW , reading manga, and watching Star Trek and Doctor Who reruns. I’m a huge lover of literature, indie and foreign films and could possibly be more passionate about these than cosmetics. Whoa. I adore traveling and have been to many great and exotic places! I’m a big lover of Japanese, Korean, and British popular culture. Ok, ok enough about me…I feel like I’m on a dating site here…. Something you’re dying to know about little, old, boring me? E-mail or comment I’ll happily provide the deets!']",fcebd18e0f7686658a5b0d9c86a28a5a2eb11f83,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/about,

Revlon Coming Out With Kiss Cushion Lip Tint By Isabella Muse on April 20, 2018 Leave a Comment in Revlon , Summer Collections 2018 Revlon Kiss Cushion Lip Tint will apparently be previewed at Beautycon this weekend and more info will become available later next week about this new lip product! How very Korean! Cushion lip tints were quite popular the last two or so years in Korea and it seems the trend is trickling into US drugstores this year. I suspect we’ll finally see some cushion blushes at some point too considering L’Oreal Lucent Magique Cushion Glow Blush launched so long ago in Japan! Not much is known yet about Kiss Cushion Lip Tint but I’ll keep you updated. Honestly, Revlon has been killing it with awesome lip products lately. I really loved and still use the Kiss Plumping Lip Creme that launched last Fall not to mention all those great shades like Dream in Nude that launched with the Color Charge Collection! I look forward to seeing how things go down with Revlon Kiss Cushion Lip Tint will share more info as it becomes available! It Brushes For Ulta Your Beautiful Airbrush Essentials For Mother’s Day Not Jean Nate! By Isabella Muse on April 20, 2018 2 Comments in It Cosmetics Affiliate Heads up It Girls and Guys there’s a new It Brushes For Ulta Your Beautiful Airbrush Essentials Set available just in time for Mother’s Day. Not that my mom would even BEGIN to know what to do with these brushes. I dunno where I came from, I suspect I’m related to Superman and was sent to Earth as an infant from Kal-El in a rocket and my mom happened to find me laying in the streets of New York and brought me home to be tormented and lovingly cherished by my older sister. No, but seriously my mom hasn’t the slightest when it comes to makeup and beauty. She’s super no nonsense. A really snazzy dresser and she loves her purses and clothes but makeup? Not so much! I did inherit a great love of fragrance from her though. She really enjoys perfume. Although, her idea of sophisticated fragrance comes in a big bottle of Charlie and Jean Nate. Yeah, I see you nodding because you remember those 30 oz Jean Nate Splash Bottles. Those will become nuclear weapons for us in the future when the dinosaurs roam the Earth again and every man, woman, and child is part of the Hunger Games. Anyway, back to brushes! It Brushes For Ulta Your Beautiful Airbrush Essentials includes a Powder Brush, Foundation Brush, Eyeshadow Brush, and a metallic bag to tote them all around in. It’s available for a limited time at ulta.com and will set you back $42. Mega size bottles of Jean Nate are completely sold separately. P.S. I don’t endorse Jean Tate all over your body. That’s just wrong.

Enjoy! Marc Jacobs Beauty Finish-Line Perfecting Coconut Setting Powder Looks Interesting! By Isabella Muse on April 20, 2018 Leave a Comment in Uncategorized Affiliate I just hauled Becca’s new loose powder but Marc Jacobs Beauty Finish-Line Perfecting Coconut Setting Powder looks interesting and maybe it smells like coconuts which means I own it now. I don’t really use setting powder since my skin is dry and this is a matte finish powder but it sure is tempting. It contains five different forms of coconut and cocoa butter, not great if coconut breaks you out or you’re allergic to it (coconut makes me itchy sometimes), as well as a what they call a soft-matte finish that has a hydrated look and not a dry one. Sephora VIB and BI Members get early access today at sephora.com and everyone else can get there hands on this April 23rd! Think you’ll haul it?']",2c685dc34a4d4d4f2b73ae411beeeecd96f44987,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/,

"['MAC x Aaliyah Images Are Exciting By Isabella Muse on April 2, 2018 7 Comments in MAC MAC x Aaliyah images hit the late singer’s Instagram today and fans are obviously gagging in excitement. As you may know, Aaliyah joins artists like Selena with a new makeup collection created by MAC and inspired by and dedicated to the R&B singer. The collection is expected to hit shelves Summer 2018 and will probably sell out in the blink of an eye but no worries I’m sure MAC will restock to appease fans as they did with Serena’s hotly anticipated and quick to sell out collection. Needless to say Aaliyah life was too cut far too short and she has garnered both fans during her life’s work and well after it with fans begging MAC to create a collection in her namesake. Dreams do come true as MAC again has listened their fans as always and so far, what I’ve seen from the collection is looking very, very promising. Take a look below to see what’s in the works for the MAC x Aaliyah Collection! Another sneak peek of the @maccosmetics Aaliyah collection! Arriving in North America June 20th online and rolling out Internationally this Summer! The lasting impact of Aaliyah carries on with an eye palette in sultry hues – which music video do you think inspired these shades? #AaliyahForMAC A post shared by Aaliyah Haughton (@aaliyah_haughton_official) on Apr 2, 2018 at 11:03am PDT Another sneak peek of the @maccosmetics Aaliyah collection!

"['Kate Somerville Cold Cream Moisturizing Cleanser + Makeup Remove Not Just for Your Grandma By Isabella Muse on April 3, 2018 Leave a Comment in Kate Somerville Affiliate You might think your grandma was the only one to remove her makeup with cold cream but Kate Somerville Cold Cream Moisturizing Cleanser + Makeup Remove proves different. This whipped formula removes all makeup even waterproof mascara easily with a formula that hydrates skin without stripping skin. Kate’s formula is free of mineral-oil so it won’t clog pores or cause breakouts while leaving skin moist and makeup-free. I happen to be a strong supporter of Japanese Pond’s Cold Cream so, I’m not completely a hater of cold cream as a makeup remover even though it does seem a rather ancient way of removing makeup. Included in the mix here is white Kiawe honey and a floral blend of jasmine, rose, and daisy extracts. I do wonder if it’ll be scented terribly strongly as that’s always a deal breaker for some skincare lovers. I personally don’t mind! I’m quite curious to check this out and will be purchasing it to see how it goes. I have drier skin and I tend to rely on a moisturizing secondary cream cleanser in my double-cleanse. Although this does seem a step one in the cleansing process. Kate Somerville Cold Cream Moisturizing Cleanser + Makeup Remove is available now at sephora.com. You may also enjoy...

By Isabella Muse on July 25, 2007 6 Comments in Babbling Bits When I originally started Musings of a Muse it was older blogs that I had snatched from my Live Journal account and placed on myspace! I’m in a similiar situation right now with this new blog! Which means I’m tempted to move some of my older blogs from myspace and add them up here on Blogger! What are your thoughts? Would you like some repeats? Reruns? Or shall I start fresh! Would love your input on this! A New Home! By Isabella Muse on July 25, 2007 4 Comments in Babbling Bits Hello There! Welcome to my nice new home! The original home of my blog is located at myspace and although I will still be posting there I thought I’d start a little something here on a Blogger and see what becomes of it! I also started doing videos on youtube which became quite popular all of a sudden so by all means pop over and say hello! A little about me: I’m 29 years old, quite the definition of kawaii I guess (or so the world tells me)! I’m an avid collector of cosmetics and although I am quite passionate about it I also adore couture, accessories, and general girly things that are not limited in anyway to one topic! I’m a general geek which means I can take apart your computer and rebuild it in under an hour! I like to muck about with systems and such! So…ya…I’m quite boring basically ? I am, however, a great shopaholic which means I have tons of products that I’ll be reviewing, discussing, taking pics, etc..just for you! So if you LOVE endless babble about all things girly, you are in the right place! I hope you enjoy these blogs as much as I love typing them up!

"['Laura Geller Lip and Cheek Treats Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on November 20, 2009 4 Comments in Blush , Laura Geller , Lipgloss , Swatches Wow look at QVC getting all fast with the shipping! I told you about the new Laura Geller Lip & Cheek Treat Sets on Monday which is the same day I ordered them and dude they came in my mail on Wednesday. Awesome shipping time right? Speaking about shipping, total rant, I had to pay almost $10 bucks to get all three shipped grrrr sometimes QVC ticks me off with their stupid shipping prices. Anyway! Jump for the review. These set me back $29.90 each and include one Laura Geller Blush-n-Brighten and one Laura Geller Lip Parfait Lip Gloss. A little break down action…. QVC sells Blush-n-Brighten with a brush for $31-$35 or by itself for $29.50 so these are the better deal if you’re wondering. For me I just feel like I purchased the blush and got a free lip gloss along with it as the gloss isn’t fabulous so I’m just seeing as a gift with purchase at this point because I can’t consider breaking it down and saying I paid $15 for the blush and $15 for the gloss as lord knows the gloss is NOT worth $15. I already own a few Laura Geller Blush-n-Brighten Blushes and I’m quite happy with them although the ones I have are the sugar variety where as these are somewhat sugar-free, Laura refers to her shimmery products as being sugar or sugar-free. These are a suger-free or shimmer-free product. But I don’t mind although they have a bit of a chalky formula they end up going on very nicely with a beautiful finish and a good pop of color. I got all three shades and each wears better than the less. I was worried one or two might be too dark but they all wear perfectly. Really gorgeous. By the way Berry does have a tiny bit of shimmer too it! They do remind me of MAC Skin Finishes however much more pigmented and alot less shimmer/frost. The gloss was a disappointment. They are ok but they have a drier formula which makes them more of a lip cream then a gloss. They have good pigmentation, a nice minty flavor, and with a little gloss on top you could make it work. I like the kits, they are pretty cute although I did feel like it was sort of a clearing out type of deal. Where they slapped things together just to get rid of them. However, this doesn’t make me love them any less. I’d recommend a haul particularly because the blushes are so lovely. Likey alot and a Muse Approval for purchase! If you’d like to see what one of the blushes looks like on check my Lancome post today as I am wearing the shade Berry in my photos.

"['Beauty on a Budget: Essence of Beauty Crease Brush Review By Isabella Muse on March 14, 2008 23 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Beauty Tools A new friend of mine asked me to to get some Essence of Beauty brushes for her this week. She asked for a particular set which was the dual crease brush. As I was doing her shopping I noticed that the brushes looked pretty good and I knew that these are a cult favorite of my sweet mate, ‘Nes, at Nessasary Makeup and that was good enough for me to want to try them! These cost $4.99 USD and are basically a dual package of mini crease brushes. The style reminds me of Bobbi Brown brushes with the wooden handle. The size of these intrigued me as they appear to be more a smudger style brush then a crease brush but hey it was worth trying for the price tag! The first brush is a tiny dome shape that reminds me of a Mally Beauty brush I own but the Mally brush is a bit more fuller where as this is smaller. I didn’t expect this to do much as it was way too small to properly work my crease area. I’m used to using MAC’s 224 and 227 on my crease. Present me with this tiny thing and I’m at a loss how I should be using it. But I happily tried it out and I must say it fits into the contour of my crease brilliantly and works a treat at blending shadows. I found that it actually gave me more management over the brush and bristles since it was far smaller then what I’m used too. I also experienced less fall out because the brush was so tiny. It also worked well on defining the v of my eye and blending inwards. As you can see I’m used to blending with a much larger brush! It’s quite a multitasking brush because I can use it on the v of my eye, within my crease, and also to line my bottom lash line with my shadow. The second brush with the package is even smaller then the first. It’s a step up from an eyeliner brush. This too worked surprisely well. It didn’t do that great a job blending the color completely but it worked fabulously defining the v of my eye and working the my color half way across my crease for contrast. I felt like both brushes gave me a bit more control over the look I was creating and I successfully manged to create an interesting look by contrasting a lighter shade of shadow all over my eye and a darker shade of shadow across part of my crease and v. Much to my delight neither brush shed a bristle the entire time I was using them and the brushes are very soft. The handles are mini size but again I felt like the handles being so small gave me much more control over what I was creating! It was kind of like having a pencil grasped tightly between my hands and it was nice and steady as I worked. As you can see below my outer eye is a shimmering light brown beige that contrasts nicely with the gold amber shadow I used. I created the look using the larger of the two crease brushes and proceeded to line my lower lash line with the smaller of the brushes! Overall, for the price, these were most definately an interesting little find and I’m generally curious about the rest of the brushes in the Essence of Beauty Collection! I can’t help but give these a Muse Approved Seal for purchase! You may also enjoy... Limited Edition Sonia Kashuk Brush Sets for Fall 2015 Cailyn Cosmetics O! Wow Brush Possible Artis Brush Dupe?

"['Kenzo Belle de Jour Review By Isabella Muse on March 18, 2009 2 Comments in Kenzo , Skincare I normally don’t like blogging skincare until I’ve used it for a month or more but seeing as I’m so excited about Kenzo Belle de Jour Moisturizer I’m thinking that I’ll rewrite my set of rules and tell you all about it! The Muse tends to think outside the box and couldn’t help but think “Oh Belle de Jour moisturizer, how very Billie Piper of Kenzo…” What? Am I the only demented one that was thinking of Billie Piper after they heard “Belle de Jour”….oh come on now you know you were thinking the same bloody thing. Yeah, Billie’s grown up since her day’s as a companion! Anyway…. If you put aside all the great benefits of Kenzo Belle de Jour and simply embrace the amazing packaging and incredible smell of the moisturizer you should be happy as a little clam. These things make a difference when you’re a girly girl who adores anything that looks and smells pretty. Bell de Jour is scented with the gorgeous smell of white lotus. Truly a stunning treat for the senses. After blogging for so long I suddenly realized one day out of the blue that some women don’t like scented moisturizers. I couldn’t believe these people actually existed. I happen to fall into the category of loving my facial moisturizer scented and Belle de Jour completely captivates with a fresh floral blend that’s really something you have to experience for yourself to understand. Truly it’s a key selling point for me as the smell is just amazing. Ok, enough of gushing about the scent….packaging…. Packaging always matters. You know how shallow we all are. We love beautiful packaging, sweet packaging, and kawaii packaging. Don’t lie now, your Muse knows you well and she understands how important beautiful packaging is. Belle de Jour comes housed in a large white box with a beautiful lotus surrounding all four sides of the box. Inside you’ll discover a tiny little book that goes into great detail about what your new facial moisturizer will do for your skin, small things like this make me smile and take note that the brand put a little extra love into the packaging. The jar is typical Kenzo design that has that chic edge to it. It’s a simple cream jar with a slight slant and a beautiful lotus on the lid. The words Belle de Jour grace the bottom. The simplicity of the jar make it elegant and very pretty to display on your vanity. Now that we got all the shallow stuff out of the way how does the moisturizer perform? Kenzo Belle de Jour is a face cream to enhance the skin’s natural beauty by protecting it from free radials and the harmful stress hormone, Cortisol. Cortisol is a chemical found in saliva, which increases significantly when a person is stress. The Muse images she has tons of Cortisol running around all over the place! High levels of cortisol increases blood pressure and weakens the immune system, making the body prone to illness and fat accumulation, see I told you that I had a ton of cortisol running through my body, take a look at my chubby little cheeks you’ll see what I mean! 75% of women using Belle de Jour showed a drop in their cortisol levels by 25% after a single application. Further tests and studies show that the skin surface showed a 28% reduction in reactive oxygenated elements (free radicals) on the skin’s surface. That’s probably a little too much information but the moral behind the story is that free radicals can create havoc with your skin and Belle de Jour is a moisturizer meant to prevent that chaos. White Lotus, is a natural and potent ingredient which helps restore skin to it’s natural balance and stimulate cellular metabolism leaving behind softer, luminous skin. Simply put the cream increases radiance of the skin, moisturizers, soothes, and protects skin from free radicals. What’s the Muse say? The formula is a nice thick moisturizing cream which is recommended for all skin types. I do think it’s a heavy cream so I’d recommend it for night use if you have oily skin or even dry skin for that matter as it can work at improving skin as you sleep. A tiny bit goes a very long way at moisturizing skin and your face feels interestingly refreshed after a single use. The cream absorbs easily and as mentioned above smells heavenly. It sinks in completely and leaves behind softer skin upon contact. It’s one of those facial moisturizers that you’ll see results right away upon application. For example, dry patches on my cheeks were instantly soothed and relieved with one application. Now as per my recommendation of using it as a night cream, for it’s price you’re going to want to take note of whether or not you want to indulge in it as both a day and night cream or just one or the other. If you live a face paced lifestyle in a large city with plenty of pollution, sun exposure, and just general nastiness that will easily take it’s toll on skin, I recommend using this as your day cream. The point of the cream is to act as a barrier between you and all that insanity that surrounds you during the day. It wraps skin in a cocoon and acts not only as your moisturizer but as a self defense system for your skin. If you work or travel in a slower town and aren’t as exposed you may settle on using this as a night cream. As I mentioned the formula is thick yet manages to be fluffy and absorbs easier so for a day cream it can work well when applied in small amounts. Restoring the balance of my skin may take a few uses but as of now my skin just feels nicer. I do feel like my skin can take advantage of feeding off a superior facial moisturizer such as this. I like this one alot and I feel a Muse Approval coming on but I’m going to keep testing it out and I’ll revisit with you in another post soon to tell you how it’s doing with my skin. So far, count this Muse impressed. Visit www.kenzousa.com for further info or to place an order. Orders over $75 USD get free shipping and three free samples. What do you think?

"[""Stop the Bobbi Brown Train I Wanna Get Off! By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in Bobbi Brown After many years of avoiding the Bobbi Brown counter I decided to dive in and make a little bitty purchase during my trip to purchase the Strange Hybrid Collection from MAC. I was feeling spontaneous so Bobbi Brown here I come! I’ve never purchased any prior Bobbi Brown products before this. I’m not even entirely sure why that is. I think it just didn’t appeal to me. Normally my taste runs to bolder, bright colors or sweet pastels and light pinks! Bobbi Brown seemed….older….more for someone in their 40’s maybe. No offense at all to older women! When I strutted my way up to the counter I already had in mind exactly what I wanted as I had had gotten a Nordie e-mail alerting me to it’s arrival (Ok Ok Ok so maybe it wasn’t as spontaneous as I originally mentioned! Gimme a Break!)! Avast Ye and Behold! The Sand and Surf Palette! Mind you this was appealing because those special, magic words appeared after it. You remember what the special words are don’t you? If not, allow me, to remind you! Limited Edition! Now prior to actually going to Nordies I wandered aimlessly around the website viewing Bobbi Brown products and the only thing that caught my eye from the line was the Sand and Surf palette and the shimmer bricks! I knew I MUST have some shimmer bricks! After all they were 1. Pretty 2. Well reviewed by girls everywhere far and wide! The magic words (Limited Edition) popped out at me during my surf around the Nordie’s website and I came across another item that I MUST have! Now that I had my shopping list I was ever prepared to buy buy buy buy buy and be enabled to the wonders of Bobbi Brown make-up! $100 or more odd dollars later I happily left with two shimmer bricks (one gold, one rose) and the sand and surf palette! I rushed home with my treasures but never did get a chance to wear any of ’em as other items took president during my morning face routine! This morning I felt for sure it was a good day to BREAK out the Sand and the Surf palette! And hell I should go ahead and give the Rose Shimmer Brick a try too! Truly this would be a great make-up day!!!!!!!!!!! And today’s face of the day consists of this: I dunno. I’m so disappointed. My eyes didn’t pop! My cheeks were blah! It wasn’t what I expected at all! The colors in the eye palette are highly difficult to work with. Blending is impossible even with your best brushes. I used a total of three colors but it looks like I used one color. The palette has a baked feel too which could account for the difficult time with blending! The shimmer brick was just blah for me. It gave me no color which It’s not really what it is supposed to do anyway but I applied it over my normal blush and used it to contour…but..again..just blah….I expect some sort of shimmer! Overall I’m not impressed at all. Really disappointed. I haven’t yet tried the gold shimmer brick and I have hopes it’ll be the one great purchase out of the three items I got! I won’t be doing another Bobbi Brown purchase in the future Sorry girls! That’s my story and I’m sticking to it! Questions, Comments, Suggestions are always welcome! My ears are open! An Introduction to Japanese Brands Part Deux By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 2 Comments in Beauty Abroad , Japanese Brands , Jill Stuart One good turn deserves another or so some wise man told me…hmm maybe it was a wise woman! Either way to add to my Asian inspired blog of yesterday I decided to bring to you today a higher end brand of product! Jill Stuart! My oh my it just rolls off the tongue doesn’t it? Now Jill Stuart is quite well known for gorgeous couture! However, sadly, this girl is unable to squeeze my wobbly bits into anything Jill Stuart designs! Like all good couture, Jill Stuart’s entire line is not meant for short, round, and average. It ranges towards slim, leggy, and gorgeous! I can lovingly admire from afar but the general idea of actually purchasing anything from the line is but a dream! I imagine when they design these things they aren’t picturing small and round and really who can blame them? Just for the fun of it let’s have a little lookee at what the line looks like shall we? I promise to get back to cosmetics shortly! Winter 2006 Winter 2006 Hmmm I wonder if we can find cheap knock offs in bigger sizes?!? Doubt it! A girl can keep hope alive can’t she? Everyone still with me? I know it’s hard to keep your train of thought after viewing such astounding pieces but please try to keep from falling off your chair and let’s get back to what the original topic of conversation was! Now, you may or may not be in a similar situation as me and if you are I do indeed have good news for you! Situation being that you too are in the short and round pond! The good news is that Jill Stuart has put out an entire line of drop dead amazing beauty items! These are probably some of the most amazing products in my collection! And I don’t have to be a size zero to indulge!!!!! HOORAY! Jill Stuart is a virgin to the beauty world but this doesn’t mean that they have failed in putting out such a line of product that your eyes will roll back into your head and you may feel the effects of orgasmic delight when you see some of the amazing items they have in store for the avid beauty fan! Jill Stuart is in no way a mainstream line of make-up! Prices range along the lines of Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. And how very dare I say it but these exceptional pieces steal much of my love away from some of my very favorite posh brand of beauty products! This spring was a landmark for the company as they introduced 4 new eyeshadow palettes and much to the delight of myself and fans everywhere a 5th for the summer collection (I have mine currently on order! It will ship June 1! Squeal with me would you?)! The palettes are the type of item that take center stage on your vanity! The packaging is like nothing you can find on our shores! I guess I should stop babbling and bring you on to the climax of the actual product! Without further words from me, I’ll go ahead and let the products speak for themselves! From my collection to your eyes, I bring you the masterpieces of Jill Stuart Beauty! (I did my best to keep as much light and flash on the product as possible when I took the pictures so you wouldn’t miss one tiny bit of detail!) Spring 2007 Blush Sparkle Powder A majority of the color collections are difficult to get and expensive to ship over! But if you are lucky enough to nab these beautiful pieces you won’t regret it! The shadows are highly pigmented, the blushes are smooth and flawless looking, and the powders are pure perfection! This girl gives them her highest rating of approval! Fay Wray You Say? By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 2 Comments in Glamorous Bits The boy hmmm wait erase that let’s start over again. The man I have found myself falling love with asked me if I could choose 5 people to have dinner with who would they be and why? I was sure to fit into the top 5 Bettie Page and Fay Wray! Who would not want to meet the epitome of class, elegance, and glamour! The two above ladies define all those adjectives and more! Much to my surprise and amazement he asked me who Fay Wray is (or was)? God lord how could he ask such a thing! Blasphemy! I guess we will have to forgive him this time as he is British and mayhap the wonder of Fay has not reached his shoreline! I shouldn’t give him that much leeway considering Tim Curry (it always fascinates me when some brit or another has no idea who Tim Curry is! I have many a fine British friend who have no idea who this wonderful man is! My god what is wrong with you people?! Do you live under a rock? How can it be you don’t know your fellow man! But ado, I guess that is neither here nor there! I imagine Tim Curry deserves his own blog entry! Someday soon!) sung about her in Rocky Horror Picture show but I GUESS I’ll have to educate him further on the virtues of Hollywood stars of yesteryear (mind you the poor boy has been bored to tears with far less popping out of my mouth but I suspect that he’s too nice to tell me I’m making him yawn!)! Which brings me to my post for today! Where has glamour gone pray tell? Glamour today is stick skinny girls with hair extensions that cost more than my car! Glamour consists of short skirts that are level with your…erm..well you know. Glamour today is bubblegum pop. Glamour is…Paris Hilton? NAY! Say it isn’t so! Please tell me that glamour isn’t defined as Paris Hilton like celebs!!! I give you my definition of Glamour (and if you are nearly as smart as I think you are, you’ll agree with the way I define true elegance and beauty): Fay Wray Vivien Leigh Bettie Page (Glamorous and Kinky! A marriage most wonderful!) Audrey Hepburn I may rightly have been born a few years too late to enjoy all the wonders of true glamour and now I’m subjected to conformed society who believe glamour comes in 100 pound packages and boy like shapes. Not that I am against such wonderful cut figures just that I am sad to see the glam of yesteryear so lost and gone from the looks of today! Dita Von Teese keeps my hope alive that true glamour lives on in some girls! I, for one, try to glam it up as much as possible! Remember it’s not always about what you look like but how you work what you were given! So work it baby! Work it! Dita Von Teese Introduction to Japanese Brands By Isabella Muse on July 25, 2007 4 Comments in Beauty Abroad , Japanese Brands , Majolica Majorca , T'estimo Today I thought I’d post a previous entry from my myspace blog! This is worth a repost as you’ll hear me talking about many different Japanese brands and this is somewhat of an introduction to Asian cosmetics, particularly Japanese ones! I hope you enjoy this repeat of an old blog! I have come to the conclusion that it is my job to enable the female population to the joys of undiscovered make-up brands! Yes, indeed, you read that correctly! If you know me, you know that my obssession with make-up runs to the extreme! I am an avid collector of MAC, Urban Decay, and other bits and bobs that run towards the insane! Now my obssession has progressed over the years and I found that I could not be happy with american brands alone! I had to branch off into uncharted waters! Discover new and exciting items that have yet to be discovered by the american female population! I needed to bring these items back and introduce them to my fellow sick, twisted, and addicted female friends! In my many travels I had discovered plenty of interesting bits and bobs but none impressed me as much as the ones I discovered while living in Japan! I was introduced to an entire array of wonderful items that were unavailable in the states! Oh joy! Nirvana! The japanese mainstream cosmetic is an ambrosia! It’s rich and varied! It can only be enjoyed by savoring it! Awe is the only noun that comes to mind when I think of the variety that awaits the eager female in Japan! If you’re familiar with make-up and you’re as much a snob as I am you already realize that anything you’d purchase in a common drugstore would be an awful experience to say the least. Many american mainstream brands such as Covergirl, Maybelline, Etc….suck. Oh my I guess that’s one way of putting it isn’t it? Sucks? They do. I’m sorry but it’s been quite a many a year since this girl has purchased any drugstore make-up brands! My tastes run to what I can buy at Nordstrom, Sephora, or Neiman Marcus! NOT CVS, Walgreens, or Walmart! Now my point in discussing mainstream make-up would be because when I lived in Tokyo the defination of drug store make-up takes on a new meaning! Many of Japanese mainstream make-up brands look like something you’d have purchased in a posh, upscale shop! Get your google ready girls and let me show you an entire new way of looking at make-up! Kanebo is one of the major cosmetics companies that distrbutes in Asia (Kanebo doesn’t only distrubte make-up but that’s another story for another day!). Under Kanebo’s main name they offer several make-up brands. Some of my favorites are T’estimo and Lavshuca. T’estimo does a line of wonderful eye palettes that are unique to my collection of insanity! Lavshuca is very new to the Kanebo line and also, like T’estimo, does a lovely range of shadows and other bits and bobs! Now one of my biggest obssessions falls from the graceful hands of Shiseido! Shiseido created it’s little sister a few years ago and entitled her Majolica Majorca or to her fans MJ. She’s pretty and sweet and utterly lovely! She’s also quite inexpensive for such a gorgeous line of products! Now you may be curious about the status of these wonderful products so I will go right ahead and tell you, much to every girls delight, all these items are almost always limited edition! Ahhh how my heart sings to say it! Limited Edition! Limited Edition! Limited Edition! Don’t we, as the female race, love those two little words? Doesn’t it make us want to whip our credit cards out and go on a buying spree!? After all these are limited edition, we may, very well, NEVER see these items again in this lifetime! My god the horror of it all! Ok, so I’m being overdramatic and completely materialistic…sue me! The point of my rather large tale is to tell you think outside the box and begin to discover an entire new world of cosmetics! Bring up E-bay, Head over to Make-up Alley, or start googling! Imagine all the lovely new bits you could discover! And if you ever have any questions your resident addict is here to help anyway I can! Majolica Majorca Website Update By Isabella Muse on July 25, 2007 2 Comments in Majolica Majorca Oh Happy Days!! Shiseido has updated the Majolica Majorca Website with a new pop-up book! Do have a look! It’s absolutely adorable this time around! They have outdone themselves with the newest pop-up! Even if you can’t read Japanese it’s still a joy to browse through! I’m so happy I ordered almost all of this color story! Just brilliant! Can’t wait till it comes in the mail! For now I will amuse myself with the new pop-up book! Helpful Hint: Just click on Majolica Majorca to be magically transported to the website!

Trying to put on a face and watch a three year run around a washroom is difficult times my friends! If you recall I had previously blogged about Black and White and the Summer Season!

Benefit That Gal Review By Isabella Muse on July 25, 2007 8 Comments in Benefit Benefit has gone and stolen money from me again! I’ve been conned, I’ve been had, I’ve been hoodwinked (a little drama never hurt anyone)! Benefit is such a hit or miss company that it never fails to fascinate me how they can make some seriously awesome products and in the blink of an eye come out with a piece of shit product that has absolutely no use! I have some really mega staples from Benefit in my train case that if I was thrown on a desert island and they said I could only have a few cosmetics, these items would be with me! I continue to buy Benefit cosmetics because I enjoy the emotional lottery! Sometimes I buy it and it’s freaking amazing and I can’t live without it and sometimes I buy it and I feel like I should have taken my money and lit a match to it! In all seriousness Benefit makes some amazing items! I can’t live without (I’m talking about throwing myself off the Empire State Building if I can’t get these products!!!!) Bo-ing , Dandelion , Lemon-Aid , Maybe Baby , and Get Even ! Some items I’ve thrown away cash on and almost (not quite but almost) wanted to slit my wrists over were Dr. Feelgood (Can you say acne in a cute compact? This makes me break out like I’m 14 again!) , Not On My Pillow Which I don’t even think they make anymore! One season and it’s not in the catalog anymore! That shows you how hard it sucks!), Badgal Lash (OH MY GOD! Worse Mascara EVER!), Dallas (If you enjoy looking like you played in the mud this is the blush for you!), High Beam….oh my word this list is huge! I guess I should say that even though my list of items I don’t like is long, I do believe that my list of loves makes up for the crummy products I’ve tried from Benefit! Weirdly enough some or even most of the ones I don’t like appear on their best seller list so I guess I’m a nit picker and everyone else is really digging them! Who knows really?! Last week I read on Make-Up Bag about the newest addition to Benefit’s family! Behold! Another shit product from Benefit! I applaud your efforts Benefit but this stuff SUCKS! I want my money back damnit! Benefit Says: Go from dull to darling with “that gal.” It’s a silky pink primer that makes skin appear smoother & brighter. Wear alone for clear complexion radiance or apply before makeup for smooth, effortless application. Re-brighten during the day with “that gal.” It’s the “that gal” perfection for a happy complexion. Excitement doesn’t even begin to explain what I felt when I read this little blurb about “That Gal” from Benefit! I was racing around in circles at the prospect of something that would give me the appearance of brighter, healthier looking skin! Honestly I had put this product up with possibly being as great as Get Even or Bo-ing!!!! I couldn’t race to the website fast enough to order me some! And I got it…. And it sucks…. Sigh….. I used it several ways upon receiving it! First time I tried it on a clean, foundation free face! I got absolutely no brighness, nothing. It’s pale pink in color but it goes on completely sheer. It was almost like using High Beam minus the shimmer! That’s ok. I’d do it a different way! It would work if I tried it with foundation! Yes, that’s the key! Fast forward to the next morning! I applied my foundation and proceeded to apply “That Gal”….um…ya….nothing. No brightness, no visble change what so ever to my face. It’s ok! I knew if I packed it in my make-up case and used it as a touch up tool it would work then for sure! Fast forward some more…….. Noon Time Make-Up Touch Up. I got out my Mineral Veil Compact and was just about to apply when it struck me that I’d forgotten about “That Gal!” I’d use it for a touch up as recommend by Benefit! So I shoved my compact back into my purse and proceeded to touch up using “That Gal”…. Umm…. Hmm…. Ya….. I think I mentioned this before…. Nothing. So the moral of today’s story kids is that Benefit has created yet another product that has absolutely no use to me! I know Benefit will gladly take it back and give me my money but I don’t have the time to bother shipping it back so I just slapped it on MUA for some poor soul to experience! This one is another miss for Benefit!']",124d407ec8ca498c2cc7eb77611cf3323b8950f7,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4312,
"['A New Home! By Isabella Muse on July 25, 2007 4 Comments in Babbling Bits Hello There! Welcome to my nice new home! The original home of my blog is located at myspace and although I will still be posting there I thought I’d start a little something here on a Blogger and see what becomes of it! I also started doing videos on youtube which became quite popular all of a sudden so by all means pop over and say hello! A little about me: I’m 29 years old, quite the definition of kawaii I guess (or so the world tells me)! I’m an avid collector of cosmetics and although I am quite passionate about it I also adore couture, accessories, and general girly things that are not limited in anyway to one topic! I’m a general geek which means I can take apart your computer and rebuild it in under an hour! I like to muck about with systems and such! So…ya…I’m quite boring basically ? I am, however, a great shopaholic which means I have tons of products that I’ll be reviewing, discussing, taking pics, etc..just for you!

"['Tokidoki At Sephora: Tokidoki Prisma Lip Gloss Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on April 16, 2010 13 Comments in Lipgloss , Sephora , Swatches , TokiDoki Tokidoki at Sephora garners some attention if you’re a packaging junkie. I happen to be just that so of course I’m all about the cuteness that is Tokidoki makeup! Tokidoki combines an ultra cute packaging combined with the super sweet flavor and scent of blueberries to bring you their Prisma Lip Gloss. Check it! What is it? Tokidoki Prisma Lip Gloss is an inexpensive $15 sheer lip gloss with ultra cute Tokidoki themed packaging! Loves it! The Good…. Wow, what a lovely gloss. Not only is the packaging super nice but I absolutely adore the gloss. The gloss features a cute gloss cap that holds a Tokidoki character inside a snow globe of shimmery confetti! Quite sweet. The gloss itself is super sheer and subtle with a CRAZY sweet scent and taste, I’m talking SERIOUS taste here. The gloss feels very nice on my lips and gives them a super high sheen shine. Its comfortable to wear sans a sticky, tacky feel and the taste just makes it extra special in my opinion. A rather nice gloss! But it has its downfalls which I’ll share with you in a second). I got the shade Samba which is a sheer peachy pink but honestly pretty much transparent for the most part. I love that they embraced a Japanese spatula applicator. Many of my Asian lip glosses sport this style of applicator and for me it makes it SUPER easy to apply, layer, and get a fuller lip look using such an applicator like this. The Bad…. Sadly, I was every so slightly disappointed with the packaging. It feels like they spent more effort working on the outer packaging that the gloss comes in (which you’ll toss out or keep if you’re a hoarder like me) than they did with the actual gloss package. The TokiDoki images aren’t anywhere on the actual tube of gloss and you’re only privy to the brand name. The actual character in the (I got Samba a sweet little monkey) cap is adorable but is covered in chunky pieces of shiny confetti so you can barely see him. As much as I adore the taste and feel of the gloss on my lips its incredibly short wearing! The gloss slides off your mouth within mere minutes of putting it on. If you layer it you may get an hour out of it but no more than that. Who might love it? Tokidoki fans! Beauty junkies that adore kawaii packaging! Fans of super glossy gloss! Anybody who adores a yummie smelling, tasty gloss. Who might hate it? Women who like their gloss to wear all day! Anyone sensitive to heavily fragranced makeup. Anyone not interested in cute packaging that could be deemed immature. Final Thoughts…… This had the potential for greatness written all over it but sadly the wear time really kills the deal. I still love it but I’m quietly trying to justify to myself if I need more colors because honestly its like buying the same gloss over and over again since the shades are all transparent with zero pigmentation and the only difference is the cute packaging. I like it alot and think its worth getting at least one but I wouldn’t go too crazy and purchase several as they will all pretty much perform the same way. Very nice but has a few flaws. Anyone try? Share your mini review! Available at Sephora.

"[""Because You’re Not Beautiful Without Dior! By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 2 Comments in Beauty Abroad , Dior Dior cosmetics (and couture) are an important part of my addiction! I’ve been collecting and storing palettes from Dior since as long as I can possibly remember (My mind isn’t as quick as it once was! I’m being wry so deal with it!). Dior has always held my heart in its very hand when it comes to clothing (not that any of it fits my wobbly body), accessories, and cosmetics. Since cosmetics and accessories are affordable (somewhat) and aren’t a size zero I can indulge my sweet tooth! I’m writing to tell you, dear friends, if you are a Dior addict (you already know this if you’re a dior crack addict so just smile and nod for the new people) or you plan on becoming a Dior addict you must remember this simple rule of thumb. Got a pen and paper handy? Ok here is the rule: BUY YOUR DIOR ABROAD! That is all. It’s even easy to remember but write it down anyway just in case! Now Dior stateside is interesting, it’s cheaper too! But Dior abroad is exotic and wonderful and rare! Oh la la! In all seriousness I sometimes purchase two of the same palettes the reason being I will get to shortly, one stateside and one from either the UK or Asia. Now while I was in England in April the Dior Flight palette had just popped up stateside and UK side! I did see it prior to leaving for the UK but decided I’d buy one in London because you see I KNEW THE RULE (that damn rule sure is handy isn’t it?)! The UK flight palette is about twice as lovely as the US one! The differences are very subtle and nothing as dramtic as the Dior Confidential fiasco (if you’re an addict you know what I’m talking about, if not, google baby google). Here you can see the two palette color choices: This is my palette (Grab a tissue I don’t want you drooling all over! And whatever you do, DON’T breath on it!): I choose not to buy 001 because I think the UK’s 002 version is far superior in color! 001 is very drown out, dark, and dank. Where as the 002 version had brighter colors, nicer shadow, and prettier glosses! Am I tempted to purchase 001? Yes I am. This time I didn’t succumb to my sickness and just stuck with the one palette! The little voices in my head told me go and get 001! Just do it! Buy it! But for once..I didn’t listen! Oh sorry you wanted to know WHY do I buy one palette abroad and one stateside right? Simple answer. I’m sick. In the head. Shoes! Shoes! Shoes! By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in Fashion , Hauls , Shoes You know that adventure we take every season into the darkness of our closets? The ones where we pull out all our winter clothes and make room for our spring and summer ones? Well this year during my plunge into the darkness of my closet I had told myself…promised myself….that I’d not buy another pair of shoes for a really long time! As I tore through my closet I came upon shoe after shoe after shoe after shoe….I have enough for everyone in the US by now and maybe a few extra pairs for people living in Europe! This weekend I took Mai to the Palisades Mall and my strong will to not purchase any shoes…somehow…left me! I’m thinking that since they are cute shoes I haven’t REALLY broken any promises to myself right? I mean technically if it’s cute that eliminates the need for willpower and any promises made are void! My weekend haul: Soooooooo Sexy! These are my total fav of the lot! I have a similiar pair but these have more strap to ’em! A perfect size 7! Very geeky shoe moment but I adore these! Will go perfect with my “ There’s no place like 127.0.0.1? T-Shirt Victoria’s Secret, Not Just for Knickers! By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in Hauls , Victoria's Secret I must say that I’m duly impressed with Victoria’s Secret’s beauty efforts as of late! I’ve always been a pretty ok fan of their Bath and Body line and perfume selections but not so much the cosmetics. As of late they have introduced some pretty interesting items that even caught my snobbish eye. I must say this summer many of the interesting little pieces they came out with have ended up in my collection! The beauty department at VS has evolved from simple mosaic blushes, shadows, and glosses to an array of slick black packaged compacts! I was tempted by quite a little pile of goodies this season! I haven’t yet tried them all, this girl has too much to get through and sometimes forgets what she has, but I will review what I’ve used so far! I’ve included a bit of cosmetic porn from my collection to feast your eyes on as well! Sparkling Diamond Collection I’ve tried all of the new Diamond collection items and I must say overall they are pretty nice, inexpensive too! The entire collection consists of 3 Shadows, 4 Lipglosses, 1 Blush, and 1 Sparkling Powder. I ended up with 1 gloss out of the 4, all the shadows, the powder, and the blusher. I’ve tried a majority of it out for size but have yet to try the blusher! I’m sorta saving it for some reason or another, I don’t know why, who the hell knows how my mind works! The gloss is super sparkly and really glides on smooth! Not tacky, not sticky! Really a great layer to some lip stain or lipstick. The shadows aren’t a favorite of mine. Color is not pigmented at all, if you’re looking at the jar and thinking “Wow what a cute blue sparkle”, think again! I got blue, green, and pink and none have given my eye any color or pop! The great thing about them is they do give you a truly great sparkle but only when layered with an eyeshadow that has color. These seem to be weak in the color department on their very own! Sparkling Diamond Eye Shadow Now the two best pieces of this collection have got to be the Diamond Sparkling Powder and Blush! The claim is (which I don’t believe for a single second) that the powder, shadows, and blush contain “real” crushed diamonds. Ummm yea right. But ANYWAY….whether or not they contain real crushed diamonds is to be determined (I’ve taken them to the lab and I’m awaiting the test results). The Sparkling Powder is truly a wonderful edition to your collection and is just perfect for anywhere. Eyes, Cheeks, Body, you name it! Personally I like using it on my eyes for some hardcore sparkle or my cheeks. I also tried it on my lips and it looks awesome! Sparkling Diamond Powder The blush I haven’t tried yet but I can tell it’s going to be a favorite of mine too! It’s heavy duty in the sparkle department and it looks like it’ll give out nice color! We shall see when I get around to taking it out of my beauty vault and using it. For now I just take it out at night, whisper to it how much I love it, polish it, and put it back under lock and key. Sparkling Diamond Blush Ok..so that’s the Diamond Collection girls! Now another interesting line up from VS is the new Bare Bronze Collection. This consisted of a few nice palettes but if you read my prior blogs you understand that bronze, tans, bronzing, etc…are NOT my THING ! Now, to go back on my earlier judgment of hating bronzing bits and pieces I decided to purchase two of the eye palettes from this collection. To my delight I am in love with both! They have a touch of shimmer to them and are pigmented enough for even the snobbiest of snobs to love! Bare Bronze Collection Bare Bronze Collection The collection also included glosses, bronzer powders, and lipstick palettes! The only thing that really appealed to me was the shadow palettes. A majority of the collection is on sale right now during the Semi-Annual so you might want to skip your way to VS or see the online catalog to nab a deal or two or three..or four! My final purchase was part of another new collection VS put out (WOW they are going nuts now aren’t they?)! As an extension to the Angel Perfume line they have now created an Angel makeup collection which they entitled Heavenly Face. This isn’t too big a collection but it’s sweet none the less! It included two double cream blushes, one shadow quad, and two double ended glosses. I ended up with the palette only as I’m a fiend for shadow quads! I haven’t used it yet but I did swipe my finger across one of the shadows and it has nice texture and a tad bit of shimmer to it! The packaging screams cuteness! Heavenly Faces Collection Heavenly Faces Collection So kids the moral of today’s story is, Victoria’s Secret has evolved and is introducing new and exciting products in the cosmetics world and making addicts like myself gag with wanting! It’s not just for knickers anymore ? Victoria’s Secret wants you to purchase your beauty, bath and body, fragrance, AND panties from them! Get shopping! Nab some deals!

"['Benefit That Gal Review By Isabella Muse on July 25, 2007 8 Comments in Benefit Benefit has gone and stolen money from me again! I’ve been conned, I’ve been had, I’ve been hoodwinked (a little drama never hurt anyone)! Benefit is such a hit or miss company that it never fails to fascinate me how they can make some seriously awesome products and in the blink of an eye come out with a piece of shit product that has absolutely no use! I have some really mega staples from Benefit in my train case that if I was thrown on a desert island and they said I could only have a few cosmetics, these items would be with me! I continue to buy Benefit cosmetics because I enjoy the emotional lottery! Sometimes I buy it and it’s freaking amazing and I can’t live without it and sometimes I buy it and I feel like I should have taken my money and lit a match to it! In all seriousness Benefit makes some amazing items! I can’t live without (I’m talking about throwing myself off the Empire State Building if I can’t get these products!!!!) Bo-ing , Dandelion , Lemon-Aid , Maybe Baby , and Get Even ! Some items I’ve thrown away cash on and almost (not quite but almost) wanted to slit my wrists over were Dr. Feelgood (Can you say acne in a cute compact? This makes me break out like I’m 14 again!) , Not On My Pillow Which I don’t even think they make anymore! One season and it’s not in the catalog anymore! That shows you how hard it sucks!), Badgal Lash (OH MY GOD! Worse Mascara EVER!), Dallas (If you enjoy looking like you played in the mud this is the blush for you!), High Beam….oh my word this list is huge! I guess I should say that even though my list of items I don’t like is long, I do believe that my list of loves makes up for the crummy products I’ve tried from Benefit! Weirdly enough some or even most of the ones I don’t like appear on their best seller list so I guess I’m a nit picker and everyone else is really digging them! Who knows really?! Last week I read on Make-Up Bag about the newest addition to Benefit’s family! Behold! Another shit product from Benefit! I applaud your efforts Benefit but this stuff SUCKS! I want my money back damnit! Benefit Says: Go from dull to darling with “that gal.” It’s a silky pink primer that makes skin appear smoother & brighter. Wear alone for clear complexion radiance or apply before makeup for smooth, effortless application. Re-brighten during the day with “that gal.” It’s the “that gal” perfection for a happy complexion. Excitement doesn’t even begin to explain what I felt when I read this little blurb about “That Gal” from Benefit! I was racing around in circles at the prospect of something that would give me the appearance of brighter, healthier looking skin! Honestly I had put this product up with possibly being as great as Get Even or Bo-ing!!!! I couldn’t race to the website fast enough to order me some! And I got it…. And it sucks…. Sigh….. I used it several ways upon receiving it! First time I tried it on a clean, foundation free face! I got absolutely no brighness, nothing. It’s pale pink in color but it goes on completely sheer. It was almost like using High Beam minus the shimmer! That’s ok. I’d do it a different way! It would work if I tried it with foundation! Yes, that’s the key! Fast forward to the next morning! I applied my foundation and proceeded to apply “That Gal”….um…ya….nothing. No brightness, no visble change what so ever to my face. It’s ok! I knew if I packed it in my make-up case and used it as a touch up tool it would work then for sure! Fast forward some more…….. Noon Time Make-Up Touch Up. I got out my Mineral Veil Compact and was just about to apply when it struck me that I’d forgotten about “That Gal!” I’d use it for a touch up as recommend by Benefit! So I shoved my compact back into my purse and proceeded to touch up using “That Gal”…. Umm…. Hmm…. Ya….. I think I mentioned this before…. Nothing. So the moral of today’s story kids is that Benefit has created yet another product that has absolutely no use to me! I know Benefit will gladly take it back and give me my money but I don’t have the time to bother shipping it back so I just slapped it on MUA for some poor soul to experience! This one is another miss for Benefit! You may also enjoy...

"['Bare Minerals Loud & Clear Lip Sheer Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on January 8, 2013 33 Comments in Bare Escentuals , Lip Balm , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Spring Collections 2013 , Swatches As you know Bare Minerals launched three Loud & Clear Lip Sheers with their new Remix Collection for Spring 2013. Loud & Clear Lip Sheer is a sweet little tinted lip balm that quite reminds me of one my favorite vintage products from Bare Minerals, the Lip Bud. Unsure how many folks remember the Lip Bud but it was very similiar to the Loud & Clear Lip Sheers and I stock piled them all crazy-like and still have one lonely one left. Needless to say the introduction of these new Lip Sheers was met with much excitement by yours truly. Let’s take a look! Although my Lip Bud looks a little larger both products actually house the same 0.07 oz of product. I think they are a kindly $15 and I would happily buy more of them if Bare Escentuals choose to do new shades. I’m unsure if these are limited edition and I’d like to think they aren’t because they are fabulous little balms well worth picking up. Lip Bud Released several years ago These are a tinted lip balm that have a translucent appearance in the tube. They apply with the barest hint of color but enough color that you can see it on lips. I love natural tinted lip balms that give the appearance of just the right amount of color without overdoing things. These give exactly that sort of finish. It’s not necessarily an MLBB (my lips but better) look but it is natural and fresh so you can tell you have something on your lips but not exactly what that something might be…”is it tinted? Or is that her natural lip color?” These have a comfortably lightweight balm-y texture on my lips. They provide a decent bit of moisture through the first application and well into the wear of three to four hours. They glide onto lips with a soft, smooth, buttery texture and providing not only a hint of tint but also a very lovely bit of shine. They have a really fresh and exciting tangerine scent and taste. I absolutely loved it. It’s pretty strong and remains flavorful through the wear. The flavor reminds me of one of those old school frozen orange ice pops. Tangerine Trance Berry Remix Amped Pink Berry Remix, Tangerine Trance, Amped Pink If you love tinted lip balm products I know these will find a way into your stashes and heart. I loved ’em. Overall, an excellent way to get a bit of color and shine on lips while keeping them soft, smooth, and hydrating. Tangerine Trance Berry Remix Amped Pink Muse Approved!

Too Faced Starry-Eyed Mini Glitter Eyeliner Gift Set contains four of their popular glitter eyeliners tucked into a cute mini gift set ready for gift giving (or just keep it for yourself, you know you want it!)! I always find it difficult getting through a full size of glitter eyeliner so this set was the ideal item to add to my stash of cosmetics. The set includes not one shade but four! Sweet! What’s not to love about getting four in one set right? I’m pretty partial to anything that contains glitter and shimmer (as if you didn’t already know) so completing my holiday looks with a bit of glitter liner is pure perfection as far as this Muse is concerned! The set includes all of the following: Ohh & Aah (Black & Silver) Super Freak (Hot Pink) Mad Mad Love (Baby Pink) Stalkerazzi (Golden Brown) The applicators are thin and dense for precise application of a nice straight line across the lash line leaving behind a trail of shimmering goodness! Each set comes in a pink box which sports a cute little tag in the back with To: and From: fields. The Muse’s reads: To: the Muse From: the Muse, Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas gorgeous! Teehee ! Too Faced Starry-Eyed Mini Glitter Eyeliner Gift Set is $25 USD which works out to around $6 or so per a liner! Not a bad deal considering one full size is $17.50 and that price only gets you one liner so for $25 you can have four shades! W00t! The Muse makes the idea of hauling so easy with her swift and clever mathematics doesn’t she? The moral of this story is that I loves anything that’s mini and Too Faced Starry-Eyed Mini Glitter Eyeliner Gift Set is on my favorite list for Holiday Gift giving to you, from you!

"['Bourjois Paris Fond de Teint Pinceau Bourjois Paris Brush Foundation Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on December 4, 2008 4 Comments in Bourjois Paris , Swatches I’m somewhat obsessed with Bourjois Paris foundations so when I seen the new Bourjois Paris Brush Foundation aka Bourjois Paris Fond de Teint Pinceau I knew I must haves it immediately. Lucky for the Muse her kindly friend from across the pond, Lauren , volunteered her time to nab me one! In the vein of Too Faced Magic Wand Illuminating Foundation , Bourjois Paris Brush Foundation is pretty much the same concept with a cheaper price tag! At around $15 USD or so the price can’t be beat for the quality of the product however I do like the Too Faced version a tiny bit more for one main reason which I’ll explain shortly. The foundation comes in a large click style pen with a brush on one end and a depressor on the other. Click a few times and foundation will flow freely into the brush allowing you to brush on your foundation and blend into place. I find the brush is useless (same with the Too Faced one!) for blending so I normally just swipe where I need foundation and blend with clean fingers. The brush isn’t the greatest quality in the world and a tad bit scratchy however after it’s wet with the foundation the scratchiness does go away and it feels alot smoother and softer on the skin! Now considering you probably tote powder around with you but not liquid foundation this is a nice little item to have as it’s quite portable without any mess! If you need a bit of touch up during the day whip out and go to town! However, since the brush doesn’t do a fab job of blending you may not feel it’s completely portable friendly! The formula is a good deal more watery in consistency when compared to the Too Faced version however this didn’t bother me to much as it blends beautifully well and gives light coverage . I don’t particularly recommend this if you have alot to cover up as coverage is light to medium. I personally don’t use a whole lot of foundation on my face anyway so one click is enough for me to smooth around and create a good working canvas for my other makeup. Now the foundation has all but one fault with it. It covers nicely and gives a good fresh look to any dullness that’s residing on my face. I have the lightest color selection which is 31 Beige and this suits me well as it lightens and brightens up my face beautifully. Now these are the strong points of the product however after application of the foundation I get a powder-like dry down which mattifies my face a bit too much. Right now my face is already on overkill dryness and this manages to make my face feel tight. Also it pretty much shouts foundation! As soon as I apply and blend it casts a certain glow to my face that indeed says I’m “made up”. I’m chalking this effect up to the fact that my skin is so dry right now. The bad news is I probably can’t use this at the moment however I do look forward to retrying it in the Summer when my skin is oily. Perhaps then I’ll be quite happy with it. I did feel that the Too Faced version was far more richer, moisturizing, and thicker plus my skin seemed to soak all that goodness up and create a flawless and natural look. Further news on the up side of things…… I also happened to enjoy how very fresh smelling this is! The foundation has a rather nice fresh scent which actually lingers around for a while after application. Quite nice as I kinda like my cosmetics to smell good. All in all I think it’s not bad at all for the price and will be a great light foundation for Summer-wear however my skin no likey at the moment. I’m not Muse Approving it for purchase since I’m unsure how it’ll work in the warmer weather so maybe expect another look at this when the Summer sets in! On a side note Bourjois Paris Brush Foundation is not yet available in the US and I can’t honestly say when it’ll be available if ever. If you’d like to try it I do recommend visiting MUA or your makeup forum of choice and asking a friendly Brit for a CP. Anyone tried Bourjois Brush Foundation yet? Love or hate? Tell the Muse!

"['Avon Color Rich 24K Gold Lipstick Review, Swatches, and FOTD By Isabella Muse on December 5, 2008 7 Comments in Avon , Face of the Day , Swatches Remember the Avon Color Rich 24K Gold Lipstick I was telling you about? Turns out it’s something rather special! I do so highly suggest checking these out for yourself from Avon as they are truly good and inexpensive to boot! Each tube is $4.99 USD and contains a beautiful sparkling shade of highly moisturizing and pigmented lip color. Who can’t love that price? The shades all contain a healthy dose of gold shimmering flecks which ends up intensifying the color of the lipstick and making your lips gleam and shine! Gorgeous! I tried two shades but I’m heading back for more shortly as truly they are gorgeous. The two colors I tried were Ruby in Gold and Golden Wine. Ruby in Gold is a beautiful deep peach a la my favorite MAC Lipglass Pink Grapefruit (I know, I know you’re tiring of hearing about Pink Grapefruit already!). Now Gold Wine had me terrified when I first seen it! The shade takes vampy up a few notches to say the least. In the tube it’s a deep, dark almost black cherry shade….terrifying….but it applies maroon with tiny flecks of gold! Gorgeous! If you ask which shade I like more I couldn’t possibly say as they are both beautiful. For the price and the great quality I’m slapping a Muse Approved sticker on ’em! I loves ’em and thinks you will to! If you’re looking for that perfect sparkling lippie for the Holiday Season with a nice price tag, look no further Avon Color Rich 24K Gold Lipstick has you covered! Snag yours by clicking here!

"['Avon Glazewear Diamond Lipstick Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on December 9, 2008 Leave a Comment in Avon , Beauty on a Budget , Holiday Collections 2008 , Swatches Last week I was excited about the prospect of 24K Gold in my lipstick! This morning I’m excited that I get diamonds in my lipstick too…… Damn, life is good. I got alot of requests for Beauty Budget finds and I hope so far I’ve given you what you want. Look at your Muse giving you gold and diamonds at a budget price….doesn’t it make you love her more than evers before? Avon Glazewear Diamond Lipstick is $8 USD and delivers a dazzling diamond finish with a moisturizing, pigmented formula. As much as I loved the new Avon 24K Gold Lipstick I have to say that the formula of the Avon Glazewear Diamond Lipstick is positively dreamy and creamy when compared with it. The formula is so buttery smooth and just glides on beautifully. The finish is so glossy smooth and gorgeous that gloss is completely optional. The color I tried was Ruby Slippers which is a peachy pink shade that makes my skin absolutely glow. The finish has a hint of silver diamond-like shimmer but nothing overly done, it’s a barely noticable shimmer. For the most part I felt like the finish was that of a gloss rather than a lipstick. I can’t say enough good things about the wonderful formula. Color payoff is equally excellant and the product is nicely pigmented. If you’re looking for a nice inexpensive lipstick with a glossy finish, a touch of shimmer, and great color pay off I highly recommend nabbing one of Avon Glazewear Diamond Lipsticks for yourself! The Muse Approves ’em and thinks they are a rather great find. Click for color selection!

"['Prescriptives Flawless Skin Total Protection Concealer Review By Isabella Muse on December 10, 2008 Leave a Comment in Prescriptives , Swatches Continuing my concealer coverage I’ve been trying out Prescriptives Flawless Skin Total Protection Concealer. Now not all of my concealers contain SPF so I was quite delighted when I noticed that Prescriptives Flawless Skin Total Protection Concealer had an SPF of 25. I’m sitting and raking my brain (which isn’t working very well the past week or so) trying to recall a single concealer in my arsenal that sports such a high SPF 25 and I can’t think of a single one…..Hmmmm….I love the fact that it conceal and offers SPF for my delicate eye area! Sweet! If you’re a fan of Benefit Boi-ing (the Muse’s holiest of holy grail concealers) this is pretty comparable in formula and coverage. Taking into consideration that Bobbi Brown’s line up of concealers is highly moisturizing and emollient you may seek something a bit more drier in texture if you’re skin is oily or you’re just not loving a formula such as Bobbi’s. Prescriptives Flawless Skin Total Protection Concealer is quite a good deal drier but still manages to remain creamy while offering medium to full coverage. If you love Benefit Boi-ing but you are finding coverage isn’t enough or disappointed that it’s only available in three shades this would be a good duplicate with more color options and just about the same formula plus pigmented enough to hide all your woes. I actually loved this as it creates good flawless coverage under my eyes without creasing, pilling, or fading. It pretty much lasts all day with little to no touch ups in between. Sadly, if I don’t prep properly it does have a nasty habit of drying my eye area out drastically which is the reason I stopped using Boi-ing. I’m unsure if I’d recommend it for older eyes, fine lines, or dry eyes as the formula can age eyes if you haven’t properly prepped. I think it blends quite well but I really do need to moisturize heavily with both an eye cream and a serum prior to use. I’ll continue using the compact I currently have but I probably will debate with myself should I need to repurchase just because my eyes are so terribly dry and can’t take this particular formula. I so love my Benefit Boi-ing and I honestly felt like the Prescriptives Flawless Skin Total Protection Concealer was a near perfect dupe for it…mmmm..if we can just have a bit more of a creaminess to the formula that may help solve the problem of my dry under eye woes! All in all I’d recommend checking this out if you have normal to oily skin minus any dryness. I think coverage is excellent for hiding small to large problems. It does a great job of refreshing the eye area and making it brighter and more awake.

"['Lipstick Queen Sinner Shine Hardcore Gloss Review By Isabella Muse on December 12, 2008 2 Comments in Lipstick Queen , Swatches Billy Joel told me he’d much rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints so the Muse did just that this morning! She sinned with Lipstick Queen Sinner Shine Hardcore Gloss and sure did like all that sinning! Supposedly only the good die young so I might as we be bad and sin my way through the day with gorgeous, shiny, plump, juicy lips! The Muse knows a thing or two or maybe three about gloss. She’s tried her fair share of ’em over the years and she even located one or two (or a million) that she loves but she’s never, ever, in all her year’s as a cosmetic junkie came across such a gloss as Lipstick Queen Sinner Shine Hardcore Gloss. Whoa. I’ve never seen a gloss this thick, this shiny, this glossy, this pigmented….sheesh…..tis like I’ve struck the lipgloss lottery! If you’ve been searching for that perfect gloss to give you Angelina lips or maybe you prefer the Dr. Frank N. Furter look this is the gloss for you! I think we have all established by now the entire lip plumping craze really isn’t about the “sting” but more about the texture and formula of the gloss. Thicker glosses create fuller looking lips! Lipstick Queen Sinner Shine Gloss has an amazingly thick formula which glides onto lips leaving behind a glossy, shiny finish and adding a sexy plump to lips. My lips are at least double the size this morning but I promise it’s not a bad Amanda Lepore look! Although the formula is quite a good deal sticky and tacky I don’t mind in the least as it does hold the gloss in place for long periods of time without having to touch up every two seconds because it’s slipping off my mouth onto my chin. Put it on and it stays on for hours at a time. I used it last night prior to heading to the movies and it lasted through a trip to the theater, through a two hour film, through a large Dr. Pepper Slurpee, a pack of Twizzlers, and back home…..looking at myself in the mirror a few hours later and my gloss was still going strong. The color Wine Sinner is a deeper peach shade on me. The swatch on the site looks more like a wine shade but I honestly felt like it looked more like a peachy brown shade on my lips. The gloss comes in a nice heavy plastic jar which is quite large so it’s $22 USD price tag is well, well worth it. I was quite impressed with the size of the product as I was expecting a smaller size but this is huge. The gloss has a faint lemon flavor that’s reminds me of Philosophy’s Kiss Me Gloss. I can’t begin to rave enough about the amazing formula. It’s pigmented enough to work perfectly well on it’s own plus it’s highly emollient and moisturizing. Chalk up Lipstick Queen Sinner Shine Hardcore Gloss as a total Muse Approved gloss for purchase! You needs it! My only minor rant is the fact it only comes in 7 shades! Can we has more shades please? Thank you! Sportin’ Lipstick Queen Sinner Shine Hardcore Gloss in Wine Sinner The Muse likey and says you must have it for yourself! Check them out at lipstickqueen.com If you’re wanting to try a few shades at once you can nab yourself the Lipstick Queen Limited Edition Shine Holiday Kit which includes four mini Lipstick Queen Sinner Shine Hardcore Glosses for $24 USD! This is quite a nice deal and I’m adding it to my cart as I want a few more shades! All in all I really loved Lipstick Queen Sinner Shine Hardcore Gloss and was very impressed with the fantastic quality. It’s been a while since a gloss wow’ed me and this definitely knocked my socks well off! Check ’em out! The Muse thinks you’ll love them!

The new Limited Edition Bobbi Brown Lip and Eye Palette contains an array of naturally beautiful shades for creating that perfect party look with a tiny bit of pop and a whole lot of elegance. The palette contains four Bobbi Brown Creamy Lip Colors and four Bobbi Brown Metallic Eyes Shadows in a slick, black compact. I loved the design of the palette as it has the lip colors on top with a pull out draw housing the shadows so everything is kept nice and tidy. The draw designed to hold the shadows pulls out easily and houses the shadows nice and tight. The shadows are all gorgeous colors with a nice metallic almost shimmery like finish. The shades are all very use friendly and aren’t in the least bit bold or scary so you’ll be getting a soft, natural look from each shade. I wouldn’t say the shadows are necessarily the same in color but I do feel like you can’t combine them to create different looks. The shadows each have an individual color and combining them does nothing but create muddy shades so I would suggest using each shade individually. The $60 USD price tag may be a bit discouraging when faced with only four looks that can be arranged from the four included colors however I took all this into consideration and still felt like it was well worth the price since the looks you can create are truly lovely. I was a bit put off by the lip colors as I was expecting the same soft, buttery formula that I was recently treated to when I purchased the Bobbi Brown Pink Satin Collection. However, the formula on these was a bit hard and the colors weren’t too pigmented. They weren’t particularly easy to apply and didn’t feel as soft as the ones I originally tried. I was a bit let down by this but after applying and playing around a bit I was happy with how they looked on so I decided to disregard the crummy formula. The palette contains a lip brush and a shadow brush. Both of which are mini size and fabulous in my opinion. Be it large or small I’m always very impressed with Bobbi Brown Makeup Brushes. I’m particularly a big fan of her lip brushes! Both brushes make applying everything a snap and it doesn’t take a ton of skill or drama to achieve a soft, flattering, work friendly look using the brushes, shadows, and lip colors! The shadows included in the palette are: Champagne Quartz (Shimmering beige with touches of pink) Gold Dust (Shimmering Gold) Golden Bronze (Shimmering fleshy peach) Galaxy (Shimmering gray with a touch of a black) The lip colors included in the palette are: Berry Mauve (Berry Pink) Pink Sequin (Sheer Peach) Dusty Mauve (Mauve with a heavy dose of brown) Ruby (Off Red almost maroon) I’ve reviewed the Metallic Eye Shadows prior to this and it deserves to be mentioned again how great the formula is. For one of my looks below I actually decided to apply wet and I have to say I love how it intensifies the color and gives a foil finish when the shadow is applied this way. I honestly can’t begin to tell you about my lips. All my looks below are created using everything in the palette but I mixed, combined, and cocktailed all the colors together to create the shades hehe so I’m unsure what I’m wearing! I think that mixing them all together kinda creates some rather nice shades rather than wearing them alone. Gold Dust applied wet Galaxy Golden Bronze All in all I absolutely loved this palette! It’s not loud or bold or vibrant but it does create some very soft, flattering looks that are ideal for work or a Holiday party! If you’re scared of bolder shades this will be a perfect pick for creating natural, elegant looks for the season! This one gets a big Muse Approval for purchase! Very worth it and a truly great palette, possibly my favorite of all the Bobbi Brown palettes I’ve tried as of late!

"['Art Deco Eyeshadow Base Review By Isabella Muse on December 16, 2008 16 Comments in Art Deco , Beauty Abroad , Swatches The Muse has a special knack for feeding into the frenzy of a hyped up products. She can successfully purchase said hyped product and convince herself how truly wonderful it is when in fact it’s utter garbage. For the past few days she’s been trying to convince herself how awesome Art Deco Eyeshadow Base is and failing miserably. After careful thought and consideration she’s decided it was about time to admit to herself that truly this stuff was absolute rubbish. How sad. After hearing the hype, reading the hype, and being fed the frenzy of all the amazing benefits and virtues of Art Deco Eyeshadow Base, the Muse decided she needed some for her very self. After all, according to makeup gurus far and wide, this stuff was ambrosia from the Gods above. Umm…not so much. Art Deco Eyeshadow Base is around $9-$10 USD and comes in a rather cute little jar a la MAC Paint Pots. The packaging could likely get you so hyper that you’ll forget what a crap product is actually inside. The Muse has fallen victim to such cases in the past but with this particular product she actually did admit to herself that indeed Art Deco Eyeshadow Base needs alot of work to hit the right note. Aside from it’s cute jar style packaging it doesn’t have too much going for it. The base is a creamy beige shade which applies transparent to the lid of the eye even though swatched it has a bit of a pearl almost iridescent finish. It does successfully deepen some shadows while doing nothing for others. Why this is, the Muse may never know, chalk it up as another makeup mystery of the world. After four uses with four different styles of shadow I found new love and respect for my Urban Decay Primer Potion. Art Deco Eyeshadow Primer does not hold my shadow all day, does not make a perfect base for shadows but it does successfully crease my shadow, make it melt off in cakey gobs, and successfully creates a very real mess. The product blends beautifully well and it does make applying my shadows a bit easier especially shimmery ones where fall out is a problem however it doesn’t do much for making my shadow last longer. The somewhat good news is that the base does successfully hold the shadow for a few hours however creasing begins quite quickly which leads up to your shadow becoming a cakey mess and finally ending with no shadow at all as it migrates all over the place. I wouldn’t say the product makes my lids oily however the base does turn into a bit of an oily mess which is where the creasing problems stem from I think. It applies quite well however after a few hours you’ll end up with a serious mess. After 3 hours…hello hot mess! I wanted to love this one and I had some seriously high hopes for it. Sadly, it has little to redeem it and just didn’t work well for this Muse. I’m unsure if I was just my dislike of the product or I’m overacting as it does seriously sport some great reviews up and around makeup forums. Personally, big waste of money for me…I’ll continue trying to use it and see if it gets better but for now it’s a bit thumbs down for this Muse! Tried Art Deco Eyeshadow Base? Do you love it? Hating it? Tell the Muse! If anyone is interested I do have an extra, brand new in the box pot that I’m selling for $12 USD! E-mail me if you’d like to take it off my hands and see if it lives up to all the hype!

"['Trendy Threads for The Curvy Chick By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 3 Comments in Fashion If you haven’t figured it out yet (You’re REALLY slow if you still haven’t noticed this) I’m short and round! This means society has fit me into cute little headings like “cute and chubby”, “big and beautiful”, etc…etc… God lord…. Anyway, I decided a long time ago even though I didn’t win the looks/weight lottery I could still work around what I do have and try to glam it up as much as humanly possible (this stuff takes alot of work people! Hours actually!)! Thankfully a few select shops have remembered us small, round chicks and decided that it was a good idea to invest some time into creating clothes for us! PHEW! Saved! One such shop goes by the name of Torrid! Thank you Torrid for remembering that all girls are not created equal and some of us are height challenged as well as blessed with wobble and jiggle! Torrid appears to want to keep the select few of my species happy by creating trendy little fashion bitlets for us! Now Torrid is a problem for me, Yes Yes Yes! I know you’re asking yourself why I am already ranting when just two seconds ago I was raving! The problem is when I go into Torrid or happen to wander onto the website I end up coming away with more clothes that I don’t possibly need! I already have enough clothes and shoes to keep a small village warm for a few years! Adding more to that pile is pretty much like suicide! Today, as I was happily sipping my cuppa, my genius, witty, clever mind decided that it might just be a good idea to have a look at Torrid’s website. Why not? What could it hurt? My feeble little mind convinced itself that since I’d be going to England either in August or this fall (hopefully sooner than later) I’d need new clothes! Now I never need an excuse for purchasing new clothes, shoes, accessories, or make-up but I had promised myself to calm my little self down and take a deep breath before purchasing stuff I don’t need! Now this never works as the little voices inside my head are strong with the force . However, today the force was quite heavy and it convinced me that I did indeed need to have a few little items for my upcoming trip! My tiny, really small, ickle, little order: It’s rare that I like to wear a dress but occasionally you’ll see me flirting around with one! This order included quite a few dresses that I’ve been wanting to buy forever and today seemed a good day to do it! Oh My God! I wanna twirl in this! I already had the stockings, might as well get the skirt! The moral of today’s blog kids is even if you’re a larger lady you can still have fun with your looks and be as fashionable as your heart desires (contrary to what society and the surgeon general says)! Work with your mama gave you! Now…I need some new shoes…Hmmm…… MAC Tendertones Review By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in MAC MAC Tendertones Color Story Sexier on the lips than balm. Silkier than gloss. More protective than naked. A lipcolour that combines soft shine, easy glide, and double-smooth satin finish with an everyday sun protective formula. To treat your lips…Love ’em tender. That blurb is taken directly from the MAC website and it’s the biggest crock of shit ever! Don’t you love when I’m being right properly unladylike with my colorful vocabulary? I know you adore it! I gotta say I’m not big on the lip gelees, the lipglasses, and the glosses in general from MAC. I’m a MAC whore but I’ll go right ahead and diss the glosses from here to Central America. They don’t rock my world. Sticky, gooey, and just gross come to mind. Do I use them? Yea. Do I buy them? Yea. Why? I dunno, I’m sick, we established that already. I do give a hearty thumbs up to MAC’s plushglass but that’s another story for another day as I say! Now when I first heard about Tendertones I was excited (when don’t I get excited at the prospect of new gloss?)! I think I idolized Tendertones to the status of Lancome’s Juicy Gelee Gloss ! I was thinking smooth, glossy, wonderfully sheer color, moisturizing, porn star lips! (Did I just say porn stay? I guess I did. Deal with it!) Nope. None of those things apply to this gloss. I should have known. I ended up purchasing 4 of the colors and although, they are happily making friends with the rest of the glosses in my collection, they are in no way a favorite of mine. They are sheer. Very sheer. I expected some color. I was thinking I could apply without lipstain under it. Not happening. I need stain under the gloss otherwise I get plain fleshy colored lips with some sticky gloss slapped on. It’s sticky. Again, I should have known. It doesn’t surprise me. MAC always has a special knack for putting out the thickest, stickiest glosses around. I feel like my lips are glued shut wearing this stuff. They smell yummie and they taste equally lovely but that’s about the only thing going for them! The pot is huge for the price another plus. To be honest while I was browsing them I was somewhat in awe and was almost to the point of purchasing the entire lot, because, again, I’m sick like that. But I’m glad I ended up with 4 colors and didn’t get too crazy. To be honest if you’re considering purchasing any, my strongest suggestion is just go with one. They are so sheer that they all go on as the same color. So really, you may well be blinded with the array of colors on display but it doesn’t matter which you choose, all go on the same clear way! Boring Boring Boring! Low rating for me. Not interested at all. They’ll end up in the bottom of my traincase and one day I’ll pull them out and sell them on E-bay or swap them away on make-up alley . Not good at all. Good try MAC but keep trying! Because Shu Uemura Wants Your Lashes to be Pretty! By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 1 Comment in Shu Uemura Behold……. My New Shu Curler! The Mercedes Benz of Eyelash Curlers! I’ve read so many reviews about this curler over the course of the last two years that I can write a book about it! I’m blogging to tell you that IT IS all THAT and a bag of chips! This freaking thing is amazing! I got it in the mail today and I’ve been happily twirling around with it for the better half of an hour! I may never need to use mascara again (I’m exaggerating and getting caught up in the excitement of course)! I’ve used so many curlers that have promised me no pinch, perfect fit and all of them fail! The curler I’ve been using for the past year or so was purchased at Sephora and…mmmm it’s ok. It’s nothing to write home about. I don’t know why I never bothered ordering the Shu Uemura one. Customer Service knows me by name by now after the amount of orders I’ve placed but not ONCE had I thought to add this gorgeous tool into my shopping cart! Best money I’ve ever spent in my life! Truly! I can understand what it’s prefered by Asian girls. It really has a good straight line and fits the contour of the eye perfect. You can get it super close to your lash line, press down super hard, and no pain, no pinch just perfect full lashes each and everytime! There is a downfall friends. They only give two replacement pads. Once you go through both pads you have to shell out money for an entirely new curler. Really though one pad should get you through 2 years or so….and on the bright side I hear Shiseido’s replacement pads fit into this curler so that’s a plus. It’s been a while since I’ve been so impressed with a tool and this is now on my list of awesome items that I can’t do without! What’s that you say? Did I just order the curler? Come on now…you know me…..I couldn’t just buy the curler. I got some lovely blushes and a rogue unlimited because really you can never have too many Shu blushes! As for rogue unlimited I’m surprised I even located a color that I don’t already own ! I’m so digustingly diseased it’s not even funny anymore, I just can’t help myself ! My Entire Order Minus The Blessed Curler Thank You Mister Shu Uemura I bow down to your greatness once again!

"['Snow in the Summer By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 4 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Lush Ah snowcake… How I love thee! Let me count the ways! You smell so sweet and lovely! Truly if innocence were to smell it would be the sweet scent of snowcake! I’ve stocked piled. When I say stock piled, I MEAN stocked piled, snowcake perfume when it was released as a Limited Edition fragrance two years ago! I’ve enough snowcake perfume to last me three lifetimes ? If every someone were to ask me if I had a signature scent this would be what I’d choose! It’s such a gorgeous blend of cherries and almond and vanilla and just yummmmmmm! Every year around November snowcake pops up on Lush’s website and for about a blessed month of good cheer we are able to purchase her and stow her away for the many months she is not available for purchase! What Lush Says About Her: If we didn’t bring out a new batch of Snowcake every Christmas we’d probably be chased all the way to the North Pole by irate Lush customers. This almond scented, creamy smooth, gloriously luxurious body soap is such a favorite that we were forced into making a hand cream with the same perfume (Smitten, since you asked). If you’ve not tried it before, don’t miss your chance. Once Christmas has passed it won’t be back until next year. More of what Lush has to say about her (excuse me why I comfort myself with their words): Snowcake, rich and creamy with a scent of perfumed marzipan, is getting to be an essential in the Lush Christmas tradition. It’s back again for the Christmas holidays but if you’re one of our devoted Snowcake fans, make sure you get enough to last all year. It’s beautifully calming and soothing; rose and styrax are gentle and softening for your skin; just what you need when you’re feeling tired and emotional (I must say I’m feeling very emotional and she’s quite the comfort). What I say about her: I’m not the only person that goes absolutely wild for this creamy bar of soap! She has quite the cult following! Last year (and this year again) we were briefly introduced to her in body powder form! Again, I have stocked pile enough body powder to last me into the next 50 years of my life! At this point you are probably wondering why I am going on and on about her! This morning, I sadly cut into my last chunk of snowcake soap! Quite depressing moment! I need a hug! I normally buy an entire slab every single year and it lasts me well into November but this year I gave so much away to friends that I have none left for myself! Oh sadness! Woe! Sigh! What shall I do with myself until November? I have to make the chunk I have at the moment last well into the summer and fall! I cut my last slab into two pieces and tucked some away to take with me to the UK! I refuse to use it before that! Such agony….pain…..sadness….cue the music! I’ll make do. I’ll temporarily amuse myself with Smitten until I can purchase my beloved again! It’s going to be a long, hard road but I can do it! The good news is I still have about 10 Christmas Pud Bath Bombs and about 10 Snow Festival Bubble Bar Slices so at least I can bath in Snowcake! Weeeeeeeeeee! I can use a hug anyway though…keep ’em coming people! A Little of This, A Little of That! By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in Hauls , MAC , MuseTV , Stila Hi there ? I did a bit o’ video blogging when I popped in last night (or should I say this morning)! It was somewhat rushed and the pics came out crummy and such but I’m gonna slap it up here so you guys can get a feel for the new color stories! I picked up Novel Twist (Novel Twist’s video will be added later on today, tonight, or tomorrow!), Flashtronic, and Rushmetalyesterday! Wahoooooo! I got a nice little haul of bits and bobs that I’d thought I’d share with you guys in my second video blog! Enjoy! Just a note I checked on Sephora and it appears not 2 but 4 of these cute palettes were released from Stila! These are the other two: I am now coming down with that terrible diseased entitled “Must Collect Them All!”….Oh Lord! Somene save my soul! MAC Paint Pots Review with FOTD By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 2 Comments in Face of the Day , MAC Little bit of a review on MAC’s new Paint Pots plus an FOTD! Yay! Sooooooooooooooooooooo I ended up purchasing one of the Paint Pots yesterday! This is just an early release from Nordies basically! The rest of the colors will be popping up sometime in August from MAC! I only got one as a I said and that color was Delft which is an ocean green teal color! Not a big fan of cream shadows but I was curious so I went ahead and grabbed one! Mmmm…..I imagine people will love these…I don’t. The texture is a bit hard and I just couldn’t work well with it. For one thing I really had to pull at my eye area to apply it which isn’t such a great idea when your 30th Birthday is in a few short months! I applied a rather medium size amount to my finger for application and it went on somewhat sheer. I guess you seriously have to work your finger in and layer it on thick to acheive the desired look! I do give it props for adhering pigment well! I applied Teal pigment on top of it and it really stuck to the paint like glue which is slightly impressive and may make me consider purchasing one or two more for that reason alone! Overall I guess they are alright. They aren’t great or even good in my book but I’m sure some people will adore these as they have been eagerly anticipated a long time coming! The good news is I used Quick Frost on my highbrow and it deserves a back-up! It’s a fantastic pigment! It’s much like Frost with Gold Shimmer to it plus it’s not nearly as grainy! Easy, 1-2-3, application with it! Face of the Day for your viewing pleasure! Kinda looks like a similiar look I’ve done before but I guess I was a bit rushed this morning and didn’t take much time to do it and thus it came out rubbish!

"['Aube Shower Eyes By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in Aube , Japanese Brands Hello World! Been a while hasn’t it? It’s good to be back! Today is a blog of review! After a rather long and lengthy conversation about the new Abercrombie & Fitch (If you’re lucky you’ll catch the wonderful insight of this on PJ’s Blog! PJ had a ton to say about the store and I enjoyed every little morsel of the e-mail) that’s opened in London (I’m quite eager to have a nosy around myself and see how they’ve done with it! Perhaps on my trip over!) I ventured very randomly into a short reply about Aube Shower Eyes! Very weird how my mind works, hops from fashion to make-up in a heartbeat! Well, to make a rather long story short Haru from Rougue Deluxe had recommended that I purchase the Aube Shower Eyes palettes! Now you can’t really go wrong when it comes to what Haru recommends, she is the expert and guru! I bow down to her greatness! We can only ever hope to achieve her heights of make-up stardom hehe (she reads this so thought I’d add in how great she is to give her a giggle or two)! This blog is for PJ whom wrote to me, “I am very interested in knowing more about what you think about Jewelry Shower Eyes. I was on the verge of ordering one of them?.” I’m right there with you! I was on the verge as well! I’ve been eyeballing these for a while and skipping over them each and every time! I’ve only ever seen the photos on Aube’s website and really those aren’t appealing in the very least! Upon Haru’s rec I decided what the heck I might as well dive in and grab two! And now I want the rest of the colors! The palette is quite awesome! The palette in general is an absolute steal! It retails for about 3572yen but you can get it as low as 2072 yen as it discounts at 30%! Really it’s as good as giving it away! You can’t get this kind of high quality make-up for such a price! Japanese brands make some of the most wonderful, appealing, pigmented, gorgeous, (I’m running out of adjectives here), and affordable make-up around! I know you want the review! You’re getting impatience with my babble! I ended up purchasing 32 and 33 I wanted EX01 very badly but it was sold out! Utterly crushed here! I did manage to find it online but had to sell another a kidney to get it (at this point I’m running out of organs to sell!!!) Sheesh I hate how people mark-up stuff! Anyway! 32 is a brown/gold palette, perfect for the fall in my humble opinion, as I wouldn’t wear any of it in the summer. 32 is a blue palette and perfect for summer wear and possibly you can get away with in the fall and most definitely the winter! Each palette contains 1 creamy glitter base/shadow, one shimmering shadow, one matte shadow, and a liner (personally I don’t use it as a liner but a contour shadow but hey whatever floats your boat and tickles your pickle! I’m always somewhat confused (Yes even I get confused about make-up application sometimes) why so many Japanese brands always include the creamy base shadow! MJ has a quite a fondness for including a creamy base in their palettes, Shiseido in general actually does! I’ve failed numerous times in succeeding with the creamy base! I applied it prior my shadow and layered my shadow on top! It came out quite the mess for me! I’ve finally settled on using the creamy base as a highbrow highlighter and that works perfect really! Upon receiving these shadows I asked Haru’s advice about what she does with the creamy shadow and she replied that she uses it in several ways. As a base (tired that and I don’t like it), as a highbrow highlighter (already do this and like it but not love) and finally, a most interesting suggestion, she applies it in the middle of the eye after her she’s used the other shadows! My word what a great idea! I read something similar on MUA and I haven’t yet tried this but I am eager too give it a go! I never considered applying it after my shadow was on! The girl on MUA had suggested patting on the creamy glittery shadow onto your eye after shadow application! Hmmmmmmmm I like this ideal and must attempt it for myself! I did get off track with all that didn’t I? The moral of the story is, my dear friends, the Aube Shower Eyes get my hearty approval! These are something you must consider adding to your collection! I am curious where the “shower” part comes into play and I’m somewhat hopeful it means that the glittery creamy base I was discussing earlier will create a wet shadow look which sounds very dramatic! Please do keep in mind, prior to purchasing these, if you’re expecting as much shimmer as you’d get from T’estimo palettes these are not what you seek! They pack shimmer but not the punch that T’estimo palettes pack! If I recall correctly Haru said new colors are coming out for the fall! Joy! Something more to add to my ever growing want list! Majolica Majorca Madness By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 2 Comments in Japanese Brands , Majolica Majorca Before I lay me down to sleep..I’ve decided to blog about my other true love (by now you realize who my first one is)….Majolica Majorca. Majolica Majorca is Shiseido’s little sister but don’t let the word “little” fool you, she packs a mighty punch in her own right! I’ve blogged about her briefly before this, you can read about her by clicking HERE. I fell in love with MJ (asian girls call Majolica Majorica, MJ for short) when I was living in Japan for a short time. She’s probably one of favorite brand of cosmetic! I think my interest in her borderlines on the obssessed at times as I have that sweaty, greedy, selfish need to own every little thing thats put out in the line! I’ve since learned some control over myself and I only buy the items that I know will work for my face! I know I even amaze myself sometimes with the amount of will power I’ve been practicing as of late! I’ve been somehow lucky enough to nab the Majewel palettes that were released in 2005 (don’t quote me on that I believe it was 2005). Again, these are some of the most prized pieces in my collection! A lovely friend of mine that blogs as well had mentioned that packaging is a very important factor whenever purchasing cosmetics and I couldn’t agree more! I think cosmetics sell themselves by not only what resides in the pot but the actually pot, case, compact it comes in! I’m a visual being. I love cute items! MJ is girlish to the max and maybe it’s my ultra girl side that finds the packaging and the actual cosmetic so very appealing! The cuteness of the Majewel Collection This year MJ put out some amazing palettes and yours truly found it very hard not to purchase every single one they released. And you know what? I went ahead and did just that!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My little stack of insanity: MJ puts quite an interesting shadow out, they are sheer yet pigmented. Even for someone like me who always reaches for bold, bright colors, can appreciate MJ’s sheer beauty! These are really perfect layering shadows and you can build up as little or as much intensity as you want. I love the fact that almost all japanese shadow palettes include some sort of liner, really, sometimes, the little things matter most! You’re literally getting the all in one package here! Now I can talk MJ shadows, blushes, liners, etc…until tomorrow morning. But really the star of this show is MJ’s amazing 15X mascara! I’ve tried plenty of fine posh mascara and MJ is by far my favorite. It reminds me of Bare Minerals brushless mascara but is ten times the mascara that Bare Minerals hopes to be when it grows up! This season they released a most flattering blue color you ever did lay your eyes on! STOP! Don’t even think it! It is not the “Oh my god blue mascara from the 80’s”! It’s just a brilliant deep ocean blue color that is divine with blue shadows! Blue mascara has been making it’s come back very slowly and honestly if you’re brunette or blonde it’s so for you! It makes your eyes brighter and they POP when you wear it! MJ Mascaras MJ Splashing Blue Mascara MJ Black Mascara MJ is not available stateside or within Europe. You can purchase a majority of the MJ line from JPMon, E-bay, and a few other places. It’s not difficult to locate and with a little quick typing and some google you’ll be right on track to locating it! Most of my product comes from my a dear friend that lives in Japan and ships them over to me! If you head on over to Make-Up Alley chances are you’ll find someone nice enough to do a purchase for you or as I said google! One important thing to remember about MJ and other wonderful Asian brands is that they are truly limited in quanity. All the palettes released are almost always limited edition! Really the concept of Limited Edition starts to mean nothing as of late in the US. The market is oversaturated with the promise of Limited Edition cosmetics but really it’s just not the case. I can remember a time when MAC color stories would sell out quickly and it was difficult to locate a particular color for years after. No longer. Really anything that becomes stamped with the coveted Limited Edition seal ends up being easy enough to locate on E-bay! Asian brands are truly defined as Limited Edition. Once they are gone, they are truly gone. It’s very difficult to locate palettes once they are sold out! I guess really the moral of the story is when you see it and you really want it, buy it, or else tomorrow it’ll be gone..for good..really…truly…no joke! I hope you enjoyed learning/reading/listening to me babble about MJ! She’s truly a special brand of cosmetic that’s near and dear to my heart! Shu Uemura Summer Prism Collection Summer 2007 By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 2 Comments in Shu Uemura , Summer Collections 2007 So I heard about this collection 500 years ago but was never able to locate any of it. It was supposely released in May and it was unsure whether that was worldwide or Asia only. Call me an idiot but this one stumped me. I’m still unclear about when it’s being released stateside. Anyway…it’s gorgeous and really thats all that matters right? The shadow trios are so me! I needed them! I went on my determined little way to locate and make them mine! Last night I scored in a MAJOR way! I’ve found both of them! Finally! My lovely mate, Mayu, was able to find them for me and is shipping them over directly! I shall post the pictures as soon as they are in my greedy hands! Now the question still remains when the hell are these coming out on our side? Are they at all? Exclusives? Got an answer? E-mail me, Educate me, I want to know! The Sadness of Beauty By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in Beauty Babblings , Givenchy What does one do when sadness beckons and sleep eludes them? Blog about beauty of course! The following entry is from a blog I did ages ago on Live Journal but I’ve revamped it for My Space! At the moment I am not feeling my normal self so I’m entitled to a mark up and edit of this very blog. It gives me something to do with my mind less it wander into my heart. Givenchy. Ah the posh richness of Givenchy’s color collections! I guess I can rightly be called a newbie to Givenchy’s make-up line as I really only started collecting it this past fall. A friend brought me a blush as a gift and this started my downward spiral into the expensive habit of tracking down and purchasing new Givenchy palettes! Yes I do curse her everyday after! Givenchy’s line is probably one of the only make-up lines I’ve seen sell out so quickly! It’s not sold in many places and it’s difficult to track down the items when they do finally pop up somewhere! I’m fool enough to call every Sephora from 42nd Street to Times Square trying to locate one palette! Online you say? Impossible! Sells out in a snap! The spring line was probably my favorite thus far! The Arty line is bright, bold, and colorful as all hell! I’d love to say that I have the entire collection but I somehow mustered up enough willpower to puchase the blush and the eye palette only! It seemed too ridiculous to actually spend all that kind of money on the entire line! Maybe when I win the lotto! I’ll whisper this really low but I also didn’t spend the money on it because I just felt I wasn’t in the same league as the collection! Hell you have to be drop dead, outstanding gorgeous to wear make-up this lovely and I’m not entirely in that catagory! (Jesus I hope no one important is reading this! I won’t mention any names but he’s likely going to bloody snuff me out for saying that I am not gorgeous! Lucky am I he thinks so ya? Ok ok ok back to the make-up). Since fall I’ve come across some great palettes they have done but by far this has been the best of the lot! If you have some spare change rattling around in your pockets and you really want to purchase something different, I highly recommend either the Arty Blush or the Arty Eye palette! Or both! Oh my! These are too amazing products that Givenchy has outdone themselves on! My tiny lot from the Arty Color Collection: Cheers to Givenchy! High hopes we see new, exciting colors come the winter! It should take me till that time to find the newest palette released for the summer! I’m off to put out signs in the neighborhood! “Have you seen this palette?” Reward offered for any information regarding its where abouts! The Need for Shower Gels By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in Bath and Body Works , Philosophy , Shower & Bath I’m in such a good mood today I thought I’d grace you with my every lovely presense and present you with a blog of shower gels (It also helps that work isn’t busy and I can afford to procrastinate my way around a blog today)! This is a very important topic of discussion so please pay heed and follow it well! I’ve always questioned the amount of shower gel, soaps, fancy bits and bobs one girl needs for her bath and shower and I’ve come to the conclusion that we need many! An endless variety to pick and choose to suit our moods during our showers and baths! Now I am no different from any other girl in I own an array of paraphilia that graces my washroom and overflows from my cabinets and shelves. If my weight had anything at all to do with shower gels I fear I’d be guilty in overindulging in sweets, baked goods, fruits, and other guilty pleasures and treasures! I’m a philosophy girl and I have been for many a fine year! I have cheated on philosophy the last few years with a small company called Lush but that’s for another blog and another day! philosophy is ever near and dear to my heart! Now philosophy is well known for it’s fabulous 3 in 1 shower gels and I beg you not to think too badly of me when I say I hate the “in the shower” experience! I’ve no aversion to smelling like candy canes, crumb berry pie, vanilla cream puffs, and the likes! So why oh why can’t the scent linger longer? Sigh! In the shower it’s so lovely and fragrant, step out and it’s gone, a forgotten dream of gorgeous scent! I wish they’d make a shower gel with good linger and throw something that would stay with your hair all day and cling to your body equally! How depressing! But…still…I keep my pile of 3 in 1’s and happily use them daily! Now to move forward slightly I should tell you that in all my years of buying these gels I’ve come across quite a few that stay on my favorite list! Some that grace my MUST have on hand ALWAYS list are: I have to go ahead and rant a tiny bit more. The fact that they have come out with some real shit 3 in 1’s the last year or so bugs me. Some that must be avoided at all costs in my humblest of humble opinions would be: Sugar Cookie (this smells NOTHING like Sugar Cookies! Who the hell approved this as smelling like sugar and cookies? All I get is LEMON!), Vanilla Cream Puff (Just GROSS and wrong in so many ways), Lavender Pound Cake (OH MY GOD I think I threw up a little in my mouth! GAG! Who’s bright idea was it to put lavender in a pound cake anway?) Which brings me to the topic of Lemonade! They introduced Lemonade last year and boy was I excited to get my paws on it! My imagination took flight and visions of cool, tart, sweet lemons danced through my head as I made my way to Sephora.com! Upon its arrival the smell of Lemonade do not greet me as I had expect. This version of Lemonade has the weirdest off smell I’ve had the displeasure of sniffing! Very strange! How disappointing! This year marked the year of fruits! They have come out with a slew of new fruity 3 in 1’s! Tangerine, Lime, Peach, Oh MY! But I’ve had none of it! I didn’t purchase a one! Once Bitten, Twice Shy by friends! I will not be compelled to order fruity bits and have them come to my door being as disappointing as Lemonade was! But, by far, the piece Pi?ce de r?sistance this summer is Pink Lemonade! Yes, Yes I know what you are thinking! “She’s gone on a rant about Lemonade and now she excited about Pink Lemonade? What the hell is wrong with her?” I KNOW I know! But I can’t help myself! The good news is that Pink Lemonache is exclusive to Nordstrom! We love Nordie’s exlusives don’t we? I was smart this time around! I was having none of ordering online! I was prepared! I was sniffing before buying! My genius astounds me sometimes! Upon arriving at the source of this exclusive 3 in 1 Shower Gel I was prepared for disappointment and despair but to my shock and utter delight THIS is what I had wanted and desired in Lemonade! Sweet, Tart, Lovely Lemons and Sugar Oh MY! Tis perfect! Just perfect! I want to take a spoon and eat the body butter from it’s very jar it smells that GOOD! Finally you’ve gotten it right philosophy! Bravo! My highest rating for this yummy collection of goodies! This is by far my favorite of all the 3 in 1’s thus far! I went ahead and spoiled myself with the lot…now let’s see if we can convince them to release a hand wash in this scent and I’ll be happy indeed!']",a1e459dfd2cef29fefbb42cb68919d5e05d711f7,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4306,

"['Because Shu Uemura Wants Your Lashes to be Pretty! By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 1 Comment in Shu Uemura Behold……. My New Shu Curler! The Mercedes Benz of Eyelash Curlers! I’ve read so many reviews about this curler over the course of the last two years that I can write a book about it! I’m blogging to tell you that IT IS all THAT and a bag of chips! This freaking thing is amazing! I got it in the mail today and I’ve been happily twirling around with it for the better half of an hour! I may never need to use mascara again (I’m exaggerating and getting caught up in the excitement of course)! I’ve used so many curlers that have promised me no pinch, perfect fit and all of them fail! The curler I’ve been using for the past year or so was purchased at Sephora and…mmmm it’s ok. It’s nothing to write home about. I don’t know why I never bothered ordering the Shu Uemura one. Customer Service knows me by name by now after the amount of orders I’ve placed but not ONCE had I thought to add this gorgeous tool into my shopping cart! Best money I’ve ever spent in my life! Truly! I can understand what it’s prefered by Asian girls. It really has a good straight line and fits the contour of the eye perfect. You can get it super close to your lash line, press down super hard, and no pain, no pinch just perfect full lashes each and everytime! There is a downfall friends. They only give two replacement pads. Once you go through both pads you have to shell out money for an entirely new curler. Really though one pad should get you through 2 years or so….and on the bright side I hear Shiseido’s replacement pads fit into this curler so that’s a plus. It’s been a while since I’ve been so impressed with a tool and this is now on my list of awesome items that I can’t do without! What’s that you say? Did I just order the curler? Come on now…you know me…..I couldn’t just buy the curler. I got some lovely blushes and a rogue unlimited because really you can never have too many Shu blushes! As for rogue unlimited I’m surprised I even located a color that I don’t already own ! I’m so digustingly diseased it’s not even funny anymore, I just can’t help myself !

"['MAC Tendertones Review By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in MAC MAC Tendertones Color Story Sexier on the lips than balm. Silkier than gloss. More protective than naked. A lipcolour that combines soft shine, easy glide, and double-smooth satin finish with an everyday sun protective formula. To treat your lips…Love ’em tender. That blurb is taken directly from the MAC website and it’s the biggest crock of shit ever! Don’t you love when I’m being right properly unladylike with my colorful vocabulary? I know you adore it! I gotta say I’m not big on the lip gelees, the lipglasses, and the glosses in general from MAC. I’m a MAC whore but I’ll go right ahead and diss the glosses from here to Central America. They don’t rock my world. Sticky, gooey, and just gross come to mind. Do I use them? Yea. Do I buy them? Yea. Why? I dunno, I’m sick, we established that already. I do give a hearty thumbs up to MAC’s plushglass but that’s another story for another day as I say! Now when I first heard about Tendertones I was excited (when don’t I get excited at the prospect of new gloss?)! I think I idolized Tendertones to the status of Lancome’s Juicy Gelee Gloss ! I was thinking smooth, glossy, wonderfully sheer color, moisturizing, porn star lips! (Did I just say porn stay? I guess I did. Deal with it!) Nope. None of those things apply to this gloss. I should have known. I ended up purchasing 4 of the colors and although, they are happily making friends with the rest of the glosses in my collection, they are in no way a favorite of mine. They are sheer. Very sheer. I expected some color. I was thinking I could apply without lipstain under it. Not happening. I need stain under the gloss otherwise I get plain fleshy colored lips with some sticky gloss slapped on. It’s sticky. Again, I should have known. It doesn’t surprise me. MAC always has a special knack for putting out the thickest, stickiest glosses around. I feel like my lips are glued shut wearing this stuff. They smell yummie and they taste equally lovely but that’s about the only thing going for them! The pot is huge for the price another plus. To be honest while I was browsing them I was somewhat in awe and was almost to the point of purchasing the entire lot, because, again, I’m sick like that. But I’m glad I ended up with 4 colors and didn’t get too crazy. To be honest if you’re considering purchasing any, my strongest suggestion is just go with one. They are so sheer that they all go on as the same color. So really, you may well be blinded with the array of colors on display but it doesn’t matter which you choose, all go on the same clear way! Boring Boring Boring! Low rating for me. Not interested at all. They’ll end up in the bottom of my traincase and one day I’ll pull them out and sell them on E-bay or swap them away on make-up alley . Not good at all. Good try MAC but keep trying! You may also enjoy...

"['Etude House Fresh Cherry Blusher Duo Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on July 2, 2009 3 Comments in Etude House , Korean Brands , Spring Collections 2009 , Swatches Etude House Fresh Cherry Blusher Duo was released as part of the Etude House Precious Mineral Skin Project Collection. Someone mentioned that this was actually supposed to be apart of a collection all it’s own. A collection in fact like the peach one! Imagine a cherry themed Etude House collection? Omg love! It’s too bad that Etude House didn’t go through with the idea but I am happy they included the Fresh Cherry Blusher Duo with it’s Precious Mineral Collection anyway! Jump ahead for a review! Etude House Fresh Cherry Blusher Duo is a tiny compact that houses duo cream blushes. The shades you’ll receive are a nice off pink shade and a brighter peach almost coral color. You can use the blushes separately or together to create various looks. Combining the two shades creates a rather bright orangey coral that’s very pretty and flattering for Summer. The formula of the blushes is the real surprise. Although creamy in texture these dry down to a matte powder finish which lasts and lasts and lasts. I was quite impressed with how long wearing these were! Although a Spring Collection, they make a fine Summer makeup addition due to their long wear formula. The color blends easily, seamlessly, and flawlessly onto skin. Cream blushes can prove tricky during application but this is simply a matter of smiling, locating the apples of your cheeks, a quick dab and a swirl and you’re done. Beautiful, flushed cheeks. The blushes are pigmented enough that you can get decent color payoff from either shade but are also allow for sheer, subtle application if you prefer. Anyone with oily skin can appreciate the powdery finish. Overall, a rather great little blusher from Etude House and a winner for Summer. I paid $4-5 retail for this from Korea but I’ve seen it on E-bay for around $10 bucks plus free shipping. I do think it’s worth the price jack as it’s a very nice blush that’s universally flattering for all skin tones plus it’s long wear formula makes it a great blush all around. PS I’m kinda wishing it was cherry scented, that would be awesome! Don’t you agree? Muse Approved for purchase! Likey! You may also enjoy...

"['Sonia Kashuk Super Sheer Liquid Tints Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on July 2, 2009 7 Comments in Sonia Kashuk , Spring Collections 2009 , Swatches I just got done meeting up with my best friend Jai for some incredible sushi (yums!) and in he walks with a little bag swinging from his arm that contained all three of the Sonia Kashuk Super Sheer Liquid Tints. He hands it over and says, “Biatch, don’t tell people on your blog about where I pick up hot guys!” Obviously, I can’t accuse Jai of not reading my insanity here on Musings, he sees all, hears all, and knows all. Oops. Thank Jai, I’m a love you for buying me liquid tints to review. So jump ahead for a review of Sonia Kashuk Super Sheer Liquid Tints sponsored by Jai! As I was telling you last night these intrigued me especially since I enjoy liquid stains and such in the Summer, well ok all year round I love stains. These little guys come in a generous pump bottle in three different shades for $9.99 each. The novelty is the scent! Teehee! They have a slightly fresh, fruity smell. It’s the little things in life that really delight me and the smell of these kinda made me smile. The shades are all rather loud, bold, and outrageous but once they are blended out it’s a subtle, natural finish. I admit I was a tad disappointed they weren’t as pigmented as I had hoped. The consistency of the formula is a runny gel which was also a little bit disappointing as I was hoping for creamy. They blend nicely but you may find that a single pump won’t do and you’ll want to build up color with maybe a drop or two more. Actually it’s quite a great little blush if you like to slowly build color up or just prefer a subtle kiss of color rather than full on blushing cheeks. I like the pump applicator as it distributes product nicely enough but it does have a little bit of a learning curve as pressing too hard ends up with too much product. A very slow pump will get you just the right amount of blusher so be gentle. The bottles are a cheery color that matches the blush inside, very cute in my opinion. The shade selections are Peony which is a hot fuchsia pink, Poppy which is a peachy coral, and Rose which is a rich red rose shade. I’m not favoring any of the shades as I think they are all gorgeous colors and each offers a nice flush of color. I don’t think the product will work well on dark skin girls as it’s a bit to subtle however anyone that’s fair or medium can very well take advantage. I haven’t worn out as of yet but I do have Rose on right now and I’m taking a trip to the movies in a little bit so we’ll see how long it wears after sitting through Manhattan traffic and a two hour movie. So far it’s wearing quite well but I’m wondering if it might melt off after a bit….I’ll tuck it into my makeup bag just in case I need a touch up. Overall, I think Sonia Kashuk Super Sheer Liquid Tints make a find addition to your Summer make up bag. The inexpensive price tag, pretty colors, and light formula is quite pleasing for Summer wearin’. If you’re a lover of a more natural finish to blush these should please. Definitely worthy of a look at this price! Anyone try yet? Wanting to? Tell the Muse! You may also enjoy...

"['Jelly Pong Pong Cheek Puff Fluffy Cheek Stain Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on July 2, 2009 4 Comments in British Brands , Jelly Pong Pong , Swatches More Jelly Pong Pong Deluxe Bag haulin’ ahead chicas! Jelly Pong Pong Cheek Puff Fluffy Cheek Stain was included with one of my deluxe bags that I recently hauled from Jelly Pong Pong. After getting the bag I gave the stain away to my mate Chris because I already had one. I realized after giving it to her that I should really haul my own and review it for you here! Click ahead for the deets! Jelly Pong Pong Cheek Puff Fluffy Cheek Stain is $14 bucks and considerably cheaper than Stila Convertible Color and Bobbi Brown Potted Rouge . Same consistency, same formula, just available in a single shade though. I dunno why but my first try with Cheek Puff was kinda meh but I did grow to absolutely adore it soon after. Probs I was ranting over it’s lack of variety in shades but I soon set my grudge away and just enjoyed Cheek Puff for it’s cuteness, inexpensive price tag, and pretty flush it gave my face and cheeks. No one can accuse Jelly Pong Pong Cheek Puff of not being adorable. Packaged in a sweet little box featuring a baby chick this blush comes housed in a screw top jar that should last you well into the next millennium since a little tiny bit goes a very long way. Key benefit of the blush is it’s incredible staying powder. Pretty much lasts all day through the warm weather, through the rain and snow, past all the humidity and sweat, and right on through your eight hour work day. It’s one of those sticky slightly tacky blushes that blends smoothly and adheres to skin like glue. It’s not going anywhere, anytime soon. The shade is a universally flattering dusky pink which is suitable for just about any skin tone as it can be built up to an intense pop of pink or just dabbed on for a very simple flush of rose. One of my favorite ways to use it is by blending onto my cheeks and topping with a MAC Mineralized Skinfinish, it goes incredibly well with Petticoat ! The results are flushed cheeks with a light highlight of gold and rose. If you’re looking for an inexpensive, cute, long wearing cream blush for Summer here it is. Jelly Pong Pong Cheek Puff is fantastic and Muse Approved for purchase all the way! Likey! Anyone a fan? What are some of your favs from Jelly Pong Pong? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"['Urban Decay Fall Collection 2009: Urban Decay Deluxe Shadow Review and Swatches of Frigid, Ruthless, and FreakShow By Isabella Muse on July 6, 2009 Leave a Comment in Fall Collections 2009 , Swatches , Urban Decay Urban Decay Fall Collection coming out you fall force with three brand new vibrant shades of Urban Decay Deluxe Eyeshadow! Oh joy! I can’t recall the last release of colors in the deluxe shadow range so I’m all about experiencing the three newest shade that were released early for the Fall collection. The three shades are available now on Urban Decay’s website if you’re impatient as the Muse to own them and will be released at Sephora towards the end of the month! The three Urban Decay Deluxe Eyeshadow shades are Frigid, FreakShow and Ruthless. Click below for a lookiee at these new shades and keep it tuned here for some FOTD’s using the new shades later this week! Deluxe shadows are sure to please anyone who isn’t a glitter/shimmer lover. Considering many of Urban Decay Eyeshadow’s in their normal range are either loaded with shimmer (Loves it!) or matte it’s difficult to be inbetween the two which is where deluxe shadow comes into play. Smooth, velvety, easy to blend, and plenty pigmented these are sure to please those who aren’t keen on a shimmer or matte finish. Sporting brand new graffiti pop art packaging the shadows are all quite loud and outrageous for Fall (aside from Ruthless which is very Fall-themed in color). I’m thinking two of the three will work wonders as a smudged up liner rather than an all over lid color. I look forward to seeing some images or face charts from Urban Decay with looks for Fall ’09. Ruthless is a pretty fawn shade with a smooth, buttery finish that blends beautifully. It’ll look incredible with a deeper espresso liner shade for a brown smoky eye look. If you’re about purple Freakshow and Frigid are sure to please. These goth shades of purple take the color to a deep, slightly forbidden level and should make eyes up for a mysterious Fall look. Freakshow is a deep, dark purple, almost royal in color with a red base where as Frigid is more of a blue based purple. Both shades seem a bit daring for use alone so I think they’d make a fine liner shade or used smudged onto eyes for a smoky purple look. I’ll have to play a little to see how best to use these two. If you love purples you’ll want to add both to your collection! Once blended out they aren’t nearly as bold as they appear in pot. All three shades of deluxe shadow are very promising colors and well worth adding to your Fall shadow arsenal. Loving all over ’em at the moment. I’ll be bringing you some eye looks using them shortly so be on the look out! In the meantime, tell me what you think of the three new shades. Are you adding these to your UD collection?

"['Sneak Peek: Stila Fall Collection 2009 Stila Kitten Smudge Pot Review and Swatches Stila Smitten with Kitten Collection By Isabella Muse on July 7, 2009 2 Comments in Fall Collections 2009 , Sneak Peeks , Stila , Swatches Stila roars (or maybe meows?) into Fall with brand new Kitten goodies that are sure to please. Here’s a little sneak peek review at the brand new Stila Kitten Smudge Pot releasing this September at Sephora. Check it! Stila introduced Kitten Eyeshadow way back when in 1997. I do believe this was just around the time I was getting into Stila and can recall Kitten being a fast favorite. I’m not the only one as many a fan will attest that Stila Kitten Eyeshadow is a cult fav! With it’s universally flattering combination of pink and beige champagne it’s one of those soft shadows that’s brilliant for dressing up or down with. Many a fan are Smitten with this Kitten. The release of Stila Smitten with Kitten Collection for Fall 2009 includes two new smudge pots and one new lipglaze. You’ll be seeing Stila Kitten Smudge Pot and Stila Kitten Lip Glaze today in separate reviews and later this week I’ll be showing you Stila Black Cat Smudge Pot which is also apart of this sweet collection. Kitten has been done prior to this in a cream form and also a gloss in the Summer 2008 but it’s still very nice to see it released in a smudge pot and lip glaze format. Stila Smudge Pots are great multitasking tools to use as a shadow primer, an all over shadow color, liner, or go crazy and use on cheeks and brow bone for a pretty highlighter. Stila Kitten Smudge Pot is a gorgeous blend of pink ad beige champagne with a shimmer finish. This smudge pot is particularly great if you’re not in love with the fall out from the powder format of Kitten as this blends easily onto the eye minus clean up after use. Stila Smitten with Kitten is a Muse Approved for purchase. It’ll be available from Stila in September but I suspect you’ll see it towards the end of August. If you’re a lover of Kitten you’ll sure to want to peep at this collection! Will you haul it? Are you a fan of Kitten? Tell the Muse!

"['Urban Decay Fall Collection 2009: Urban Decay Ink for Eyes Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on July 7, 2009 2 Comments in Fall Collections 2009 , Swatches , Urban Decay Ahh Urban Decay you sure do please this Fall with your incredible new collection! It’s such a thrilling time for Fall Collections this year and I can’t begin to tell you how exciting it is to see them all pop up and about. Urban Decay did a particularly incredible job this year with it’s Fall Collection and I’m quite excited to see the release of many, many new items. I was slightly worried that many brands would make subtle little releases due to poor consumer spending so it’s an utter relief to see so many great releases. One such release is the Urban Decay Ink For Eyes that totally floored me with it’s innovative packaging, likey! Check out the review and swatches after the jump! Urban Decay Ink For Eyes is housed in a slick slim line case decorated with a pretty peacock, no one can say this packaging isn’t ace. Loving all over the packaging for a few reasons. I love that I can tuck these easily away for quickie touch ups as they are so small and slim it’s easy to travel with them. I love that they include dual ended brushes for application. Line eyes with the flat brush and smudge with the smudger sponge. Love the mirror tucked inside each case too! It’s just a really unique take on cream liner packaging and quite interesting, adorable really. The liner inside each case was at first a disappointment because they had shipped in the heat and ended up quite soft and melty. I sat them in my fridge for about an hour and proceeded to fall in love soon after. The formula is creamy and richly pigmented. They smudge quite nicely too which is always a plus. I do find potted liners sometimes smudge crummy but these really smudge nicely which lends a mysterious look to eyes and will be ideal for smoky eyes. The liner doesn’t smear during so one line application and you’re done, of course build it up for a more dramatic look by all means. Formula is paraben free plus Urban Decay doesn’t test animals which should appeal to our green makeup lovers. The liner comes in six shades so far but knowing Urban Decay I imagine you’ll see even more brilliant shades released in the not so distant future. You can go with potted liner anywhere really but if you’re wanting to step it up with bolder shades, Urban Decay is your girl. The shades released thus far are: Demolition-brown Binge-deep midnight blue (almost looks purple Empire-dark purple Loaded-forest green Pyrotechnics-iridescent glitter Zero-black My fav shades are Zero, Demolition, and Loaded. Pyrotechnics is simply a clear base with a hint of shimmery glitter so you won’t get big color payoff with this but I find that a dab in the inner corners of the eyes and a bit lined under the eyes brightens things up nicely. It’s one of the only colors I didn’t swatch successfully as it didn’t show up too well in a photo but don’t overlook it, it’s actually a very nice little shade. All in all if you’re a fan of UD you’re going to want to haul these or if you’re scared of liquid liners and aren’t too keen on pencils, cream is definitely the way to go for ease of application. The slick, fun packaging is an interesting take on boring old potted liners! Likey! Anyone hauling these? Tell the Muse! You may also enjoy...

Along with it’s new Fall Collection Stila is releasing a brand new lip glaze in the Kitten color. Good news for Kitten lovers I’m sure. Jump for it. First off, allow me to remind you Kitten has already been formulated in an LE gloss back in Summer 2008. No offense Stila but I really didn’t dig that gloss so I’m quite happy, ecstatic actually that Stila went ahead and re-released the shade in lip glaze formula. Stila Lip Glaze is quite nice in general. Nicely pigmented, plenty of tack and stick for a long wearing formula, and a great click pen for application. Loves it! Adding the shade Kitten to the line is fantastic as it pairs beautifully with Kitten shadow and the likes and as I said the original gloss formula wasn’t particularly great but lip glaze is by all means a beautiful gloss. The Lip Glaze shade is considerably richer when compared to the shadow. It has a bit of pink sparkle to it but heavily golden beige for the most part. The shade is flattering for Fall without question but works well in the Summer sun as well! If you’ve been longing for Kitten in gloss formula here’s your chance.

"['The Need for Shower Gels By Isabella Muse on July 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in Bath and Body Works , Philosophy , Shower & Bath I’m in such a good mood today I thought I’d grace you with my every lovely presense and present you with a blog of shower gels (It also helps that work isn’t busy and I can afford to procrastinate my way around a blog today)! This is a very important topic of discussion so please pay heed and follow it well! I’ve always questioned the amount of shower gel, soaps, fancy bits and bobs one girl needs for her bath and shower and I’ve come to the conclusion that we need many! An endless variety to pick and choose to suit our moods during our showers and baths! Now I am no different from any other girl in I own an array of paraphilia that graces my washroom and overflows from my cabinets and shelves. If my weight had anything at all to do with shower gels I fear I’d be guilty in overindulging in sweets, baked goods, fruits, and other guilty pleasures and treasures! I’m a philosophy girl and I have been for many a fine year! I have cheated on philosophy the last few years with a small company called Lush but that’s for another blog and another day! philosophy is ever near and dear to my heart! Now philosophy is well known for it’s fabulous 3 in 1 shower gels and I beg you not to think too badly of me when I say I hate the “in the shower” experience! I’ve no aversion to smelling like candy canes, crumb berry pie, vanilla cream puffs, and the likes! So why oh why can’t the scent linger longer? Sigh! In the shower it’s so lovely and fragrant, step out and it’s gone, a forgotten dream of gorgeous scent! I wish they’d make a shower gel with good linger and throw something that would stay with your hair all day and cling to your body equally! How depressing! But…still…I keep my pile of 3 in 1’s and happily use them daily! Now to move forward slightly I should tell you that in all my years of buying these gels I’ve come across quite a few that stay on my favorite list! Some that grace my MUST have on hand ALWAYS list are: I have to go ahead and rant a tiny bit more. The fact that they have come out with some real shit 3 in 1’s the last year or so bugs me. Some that must be avoided at all costs in my humblest of humble opinions would be: Sugar Cookie (this smells NOTHING like Sugar Cookies! Who the hell approved this as smelling like sugar and cookies? All I get is LEMON!), Vanilla Cream Puff (Just GROSS and wrong in so many ways), Lavender Pound Cake (OH MY GOD I think I threw up a little in my mouth! GAG! Who’s bright idea was it to put lavender in a pound cake anway?) Which brings me to the topic of Lemonade! They introduced Lemonade last year and boy was I excited to get my paws on it! My imagination took flight and visions of cool, tart, sweet lemons danced through my head as I made my way to Sephora.com! Upon its arrival the smell of Lemonade do not greet me as I had expect. This version of Lemonade has the weirdest off smell I’ve had the displeasure of sniffing! Very strange! How disappointing! This year marked the year of fruits! They have come out with a slew of new fruity 3 in 1’s! Tangerine, Lime, Peach, Oh MY! But I’ve had none of it! I didn’t purchase a one! Once Bitten, Twice Shy by friends! I will not be compelled to order fruity bits and have them come to my door being as disappointing as Lemonade was! But, by far, the piece Pi?ce de r?sistance this summer is Pink Lemonade! Yes, Yes I know what you are thinking! “She’s gone on a rant about Lemonade and now she excited about Pink Lemonade? What the hell is wrong with her?” I KNOW I know! But I can’t help myself! The good news is that Pink Lemonache is exclusive to Nordstrom! We love Nordie’s exlusives don’t we? I was smart this time around! I was having none of ordering online! I was prepared! I was sniffing before buying! My genius astounds me sometimes! Upon arriving at the source of this exclusive 3 in 1 Shower Gel I was prepared for disappointment and despair but to my shock and utter delight THIS is what I had wanted and desired in Lemonade! Sweet, Tart, Lovely Lemons and Sugar Oh MY! Tis perfect! Just perfect! I want to take a spoon and eat the body butter from it’s very jar it smells that GOOD! Finally you’ve gotten it right philosophy! Bravo! My highest rating for this yummy collection of goodies! This is by far my favorite of all the 3 in 1’s thus far! I went ahead and spoiled myself with the lot…now let’s see if we can convince them to release a hand wash in this scent and I’ll be happy indeed! You may also enjoy...

"['Essence Nude Kiss XXXL Shine Lipgloss Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on February 7, 2013 13 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Drugstore Makeup Brands , Essence , Swatches If you’re on a tight budget you might want to check out Essence XXXL Shine Lipgloss as it gives a heck of a lot of shine and a little bit of a tint too for under three dollars ($2.49 to be exactly) plus it’s available in a rather wide array of shades too! Essence XXXL Shine Lipgloss is available in twelve shades for as little as $2.49 each. This cheap as chips gloss has a jelly-like texture with a slanted tip sponge applicator for application. It’s not going to change your lipgloss world by any means but it will rock your beauty budget if you’re a drugstore girl at heart. The jelly-like consistency has a high shine finish and a cake batter-like taste and flavor (it’s very strong at first but subtle once applied on lips). I found the formula weightless on my mouth and very comfortable to wear sans any sticky, tacky feel. The gloss has a super high shine factor which makes it quite lovely on top of lipstains or lipsticks. The finish isn’t opaque but it lends a sheer, delicate tint to lips so you can wear it comfortably without lip color and still see color come through on lips. For such a cheap little gloss I love how mirror-like the finish is that it provides, one would expect a drier finish due to the lower price tag. On the down side the wear time is rather sure due to the lack of stickiness. The gloss doesn’t a formula that adheres well to lips so a touch up is necessary within an hour to two at best. At this price, I can’t rant too much! High shine, flavorful, a little hint of tint, yeah, I’m happy. Well worth checking out if you’re on the hint for a beauty budget lipgloss. Available at Ulta.

Hmm..maybe I won’t have to sell my soul to the devil…I’ll just sell off unimportant organs…heart…..kidneys….a lung or two! Dearest Dior, Please make cheaper shoes! K, thanks! Hugs! -i. Wellies Are So Glam Darling! By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 Leave a Comment in Celebs , Fashion , Glamorous Bits Photos of Keira in Vogue making wellies look glamorous! Bet you can’t pull this off: Dare say that elephant is looking right proper smart with his Louis Vuitton Accessories! A Storage of Coverage By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 Leave a Comment in Beauty Secrets Today’s blog will focus on good coverage! This will be a rather short entry! I can hear all the disappointing sighs already. Fear not it may be short but it’s filled with tons of good information about good coverage! Let’s begin shall we? If you’re a girl (and maybe if you lean towards metrosexual, transsexual, or other sexual sides) you won’t leave the house without foundation on your face. Oh why oh can’t we all be fresh faced and gorgeous all the time minus foundation (and if you fall into the catagory of being able to leave the house without foundation…well…we HATE you! Kidding Kidding! We envy you mostly!)! Reality is reality and I personally don’t live the house without my face in place! I know of only one man who’s seen me without my face on and I had to kill him soon after! Kidding, he lives in another country so I think maybe I’m safe for now! I’m going to cut right too it and say I hate foundation! I have a wicked combination of skin that varies from season to season which makes finding proper coverage impossible. In the winter I’m as dry as the dessert, in the summer my forehead shines like a mirror, and during the fall and spring it’s a combination of both dry and oily. I always have little adventures with coverage and I try all sorts of brands but 4 take up resident in my beauty arsenal for many a fine year and never shall we part! I’ll tell you about my gems in a moment! I’m going to go ahead and throw this out there and watch the entire female population come down on my head for it. Bare Minerals blows ass! Yes indeed it does! Kill me, shoot me, sue me, do whatever it is you want but I won’t change my mind! The entire kit blows right out of my ass! I brought it and sold it on E-bay within 2 minutes of having it! This is not to say the rest of the line blows, just the foundation. I love the glimmers, shadows, etc….but the foundation can take a leap right off the nearest cliff and I’ll sit happily on top and blow kisses of good riddance and don’t come back! Pray tell who is it that writes such star reviews about this kit? Where are you? E-mail me I wanna talk about these 5 star ratings you’ve given this rubbish product! It’s crap! I imagine at the moment Leslie may very well be reading this and calling her lawyers up to sue that small chubby chick on myspace for dissing on her product! Sorry Leslie! I HATE your foundation/coverage kits! Now that, that is out of my system we can get on to my secret for flawless skin finish ? You need four products to make your face perfect in all ways! Morgen Schick Hide and Hilight Concealer Morgen Schick Whisper Set Powder Benefit Bo-ing Sofina Raycious Skin Powder (Asia Only) I’ve been using Morgen Schick’s concealer forever and I’m always delighted with the coverage they provide and the fact that it makes my skin look so healthy and lovely! Hide and Hilight works as a great coverage and you can keep it fresh and long wearing by using the whisper set powder on your face afterwards. Benefit Bo-ing I use for under my eye area and to prep my eye for shadow. It also provides beautiful coverage and makes me look like I got at least 8 hours of sleep in when in reality it was more like 5! And finally Raycious Skin Powder always stays with me for quick touch ups! If you’re overeager to try Morgen Schick you can purchase it directly but I’d suggest going on E-bay for cheaper prices! Raycious is not sold in US stores, again, E-bay is a good place to look! And Benefit Bo-ing can be purchased wherever Benefit is sold! Sephora and Macy’s carries the line! All of these items are a part of my everyday make-up and I can’t live without them! If you’re looking to try something new I strongly suggest you give them a whirl and see how they work for your skin! A girl with flawless skin coverage is a happy girl indeed! I look forward to hearing your reviews and your story of coverage if and when you try them! Purple is Passionate By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 Leave a Comment in Face of the Day Purple is so passionate! What I used: MAC Kitchmas Pigment (All Over Lid and Within Crease) Urban Decay Grifter (Within Crease) Urban Decay Ransom (Outter Lid) Urban Decay Fishnet (Outter V of Eye) Tony and Tina Glitter Eye Liner (Bottom Lower Lash Line) Bare Escentuals Brushless Mascara An Ode to Parrot By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 2 Comments in MAC An ode to that legendary MAC color that is sadly gone from our graces! Parrot how I adore thee and will miss you when I’ve used you all up! Moonflower tries to be like you but it doesn’t fill my heart the way you do! When oh When will they repromote you?

"['MuseTV Presents: Fall Collection Haul By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 6 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , Japanese Brands , KATE , Lavshuca , Majolica Majorca , MuseTV ‘ello there! I was lucky enough to get a delightful little package in the mail of which contained the Fall Japanese goodies! I did a video blog of ’em for you guys! I’ve added in pics as well and will be doing reviews and Face of the Days pics very soon! MuseTV Presents: Fall Collection Haul: Please excuse the poor quality of the pictures ? I normally take photos with my trusty Kodak DX6490. I decided that I’d go with cute and super portable so I purchased a Sony Cyber Shot T20 this past week! I was excited to have a smaller cam to use for taking pics for my blog and just generally toting around for small shots here and there! My DX6490 is only 4MP’s has a virtually no ISO so the T20 was quite appealing at 8MP with an obscene ISO, HD output, onscreen editing, and a tons of other bells and whistles. Upon getting it in the mail I flipped out at how cute it was. I proceeded to try some Face of the Day pics plus some additional variety, random shots and………it’s crap. I strongly suggest not bothering! I’ve just now finished wrapping it up and it’s going right back for a full return! I am astounded at the crap quality of the pics! Everything had a weird orange tinge too it plus the ISO had a setting of 300 because anything more would cause some mega crap quality photos! Do tell me whatcha think of these pics taken with the cybershot as compared to my older pics in my blog taken with my trusty kodak! I’ve been sorely tempted to purchase a Nikon D40 but can’t justify the cost for a hobbyist like myself. It’d be far different if I had a family with children and such but just to purchase the D40 for hobby shots of cosmetics, some vacation photos, and random shots seems just a silly purchase really! I adore photography but the general idea of the D40 seems a spoiled indulgence on my part! Anyway! On to the pics ? New Lavashuca Palettes Older Lavshuca Palette, New Color!

PR By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 Leave a Comment in Beauty Babble Musings of a Muse has a loyal readership both within the US and Internationally. Japan, Singapore, Korea, and England are just a few of the many places that Musings gets traffic from. Readers are very interactive about what they are currently loving in the cosmetic world here at Musings and love hearing about the latest and greatest on the makeup front! Musings of a Muse is popular do to the fact that the Muse is an average, everyday girl (Not Paris Hilton!) that’s passionate about cosmetics, skincare, and other wonderful beauty finds and that excitement and passion comes out in her posts and reviews to readers (If anything at all the Muse sure does know how to get the blood boiling and pumping when it comes to new cosmetic finds!)! If this is an environment that you’d like to see your product reviewed in do drop the Muse an e-mail. My press time varies depending on what I have lined up for review at the moment however I can make room if you need your review posted at a quicker turn around time! Just ask nicely ? About the Muse Profile By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 Leave a Comment in Beauty Babble Who is this Muse girl anyway? Around the Internet I’m simply known as the Muse. A Muse of makeup maybe..the Muse in Musings perhaps? Could be anything. Who am I really? I’m just an average, everyday, general cosmetic junkie that plans to take over the world. You can join me and my minions on our quest for cosmetic nirvana by reading my uber awesome, fabulous blog! In all seriousness………. I’m a 30 year old, native New Yorker. Born, Bred, and Raised in this little city (but traveled far from home on many a fine occasion seeking new and exciting beauty products from distant lands…it’s true just check my blog for reviews on products you may have never heard of!). Contrary to popular belief I do not work in the fashion or cosmetic industry, far from it. When I’m not moonlighting as the Editor here at Musings (Wow! Editor sounds so bloody important doesn’t it?) I have a real job, in the real world as an Insurance Broker, underwriting commercial and personal policies. I own and operate my own office with my older sister and together we are a legend in our own minds (I’m positive other people think we are legendary as well but I haven’t met one yet! If I do I’ll let you know!). I also enjoy pina coladas and getting caught in the rain…. When I’m not posting tons of reviews, testing new products, and playing around in the comment box with my awesome readers you can find me at some high end counter looking for the next awesome cosmetic find. I’m also a geek and come with all the excess baggage geeks come with such as attending crazy conventions, playing stupid amounts of WoW , reading manga, and watching Star Trek and Doctor Who reruns. In my spare time I love shopping, eating out, going to the movies, and enjoying good times with my friends (Hey, I live in the city that never sleeps! We got plenty of awesome entertainment options here!). I’m a huge lover of literature, indie and foreign films and could possibly be more passionate about these than cosmetics. Whoa. I adore traveling and have been to many great and exotic places! I’m a big lover of Japanese, Korean, and British popular culture. Ok, ok enough about me…I feel like I’m on a dating site here….

"['Lush Snowcake Soap You Need It By Isabella Muse on December 2, 2015 21 Comments in Bath & Body , Holiday Collections 2015 , Lush , Muse Approved , Shower & Bath , Soap Purchased I get a lot of complaints about the fragrance of Lush and how headache inducing their products are. So many people tell me they walked into a store and have to walk right back out because the smell gets to tehm. It doesn’t personally bother me. I’ve been blogging since 2006 or so and I’d like to say I was probably one of the first beauty bloggers out there that was writing odes of joy about Lush Cosmetics (I could be vain believing that but at the time I can’t recall many blogs writing about Lush). Needless to say it’s been a big part of my life but I can def understand that some folks have sensitivities and the fragrance of Lush has just turned them off the brand. Please don’t give up though. Especially if you haven’t tried Lush Snowcake Soap! Lush Snowcake Soap is released for a limited time every year and I typically buy an entire slab of it to last me through the year but this year and the year before I just settled for hauling 10 or so bars of it and calling it a day ? It’s such a Holiday classic and I’m not sure how I get through the time I’m without it. I wish they’d make it permanent but sometimes I think that might mean I’d tire of it so maybe it’s good that it is limited to a once a year thing. It’s one of Lush’s creamiest soaps and it produces beautiful, creamy lather! But most importantly the scent! Oh the scent. Lush calls it rose, they call it vanilla, they call it marzipan…for me it’s like the most perfect, creamiest marzipan in the world. It’s impossible to explain with mere words but trust me it smells so, so beautiful and it’s like no other scent Lush has available. If you haven’t tried it, I urge you to head to your Lush store and take a little sniff. I can guarantee you’ll fall in love and don’t yell at me if you spend way too much on slices to hoard away for the rest of the year as once Snowcake is gone, it is gone, and won’t return until next Christmas. Snowcake, as always, is Muse Approved. Available in stores or online at lush.com. Are you fan? You may also enjoy...

"['Mally Beauty Liquid Light Eye Brightener Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on October 5, 2009 4 Comments in Concealer , Mally Beauty , Swatches Wow, the Muse is kinda striking out lately with Mally. Many moons ago I came across Mally Beauty Eye Brightener and decided I must have it for myself. Many more moons went by and I never indulged. Not sure why but I put off buying this for a while but recently I hauled a few Mally items from QVC and decided, “meh let me add the eye brightener in my cart…” The idea behind the product and the product itself is interesting to say the least but sadly it fails to leave up to what I expected. Read ahead for the review. So what is it? Basically it’s a powder to liquid concealer or actually let me correct myself…it’s an eye brightener. Don’t expect to concealer with this as it doesn’t do that. It does however brighten your eye area up for a more refreshed, awake you. It’s $25 bucks and probably the most I’ve ever spent on so little of a product. I’ve indulged in alot of high end cosmetics, skincare, etc…but never have I ever splurged on such a small amount of product. The actual size is 0.18oz but that’s the bottle…I’m thinking there is even less than that inside. The basic idea is you tap a small amount out of the bottle, which by the way proves impossible to do because of the poorly thought packaging, and swirl it around your palm with a fingertip and watch as the powder turns into liquid. Now, lightly tap under eyes. Presto, bright, awake eyes….yeah well not so much. The innovative formula is a pure win. It really does go from powder to liquid as soon as you touch it. But problems follow close behind…. First problem arises while tapping that small amount out. Although the bottle has a small spout it still manages to spill a whole lot of powder into your palm which could be seen as waste. No worries about that though as you actually need a WHOLE lot of powder as it’s not pigmented nearly enough to really brighten anything up. If you use say half the bottle you might come out looking fresh but using a small amount will do little to nothing particularly if you need a whole lot of brightening for dark circles and other under eye woes. The formula is interesting as I mentioned considering it goes from powder to liquid. However, the liquid version proves to be difficult to “pat” on. If you pat on incorrectly it’ll crease and cake up in fine lines and if you rub too hard it’ll pill. Overall, the idea is interesting, fresh, and exciting. However, the formula, packaging, and size need a whole lot of work. $25 for a tiny amount of powder is absurd and I’m shocked as Mally normally delivers alot of bang for your buckage. I truly adore the idea but it needs a whole lot of work for me to even consider dishing out again. All in all a rather big waste of money. No likey. You may also enjoy...

"['Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Inspired by Carmindy Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on November 3, 2009 18 Comments in Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Sally Hansen , Swatches A little more beauty on a budget kids with the Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Inspired by Carmindy Collection. I’m little late to this ballgame as this line was introduced a while back ago and I just got a chance to try it out recently. You know me I’m such a nitpicker when it comes to drugstore makeup. What do you think? Will I like Sally Hansen’s Natural Beauty Collection? We’ll see…. Jump for it. More than ever before, today women are more and more drawn towards a green friendly makeup. Concerns about ingredients in cosmetics has become a main focus when selecting cosmetics and skincare. Natural ingredients and paraben formulas are becoming more and more popular in the world and in response to this demand, Sally Hansen developed the Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Collection. If you happen to prefer a paraben-free formula and a more natural makeup line, the Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Collection Inspired by Carmindy should appeal. Made up of lip, eye, cheek, and face cosmetics you’ll have plenty to choose from with a budget friendly price to sweeten the deal. I tried out a few eye palettes, some lipsticks, and gloss and it’s not half bad. I’m normally quite wary of trying out more natural makeup as sometimes a lack of certain ingredients does bring down quality. Sally Nansen Natural Beauty Instant Definition Eye Palettes are a worthy pick up. At around $7 bucks these palettes contain three shades of shadow for highlighting, defining and contrasting. The shadows are all quite smooth and rich in pigment. They blend beautifully well without a harsh blast of color as they are easy to use for a light color wash or build up for a more dramatic look. They don’t wear so well without prepping and primer and will pretty much disappear within a few hours so make sure to use a good primer to keep them wearing well all day. The palette includes three shades to make up your eye. The lightest shade can be used to highlight your highbrow or as a prepping color wash while the two main shades can be used on lid and crease for a contrasting look. I tried out two of the palettes which were The Earth Palette and The Storm Palette. The Earth Palette makes for a pretty olive green look where as The Storm Palette offers up some perfect shades for a smoky eye look. Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Color Comfort Lipstick are a color rich lipstick with a natural formula. Now these I wasn’t too impressed with. Aside from pigmentation the actual lipsticks failed to thrill me and I didn’t find the formula all that incredible however I did take note that the pigment was quite good for a drugstore brand. The paraben-free formula and budget friendly price make them a good contender in the beauty budget arena. Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Natural Shine Lip Gloss are now my sister’s fav gloss. She thinks these are flipping awesome and even I can admit they are pretty good. Pretty nice pigmentation, a good brush applicator (yay for brushes! hate sponges grrr!), and a moisturizing formula that feels lightweight on the lips makes for a great gloss. Overall, the Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Line is an interesting array of cosmetics that should appeal to those who are ingredient conscious or anyone who is seeking out a cheaper alternative to higher end, higher costing counter cosmetics. These performed fairly well for me and I can see myself further exploring the eye palettes and glosses. I am quite interested in possibly trying out the base products as well now. Anyone try? Any favs? What are your thoughts on the Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Collection? Curious minds, share!

"[""Sneaky Little Spontaneous Purchases! By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 2 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Hauls , Shower & Bath On my rush to get home last week I decided that it would be such a grand idea to stop into Bath and Body Works to pick up the three newest 3 in 1’s! A little history behind these new 3 in 1’s: They are a big ripoff of Philosophy’s 3 in 1’s and could………possibly…..be better! You did not hear that from me, if you spread the word you heard it from me…I’ll deny it! I have no shame, I’ll claim you a liar and laugh about how ridiculous you are to spread such a rumour as this! Now around Christmas 2005, Bath and Body Works introduced three very simple 3 in 1 Shower Gels. They were, as I recall, Eggnog, Hot Chocolate, and Gingerbread. Obviously they went over pretty big because summer rolled around with new 3 in 1’s. Pina Colada, Strawberry Daiquiri, and another, the name of which, escapes me at the moment. After this, quite a few were released with the new seasons…. Now these must have been quite a smashing success because this year they went nuts and released around 12 new scents! They never did anything like this on such a large scale so the variety was quite lovely! Peach, Melon Cooler, Island Coconut, Frosting Forever, Iced Tea, Etc..Etc… Oh my how naughty! Does this remind you of anything? Talk about shameless copying! Now my story got off track slightly and I have to somehow pull myself back to the right mind frame! All this variety frazzles my nerves! As I was saying I decided to pop into Bath and Body Works to purchase three new 3 in 1’s in particular! I had wandered on the website during my work day and noticed that they were $6 during the HUGE Semi-Annual Sale! I was shocked that something they introduced a few short weeks ago was cut in half from it’s original $12 price tag! WOW! The three newest scents that they had put out were Island Coconut, Sunset Mango, and Beyond Berry! These scents were introduced after the above mentioned ones so I was quite pleased that I’d be nabbing myself a little deal! I now realize what a conspiracy the $6 price tag is! Heed my warning and you can avoid the drama of Spontaneous Purchasing! When I entered Bath and Body Works that day the line of people was what borderlines on the absurd really. People holding tight to dozens and dozens of bottles of body sprays,body lotions, etc…. These people were acting like there might very well be a shortage of lotions, shower gels, and body sprays sometime in the near future (Dear oh Dear maybe they knew something I didn’t?!?!?!)! It’s actually very difficult, to hold your head high, walk through the aisles, and avoid bins that are marked $3, $4, $5, etc…. I’ve come to the conclusion that the gimmick of setting the newest 3 in 1 scents at $6 a piece is just to get your little ass in the shop because when you are there you aren’t settling for just those three shower gels! You’re wanting some of everything! Before long you’re running around with the rest of the minions gathering up bottles of lotion that will keep you smooth for the rest of your living days! I’m happy to report I didn’t give into temptation! I resisted! Bath and Body Works evil little plot to get me in the shop and spend a zillion dollars didn’t work!! I went in, purchased the three bottles I said I would and not a thing more! Go on, pat me on the back! I deserve it right? Ahh..the temptation of spontaneous buying weights heavy on my mind and heart but resist I did and came out a stronger person for it! My Very Small Haul from This Year’s Semi Annual Sale! C-Shock: A New MAC Color Story Part 2 By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 Leave a Comment in MAC , Summer Collections 2007 C-Shock was all it promised to be! The lipgelees and lipsticks weren’t so fantastic in my humble opinion, way to loud and garish. The real star of the show were the shadows. The only one I didn’t get was passionate as that was a repromote and originally released with the Nocturnelle color story back in the fall! Of course I’d never leave you without taking some fine pics of the bits I purchased today!

I’m pretty excited about this one girls (and guys)! The shadows are extra bold and outrageous, just the way I like ’em, because after all I’m a bold and an outrageous girl (So not true but it does sound exciting when I type that doesn’t it? Don’t kill the mood let me go on believing that for the next 2 minutes of this post!)! You can go ahead and add exciting in there as well…I’m bold, outrageous, and exciting…oh wait..we were discussing MAC weren’t we? Truly the one that I am properly chuffed about would be Big T!

That said…let’s move on to the good stuff! My lovely, sweet, gorgeous, amazing, beautiful, and loving friend Mai is coming from Japan to stay with me shortly. Hi Mai! I know you read this lovie! I got a package from Mai this pass week! Mai is my asian cosmetic crack dealer. She is, it’s true. Don’t worry her english sucks so right now she’s scratching her head and possibly her arse and wondering what a crack dealer is (don’t worry she can take a joke and loves when I tease her)! Love you Mai! Anyway… Within this gorgeous, amazing, bright, shiny, huge package, there be treasure maties! Oh my was it ever the package of all packages! I had asked Mai to pick me up some bits, bobs, and a little of this and that! By the time I was done I had raked up a bill with Mai that could put my first born child through college for the next four years of his life. Somehow, I convinced myself that it was ok to spend that much money on cosmetics because…because….I dunno how I convinced myself it was ok! Let’s not dwell on that right now! Mai is now happily sitting on a Paypal payment from me that’ll fund her morgage for a year! Yes yes I know I know! You want to see the amazing items I got don’t you? Greedy little buggers aren’t you? Behold: Aube Sofina Limited Edition Fruitina Lipgloss These are awesome! I’m well chuffed and disappointed I didn’t order 10 more! Super duper glossy and shimmering! I just didn’t like the fact that they weren’t flavored. That was somewhat crummy! They taste sorta yuk! But I guess I can deal with it! Those are real Swarvoski crystals embedded in the top! Pretty neat right? Lavshuca Jewel Lipstick Really pleased with these as well! I was shocked that it turned out these are NOT full size lipsticks! They are mini ones! Very cute and very portable! I was under the impression they were larger! Aside from that they are great! I picked the color selections from my mate PJ’s blog and I’m glad I went with them because they are both great colors! Can’t go wrong with PJ! I want more of these as well! They go on quite sheer and are just a blush of color for your lips! Nice product! T’estimo Eyeshadow Singles I’m a T’estimo whore! But my entire time purchasing T’estimo cosmetics I’ve never once purchased an eyeshadow single! These are my first! Not much to say really! They are just as wonderful as anything you find in the palettes! Possibly even nicer to have a single color outside the palette theme! Really enjoy how sparkling and shimmery they go on! Lavshuca Blush These were introduced as part of the summer lineup! Rubbish. I purchased the mosiac blushes prior to these and was disappointed! I should have known better! Not even a sheer wash of color from these! Barely pigmented! Absolute garbage! Up on E-bay tomorrow! Was kinda hoping for a better product! Oh well! Win some, lose some! Shiseido Maquillage Glossy Gloss There are certain brands of cosmetics that are like bread! You go to the store, you buy bread, you eat the bread and it’s good! It’s rare that you buy bread that you hate (hell take it from a round girl, carbs are GOOD)! Shiseido is like bread! Anything you buy from Shiseido is an absolute winner! You can’t really go wrong. It’s a solid cosmetic brand that makes outstanding products. These glosses are just what they say “glossy gloss”! Intense shine and gloss! Really just perfect! Lavshuca Loose Face Powder This is an interesting little find! I use a unique little product, that I won’t reveal since I have to have some secrets, to lighten my face. I purchased this as a possible replacement! And I’m quite delighted to say it can’t be used in the same manner as I use the other shhhh secret product! I’m delighted because this is actually a shimmering powder that makes my cheeks and face look all sparkle like and lovely! Really like this one! Jill Stuart Blush Some Jill Stuart Blushes I didn’t have! I have almost all the colors now! These were just as great as all my others ? Jill Stuart Brilliance Eyes Summer 2007 Eyeshadow Palette This is the 5th palette they introduced for the Brilliance Eyes collection! I own them all and I love them! This one however was…mmm slightly disappointing! I was not loving the black color! Why they felt the need to put in black is beyond me! But hey the rest are cool ? Jill Stuart Loose Powder Gorgeous shimmering powder! I already have this in the Shine and Natural colors and this is by far my favorite! Sparkle! Weeeeeee! The Pretty Boxes Jill Stuart Arrived In! Lavashuca Lipstick Not much to say about these! I have a zillion already and these are just some extra colors I wanted! Sheer, glossy and wonderful as always! T’estimo Lipstick Again, not much to say! I have a ton already but wanted a few more ? Great colors! Shimmering, glossy, and sheer! These are what MAC slimshines hope to be like when they grow up! So that pretty much concludes our tour of my latest purchases! Hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed posting it! Drop me an e-mail if you have questions about where to purchase these items or what countries they are available in! My ear is yours! I’m always pleased to help! Sunset and Sunny Eyes By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 Leave a Comment in Face of the Day Sleep is gone yet again! I have no idea what I’ve done to it but it ran away! When it gets back I’m giving it a solid beating! For now I’ll keep myself busy posting some FOTD’s Face of the Day Pictures !

I think snow storms and rainy days are ideal for snuggling in bed and sleeping late. 246. My sister and I work together. 247. I think Blue Bunny Bunny Tracks ice cream is ambrosia. 248.

"['About the Muse Profile By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 Leave a Comment in Beauty Babble Who is this Muse girl anyway? Around the Internet I’m simply known as the Muse. A Muse of makeup maybe..the Muse in Musings perhaps? Could be anything. Who am I really? I’m just an average, everyday, general cosmetic junkie that plans to take over the world. You can join me and my minions on our quest for cosmetic nirvana by reading my uber awesome, fabulous blog! In all seriousness………. I’m a 30 year old, native New Yorker. Born, Bred, and Raised in this little city (but traveled far from home on many a fine occasion seeking new and exciting beauty products from distant lands…it’s true just check my blog for reviews on products you may have never heard of!). Contrary to popular belief I do not work in the fashion or cosmetic industry, far from it. When I’m not moonlighting as the Editor here at Musings (Wow! Editor sounds so bloody important doesn’t it?) I have a real job, in the real world as an Insurance Broker, underwriting commercial and personal policies. I own and operate my own office with my older sister and together we are a legend in our own minds (I’m positive other people think we are legendary as well but I haven’t met one yet! If I do I’ll let you know!). I also enjoy pina coladas and getting caught in the rain…. When I’m not posting tons of reviews, testing new products, and playing around in the comment box with my awesome readers you can find me at some high end counter looking for the next awesome cosmetic find. I’m also a geek and come with all the excess baggage geeks come with such as attending crazy conventions, playing stupid amounts of WoW , reading manga, and watching Star Trek and Doctor Who reruns. In my spare time I love shopping, eating out, going to the movies, and enjoying good times with my friends (Hey, I live in the city that never sleeps! We got plenty of awesome entertainment options here!). I’m a huge lover of literature, indie and foreign films and could possibly be more passionate about these than cosmetics. Whoa. I adore traveling and have been to many great and exotic places! I’m a big lover of Japanese, Korean, and British popular culture. Ok, ok enough about me…I feel like I’m on a dating site here….

"['Sonia Kashuk Classic Palette Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on December 29, 2009 5 Comments in Holiday Collections 2009 , Palettes , Sonia Kashuk , Swatches , Winter Collections 2009 If you’re looking for a work friendly look or a nice, neutral look for New Year’s you might want to check out the Sonia Kashuk Classic Palette for $19.99 as it brings color and tools together in one slim, flip top palette. Check it after the jump! Sonia Kashuk Classic Palette was a Holiday release but honestly you can easily work it year round for an elegant look. It’s a tri-fold palette with a full size mirror, brushes, and a full face palette to create several neutral looks. You get four brushes, three eye shadows, three lip creams, one liner, and one blush. Design wise the palette is quite nice. It folds up into a small size which is tiny enough for travel or toting around for touch ups. The full lenght mirror and brushes are a welcome addition, making the palette friendly for stowing away in a desk draw or carrying around. Although I find the brushes a very nice touch they do run towards being a tad scratchy and coarse. The makeup in the palette is quite nicely pigmented but does feel a tiny bit cheap. I created a nice look using the products however some items proved better to work with than others. The shadows blend nicely with good color payoff likewise for the blush. The liner is nicely pigmented as well and will work wet or dry. I did feel the lip creams were a tad badly formulated and dry on my lips. The overall feel of the cosmetics wasn’t nearly as good as other cosmetics I’ve tried from the Target Sonia Kashuck Collection. They blend well, are nicely pigmented, but I can’t shake the feel of cheap makeup when I use the palette. Overall, I think it’s a nice palette for quick looks or for those who aren’t experienced with makeup and desire an all in one palette. It makes a rather nice gift as well or just to purchase to keep in your desk draw when you need to quickly do up makeup for an evening out, etc….. Ok, but not great by any means. Anyone haul? Do share your review! Available now from Target. Disclosure: The following item was provided to Musings of a Muse by a PR firm for review purposes.

"['Urban Decay Alice in Wonderland Book of Shadow Review, Swatches, and Photos By Isabella Muse on January 15, 2010 121 Comments in Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Spring Collections 2010 , Swatches , Urban Decay It’s today, it’s today! It’s feels right proper like Christmas doesn’t it? Today, the Urban Decay Alice in Wonderland Book of Shadows makes it’s special appearance for purchase at www.urbandecay.com . Some of you already commented and e-mailed telling me you got yours! Damn, you’re quick little devils aren’t you? Anyone that’s a fan of the story, the upcoming movie (‘ello Johnny Depp), or most important, Urban Decay cosmetics will want to get their greedy, grubby little paws on the Alice in Wonderland Book of Shadows! Have a jump for instant gratification to a world of Alice swatches, babblings from yours truly, and photos! Best hurry or you’ll be late to a very important date. For the Muse the novelty of first laying my eyes on the Alice in Wonderland Book of Shadows would have to be the adorable pop-up scene of Alice in the mushroom forest. A large mirror rests behind the scent creating the illusion of a deep forest of towering mushrooms on the path that leads to a bizarre hookah-smoking caterpillar. As with the standard book of shadows this is a slide drawer design. The design and scene of Alice’s journey flips up and the drawer of shadows is hidden beneath, pull it forward to reveal 16 shades of Urban Decay Eyeshadow, 2 Urban Decay 24/7 Eye Pencils, and a Mini Bottle of EyeShadow Primer Potion (I tried drinking it to see if it would make me smaller but nope it obviously doesn’t have the same ingredients as the cocktail Alice downed.) This version of Book of Shadows is a bit special as you already know since the names of the shadows have been remained to various characters and places in the book (film). Many of you were instantly curious about which shades these were from the general catalog so I’ve taken the liberty (with a little help from Urban Decay who sneakily placed the names of the colors on the packaging) of breaking down which shadows are which. Underland (Flash) Alice (Painkiller) Oraculum (Baked) Queen (Last Call) Chessur (Chopper) White Rabbit (Polyester Bride) Wonderland (Maui Wowie) Curiouser (Grifter) Muchness (X) Mushroom (Mushroom) Midnight Tea Party (Midnight Cowboy Rides Again) Vorpal (S&M) Absolem (Homegrown) Drink Me, Eat Me (Sin) Madhatter (Twice Baked) Jabberwocky (Oil Slick) The palette is made up, for the most part, of some of Urban Decay’s less glittery shadows. White Rabbit, Midnight Tea Party, and Wonderland are probably the most glittery of the bunch. Where as Underland, Alice, Oraculum, Queen, Vorpal, Mad Hatter, Absolem, and most all the other shadows are more of a satiny finish sans a slew of glitter. It goes without saying the shadows are all intensely pigmented and blend with ease for a flawless finish. Urban Decay also included a mini primer potion to keep your shadows in place all day along with Flipside and Zero 24/7 Eyeliners. Shades are broken down by as follows: Underland-Bright iridescent purple Alice-Bright bold aqua (From the Urban Decay Show Pony Shadow Palette) Oraculum-Rich Bronze Queen-Plum Chessur-Coppery fawn with silver shimmer White Rabbit-White with silver glitter Wonderland-Dirty gold with silver glitter Curiouser-Lavender with silver glitter Muchness-Golden Peach Mushroom-Pewter Midnight Tea Party-Champagne pink with silver glitter Vorpal-Bright metallic silver Absolem-Bright true grass green Drink Me, Eat Me-Champagne Madhatter-Brown with golden shimmer Jabberwocky-Black and with silver sparkle I only had time to do two looks sadly as I just got my palette two days ago but next week, if you want, I’ll create some other looks. My first look was created using Alice, White Rabbit, and a bit of the Flipside liner. It quite reminds me of Alice’s lovely blue eyes and the color of her pretty dress! My second look was created using Chessur and Muchness. The colors reminded me of a calico cat! Overall, I seriously couldn’t be more excited about the palette. My inner child squealed at how cute it was. The palette is $52 and honestly for such a well made palette with 16 shades of shadow plus the little extras I’d say it was a nice overall deal. Anyone who hasn’t had the pleasure of experiencing Urban Decay will have a wonderful time with this purchase or if you’re a long time fan you’ll happily add this to your collection. For more photos of the shadows in the palette please see my close up shots. Much to many a fan’s excitement the Urban Decay Alice in Wonderland Book of Shadows is available now from www.urbandecay.com Definitely grab it why you can as Urban Decay has created quite a buzz and I wouldn’t be too surprised to see it sell out fast. Anyone order it already? Wanting to? Loves it? Leaves it? Share your thoughts with the Muse! I’d greatly appreciate it if you not hotlink images, thanks!

"['MuseTV Presents: Fall Collection Haul By Isabella Muse on July 29, 2007 9 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , Japanese Brands , KATE , Lavshuca , Majolica Majorca , MuseTV ‘ello there! I was lucky enough to get a delightful little package in the mail of which contained the Fall Japanese goodies! I did a video blog of ’em for you guys! I’ve added in pics as well and will be doing reviews and Face of the Days pics very soon! MuseTV Presents: Fall Collection Haul: Please excuse the poor quality of the pictures ? I normally take photos with my trusty Kodak DX6490. I decided that I’d go with cute and super portable so I purchased a Sony Cyber Shot T20 this past week! I was excited to have a smaller cam to use for taking pics for my blog and just generally toting around for small shots here and there! My DX6490 is only 4MP’s has a virtually no ISO so the T20 was quite appealing at 8MP with an obscene ISO, HD output, onscreen editing, and a tons of other bells and whistles. Upon getting it in the mail I flipped out at how cute it was. I proceeded to try some Face of the Day pics plus some additional variety, random shots and………it’s crap. I strongly suggest not bothering! I’ve just now finished wrapping it up and it’s going right back for a full return! I am astounded at the crap quality of the pics! Everything had a weird orange tinge too it plus the ISO had a setting of 300 because anything more would cause some mega crap quality photos! Do tell me whatcha think of these pics taken with the cybershot as compared to my older pics in my blog taken with my trusty kodak! I’ve been sorely tempted to purchase a Nikon D40 but can’t justify the cost for a hobbyist like myself. It’d be far different if I had a family with children and such but just to purchase the D40 for hobby shots of cosmetics, some vacation photos, and random shots seems just a silly purchase really! I adore photography but the general idea of the D40 seems a spoiled indulgence on my part! Anyway! On to the pics ? New Lavashuca Palettes Older Lavshuca Palette, New Color! New Lavshuca Glosses Lavshuca Glitter Mascara MJ Honey Plump Glosses MJ Fall Eyeshadows New MJ Mascara and Neo Lash Expander MJ Fall Collection Glosses MJ Fall Collection Eyeliners KATE Fall Shadow Collection KATE Gel Eyeliners KATE Dual Carat Eyeshadow Kiss Lipgloss Maqulliage Pressed Powder Visee Eyeshadow Palette A Few Words of Thanks By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 3 Comments in Babbling Bits I owe some huge words of thanks to a few people! Thanks to Touch of Blusher and Rougue Deluxe for linking me and pimping me via their blogs! Appreciate it greatly and can’t say thanks enough! Also a huge thank you to a reader of Touch of Blusher who came up with the term “MuseTV”! I love it and hope you don’t mind me using it! It’s the entire concept behind the blog now and I think it’s such a sweet little theme for my blog! Many hugs! Again, Thanks a plenty and hugs all around! Celebrate Good Times! Come On! By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 Leave a Comment in Babbling Bits Good News! A majority of my entries from myspace are moved over and I can now start getting back to my regularly scheduled blogs! Are you excited or what? Now I need some sleep!!!! Please Leave a Message after the Beep! By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 6 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Face of the Day ‘ello ‘ello friends! Sleep is at the pub (I made that up! We don’t have pubs in New York! Pssstttt… Jonny doesn’t believe it but I’m trying to convince him! Help a girl out! Tell him yanks don’t do the pub scene!). Sleep is……..at the drug store picking up some beer for me, oh my I made that up too as I don’t drink! Wait wait a good excuse will come to me soon! Pause for effect……………………………………. Sleep is playing strip poker with Tammie and her juicy nipples! Wow…those of you who have no idea who Tammie is or her juicy nipples may have stumbled onto more than you bargained for! Eep ….I’m bracing myself for the family and friend phone calls tomorrow morning! Oh my how very unladylike of me to say juicy and nipples in the same sentence! And to think this originally started out in my feeble mind as being a blog about cosmetics! Oh brother! I swear blogging is alot like talking to yourself. It’s all rather calming! I imagine as long as I don’t answer myself back I should be safe from the and the little men in white suits and all that stuff! Oh..I am babbling aren’t I? What was this about again…….. OH yes! I remember now! Face of the Day Picture! Without further delay I bring to you a new look: What I Used: Bare Minerals Glimmer in 2000 on Highbrow Bare Minerals Glimmer in Bloom on Lid Bare Minerals Glimmer in Azure in Crease My Trusty MJ Mascara Super simple one! It came out crap because I rushed it and just wasn’t into doing it! I normally put most of my heart into creating the looks but today I was just feeling tired! It came out alright for something rushed and done in a sloppy manner though! Suggestions, Comments, Questions? My little ears are perked and at the ready! I got around to using my #227 brush! Which is a freaking gem! I have to thank Leesha for that rec! She’s always saying how great the brush is in her you tube tutorials that I caved and purchased it! Holy cow! Great brush! I normally use the #224 or the #217 but I think the #227 can possibly take over both of those brushes in my beauty arsenal! It’s really quite a little multitasker! Strongly suggest you grab one for yourself! Most expensive brush in my collection. Why you ask? Because I freaking had to buy it twice!!!!!!!! Funny story about the brush….I popped over to Macy’s to buy it after I left work the other day. So I’ve been sorta shit this week and I was just doing a quick run for the brush! I got there and my lovely boy Deanie (I guess gay men can get away with names like Deanie don’t ask me I dunno! I love him so lay off!) got me the brush! So I shell out my money…$32 bucks and change! Good price for a killer brush like this! I leave the store and I’m walking down 42nd Street and passing along Herald Square and I notice the bag feels freaking light. I dropped the bloody brush. Gone. Finished! Disappeared! I retraced my steps all the way back to the bloody MAC counter and didn’t find it! Some lucky girl is blending her heart out with my brush! I hope whoever found it is enjoying it! Anyway, to make a really long story short I ended up buying a new one! So this is probably the most expensive freaking brush in my collection! I’ve spent $55 on a brush, I’ve spent $30, I’ve spent $25, but never freaking $65 plus dollars! Oh lord! Someone shoot me in the forehead and put me out of my misery! Anyway I’m babbling….I believe sleep hasn’t come home yet…damn Tammie and her nipples….. I shall watch my telly until it decides to drag it’s sorry arse home! I’m putting my foot down this time! When it comes home I am not letting it out of my site for a good long while! An Oldie but Goodie By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 4 Comments in Face of the Day Just like some of us may have a bad hair day, I had a bad make-up day! Today’s make-up came out somewhat crummy for whatever reason. Maybe I rushed, maybe I was tired….hundred things went wrong this morning and I just disliked my entire look! I was feeling kinda ugly today so ya….total girl moment! So……….I bring you an oldie but goodie in place of what would have been today’s Face of the Day! This was taken sometime in April for an evening out while I was in London. Really Simple Dramatic Eye Look. …. Used: MAC Pro Pigment in Deep Sea Green Mac Pro Pigment in Teal That’s it ?

"['Beauty Babble: Weathering Makeup By Isabella Muse on June 19, 2009 Leave a Comment in Asian Brands , Beauty Babble , Kat Von D , Korres Natural Products , Lush , MAC , Skincare , Urban Decay Wanna Beauty Babble with me? During our last babble we were hit with survival beauty and all the essentials we’d need in dire situations. How To Play: The Beauty Babble section basically is a scenario of “possibilities” with questions and answers about what you’d do in situations where cosmetics would be needed! Today’s babble is about various weather conditions and makeup items or skincare you’d need in such situations! Jump ahead to read my babblings and submit your own if you’re wanting to play! You head to work on Monday expecting it to be like any other day of the week when your boss pulls you aside with some incredible news. He relates to you that he wants to send you to London for the entire Summer to work at the UK branch. You’re so excited you can’t believe your good luck! As soon as you leave his office you dial up your best friend who lives in England to share the details. Your best friend informs you that it would be a terrible time to come to London right now because the predicted weather for the next three months is gloomy, cloudy weather and rain! You’re kinda feel badly after you hear this especially since you’re having perfect Summer weather right at home. You keep your chin up and decided you’ll need a few makeup essentials to bring Summer with you to cold, dreary London. What will they be (choose five)? I’d choose a fun Summer scent, a great bronzer, a pretty shade of blush, a shimmery, Summery palette for my eyes, and a good primer to keep my makeup from falling off my face in the rain! My picks: Fragrance: Harajuku Lovers G Warm, coconut will help me think Summer during those rainy days! Bronzer: Urban Decay Baked Bronze in Glided As if you haven’t heard enough how much I love this bronzer! Shimmery cheeks with hint of gold and peach will bring a little sun to my cloudy day in London! Blush: MAC Eversun Blush My ideal blush this Summer and plenty peachy to bring a little color into my world on dreary days! Eyeshadow Palette: Kate Von D Gypsy Eyeshadow Palette A slew of Summery greens to spring up my look in the rain! Primer: Korres Face Primer Love this stuff! Keeps my makeup so fresh! Hopefully it’ll help keep it waterproof too! Your best friend asks you to dinner on Friday night and explains she has amazing news to tell you! You meet up with her and as you’re ordering dinner she springs on you she’s getting married to an Arabian Sheikh. With your mouth hanging open you gasp in shock! After getting over your shock you gush how excited you are for her. After the waiter leaves with your order you proceed to ask her for all the details. She explains that the wedding will take place in the Sahara Desert. Trying not to gasp in shock you begin plotting skincare items you’re going to need to keep your face properly moist. Pick three items to keep your skin in order! My picks: Lush Ocean Salt Most people don’t use Ocean Salt on their face because they feel it’s too harsh but I happen to love it! It’s ideal for those crazy desert days when my skin begins to flake up! Mandom Perfect Assist 24 Double Moist Cream This will keep my skin moist and dewy while the sun is beating down on my head! Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sun Block Gotta have high SPF for those sunny days in the desert! 85+ on this one! w00t! Ok! Now it’s your turn. The desert and dreary, cold rain for three months! Babble it peeps and tell me what you’d need to survive these nasty weather conditions. You may also enjoy... Beauty Babble: Survival Beauty Beauty Babble: Money for Nothing!

"['Beauty Babble: Survival Beauty By Isabella Muse on May 14, 2009 Leave a Comment in Beauty Babble , Haircare , Lush , Mally Beauty Hey Guys! I’m trying out a new category here at Musings called Beauty Babble. The Beauty Babble section will basically be a scenario of “possibilities” with questions and answers about what you’d do in situations where cosmetics would be needed! For example. Your house on fyressssss! Oh my god! What beauty item would you grab while running out the door! (might as well add this one into our Beauty Babble this week) Fun right? Jump ahead to see this week’s Beauty Babble! Your in a deep sleep, REM has set in, your snoring out of one nostril and drooling from your mouth while dreams of Colin Firth sweeping you across an English country side dances through your head! Suddenly an annoying beeping makes a guest starring appearance in your Pride and Prejudice fantasy, what the hells is it? Oh my god it’s the smoke alarm! You have to jump out of your bed and get out of your house (or apartment, parent’s basement, rental room, etc…) as quick as you can! You have to grab one beauty product! What would it be? The Muse says concealer. I could probably live without the rest but I need concealer to cover up my scary puffy eyes, fine lines, and dark circles! I’d probably go with the Mally Concealer System , I figure I could pass it off as two products in one since it has a setting powder and a creamy concealer. You’re on a gorgeous cruise, the weather is beautiful, you’ve been enjoying fun in the sun and plenty of eating at that never ending buffet (does the food every end?). As you’re waiting on that buffet line in your string bikini the captain announces you must abandon ship! Waiting life boats are prepared to dump you on a deserted tropical island. The captain happens to be a makeup junkie so he allows you to select one item from your train case to take with you! What will it be? The Muse says SPF! As tempting as it is to say concealer or powder (imagine my oily face in that humidity), I’d much rather protect my skin with a good SPF, I’d simply die if I ended up all tanned and gross looking (the Muse no likey tanning). I’d probably go with Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protection as it’s one of my favs! As you’re yawning through your work day and procrastinating terribly by reading beauty blogs you notice your favorite blogger is going to the moon! You read further to hear she (or he) is giving away tickets to the moon, whoa. Foaming from the mouth you eagerly comment and enter for your chance to go to the moon with your favorite beauty blogger (your fav beauty blogger should be the Muse btw plus as soon as cosmetic companies start giving away trips to the moon you know damn well I’m holding a contest for one!). A week later you’re contacted about winning but sadly you’re only allowed to take one item with you due to strict moon travel accommodations. What do you take with you to the moon? I’d so take some sort of anti-frizz gel or spray! Imagine a no gravity situation? You’d be looking like Einstein as soon as your foot hit pay dirt! I’d probably go with Lush King of Mods , Soap & Glory Hair Supply , or some of that Sunsilk Captivating Curls smoothing cream! Now it’s your turn. Put your self in all the above situations, a fire, a trip to the moon, and a humid tropical island. Now think hard….what one item would you take with you to those destinations? This Beauty Babble is all about Survival Beauty! Post your answers in the comment box! Have fun! You may also enjoy...

"['Beauty Babble: Makeup On The Go By Isabella Muse on September 23, 2009 10 Comments in Beauty Babble , Bobbi Brown , Cargo , Philosophy , Shu Uemura Hey Chicas! I was feeling the need to Beauty Babble today as it’s been a while since we did one. If you want to babble with me here’s how it works. To play the game you’ll basically be filling in a series of questions about what you’d do in certain situations where cosmetics would be needed. Today’s babble is about makeup on the go! Jump ahead to read my babblings and submit your own if you?re wanting to play! Scenario 1 You’re running late for work, yet again, and have absolutely no time to do up your makeup. GASP! You soooo can’t make an appearance at work with absolutely no makeup on your face plus you don’t want the new guy from accounting to see you without your face on. What to do? How can you get your makeup done in a hurry on the way to work. The Muse is all about the new Philosophy Supernatural Coloring Book . It’s easy for dabbing on makeup on the fly plus the look is completely work friendly. It’s so easy you can do it on the way to work. I’d also tuck my Philosophy Finger Paints Corrector Palette in my bag as I love this for quickie touch ups and covering up my dark circles and such. Perfect for on the go makeup. What’s your favorite quick items for a super quick makeup application? Scenario 2 Your boyfriend comes over unexpectedly waving around two tickets to Hawaii that he won at the local grocery store. The problem is the flight leaves in 90 minutes and you only have time to pack a few essentials before heading to the airport. What five items do you take with you? I’d have to snag my Bobbi Brown Concealer Palette , Shills BB Cream, Shu Curler , some cheek stain, and my Urban Decay Book of Shadows, and a black eyeliner. Scenario 3 You’re getting ready for work one sunny morning and create a gorgeous yet simple look using some of the newest MAC Collection. You head outside and decide it’s a perfect day to walk to work (yeah right that would be my ideal world, where I can walk to work ha). Half way there the sky darkens and a sudden freak burst of rain starts pouring down. Your awesome makeup look gets utterly and completely ruined. You can’t go into your office looking like this. You head to the nearest washroom when you get to work and start digging in your purse trying to find items to repair your face. What’s inside your purse that can repair the damage? Well…I’d so freaked up if this happened. I don’t carry a whole lot of makeup with me but lucky enough I do have the following bits and bobs hanging out to help me. First off I’d get it all off as best I can. I normally have wipes of some sort hanging out in my bag so I’d use them to get most of the makeup off. I carry my Raycious Powder everywhere so I’d apply that as my foundation. I also have lip and cheek stain at all times so I’d use that on my cheeks and lips. A little gloss and finally I almost always tote around a Cargo Eyelighter so I’d dab that on my eyes. Well that wrapped up this session of Beauty Babble. Feel free to babble your makeup on the go solutions, looking forward to hearing them! You may also enjoy... Beauty Babble: Money for Nothing!

"['Looking Pretty Doesn’t Break Bad Habits By Isabella Muse on August 6, 2007 1 Comment in Beauty Babblings , Hand and Nails I’m a true girly girl in ever sense of the word! I love cosmetics, I love bath products, I love new shoes and gorgeous clothes, I love all girly bits and bobs! Anything that’s pink and shimmers is always appealing! The extent of my girly nature ends when it comes to doing my nails! I’m a big time nail biter! I bite my nails constantly! It’s a terrible habit that’s difficult to break! Not only is it terrible but it’s down right disgusting! This weekend I went away a few days with some friends and decided that I’d get all glam and do my nails. The good news is that it made my chubby little fingers look long and lean. The bad news is it drove me nuts all weekend trying to relearn how to use my hands with such long nails on the tips! Last night, after getting home, I began the intricate surgery of removing these bloody things! It obviously wasn’t going to be an easy procedure so I went to bed very unhappy! This morning I came to work with what remained of these nails on and promptly sat in the washroom for the better part of the last 30 minutes popping them off one by one because I am unable to work with these freaking things on! I give huge kudos and props to those of you who are able to function day to day with long nails! As for me I’ll stick to my bad habits and keep chomping away at the bit…! MAC Painterly and In3D By Isabella Muse on August 2, 2007 Leave a Comment in Hauls , MAC , MuseTV So…………..I went against my word in my prior blogs about Painterly and In3D and I went ahead and purchased some of the bits and bobs that were released! First off I should say that I’m not completely sold on Painterly yet! Lots of tugging to be had during application which kinda freaks me out! But I’ve decided maybe applying with a brush is the way to go with these! You can see my very first review and FOTD with Delft in a prior blog ! When I seen the display basically some of the colors sorta screamed at me and thus I walked away with 4 colors! Greenstroke Artifact Moss Scape Construtivist These are great colors and I’m looking forward to trying to convince myself to love these! I also ended up snatching up some of the new technakohls because really we can never have too many eyeliner pencils right? I ended up getting: Plank Foxtail Antiquity I also happened to fall in love with In3D! These shocked me as I’m not normally MAC’s biggest cheerleader when it comes to their glosses! But these are a good solid product and I think they should keep this formula around! It doesn’t have the normal sponge applicator but a brush like applicator which I love! I always feel like a brush applicator catches more product and you don’t have to keep dipping and layering! Some of the colors were just really gorgeous and pretty pigmented to the point that you won’t need stain or lipstick under these! The colors I ended up getting were: Racy In3D Boundless Apex Wondershine I did rant a bit in my last blogs about these new color stories but overall a nice haul of products this time so I take back some of the rants ? MuseTV decided it wanted it’s time in the spotlight as well so I present a video of MAC’s newest color stories (Sorry for my lack of enthusiasm I’m just dead tired tonight so these videos aren’t so great)! Enjoy! MuseTV Presents: Must Have Beauty Staples By Isabella Muse on August 2, 2007 3 Comments in Beauty Babblings , MuseTV Hello there!

MuseTV Presents: A Special Request of Must Have Beauty Items Stila Warehouse Sale By Isabella Muse on August 1, 2007 Leave a Comment in Beauty Babblings , Stila Those lucky enough to live in California were able to partake of the pagan ritual (I’m kidding it isn’t pagan but sometimes the general idea of a huge cosmetic sale and a buncha girls running to grab everything they can could possibly appear cult like to the non cosmetic whore) of this sale were able to nab some AMAZING deals! We hate you all, ever last stinking one of you (I’m kidding of course but damn I love drama)! Sigh. Now that I’ve expressed my dislike for people that got super deals at this sale I shall go on ? Well, the bad news is I wasn’t able to nab any of the deals as I wasn’t anywhere near California during this massive sale! They had palettes for $8 bucks each!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! $8 bucks???! That must be illegal in some states! God, I’m so depressed right now. Anyway, the good news is that some of the palettes were pretty rare and although people paid far less for them during the warehouse sale it’s obvious they’ll end up on E-bay for heaps more! But in a way that’s good news for the avid collector because if you happened to have either never nabbed these palettes before or want to add something special to your existing Stila collection now is a good time to search on E-bay and see what sort of deals you can nab! I’ve seen the following deals: Spring Trio Duos for $19.99 which were originally $25 (They probably paid $8-$12 for it but still that’s a good deal at $19.99) Wicked Special Edition Kits ranging from $19.99-$24.99 (Can’t recall the original price of these but they have been long gone and they are now popping up all over E-bay) Spring Ephemeral Trio for $34 (I was just asking my lovely mate Haru about this and now several have popped up on E-bay! These are going for about the original price they were in Asia which isn’t a bad deal at all in my humble opinion! During the sale these went for $8 but I still think $34 for the palette is quite the steal) Various Stila Girl Trio Shadows Ranging from $9.99-$14.99 (Can’t really recall the original price of these but at these prices that’s a deal as well)! Many deals are to be had on E-bay and even though some people are profiting from the sale (Hey it’s a dog eat dog world I guess!) I still think it’s great to nab some good deals at the moment as many of these items are difficult to find at the moment and now the market is saturated with great vintage Stila! Japanese youTube Video By Isabella Muse on August 1, 2007 3 Comments in Beauty Babblings I wandered over to visit my little friend Eru’s blog on myspace and she had thee most awesome youTube video up! I don’t wanna steal her thunder and post her video here so if you’d like to see it visit her blog here . Many brands I’ve done blogs on are featured in the video! You have to be sure to watch the complete video because at the end they feature awesome press on shadow! Now I’ve seen press on before and I can even get some here from Cargo! But these are amazing as they contain not 1 color but 3! The Japanese are so innovative in all things and something as mundane as press shadow that has three shades just flips me out! Really a cool product! If you aren’t familiar with press shadow here are ones that Cargo has released about two years ago or so: Now the general idea of the color cards from Cargo are beauty simplicity at it’s best! However, this isn’t nearly as simple as the press shadows featured in the video! The Cargo cards are meant to be used with a brush or a fingertip! The ones in the video take this a step further by allowing you to press them onto your eye area, slip them off, blend with your finger tip a bit and PRESTO! gorgeous shadow! This, my friends, is why Japanese brands get my money a majority of the time! Superb! Do check it out and if you have a myspace account I’m sure Eru would appreciate your comments about whatcha think!']",fa9b4274222a71a28632d0d053ffce65386b66b0,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4295,

"['Agent Provocateur Wants You To Strip! By Isabella Muse on August 8, 2007 Leave a Comment in Fragrance Agent Provocateur has updated it’s website with it’s newest fragrance Strip! Yours truly couldn’t wait to get my greedy, sweaty hands all over it so I’ve gone and ordered a bottle! Here’s the blurb from the website: Agent Provocateur Strip has an evocative soul accord made up of exotic Ylang Ylang, Iris Bud and Geranium Bourbon. This is embraced with the heat of Hot Amber oils, Vetivert from Haiti, precious Exotic Woods and musks that react to your body temperature and exudes from your skin to release the sexual attractant within. Now I guess I really need this because obviously, as advertised, it’s going to release my sexual attractant within! If anyone knows me you know that sexy and myself don’t actually fit into the same sentence! This fragrance is not only promising to make me smell sexy but also release my special inner sexy minx scent that will have everyone just positively wanting me! How about that for multitasking folks! (I wonder if they make an Eau De Dorky, that would probably work better on me) In all seriousness I was disappointed by Ma?tresse so I’m slightly weary of Strip but we shall see! I was so psyched about Ma?tresse release I had purchased two and was utterly devastated it didn’t work with my body chemistry! The good news is the second bottle is going to a good home with my boyfriend’s mum who I am hopeful will love it more than I did! I guess with all the hype surrounding the original AP I was looking forward to it’s sister with much excitement only to have my giddy pleasure dashed upon spraying it on me! So…here’s to hoping Strip is gorgeous! If not…E-bay anyone? Diorissime Fall Collection 2007 By Isabella Muse on August 8, 2007 5 Comments in Dior , Fall Collections 2007 It’s that time of the year again kids! Dior has introduced it’s newest palette for the Fall collection and I was hyperventilating as I viewed it in all it’s glory at Nordies a few nights ago! The good news is it’s gorgeous, the bad news is that I didn’t buy it! Oh my god the cries of outrage are so loud! I hear you all now screaming in agonized pain about the unjustness of me not purchasing a Dior palette! But, if you’re at all familiar with the Muse’s purchasing habits you’d know why! Remember children. Buy your Dior broad! I’ve called up my very sweet mate in England and asked her to waddle on down to Boots to get my Diorissime palette because for obvious reasons the 001 version is far better than the shit 002 version that has graced the US shores! Our version, as always, is a crummy darker palette which I’m utterly hating. It’s gorgeous in the sense that the clutch was beautiful but the colors inside just aren’t for me! Thus 001 is the one for this muse! I haven’t yet received it but it should be with me any day and I’ll take some lovely porn pictures of it for you to drool all over! I nabbed some pictures from E-bay of both palettes and you can see for yourself why the 001 version is far superior to the crap we get here in the US! 001 002 I’m quite tempted to lick the monitor screen at the moment viewing those pictures! I’ll try to refrain! As with almost all cosmetics, I am tempted to purchase both but really I don’t see myself using the US version! The colors are just too blah for lack of a better word! If for some odd reasons or another you are lemming 002 you can purchase it now from Sephora and other locations that carry Dior! If you’re lemming 001, quick, find a mate to purchase it for you! It’s available in Singapore, Japan, and of course the lovely UK! Which do you prefer? Customizing Your Haircare By Isabella Muse on August 7, 2007 14 Comments in Haircare , Online Shopping The sense of scent is a unusual and unique mystery! Different scents are appealing to different people. Some people find the smell of a baking pie very comforting, some enjoy the sweet scent of a ripe peach, others enjoy the smell of wet glass after a rainfall. The good news about your choice of scent is that you can have it and customize it to suit your haircare! Yes, indeed, I did say haircare! The internet offers wonderful shopping options and some very posh brands of haircare are available, believe me I know, as I’ve tried them all! But for the last few years I’ve turned to smaller companies that create a wonderful utopia of haircare products that suit my need for not only a good volumizing shampoo and a deep quenching condition but also a sweet smelling one or a foody scented one! I’ve come across some wonderful small shops that offer wonderful customization for shampoos, conditioners, hair sprays, hair gels, hair refreshers, and more! These small shops offer a wide range of scents that will suit any need! Scents range from fresh baked goods like cookies, cakes, and cupcakes, different fruits, and of course wonderful sweet scents to ease your need for sugar! I guess some people would wonder why I have a need to smell like a cupcake or a peach but hey that’s another mystery that’s unique…it all comes down to being a girl! Some scents I’ve come across in haircare that I’ve tried, fallen in love with, and stash in my washroom would be the following: Bunny Hugs-A dreamy and creamy blend of sliced fruit, with oranges, marshmallows and whipped cream. Cherry Cupcakes-Sweet, frosted vanilla & cherry cupcakes with light notes of almond & toasted coconut. Island Girl-A cocktail inspired fragrance blending of lemon and lime with cherry and pineapple. Violet Fairy Cakes-These little vanilla frosted, violet topped petit four cakes are perfect for a fairy tea party. White Cake-Scrumptious white cake with sweet almond notes! Banana Split Cupcakes-Chocolate banana cupcakes topped with strawberry cream and a cherry! Sweetheart Cake-Fluffy mini cream puffs stuffed with a soft strawberry buttercream with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Pretty in Paris-Sweet summer strawberries, oodles of marshmallow cream frosting, cotton candy and vanilla cream makes this one sweet treat. These are just some of the scents that line my bathroom cabinets. The companies I shop from offer a wide range of scents to suit every need, truly when I said wide range I mean it! Scent lists available from most sites go from 100-500 blends or more! Some companies are even willing to blend a custom scent to suit your needs if you happen to not locate one from the huge list they already have! I find that many of the haircare products linger very long in my hair and give off an amazing throw which means I am constantly asked, “Wow what is that wonderful smell”…! I always love to smell sweet and gorgeous I guess it comes with the girl territory and when someone remarks on how wonderful my hair smells I just glow and feel very tickled they noticed! These companies offer a wide range of items that can be customized but this blog entry is solely dedicated to the haircare line of items! Some shops to check out: Cherriflip An absolute favorite of mine hands down! Wonderful Shampoos, Conditioners, and Other great haircare products! Truly Uniquely blended scents available that cannot be located anywhere else! Cherriflip currently has a sale going on, 20% off your entire order! Take advantage of this great deal! Skindazzles Another favorite and the home of my very favorite, signature scent, Bunny Hugs! Skindazzles has 10% off select items at the moment! Make Me Smooth A wide range of different haircare needs with tons of scents to choose from! Ongoing sales change week to week! The Little Shop of Beauty Little Shop of Beauty is one of the few shops that offers hair gels and hair sprays in custom scents! Free Deluxe Samples with orders! These are just some of the dozens of shops that offer customized haircare! Have a search and you’ll find a million more! If you aren’t familiar with these forms of shops please keep in mind prior to ordering that they make your order upon your submitting it! This means that certain items do take a longer wait time! Some companies have wait times up to one month while others get products out faster! Basically your items are not sitting on a shelf and placed in a box for shipment, they are freshly made and then shipped to you! They are immensely popular as well which causes the wait time to go up accordingly, especially around the Holidays! Prices are affordable but some companies are Canadian which means costly shipping options! On the plus side some companies do run specials with 10%-20% off orders! Personally I love the option of clicking on a bottle of Shampoo and asking for it in any one of 500 scents! Many of these small shops revolve the scent lists as the seasons change and the holidays come up! I love smelling like sweet, juicy fruits in the summer and gorgeous pies, cakes, and cupcakes in the winter! I like the scent of cool mints or warm cakes and baked goods in my hair during Christmas and possibly the smell of caramel apple or candy corn during Halloween! If that isn’t customized haircare I don’t know what is! Some of the many haircare products that overflow from my washroom cabinets! MuseTV Presents: A Spotlight on Majolica Majorca By Isabella Muse on August 7, 2007 12 Comments in Japanese Brands , Majolica Majorca , MuseTV , Spotlights I get many fine questions about MJ or MM (short for Majolica Majorca) from many a fine person that wanders onto my youTube page or happens upon my blog! I went ahead and did a little spotlight video on some fantastic MJ products I love! Enjoy! MuseTV Presents: A Spotlight on Majolica Majorca Cargo SmokyEye Kit By Isabella Muse on August 7, 2007 Leave a Comment in Cargo , Fall Collections 2007 , Wish List I’m not normally tempted by any of Cargo’s cosmetics. I do have a few odd pieces and I like it well enough but it’s not my brand of choice. I must admit that this year I did indulge in purchasing a huge lot of the cute Christmas cards they do (These say “Santa Gloss Is Coming to Town”! How freaking cute is that???!!!)! I mean come on! What cosmetic whore do you know that can resist Christmas cards that have a dot of gloss on ’em (that’s completely usable by the very way)! Chances are if you’re a mate of mine you got one of these last year and chances are my little ass might just be super corny and go right ahead and send these again this year teehee! Anyway! I am tempted by this: The full size SmokyEye Brush has been on my wish list for a while so how cool is it that it’s bundled with this kit!? Pretty darn awesome in my opinion! I don’t believe this is a full size brush but probably a mini version but I’m still tempted by this kit’s price! Quite a bargain to be had here! Let’s see…off the topic of my head….It’s about $28 bucks for the cargo smokyeye duo and another $32 for brush so that’s $60 bucks for just two items and this kit has them PLUS a mascara and a cute little tin for $39 bucks! What a steal! Now not only has the brush been on my items to pick up but I’ve also wanted to try the Smokyeye duo for a while and here in lays the perfect excuse to try both plus get some nice little extras with the purchase! Overall I’d say this is a great little kit! Nice work Cargo it’s on my wish list!']",6bfb6c26ead895e9e3afedf844b03722b3a66c53,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4293,
"['Adventures in Shadesticking By Isabella Muse on July 31, 2007 2 Comments in Face of the Day After reading many, many, many, many, many have I mentioned many? many, reviews about how wonderful, amazing, fantastic, and brilliant MAC shadesticks are I decided to crack open my box of Dress Set Shade Sticks and pull out the Sea Me Shadestick for a try! Remember kids I don’t like cream shadows but I can be converted maybe, kinda, sorta…. I used the Sea Me Shadestick prior to applying some Steel Blue pigment and was quite impressed at the results!

Urban Decay has introduced 12 New Shades of Matte shadows! Oh my! I want them all! Yes, I did say that so get over it! I’m an avid collector of UD shadows and nothing will stop me from getting these! Well…maybe I’ll wait an itty bitty while before ordering..but it shouldn’t be too long! I’ve read a few blogs and they had mentioned that Urban Decay “promised” the shadows to be pigmented. This seems like a question. Is there any doubt these will be awesome? Come on…let’s be honest…these are going to reign supreme in our collection and possibly go for hand to hand combat with MAC matte shadows! I’m also hearing general excitement about Narcotic a bright turquoise!!! Oh the my! I, too, felt like it was Christmas upon seeing this gorgeous hue! It’s turquoise which means I’m all over that like candy! Hmmmm…but my brain begins to kick in and I stop thinking with my excited emotions and I realize wait a sec…this looks like freaking Piccadilly! Now I’m in a panic….a gorgeous shade of turquoise that just may be a rerun? Jesus, what an excitement killer! How terribly wrong of Urban Decay to get my hopes up only to have them crushed by the idea that this very may well be a spin off of Piccadilly! Narcotic Matte Eyeshadow My Beloved, Rare, Long Ago Discontinued Piccadilly Anyway the moral of the story is I still absolutely want Narcotic and the other 11 shades! However, Narcotic still seems to have the look of Piccadilly to it! I can cross my fingers that maybe, just maybe it’s even more vibrant and bold than Piccadilly! The 12 New Shades Are: Chronic: Bright Light Green ABC Gum: Pale Peach Foxy: Light Neutral Narcotic: Bright Turquoise Revolver: Stone Gray Perversion: Jet Black Secret Service: Medium Brown Illegal: Smoky Rose Cult: Eggplant Naked: Buff Nude Purple Haze: Bright Purple (Ooo! Cool! Purple Haze sans Glitter!) Yeyo: Powder White I think these will be great for layering with the regular Urban Decay shadows! All in All some nice shades in this bunch and long over do as plenty of people found application with UD shadows a general mess! Personally I love ’em and never had much problem with fall outs but I know some people who are sure to be happy with a matte formula! Speak to me! Are these on your wish list?

I’m curious if these are replacing the old style paints! But I’m doubtful as these are entirely new colors!

Reason being with airline security being so tight these are a simple little treat to stow in your train case without the drama of large bottles! They also double as a bar of soap! Wash your hair and your body with one puck! Cool eh? You’re probably curious how these work aren’t you? Easy as pie! Wet your hair, swipe the bar across your head a few times, lather, rinse, repeat, and smile! Simple as 1-2-3! Not only are these easy to use and easy to travel with but they last for ages! If you’re currently being frugal with your money and don’t want to shell out for expensive shampoos this is a good way to go! One puck will last as long as 3-4 months! If you aren’t happy enough at the idea of a cute little shampoo puck you will be at the fact that they have cute little tins to hold ’em in too! Excited yet? I knew you would be! And since Lush likes it’s customers so much, if you buy two bars you’ll get a free tin! Yay! At the moment their are 9 different bars to choose from! I’ve tried most of them so I can give you a brief review of each! As I said above I generally use these when I travel or when I am feeling a bit on the lazy side in the morning! My hair is dry and tangles easily so I can use only some of these without conditioner! You may very well be able to get away with using the puck alone but I can’t with most of them. I’d recommend a good condition afterwards! Lush also offers solid conditioners (I recommend trying Jungle) to compliment it’s solid shampoo bars so that’s something you might like to try as well! Sadly Lush has discounted a few of my favorite shampoo bars such as Doctor Peppermint! But they have since replaced it with another of my favorites which is called New! New! smells like red hot candies and feels quite refreshing and tingly when lathering up my hair! I actually use it once a week as a clarifying shampoo to cleanse my hair! It clarifies really well, maybe too well as it does seem to dry my hair out a bit more than I’d like! But it does a great job of making my hair shiny clean! New! Shampoo Bar Godiva is a very popular shampoo bar and ends up on the bestseller list quite alot! It’s not not my favorite but I do like it! I can easily use it as a multitasking shampoo bar and don’t need conditioner very much afterwards as the bar is loaded with chunks of cocoa butter which my hair seems to really like thus causing it to behave and remain tangle free! Godiva has the strong scent of jasmines and after one use I guarantee your hair will smell delightfully floral all day long! Godiva Shampoo Bar Lush offers two distinct shampoo bars which are used according to your water! If you’re in an area where your water is soft they present the Soft Shampoo bar and if you live in an area where the water is hard they offer the Hard Shampoo bar. I personally do not like either! They tangle my hair up badly, aren’t the best smelling, and dry my locks out to a straw like texture! These you can pass up in my humble opinion! If you by some chance live in the UK or are traveling there you may want to pick up a Hard Shampoo bar because in cases of harsh water as England’s this works a treat even though I’m not a huge fan of it! Soft Shampoo Bar Hard Shampoo Bar Karma Komba a Shampoo Bar that is most loathed for this girl! To my nose this smells like oranges and dirt! Yes, oranges and dirt. You heard me right. Patchouli is a very hardcore note in this Shampoo Bar so if you enjoy a deep green, herbal scent this be for you! As for me I can’t stand it! Karma Komba Soak and Float is a bar for problem scalps! If you suffer from dandruff or oily locks this be the bar for you! The scent is quite overpowering and just terrible. I’ve never actually used this on my hair as I suffer from neither dandruff or oily bits but from what I’ve heard it’s a miracle cure all for a troubled scalp! I guess if you can get pass the scent you’ll be on squeaky clean scalp street with this bar! Soak and Float Shampoo Bar Seanick is the type of bar that will give your hair that just out of the ocean look! I’m serious, tis true! If you like the way windblown, full hair looks this be the bar for you! Seanick gives great volume and bounce and it simply makes your hair shine! It has quite a nice scent, like fresh ocean air! This is an overall lovely Shampoo bar that comes with a healthy recommendation! Seanick Now Hybrid is a friend of the Muse’s hair! When my hair begins to grow down my back once again (I cut it, shoulder length, not so long ago) this is the bar I reach for! If you have long hair you realize how much weight that is and how it feels so heavy on your back and product just seems to stay “glued” in it! Hybrid makes your long locks feel airy and light, it clarifies and cleans too! It has a strong smell of black licorice that’s quite appealing to my little nose! And best of all I don’t have to worry overmuch about conditioning afterwards because my hair behaves very well after a lather up with Hybrid! Hybrid Shampoo Bar The Ultimate Shine promises shine, bounce and condition. It does none of the above. It smells quite strong of Ylang Ylang which makes my nose wrinkle up in dismay! It tangles my hair awfully and causes generally havoc with my locks! This one I’d avoid at all costs! Ultimate Shine Shampoo bar Remember prior to putting your puck in your tin, dry it out fully otherwise you’ll end up with a mushy shampoo bar when next you use it! Shampoo Tin These are great little multitasking tools when traveling abroad or just for those really quick Monday morning showers! The Muse likes to simplify life sometimes and these shampoo bars help that along! And if you happen to be a guy these might just be an offering from the Gods (Think we didn’t know you’ve been washing your hair with a bar of soap? We girls know everything! Now you can use a bar of soap to wash your hair and guilt free too!) Some of my Shampoo Bars The Weekend Beauty Shopper Steals and Deals!

Shu Uemura Edo Komon Fall 2007 Collection By Isabella Muse on August 10, 2007 4 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , Shu Uemura The Edo Komon collection is now available on Shu Uemura’s website. Another ho-hum collection that I probably won’t bother any time with! I adore Shu but I can’t get excited about navy blue eyeshadow. Sorry Shu the wallet is remaining in the pocket this time around! Is it me or do none of these colors work together? And by the very way the model on the left hand side is wearing a lovely cranberry color…where is that being offered? Did I miss something? And where’s the makeup video? Is everyone out to disappoint me this Fall Season or am I total grouch ? Sigh. Sephora Fall Catalog 2007 By Isabella Muse on August 9, 2007 7 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , Sephora It’s here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sephora’s Catalog should be winging it’s way into your mailbox shortly but if you can’t wait you can hop on over to Sephora’s website and see the catalog in all it’s glory from first to last page! Are you excited or what? Don’t be. Sorry don’t mean to burst your bubble there! It appears this year’s catalog blows! This is my “I’m not excited” at all attitude. Sheesh you know the world may very well be coming to an end if I’m not squealing at the prospect of a new Sephora catalog! Best look outside your window and make sure hell hasn’t frozen over or large drops of fiery rain are falling from the skies! Ok..so maybe I’m being dramatic but geez the catalog just stinks! I don’t see much of anything that I can remotely get my panties twisted in a bunch over aside from items I have previously mentioned in my blog! Thanks alot Sephora it’s almost as if it’s Christmas morning minus the presents! Wasn’t it enough to disappoint me with the Summer Catalog ? You had to go and ruin the Fall Catalog for me too? It’s not fair I tell you! God I’m already in a state of panic about the possibility of the Winter Catalog sucking too! That’d make an entire year of shitty catalogs! That’s wrong on so many levels! Sigh…. I’m going to bed utterly depressed and devastated tonight! Touches of Fall By Isabella Muse on August 9, 2007 6 Comments in Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab , Fall Collections 2007 , Fragrance , Online Shopping As I sit here and type this I can hear the crickets outside my bedroom window. This can sadly mean one thing, Summer is soon coming to an end. I always get kinda melancholy when the season changes and a new one begins. It’s almost as if I am saying goodbye to friend that I won’t see for an entire year! The good news is that soon the weather will get cooler, the leaves will start to fall from the trees, and the nights will become longer. All this adds up to the upcoming holiday that I may very much like more than Christmas. Some of you may guess what Holiday I am speaking of but some of you may well not be familiar with it in your part of the world. Halloween ? Halloween holds a spot near and dear to my heart not only because it’s my birthday but because it’s just a generally awesome Holiday! I love everything about it! Candy, costumes, nutty (like me) caramel apples, kids….! I think one of the best things about Halloween is when the beauty industry takes a step into it and store shelves not only line up with candy and decorations but Halloween themed bath goodies, perfumes, and an assortment of bits that any girl will love! I’m particularly partial to heading into Bath and Body Works when they start loading their shelves with body lotions, shower gels, and body sprays in an array of funky Halloween blends like Spicy Pumpkin, Apple, etc….! I’m quite curious what they’ll be introducing in the Temptations line for Halloween/Fall! Many smaller shops online take part in the festivities of Halloween and theme many products for the Holiday! One particular shop that I know and love dedicates an entire line of perfume oil to the Halloween holiday! Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab or BPAL to it’s diseased, addicted fans (Hey I can call them diseased because I’m one of the club with a gold membership card!) releases anywhere from 10 to 15 limited edition perfume oils every year for Halloween! This is truly an eagerly anticipated event for fans everywhere! If you aren’t familiar with the Lab let me give you a very brief introduction to it. The Lab started out as a very small operation that sprung up into a pretty huge full time online shop! It’s immensely popular and has an order wait time of 20-45 days!!!!!!!!!!! They sell 5ML bottles of highly concentrated perfume oil in a variety of scents. Perfume Oil is very potent and strong, a dab will last all day and into the evening too! 5ML seems small but it will last you a long time since you’ll be applying so sparely. The Lab, sadly, isn’t particularly a great place for people like me. Reason being is because they lack fruity, food, and sweet blends. A majority of the catalog are earthy, herbal, dark blends which I can’t stand. These have a huge cult following and many girls absolutely love them. Personally they aren’t for me. The good news is that if you dig deep enough you’ll find quite a few gems in the catalog! They release limited edition scents quite often and with every new moon they release a fragrance dedicated to that particular moon! I find that the limited edition scents are where the real treasures lay! They do Halloweenies during the Fall and Yule blends during the winter and Christmas Holiday! They also have themes for Valentine’s Day but those are normally too dark for me! They even went so far as to release some very silly Paris Hilton in Jail themed oils! Now if you are weary and just want to try they offer what they call “imps” of catalog blends. Imps are tiny vials of oil for you to test and see if you’d love a larger bottle! 6 are $19.50 plus shipping! They also include imps with any full size bottle purchase as an extra little gift for purchasing! Well that’s a bit of background info on the lab…. Mostly I’m excited because shortly towards the middle or end of the month (Depending on Beth’s, the owner, schedule) the Halloweenies will pop up and be available for purchase! Each year I really get excited to see which blends will make a come back from the year before and which new blends will be available! If you LOVE Halloween as much as I do you’re in for a real treat if you do decide to order from the Lab! The past few years I’ve collected many a fantastic perfume oil! Spicy Pumpkin, Candy scents, and so many other interesting bits and bobs have popped up! I’m especially a huge fan of the Pumpkin Patch oils which are released in a set of 5 and consist of 5 different blends of pumpkin mixed with different notes such as cocoa, pomegranate, and more! These are actually a good investment. Sounds weird doesn’t it? Perfume Oil an investment. But actually they are. Bottles have ranged, over the course of a few years, from $14 to $17.50 and $20-22 for Limited Edition. Now if you hang onto a particular blend long enough you can fetch triple or more your money back! Not that I’d sell ANY of my rare blends EVER but it’s an interesting little fact of information to share! I’ve seen bottles of Pumpkin King go for $300 on E-bay! I’ve also seen many bottles from the Carnival Series go for $90-$120! I’ve even heard rumors of unreleased blends going for $500!!!!!!! Occasionally with the Limited Edition blends the Lab’s Trading Post shop will release special oils that are a bit more costly! Last year they released 4 blends entitled Trick or Treat. It consisted of 4 oils, 2 Trick and 2 Treat. In order to get the oils you had to plea your case of which you wanted and why! It was all in good fun and made your purchase interesting and fun ? I got all 4 of the bottles! They cost $50 each and came with a cute little T-Shirt! The oils are well up in price now on E-bay but I refuse to part with them ? Soon the new blends will be released and again the yearning for a new scent will fall upon me and others like me! If you’ve never purchased from the Lab before now is a good time as any to start checking it out and see which Halloween blends will pop up that you might be interested in! If you need any help deciding on a particular scent do let me know as I’ve tried plenty!!!! Happy Shopping! I leave you with some pictures from my collection! Trick or Treat Oil Blends from Halloween 2006 Pumpkin Patch Oil Blends from Halloween 2005 A few of the Halloweenies from Halloween 2006 A few Halloweenies from Halloween 2005 (As you can Sugar Skull is in both this picture and the one above! Sometimes oils get a reprieve and make a reappearance from year to year! I always buy the reruns because the blend is sometimes slightly different from the year before and it’s delightful to pick apart how they differ from year to year!)']",273603ea91ea5b81d8bfd2cc9952dc7577c867f8,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4291,

"['MAC SugarSweet FOTD By Isabella Muse on March 19, 2009 Leave a Comment in Face of the Day , MAC The Muse is getting excited to get to MAC today for a good day of hauling some of the MAC SugarSweet Collection. It’s all looking rather tempting doesn’t it? To celebrate I decided to use some of the items I already have from the collection paired up with a few items already in my beauty vault! Jump ahead for a peek at my SugarSweet FOTD! I really love MAC eye shadow in Aquavert so I was happy to see it brought back. I honestly have plenty to last me so I won’t be indulging in another but it’s nice to see it brought back to life with the SugarSweet Collection. This morning I used Aquavert on my eyes and added some Kryolan Metallic Mint Green Eye Dust on top. I used the MAC Shadestick in Lemon Chiffon as a base and a highlighter for my brow bone. On my lips I have a light application of MAC Lipstick in Lollipop Loving with a clear gloss on top. Lollipop Loving was released prior with Heatherette so I already had it in my collection. Lollipop Loving is a great shade but I find I have to do a light application with it otherwise it makes my full face look even fuller eep! It’s a frosty pearl nude finish that just isn’t as flattering on me as I’d like but a nice light layer with clear gloss works well. To complete the look I used the new MAC MSF in Refined as a blush and a highlighter. It’s pigmented enough to give my cheeks a burst of peach! Refined isn’t as glittery as many MSF’s I already have but the flash from my camera makes it look like shimmer overload so no worries it is quite a nice satin finish without chunky glitter. I was going to do a Dear Cupcake look but I decided I was loving all the green so I went with that plus I thought that Refined would look better with a pop of green.

"['Lorac Starry-Eyed Baked Eyeshadow By Isabella Muse on August 16, 2007 2 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , Lorac , Wish List Hmmmmmmm now here’s something I can finally get excited about this Fall! Lorac has three new baked eyeshadow that promises I’ll shine like a super star if I buy them (I don’t really need these as I already am quite a star as is! I’m joking! I’m joking! No one throw any tomatoes please!). The three colors are Evening Star (a blue trio), Rising Star (a green trio), and Shining Star (a bronze trio). These are all limited edition and $24 each! Bit pricey for a trio but if they are contain as much sparkle and shimmer as they promise it’ll be worth it! They are on my wish list ! Stashes and Storage By Isabella Muse on August 15, 2007 3 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Storage PJ from A Touch of Blusher sent me this fantastic link ! I adore seeing how other people store products and just generally like to see what they have in their stashes! Dunno if this makes me nosy or curious! This blog has some great pictures of vanities, stashes, and storage! When I view other girls stashes (why does that somehow sound perverted?!) I feel less lonely in my cosmetic ocean (without a life vest)! Lavshuca Color Conc Rouge Review By Isabella Muse on August 15, 2007 7 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , Japanese Brands , Lavshuca Lavshuca introduced several colors of it’s newest gloss, Color Conc Rogue , for it’s Fall 2007 Collection (I googled pictures of the newest collection but all I get are some weird model advertising Lavshuca who is this girl and where’s Puffy damnit!) I purchased four of the ten colors. When I first got wind of these I was over the moon because hey I love gloss! Gloss is good. Gloss is nice. Gloss makes me (and my lips) happy! Um..ya..anyway….At the time I was seriously going to go ahead and purchase all ten of the colors because we established already I’m that kinda diseased about cosmetics ? I’m glad I went with four because I have to give Color Conc Rouge a bit of a bad review! Sad sighs all around! I’ve tried to love this, I’ve tried to even like it. I’ve used two of the four colors so far and they just don’t do anything for me! It’s sadly lacking any “wow”! The general idea of the gloss is it’s supposed to act as a lipstick and a gloss all in one but that sadly doesn’t really work. The texture is like any gloss you might have about. It’s pretty thick, pretty slick but it doesn’t glide. The glide is non existent (if you know gloss you know what I mean). I’m trying to firgure out exactly why it has no glide, I’m not entirely sure if it’s the actual gloss or the applicator! The applicator is just a hard plastic piece with no sponge at the end so you are basically trying to apply gloss using the end of a tiny, hard piece of plastic! The gloss it self feels ok on, not tacky and not too sticky but just about right. However, it has no lasting power. Application may last you 30 minutes if you’re lucky! Again, as almost all Japanese brands, it’s unflavored! Overall it’s just sadly lacking! On the plus side the packaging is adorable which is cause for some excitement but the actual product inside leaves much to be desired! The colors are quite gorgeous but what’s color if it doesn’t apply correctly. Lavshuca has some hit or miss products and this is sadly a miss for me! Of course I’m happy to have these in my collection but I can only offer it an ok rating. Save your pennies, buy something else! BR1, RD2, RD1, and PK1 The Illusion of Hollywood, A Non Cosmetic Blog By Isabella Muse on August 14, 2007 5 Comments in Miscellaneous Blogging There is, in my humblest, lowly opinion, such a thing, as taking too many liberties. This be a perfect example: Your thoughts? Perhaps I’m too much of a purist to give this it’s proper dues (Am I the only one that finds it deeply disturbing they choose an American actress to portray Jane freaking Austen!

Appeasing Your Hunger for Japanese Cosmetics Part 1: An Introduction By Isabella Muse on August 14, 2007 7 Comments in Japanese Brands , Online Shopping ‘ello girlies (and guys)! I had quite a few questions in regards to “OH MY GOD WHERE CAN I GET JAPANESE COSMETICS!!!!!!!?” The Muse has some gorgeous friends in her life that do her shopping for her! Without these lovely people in her life she’d be quite remiss of Japanese goodies in her train case! My god the HORROR! *insert scared, terrified looking face here* Sometimes busy schedules also means that they are unable to get me my little bits and ship them over ? (I say “little bits” so it makes me appear less obsessed than I actually I am teehee!) When these horrible things occur the Muse must search, search, search for alternative ways of locating her Japanese crack…errr…I mean Japanese cosmetics! Our very own, gorgeous Fleck has some great hints, tips, and general tricks for obtaining what she wants! She’s passed some great ideas off to the Muse about where to locate good cosmetics to satisfy her lemmings! Do visit her reviews on MUA ! They are my bible when purchasing! The Muse also has her own toolbox of locating interesting little bits and pieces to appease the insatiable hunger for Japanese cosmetics! Finding decently priced Japanese cosmetics is a difficult job my friends but with a little hard work you can find somewhat good priced deals here and there ? This will entry will be in several parts which will also include a video blog to go along with it! I hope it helps satisfy your lemmings for great cosmetics!']",0b126f103327b611b8fc5d5f11868c4ee45881c5,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4289,

Halloween Arrives Early at Cherriflip By Isabella Muse on August 12, 2007 4 Comments in Online Shopping , Shower & Bath Cherriflip has sent out it’s monthly newsletter with it’s new Halloween goodies and the Muse is getting quite a case of the excited wriggles! The goodies available for Halloween are 4 new bubble bars and 7 new gorgeous scents that you can have in any number of bath goodies, shower gels, perfumes, etc..! One of the bubble bars entitled Blue Meanie is cute and sweet but it’s also a contest! One of the bars was made wth orange eyes and if you happen to get that bubble bar in your order (these are randomly selected) you could win your entire purchase free of charge! Yay how exciting! Some of the new Halloween Themed Bubble Bars: If you are unfamiliar with bubble bars I’ll explain ? Bubble Bars are a solid form of bubble bath! You take these very cute bars and crumble them under warm running water while your bath fills! Swish your hand around a bit and you get masses of lovely bubbles in your tub! Not only do they smell amazing but they moisturize wonderfully! The New Halloween Scent List: Screaming Banshee: You will be screaming with delight with this divine salty yet sweet caramel ice cream scent. Hints of soft toasted peanuts, rich vanilla, and sugary sweet caramel ice cream make this the ultimate decadent sweet treat. Spooky Juice: Bright and crisp concoction of fresh guava, airy cucumber and soft pear. Spooky juice is a refreshing light treat. Dark Enchantment: A bewitching sophisticated blend of deep black amber and vanilla bean blended with lavender. Dark enchantment is a deliciously addictive scent. Voodoo Doll: Wickedly wild and refreshing wasabi sniff. Walk on the wild side with a little wasabi voodoo! Taboo: warm caramel cream with just a touch of cocoa and vanilla meringue, and a hint of praline essence BOOkies: Sweet caramel pumpkin cream essence infused in a warm cookie crumble base. The Vanishing: A delicious banana blended with ripe, fresh fruit mallow cream. Fresh banana slowly vanishes to reveal light berries, citrus and marshmallow cream. This is one disappearing act you don’t want to miss. The Muse would love to place an order but first she must firgure out the riddle that Cherriflip has teasingly put in their newsletter: My life can be measured in hours, I serve by being devoured. Thin, I am quick Fat, I am slow Wind is my foe. What am I? If I can firgure it out I’ll receive an extra 15% off my entire order! Any ideas? I’m stuck ? If you do happen to firgure out the one word answer you can use that word in the coupon box to get the discount off your order! Cherriflip is one of my favorite online shops for not only wonderful Bath Goodies and Bodycare but cosmetics as well! Do check out the entire Halloween line up! Happy Haunting..err..I mean Shopping!

This little gem is on my Wish List! I shall scour every nook and cranny of this city till I find it and make it mine! Sometimes the lemming comes on me hard teehee! Want it? Need it? Have to have it? Meh, I’ll pass? Tell me ? My ears are open! Shopping Discoves on Etsy By Isabella Muse on August 12, 2007 Leave a Comment in Etsy Musings , Fashion , Online Shopping , Shower & Bath I think, by now, we have established I LOVE shopping! Now I’m not saying that I love it…I LOVE IT….get me? Sometimes, a girl such as myself, can get a bit bored with items that stores have. I get a bit burned out seeing the same type of product offered over and over and over in a different format, color, or package. I love being wow’ed by the next best thing but on a occasion sometimes the wow factor goes out of shopping! In order to get my daily dose of wow I head over to Etsy to discover new, interesting, unique and generally awesome little goodies that are handmade by masses of different people! Etsy reminds me of a little market places where tons of friendly people are peddling their wares! The only difference between Etsy and a real market place is this is my computer and I don’t actually get a chance to meet with the talented artists that pawn their goods on Etsy ! I admire and respect many of the artists on Etsy and adore giving them business! I think it takes a special kind of person to create so many interesting items! I call them artists because truly that’s what it boils down too! These people put heart and soul into all their creations! The best thing is you’ll shop, purchase, and end up owning something that’s truly a one of a kind item! What more could a girl want? Some Etsy Shops that the Muse frequents and recommends: Mad City Sue Soaps Plenty of wonderful bits and bobs to keep you happy in the shower and out! Handmade soaps, body scrubs, customized mists and more! I strongly recommend the Italian Cream Cake Foaming Shower Parfait but please try to avoid digging into it with a spoon! After all it is for your body! Whimsy Hollow When the Muse wants to a little sparkle, shimmer, and glitter she looks no further than Whimsy Hollow where she can purchase Faerie Glimmer Dust! This gorgeous shimmer comes in a whimsical little jar with the cutest little powder puff. Use it on your eyes, shoulders, body, anywhere you’d love a little sparkle and a bit of honeysuckle fragrance makes it extra special! Whimsy Hollow offers other fine little bits and bobs for sale so check the shop out and see what catches your fancy! Sobe Botanicals The Muse loves lip glosses and balms! When she grows a bit tired of her normal stash she heads over to Sobe Botanicals to purchase some of their custom made lip glosses! Sobe allows you to choose the color and the flavor of your balm! It goes on smooth, gives your lips a tiny touch of color, tastes yum, and is cheap as a day old chips! Perfect for those days you don’t want to be too made up! Sobe has other wonderful little makeup minerals and such for sale as well! Baba Studios The Muse sometimes likes to step off the well used path onto a new one! When she does she visits Baba Studios to purchase some of their highly sought after bags! She uses them for a variety of storages purposes and sometimes even when she’s out and about! They always cause quite a stir among the vintage lovers in her life and are quite the conversation piece! For a few dollars you too can own a very interesting piece of art work to hang around your wrist or just to hold your tiny treasures in! GraceEsjavacreations The Muse absolutely adores spoiling her family and friends! She loves buying them pressies even when their isn’t a holiday or a birthday to celebrate! When she wants to add a special little something to a package for a friend or a family member she enjoys tagging it with one of the Victorian tags she can purchase from GraceEsjavacreations! It gives her gifts that special little touch! BamaBelle Vintage Boutique I can’t think of a single thing that the Muse’s likes more than vintage clothing! Oh yes wait I can think of something! Vintage clothing without the hassle of shopping for it yourself! Bamabelle scours the Vintage scene for all the greatest finds you could possibly imagine and all you do is sit back and relax while browsing through an extensive list of her finds! Gosh vintage shopping doesn’t get any easier does it? Note: the Muse loves when Bamabelle locates interesting cute camis and lists them for mere pennies for which she’d paid here in Manhattan! Louise Black Designs The Muse is never averse to adding a little goth into her life! She admires all the FRUiTS, Lolitas, and general Harajuku girl styles! When you want a little darkness in your life you can visit Louise Black Designs for an array of wonderful gothic clothings! Gorgeous corsets, blouses, and wonderful vintage pieces will line your closet after shopping here! She’s pretty new but she’s a favorite for me already! Her corsets are absolutely drop dead gorgeous! I’ve purchased two already! glamourbunny Corsets The Muse has a lot of wobbly bits that need to be tucked out of the way! When she wants them tucked away and seeks to look glamorous she heads over to the glamourbunny’s closet to purchase corsets and belts and an array of gorgeous handmade clothing! The Muse recommends the Taffeta bow belt for $25! It’s the must have Fall fashion accessory in her humble opinion! Boudoir Queen The Muse loves a little flare! When she seeks something with flare she wanders over to Boudoir Queen to purchase it! The Boudoir Doll purses are quite a favorite here! Note: If you’re a lucky petite size you’ll be happy to shop her Living Doll Collection which features some of thee most amazing fashion finds I ever did lay my eyes on! You can pair some of her corsets with a simple pair of jeans for a really amazing look! As you can see Etsy offers a wide array of wonderful, unusual, unique, and amazing finds! These are just a mere handful of my favorite shops! Head on over, sign up, and begin searching, finding, and adding to your favorite shops! It’s always nice to have a special piece in your closet, shower, or train case that no one else has! Just don’t tell them where you purchased it! A girl has to have some secrets right? Already an Etsy Member? Tell me your favorite shops!']",2c3e79f80db791f68fc55a841466e0abc6f95441,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4290,
"['Touches of Fall By Isabella Muse on August 9, 2007 6 Comments in Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab , Fall Collections 2007 , Fragrance , Online Shopping As I sit here and type this I can hear the crickets outside my bedroom window. This can sadly mean one thing, Summer is soon coming to an end. I always get kinda melancholy when the season changes and a new one begins. It’s almost as if I am saying goodbye to friend that I won’t see for an entire year! The good news is that soon the weather will get cooler, the leaves will start to fall from the trees, and the nights will become longer. All this adds up to the upcoming holiday that I may very much like more than Christmas. Some of you may guess what Holiday I am speaking of but some of you may well not be familiar with it in your part of the world. Halloween ? Halloween holds a spot near and dear to my heart not only because it’s my birthday but because it’s just a generally awesome Holiday! I love everything about it! Candy, costumes, nutty (like me) caramel apples, kids….! I think one of the best things about Halloween is when the beauty industry takes a step into it and store shelves not only line up with candy and decorations but Halloween themed bath goodies, perfumes, and an assortment of bits that any girl will love! I’m particularly partial to heading into Bath and Body Works when they start loading their shelves with body lotions, shower gels, and body sprays in an array of funky Halloween blends like Spicy Pumpkin, Apple, etc….! I’m quite curious what they’ll be introducing in the Temptations line for Halloween/Fall! Many smaller shops online take part in the festivities of Halloween and theme many products for the Holiday! One particular shop that I know and love dedicates an entire line of perfume oil to the Halloween holiday! Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab or BPAL to it’s diseased, addicted fans (Hey I can call them diseased because I’m one of the club with a gold membership card!) releases anywhere from 10 to 15 limited edition perfume oils every year for Halloween! This is truly an eagerly anticipated event for fans everywhere! If you aren’t familiar with the Lab let me give you a very brief introduction to it. The Lab started out as a very small operation that sprung up into a pretty huge full time online shop! It’s immensely popular and has an order wait time of 20-45 days!!!!!!!!!!! They sell 5ML bottles of highly concentrated perfume oil in a variety of scents. Perfume Oil is very potent and strong, a dab will last all day and into the evening too! 5ML seems small but it will last you a long time since you’ll be applying so sparely. The Lab, sadly, isn’t particularly a great place for people like me. Reason being is because they lack fruity, food, and sweet blends. A majority of the catalog are earthy, herbal, dark blends which I can’t stand. These have a huge cult following and many girls absolutely love them. Personally they aren’t for me. The good news is that if you dig deep enough you’ll find quite a few gems in the catalog! They release limited edition scents quite often and with every new moon they release a fragrance dedicated to that particular moon! I find that the limited edition scents are where the real treasures lay! They do Halloweenies during the Fall and Yule blends during the winter and Christmas Holiday! They also have themes for Valentine’s Day but those are normally too dark for me! They even went so far as to release some very silly Paris Hilton in Jail themed oils! Now if you are weary and just want to try they offer what they call “imps” of catalog blends. Imps are tiny vials of oil for you to test and see if you’d love a larger bottle! 6 are $19.50 plus shipping! They also include imps with any full size bottle purchase as an extra little gift for purchasing! Well that’s a bit of background info on the lab…. Mostly I’m excited because shortly towards the middle or end of the month (Depending on Beth’s, the owner, schedule) the Halloweenies will pop up and be available for purchase! Each year I really get excited to see which blends will make a come back from the year before and which new blends will be available! If you LOVE Halloween as much as I do you’re in for a real treat if you do decide to order from the Lab! The past few years I’ve collected many a fantastic perfume oil! Spicy Pumpkin, Candy scents, and so many other interesting bits and bobs have popped up! I’m especially a huge fan of the Pumpkin Patch oils which are released in a set of 5 and consist of 5 different blends of pumpkin mixed with different notes such as cocoa, pomegranate, and more! These are actually a good investment. Sounds weird doesn’t it? Perfume Oil an investment. But actually they are. Bottles have ranged, over the course of a few years, from $14 to $17.50 and $20-22 for Limited Edition. Now if you hang onto a particular blend long enough you can fetch triple or more your money back! Not that I’d sell ANY of my rare blends EVER but it’s an interesting little fact of information to share! I’ve seen bottles of Pumpkin King go for $300 on E-bay! I’ve also seen many bottles from the Carnival Series go for $90-$120! I’ve even heard rumors of unreleased blends going for $500!!!!!!! Occasionally with the Limited Edition blends the Lab’s Trading Post shop will release special oils that are a bit more costly! Last year they released 4 blends entitled Trick or Treat. It consisted of 4 oils, 2 Trick and 2 Treat. In order to get the oils you had to plea your case of which you wanted and why! It was all in good fun and made your purchase interesting and fun ? I got all 4 of the bottles! They cost $50 each and came with a cute little T-Shirt! The oils are well up in price now on E-bay but I refuse to part with them ? Soon the new blends will be released and again the yearning for a new scent will fall upon me and others like me! If you’ve never purchased from the Lab before now is a good time as any to start checking it out and see which Halloween blends will pop up that you might be interested in! If you need any help deciding on a particular scent do let me know as I’ve tried plenty!!!! Happy Shopping! I leave you with some pictures from my collection! Trick or Treat Oil Blends from Halloween 2006 Pumpkin Patch Oil Blends from Halloween 2005 A few of the Halloweenies from Halloween 2006 A few Halloweenies from Halloween 2005 (As you can Sugar Skull is in both this picture and the one above! Sometimes oils get a reprieve and make a reappearance from year to year! I always buy the reruns because the blend is sometimes slightly different from the year before and it’s delightful to pick apart how they differ from year to year!) You may also enjoy...

"['Simplifying Your Haircare By Isabella Muse on August 12, 2007 9 Comments in Haircare , Lush , Shower & Bath Are you not a morning person? Do you find general haircare a pain in the neck? Do you seek to simplify something as mundane as shampooing your hair? Do you travel alot? If you answered yes to any of the questions above than I have quite a simple solution for you! Look no further your wish is my command! A shampoo puck. Yes, yes I am already hearing you say to yourself, “What’s she on about now?” Well..occasionally…the Muse is a bit lazy in the morning or just wants to keep things a bit on the simple side so she uses a nifty little shampoo puck to get her locks cleansed, shining, and happy in the shower! Lush Cosmetics offers several kinds of these multitasking demons! I generally use shampoo pucks when I’m being a bit lazy but they are also quite a nice little bit to have when you are traveling! Reason being with airline security being so tight these are a simple little treat to stow in your train case without the drama of large bottles! They also double as a bar of soap! Wash your hair and your body with one puck! Cool eh? You’re probably curious how these work aren’t you? Easy as pie! Wet your hair, swipe the bar across your head a few times, lather, rinse, repeat, and smile! Simple as 1-2-3! Not only are these easy to use and easy to travel with but they last for ages! If you’re currently being frugal with your money and don’t want to shell out for expensive shampoos this is a good way to go! One puck will last as long as 3-4 months! If you aren’t happy enough at the idea of a cute little shampoo puck you will be at the fact that they have cute little tins to hold ’em in too! Excited yet? I knew you would be! And since Lush likes it’s customers so much, if you buy two bars you’ll get a free tin! Yay! At the moment their are 9 different bars to choose from! I’ve tried most of them so I can give you a brief review of each! As I said above I generally use these when I travel or when I am feeling a bit on the lazy side in the morning! My hair is dry and tangles easily so I can use only some of these without conditioner! You may very well be able to get away with using the puck alone but I can’t with most of them. I’d recommend a good condition afterwards! Lush also offers solid conditioners (I recommend trying Jungle) to compliment it’s solid shampoo bars so that’s something you might like to try as well! Sadly Lush has discounted a few of my favorite shampoo bars such as Doctor Peppermint! But they have since replaced it with another of my favorites which is called New! New! smells like red hot candies and feels quite refreshing and tingly when lathering up my hair! I actually use it once a week as a clarifying shampoo to cleanse my hair! It clarifies really well, maybe too well as it does seem to dry my hair out a bit more than I’d like! But it does a great job of making my hair shiny clean! New! Shampoo Bar Godiva is a very popular shampoo bar and ends up on the bestseller list quite alot! It’s not not my favorite but I do like it! I can easily use it as a multitasking shampoo bar and don’t need conditioner very much afterwards as the bar is loaded with chunks of cocoa butter which my hair seems to really like thus causing it to behave and remain tangle free! Godiva has the strong scent of jasmines and after one use I guarantee your hair will smell delightfully floral all day long! Godiva Shampoo Bar Lush offers two distinct shampoo bars which are used according to your water! If you’re in an area where your water is soft they present the Soft Shampoo bar and if you live in an area where the water is hard they offer the Hard Shampoo bar. I personally do not like either! They tangle my hair up badly, aren’t the best smelling, and dry my locks out to a straw like texture! These you can pass up in my humble opinion! If you by some chance live in the UK or are traveling there you may want to pick up a Hard Shampoo bar because in cases of harsh water as England’s this works a treat even though I’m not a huge fan of it! Soft Shampoo Bar Hard Shampoo Bar Karma Komba a Shampoo Bar that is most loathed for this girl! To my nose this smells like oranges and dirt! Yes, oranges and dirt. You heard me right. Patchouli is a very hardcore note in this Shampoo Bar so if you enjoy a deep green, herbal scent this be for you! As for me I can’t stand it! Karma Komba Soak and Float is a bar for problem scalps! If you suffer from dandruff or oily locks this be the bar for you! The scent is quite overpowering and just terrible. I’ve never actually used this on my hair as I suffer from neither dandruff or oily bits but from what I’ve heard it’s a miracle cure all for a troubled scalp! I guess if you can get pass the scent you’ll be on squeaky clean scalp street with this bar! Soak and Float Shampoo Bar Seanick is the type of bar that will give your hair that just out of the ocean look! I’m serious, tis true! If you like the way windblown, full hair looks this be the bar for you! Seanick gives great volume and bounce and it simply makes your hair shine! It has quite a nice scent, like fresh ocean air! This is an overall lovely Shampoo bar that comes with a healthy recommendation! Seanick Now Hybrid is a friend of the Muse’s hair! When my hair begins to grow down my back once again (I cut it, shoulder length, not so long ago) this is the bar I reach for! If you have long hair you realize how much weight that is and how it feels so heavy on your back and product just seems to stay “glued” in it! Hybrid makes your long locks feel airy and light, it clarifies and cleans too! It has a strong smell of black licorice that’s quite appealing to my little nose! And best of all I don’t have to worry overmuch about conditioning afterwards because my hair behaves very well after a lather up with Hybrid! Hybrid Shampoo Bar The Ultimate Shine promises shine, bounce and condition. It does none of the above. It smells quite strong of Ylang Ylang which makes my nose wrinkle up in dismay! It tangles my hair awfully and causes generally havoc with my locks! This one I’d avoid at all costs! Ultimate Shine Shampoo bar Remember prior to putting your puck in your tin, dry it out fully otherwise you’ll end up with a mushy shampoo bar when next you use it! Shampoo Tin These are great little multitasking tools when traveling abroad or just for those really quick Monday morning showers! The Muse likes to simplify life sometimes and these shampoo bars help that along! And if you happen to be a guy these might just be an offering from the Gods (Think we didn’t know you’ve been washing your hair with a bar of soap? We girls know everything! Now you can use a bar of soap to wash your hair and guilt free too!) Some of my Shampoo Bars You may also enjoy...

"['Fall Collections 2008: Urban Decay Matte Eye Shadow in Electric By Isabella Muse on August 4, 2008 5 Comments in Face of the Day , Fall Collections 2008 , Urban Decay I’m not going to lie and say I wasn’t disappointed when I heard about Urban Decay’s Fall Collection. They are introducing some seriously ridiculously, gorgeous lippies this season which are outrageous and the Muse is busy, busy, busy testing away however I was crestfallen when I realized the eye shadow selections for Fall are all new matte colors. Le sigh. The Muse is sad. I heart the general catalog eye shadows that made Urban Decay an absolute cult favorite! Shimmer, Sparkle, Shine, and Glitter! So Muse-like! I remember when Urban Decay introduced the matte shadows and how many sighs of utter relief soon followed. I just don’t happen to be part of the population that loves mattes so no sighing here! Sorry. I may be an itty bitty bit brokenhearted but Urban Decay definately made it up to me by introducing a new gorgeous, vibrant, popping aqua shade! The Muse is all over aqua! Psstt….don’t worry we still have the Winter Collection to look forward too! This Fall Urban Decay has extended the matte line of shadows with three new shades: Shakedown Taupe Brown Heist Mauve And my favorite…. Electric POPPING Aqua! Can you spell lust? The Muse is lusting this shadow! Even though it’s matte I’m still loving the fact that I can apply some and dose myself with some heavy duty sparkle and shimmer right on top to make my eyes literally pop out of my head! Loves it! Since I’ve never reviewed the matte shadows prior to this I’ll give you a brief low down. They are extremely pigmented, wonderfully silky and easy to blend, and really bold and vibrant (did you expect anything else from Urban Decay?). Urban Decay Matte Eye Shadow in Electric has “the Muse” written all over it baby! I did a rather outrageous aqua look with it this weekend and applied a ridiculously amount of MAC pigment in Mutiny right on top! Pure perfection! I’m loving this one and I’m slapping the Muse Approval on it for purchase! Run to Urban Decay and Sephora to grab yourself a pot!

"[""Secret Scent Expressions By Isabella Muse on August 19, 2007 1 Comment in Recommendations I guess I shouldn’t really get all that excited at the prospect of deodorant but I find I can’t help myself with the new Scent Expressions from Secret! Yup, we all get up in the morning, take our little showers, do our hair and makeup, brush out teeth, and most importantly apply our deodorant! Not much to get excited about in the deo department is there? Nay I say! Get excited! Secret’s created 14 little gems of deodorant in an array of super awesome scents that I’m really loving at the moment and can’t help but recommend! Not only do I stay dry but also sweet smelling all day long! Wahoo! You seriously can’t not get excited about scents like Brazilian Cherry, Southern Peach, Vanilla Chai, and Arctic Apple! Scent Expressions are available for about $4.99 each at your local drugstore and come in 14 brilliant scents! Go snatch some up! Your pits will thank you! Lancome’s Mystery Game Collection By Isabella Muse on August 19, 2007 5 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , First Impressions , Lancome Oh my the very my! The mail came on Saturday but I didn’t have a chance to open it till just this very second and to my delight what was in it? Lancome’s Mystery Game Collection! I was quite excited to get my greedy, sweaty, eager little hands all over the Cube of of Destiny! I ripped open the package and behold: I’m normally not a fan of Lancome’s general cosmetic line but this was too good to pass up! I’m actually quite happy I dove right in and purchased it because it’s quite a nice little conversation piece as well as usable (the sudden urge to wrap it in cotton, never use it, take it out for special occasions, pet it and tell it how pretty it is may strike at times but try to refrain and just use the damn thing! I should take my own advice shouldn’t I?). The Destiny Cube comes in two color variations Deep Fascination and Charisma. At first I thought it was one color option but there are, in fact, two color options to choose from! I purchased the darker of the two (although the overwhelming urge to buy the two colors was hard to argue with!) which is Charisma. I think it’s a much better Fall look than Deep Fascination. Deep Fascination Charisma I haven’t touched either shadows or glosses yet so I’m unsure of texture or pigment but I’ll be doing a deeper review of this later on! For now I’m just happy to take it out of it’s black velvet satchel and stroke it lovingly! The face chart included with the Cube is a nice little extra but highly exaggerated in my humblest opinion! There is no way on God’s green little earth that you’ll be able to create these looks with this one Cube! The colors are just off completely! In the chart the model is wearing a very lovely pink shade and shaded in with the green as a smoky look! The green shade is quite spot on but the pinkish shade you see is no where near what is available in the cube! The color is a soft lilac color and not pink at all! I feel the lip creams are off mark as well! It’s a nice little item to include but the colors are way off base! I also purchased Baume Baiser which is freaking amazing! This truly deserves a back-up! We need a case of these sent over as soon as possible! I originally read about this on the Make-Up Bag and the review was so outstanding that I had to nab this little guy for myself! This is part of the Mystery Game collection contrary to the fact that Lancome’s website doesn’t display it on the same pages as the Mystery Game! As Make-Up Bag said this is a highly addicting product! It contains a soft pillow of lip treatment that has a weird jello like texture and tastes like a dreamy, creamy, sweet marshmallow! It makes my lips feel absolutely soft and smooth! It’s quite like the box says…kiss a pillow! This balm is perfect for application all day, under lipstick or gloss, or just by itself! Truly money well spent! I need another one! Finally I purchased Blush Subtil Shimmer in Shimmer Pool Pink! I unknowingly purchased this only to have it arrive and realize I had already purchased this same color AGES ago! This is just a repeat that they have included with the Mystery Game color story and no reason to pick it up! Don’t make the same mistake I did on this one! Overall, Lancome’s outdone their selves with this nifty little collection! I’d love to see Lancome release some more of the fun items I’ve seen recently! This is truly something that has the avid cosmetic collector in mind when it was created! The entire collection is very usable but the Cube is a piece you’ll want to cherish!

"['Shopping Discoves on Etsy By Isabella Muse on August 12, 2007 Leave a Comment in Etsy Musings , Fashion , Online Shopping , Shower & Bath I think, by now, we have established I LOVE shopping! Now I’m not saying that I love it…I LOVE IT….get me? Sometimes, a girl such as myself, can get a bit bored with items that stores have. I get a bit burned out seeing the same type of product offered over and over and over in a different format, color, or package. I love being wow’ed by the next best thing but on a occasion sometimes the wow factor goes out of shopping! In order to get my daily dose of wow I head over to Etsy to discover new, interesting, unique and generally awesome little goodies that are handmade by masses of different people! Etsy reminds me of a little market places where tons of friendly people are peddling their wares! The only difference between Etsy and a real market place is this is my computer and I don’t actually get a chance to meet with the talented artists that pawn their goods on Etsy ! I admire and respect many of the artists on Etsy and adore giving them business! I think it takes a special kind of person to create so many interesting items! I call them artists because truly that’s what it boils down too! These people put heart and soul into all their creations! The best thing is you’ll shop, purchase, and end up owning something that’s truly a one of a kind item! What more could a girl want? Some Etsy Shops that the Muse frequents and recommends: Mad City Sue Soaps Plenty of wonderful bits and bobs to keep you happy in the shower and out! Handmade soaps, body scrubs, customized mists and more! I strongly recommend the Italian Cream Cake Foaming Shower Parfait but please try to avoid digging into it with a spoon! After all it is for your body! Whimsy Hollow When the Muse wants to a little sparkle, shimmer, and glitter she looks no further than Whimsy Hollow where she can purchase Faerie Glimmer Dust! This gorgeous shimmer comes in a whimsical little jar with the cutest little powder puff. Use it on your eyes, shoulders, body, anywhere you’d love a little sparkle and a bit of honeysuckle fragrance makes it extra special! Whimsy Hollow offers other fine little bits and bobs for sale so check the shop out and see what catches your fancy! Sobe Botanicals The Muse loves lip glosses and balms! When she grows a bit tired of her normal stash she heads over to Sobe Botanicals to purchase some of their custom made lip glosses! Sobe allows you to choose the color and the flavor of your balm! It goes on smooth, gives your lips a tiny touch of color, tastes yum, and is cheap as a day old chips! Perfect for those days you don’t want to be too made up! Sobe has other wonderful little makeup minerals and such for sale as well! Baba Studios The Muse sometimes likes to step off the well used path onto a new one! When she does she visits Baba Studios to purchase some of their highly sought after bags! She uses them for a variety of storages purposes and sometimes even when she’s out and about! They always cause quite a stir among the vintage lovers in her life and are quite the conversation piece! For a few dollars you too can own a very interesting piece of art work to hang around your wrist or just to hold your tiny treasures in! GraceEsjavacreations The Muse absolutely adores spoiling her family and friends! She loves buying them pressies even when their isn’t a holiday or a birthday to celebrate! When she wants to add a special little something to a package for a friend or a family member she enjoys tagging it with one of the Victorian tags she can purchase from GraceEsjavacreations! It gives her gifts that special little touch! BamaBelle Vintage Boutique I can’t think of a single thing that the Muse’s likes more than vintage clothing! Oh yes wait I can think of something! Vintage clothing without the hassle of shopping for it yourself! Bamabelle scours the Vintage scene for all the greatest finds you could possibly imagine and all you do is sit back and relax while browsing through an extensive list of her finds! Gosh vintage shopping doesn’t get any easier does it? Note: the Muse loves when Bamabelle locates interesting cute camis and lists them for mere pennies for which she’d paid here in Manhattan! Louise Black Designs The Muse is never averse to adding a little goth into her life! She admires all the FRUiTS, Lolitas, and general Harajuku girl styles! When you want a little darkness in your life you can visit Louise Black Designs for an array of wonderful gothic clothings! Gorgeous corsets, blouses, and wonderful vintage pieces will line your closet after shopping here! She’s pretty new but she’s a favorite for me already! Her corsets are absolutely drop dead gorgeous! I’ve purchased two already! glamourbunny Corsets The Muse has a lot of wobbly bits that need to be tucked out of the way! When she wants them tucked away and seeks to look glamorous she heads over to the glamourbunny’s closet to purchase corsets and belts and an array of gorgeous handmade clothing! The Muse recommends the Taffeta bow belt for $25! It’s the must have Fall fashion accessory in her humble opinion! Boudoir Queen The Muse loves a little flare! When she seeks something with flare she wanders over to Boudoir Queen to purchase it! The Boudoir Doll purses are quite a favorite here! Note: If you’re a lucky petite size you’ll be happy to shop her Living Doll Collection which features some of thee most amazing fashion finds I ever did lay my eyes on! You can pair some of her corsets with a simple pair of jeans for a really amazing look! As you can see Etsy offers a wide array of wonderful, unusual, unique, and amazing finds! These are just a mere handful of my favorite shops! Head on over, sign up, and begin searching, finding, and adding to your favorite shops! It’s always nice to have a special piece in your closet, shower, or train case that no one else has! Just don’t tell them where you purchased it! A girl has to have some secrets right?

"['MAC Cult of Cherry Review By Isabella Muse on August 20, 2008 50 Comments in Face of the Day , Fall Collections 2008 , MAC I’m really behind on my MAC posts lately aren’t I? I’m sorry about that guys! Forgive me? I still have to blog Cool Heat which was an absolute favorite! And of course Starflash! But today….today is reserved for something extra special. MAC Cult of Cherry! I’ve had a few items from Cult of Cherry for a little over two weeks now but I’ve just been to busy to blog ’em however now was a good time to tug them out of my “to be reviewed” pile and post considering that Cult of the Cherry is live and kicking on the MAC website and should be at your counter already or coming to it shortly! Leave it to MAC to take on the latest trend of rich, bold reds, purples, and black and add a tiny bit of unique flavoring to it to create a truly interesting collection that’s both bold and mysterious. The collection’s theme is the forbidden fruit of cherries and the decadence of chocolate to combine a cocktail of bold reds, rich browns, and plenty of kick! Although some of the colors in the collection are definately difficult to work with it’s fun trying. One such item for me was MAC Matte Lipstick in Bing. I’ve been trying to use this in a look for over a week and still haven’t successfully completed a look where I didn’t look like a corpse! But I vow I will get this down! It’s my aim to look super glam sporting this lippie! MAC Matte Lipstick in Bing I created my look below using the MAC Tempting Eye Quad, Jam Packed Lipglass, and So Scarlett Lipstick. The MAC Tempting Quad is a bit intimidating at first especially considering that the green is such a neon shade. But turns out it all rather works fantastically well together to create a rather wonderful Fall look! The colors in the quad are Sharp which is a neon green, Next to Nothing a soft cream, Dark Edge a matte deep chocolate, and Temping a shimmering off brown. Although I was a bit worried about mixing green up with brown after working with the palette I was impressed with how well the colors just melded together. The palette is really simplicity at it’s best and it’s truly easy to create elegance from four simple shades of shadow. To begin my look I prepped my entire eye with the color Nothing, concentrating on my highbrow area. I proceeded to use Sharp on my entire lid and slowly blended it into part of my crease. After this I blended Tempting into my crease and topped it with Dark Edge. After blending upwards I added more Tempting for that added bit of shimmer and lined my lower lash line with it. I finished my look by using Dark Edge as a liner shade for my upper lash line. It was really a simple few steps and I liked what came out of it. I’m wanting to purchase the other two quads from Cult of the Cherry so I’m heading over to my counter soonish to see what else catches my fancy as I didn’t attend the pre-launch party for the collection. As mentioned I used MAC Lipstick in So Scarlett on my lips which is a wonderful burgundy shade with tiny touches of purple. MAC Lipglass in Jampacked completed my lips. Since Jampacked also contains both touches of burgundy and grape it combines wonderfully well with So Scarlett to create a popping lip look. I was slightly disappointed that you couldn’t see more of the grape in my completed look. It looks like I’m wearing more of a red lippie but still I think it’s rather a beautiful combination. I have my eye on Cult of Cherry and of course Russian Red. I’m sure tons of people are excited about Russian Red making a reappearance! MAC Lipglass Jampacked MAC Lipstick So Scarlett One other color I got to test out was Creme Cerise this is a taupe which has that off beat creamy brown look to it. I haven’t yet used this but I think it’ll look smashing with any of the quads released! And finally, my favorite, Illegal Purple Nail Varnish! So goth! Totally appeals to my inner goth in a big way! It’s the deepest purple I’ve come across in a nail color and simply stunning. All in all I think MAC Cult of Cherry definately has a little something for everyone as most MAC Collections do. I’m really enjoying the boldness of these colors. MAC does bold brilliantly well but this is possibly the darkest collection I’ve seen pop up since I began collecting. It’s definately extra special and trendy for the upcoming Fall Season! Look out for some of these looks on the runway during Fashion Week! I’m sure you’ll see some of these trendy looks pop up! Have you seen the rather funky, cool video on the MAC website? Check it out! Love MAC Cult of Cherry? What are you hauling? Tell the Muse!

"['Fall Collections 2008: Urban Decay 24/7 Concealer Pencil Review By Isabella Muse on July 29, 2008 22 Comments in Fall Collections 2008 , Swatches , Urban Decay I admit that I’m easily jaded when it comes to new collections, cosmetics, makeup, skincare, etc..lately. It’s difficult to impress me more and more. I try so many new and exciting items and many disappoint however I have come across a product that has the greatness to become an absolute cult favorite in my humblest opinion. As part of it’s exciting Fall Collection Urban Decay has released a concealer pencil entitled 24/7 Concealer Pencil. I can’t begin to tell you how excited I am about this product. I was a bit disappointed with the Too Faced Mineral Water pencil I recently tried so when I heard about Urban Decay 24/7 Concealer Pencil I expected much of the same outcome when testing it out. Most of these pencil style concealers are difficult to blend, feel waxy and hard, and just aren’t pigmented enough to cover up problem areas, etc…. Not the case for 24/7 Concealer Pencil. Wow, simply wow. Get one. Immediately. You need this product in your beauty arsenal. It’s absolutely essential you have one! First off the name is completely fitting with the product. Urban Decay 24/7 Eye Liners are extremely popular with the masses due to their creamy consistency and effortless glide across the eye. It just so happens that the 24/7 Concealer Pencil has an identical soft, creamy formula as the eye pencils! Urban Decay’s Potion Primer has become a staple and essential cult item with many makeup fans and I think this new concealer has the potential for that greatness! First of all the general idea of fitting a moist, creamy, blendable concealer into a pencil is absolutely awesome. Have you ever successfully used a concealer pencil that contained a formula with all those key benefits? I haven’t. The color I got was CIA which is the lightest shade available. It might have been a bit too light but I don’t mind as I liked the way it brightened my eye area up and created a nice awake look to my eyes. The product is richly pigmented and will cover up any and all problems in particular dark circles under your eyes. It’s advertised as a concealer for blemishes, under eye circles, redness, etc….I’ve used mine for only my eye area and I’m impressed with the results. It woke up my tired eyes and offered excellent coverage for dark circles and the extra luggage I sometimes sport around my eye area. The texture is a soft, creamy moisturizing concealer that blends with little effort. The idea of not having to dip into a pot for my concealer or squeeze a mess of liquid out of a tube totally pleases me to no end. Just swipe and go. Easy. Simplicity like this is worth the price! The formula is not drying nor does it settle into fine lines. It smooths beautifully under the eye covering up problems while creating a matte, flawless finish. The product sports a dose of Vitamin E and also contains a new ingredient called Microsponge which absorbs excess oil and prevents further breakouts and clogged pores. The absorbing excess oil is pretty exciting for those that sport oily lids. A bit of this will be a wonderful prep to mattify your lids in preparation for your eye makeup. I’m also loving this for after eye makeup touch ups. I get major fall out and I find that after I apply my shadow, pigments, etc…if I swipe a bit of this under my eyes and blend it gets rid of my fall out mess and gives me a fresh under eye area minus chunks of shimmer and glitter from my shadow. The portability of the product is a major plus. Tuck it in your purse for quick touch ups on the go! Perfection! For some reason the finish, texture, and formula quite reminds me of YSL’s popular Touche Eclat Radiant. The only difference being Urban Decay sports a pencil design and is heaps cheaper! It’s safe to say that this can easily be used as a quick highlighter as well for quick touch ups to your face. Smooth a little down the sides of your nose and blend outwards for a fresh face. The pencil is available in four shades and comes with it’s own sharpener for $16 USD. It’s available for sale now from both Urban Decay and Sephora. This comes with my highest rating of Muse Approval and I recommend going out and grabbing one as quickly as you can! It’s truly an outstanding product and a must have item! Urban Decay has a winner on it’s hands here and I predict it’ll be extremely popular once the word gets out! Want to try this? Already have? Love Urban Decay? Tell the Muse!

"['Bath and Body Works Fall & Winter 2007 Collections By Isabella Muse on August 23, 2007 5 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Fall Collections 2007 , Shower & Bath , Winter Collections 2007 I got a sneak peak at what’s ahead for Bath and Body Works and I’m doing a little jig in excitement! I can’t help but get a bit excited at the prospect of new 3 in 1 temptation shower gels! I’ve collected myself a nice little stockpile of these during the Summer sale and I think I might love ’em even more than Philosophy’s 3 in 1’s! Just a few of the bottles I snagged during the Summer sales! There are more but we wouldn’t want you to see how diseased I really am now would we? Last year, Twisted Peppermint was quite a RAVE for the Muse! So much so that she ended up squirreling away bottles and bottles and bottles, did I mention bottles? and bottles of it! It was thee most delightful blend of vanilla and peppermint candy cane that the Muse truly enjoyed indulging in! The best part about Twisted Peppermint is it not only made the perfect winter pampering treat but it also carried into Summer as wonderful cooling experience! The last few of what remains from the Muse’s stash of Twisted Peppermint! ? This year it appears they are adding to the Twisted Peppermint collection a body spray! Oh my! Lotion, Shower Gel, and Scrubs wasn’t enough they had to tempt me with body spray too! I can picture myself come December calling up everyone I know in New York and screaming at them to PLEASE for the LOVE of God and all things HOLY get me some of that Twisted Peppermint and ship it over to England as soon as possible (I’ll be in the UK for Christmas)! Flipping through the catalog I also happened to come across some other very interesting items! Spicy Gum Drop! Oh My! And what’s this…Chocolate Mint! This should be illegal! The somewhat bad news is that the Fall line up looks kinda sorta similar to last year! Pecan Pie is sticking around, Pumpkins on Parade is coming back, and…..drum roll please……Cherry Pie is making it’s debut! Cherry Pie looks divine! Looks like it’s going to be a sweet Fall and Winter if Bath and Body Works Temptation line will be sharing your shower with you! Lunasol Geminate Eye Palettes By Isabella Muse on August 23, 2007 12 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , Friends , Hauls , Japanese Brands , Lunasol A package from my angel arrived a few days ago which contained the new Lunasol Geminate Eye palettes! SQUEAL! The colors are amazingly pigmented, full of sparkle and shimmer, and really solid colors for the cooler months! I’ve never purchased a Lunasol palette prior to these but I can see these are quite possibly Kanebo’s best line of product and may even beat out T’estimo for quality! These are a higher end cosmetic compared to Kanebo’s other color lines and the cost of each proves that these are indeed a luxurious item to purchase! This is only a first impression, I haven’t tried them yet as I am too busy stroking them and telling them how pretty they are BUT I can tell you they are possibly better than Visee’s Jewel Crush Eyes ! Many of you, like myself have purchased T’estimo’s newest palettes plus Visee’s Jewel Crush Eyes. These beat out both in the department of high shimmer, sparkle, and glitter! If you’re pressed for cash and in debates what you should purchase I’d go with one of these and skip the T’estimo and Visee palettes! Overall I’m mighty pleased with these and quite excited to begin creating a new look with ’em! These have to be the best Fall collection I’ve seen this season! The colors just remind me of a cool autumn night! I was in high debate about which palettes to choose and in the end I decided on all five! And am I ever glad I did! Ruby Alexandrite Diamond Sapphire Cat’s Eye The Muse was completely spoiled in this package as not only were the Lunasol palettes tucked into it but some gorgeous little pressies that the angel included for me! Now this angel knows me a little too well and she included some much lusted after Sweet Sweets palettes for me! Sweet Sweets is an amazingly cute and inexpensive Japanese drugstore brand! These are just too terrific for words! I’m utterly in love with ’em! They are on the sheer side but if you want to do a real simple makeup look these are perfection! I’m loving these! And if that wasn’t enough something else was tucked into my box! I love the little fairy drawing the eye liner on! The Muse’s angel sure knows how to enable because Cineora is not a brand that the Muse has every heard of! The loose powder is not only adorable but perfect for tucking into my purse for touch ups! It does wonders on under eye circles! And the liner is sheer perfection! One stroke will do it! No having to go back and repeat myself this is nice and dark! The Muse is in love with Cineroa’s brand of cosmetics now ? Friends are special people and when they go out of their way to do something lovely for me I can’t help but feel thankful that I am lucky enough to have my life touched by them! MAC Smoke Signals Haul By Isabella Muse on August 23, 2007 4 Comments in First Impressions , Hauls , MAC I just got in from Nordies with my little haul of MAC Smoke Signals in tow. Sadly, Blue Storm didn’t make an appearance so I’ll have to wait a little longer to get my hands on it. I ended up purchasing two eyeliners, two pigments, and the two quads. I left the lippies, nail varnish, and blush, none struck me as must haves. Overall it’s a great collection! I think I got the pick of the best items and the rest are pretty much leave ’em, not need ’em. The blushes weren’t anything to write home about, the nail varnish are nice but I tend to bite my nails so not too worth it for me, and the lipsticks just weren’t wowing me. The quads are a must have and the best I’ve seen from MAC in quite a while. All the colors work well together in these which is rare since a majority of the quads I get from MAC have colors that seem to never work well for me and I end up scratching my head trying to firgure out what sort of eye look I could possibly create with the quad. The two liners are also must haves in my humblest of humble opinions! Raven is a deep maroon color that really will look great with Lovestone and Cranberry! Orpheus is an equally gorgeous shade. The pigments weren’t anything to get too excited about. Silver Fog is shown as Limited Edition shade but it’s a normal MAC Pro item. This is exciting if you happen to not have a MAC Pro in your general area but if you do have a Pro shop it’s just a snore. I picked this up as I never did bother getting it from my local Pro shop! It’s definately a very nice pigment! Smoke Signals is very bizarre not sure what to do with this little guy it’s a bit reddish, a bit brownish, and maybe even a tad bit purple thrown in! Not sure how this fits into the smoky eye look but count me as challenged, I aim to create a look with it. Dark Soul is a regular catalog item and not entirely worth the $20! Unless you’re a collector you can do away with purchasing such a large jar of black piggie! Just stick to a sample from E-bay or forums! If you’re purchasing your lot in store be sure they give you one of the postcard booklets! It’s rare they give postcards out anymore so this is a nice item if you happen to collect MAC postcards! It includes all the looks featured in the video plus some face charts on the back! And it’s free! We like free stuff don’t we? Overall a nice offering from this collection! Do check out the MAC website to see a great video of Eartha Kitt glamming it up! It so fits with the theme of this collection! MuseTV Presents Smoke Signals (I’m sorry this one is crummy guys! I’m just a bit drained today).

"['Mountain Dew Shampoo and Conditioner By Isabella Muse on August 6, 2010 28 Comments in Beauty Most Unusual , Etsy Musings , Of Geeks , Shower & Bath I’m pretty sure if I admitted to not loving and bleeding Mountain Dew (particularly Code Red) they’d revoke my Geek Membership and I’d be kicked out of my Guild. Between us, I can’t stand the taste of the stuff but don’t tell anyone ok? I’d lose my credibility as a W0W geek if you spread that kinda news around. Now if you happen to be a fond lover of Mountain Dew or just a general geek or you need to stay awake long hours at a time while you live your primary W0W life (and your real one wastes away) you might be interested in a little something that Bella Sugar discovered on Etsy. Check it! From Etsy user, Digitalsoaps : A geek’s dream existence: Wake up at noon. Wash hair with soda. Wash body with video game controller. Open bag of Cheetos. Play video games. Fight zombies IRL. Sleep. Repeat. Now I gotta say, if I could live my life everyday with a bag of cheetos while playing video games and fighting zombies, I’d be one happy camper. Seriously? Zombies? IRL? Yes, please, sigh me up! I don’t even need the Cheetos, just give me a big machine gun and some Zombies…..oh wait, I can’t, I forgot, Zombies are people too . Damn. Moral of this story is that Digital Soaps sells refreshing shampoo made with a Mountain Dew scent (is your inner geek screaming?) each bottle contains 530 mg of caffeine which they say is absorbed through the skin. I’m hyper enough, don’t need to add to that equation. And how the hell is it absorbed anyway? Hell, they even have a matching conditioner so they are obviously targeting the female nerds here. If Mountain Dew Shampoo and Conditioner isn’t doing it for you, you can check out caffeinated soap bars shaped like your favorite game controller, Pepsi Shampoo, or even rock it old school with Tetris shaped soap. God, I love this shop so hard right now. Visit the Digitial Soap Etsy Shop to get your geek on. Tell me whatcha think? Any geeks out there? For the record, I want a Code Red Shampoo and Conditioner set. You may also enjoy...

This pretty soaps are a darling ode to a favorite sweet from France. The top and bottom “cookies” are whipped soap and the cream filling is a contrasting shade of soapy filling! Choose from Almond, Lemon Creme, Rose Bud, or Green Tea. Remember these are macarons for your shower not your mouth! Each soap is $7 and available at Naiad’s Etsy Shop.

"['The Muse’s Gift Guide: Unique Gifts From Etailers Part 1 By Isabella Muse on November 11, 2009 20 Comments in Fragrance , Gift Ideas , Online Shopping , Shower & Bath Hello dears. It’s so very early to worry about the gift giving season isn’t it? But I really want to get a jump start on Gift Giving Guides this year and one particular guide that REALLY needs an extra early preview is my Unique Guide to Gift Giving via Etailers. I love Etailers ummm wait scratch that….I’m addicted to Etailers. What are Etailers? Etailers are basically smaller shops or homegrowns as I refer to them. It’s normally run by a single person sometimes two and products are handmade in most cases from scratch. These products include bath and body goodies, perfumes, perfume oils, and in some cases even cosmetics. I love purchasing gifts from Etailers because it makes the gift giving experience really unique and special because seriously some of these items just can’t be purchased in any store or shop you’d find at the mall. I’m also starting this guide a little earlier because many of these shops are popular and they sometimes have a lead shipping time which takes anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks (or more) to get your items since they are being freshly made. I’ve personally shopped from these stores myself however I can’t vouch for their shipping time so please if you’re gifting someone do take the shipping time into consideration prior to ordering. Again, this is why this particular gift guide is going up early. In other news… I’ll be doing other gift guides over the next month and into December. Hopefully you’ll find each of these guides a helpful way to discover some great presents for friends and family. If you have an idea for a particular guide I’d love to hear it, do comment and share. Jump ahead for the Muse’s Gift Guide to Unique Gifts From Etailers around the Internet! Let me start my guide by introducing you to Isle of Eden. I haven’t placed an order from Isle of Eden in a very long time simply because in my experience the shipping time was VERY bad. It takes anywhere from 3-6 weeks to get in order or at least that was the case for me. I don’t mind waiting for the order but when it’s for gifts it was a problem. It has a huge cult following and the products are very, very nice but the shipping does present a problem. I’m telling you about this one a bit early as there may still be time to squeeze an order in and get it in time for Christmas. The products are pretty much body scrubs, whipped body creams, shampoos, perfumes, etc…all the items are handmade and blended with interesting scents that you won’t find anywhere else. I’ve tried pretty much all that she offers and I’ve always been quite pleased aside from as I mentioned above the very poor shipping times. These are a nice, unique gift idea none the less. She promises her turn around for shipment is 10 days if it’s true or not I can’t relate back to you. Visit Isle of Eden at www.isleofeden.com Now one of absolutely favorite places to shop for the Holidays would be Margarita Bloom. I don’t have a friend alive who won’t turn and ask “but didn’t you buy me some Margarita Bloom for my stocking?” Indeed, it’s a rather addicting little shop. With a wide array of handmade moisturizers, lip treatments, bath and body goodies, and much, much more, you won’t have a shortage for gift ideas here. Plus did I mention the vintage pin up girl style packaging is so me? Shipping is very fast in my experience and the owner is a joy to deal with, a real sweetie. Visit Margarita Bloom at www.margarita-bloom.com Some items on my wish list from Margarita Bloom: Sake Couture Soap ($8.50) CupCake Love Soap ($8.50) Oh My I Smell Delicious Roll On Perfumes in Strawberry Angel Cake and Vanilla Sprinkles ($12.95 Each) Margarita Bloom’s Fabulous Little Box of Goodies ($19.99 for 10 “surprise” MB samples and one full size bath product) I can’t tell you how long I’ve been ordering from Red, White and Blue Bonnet which is an E-bay online Bath Shop run by a lovely little lady named Carol. She makes the cheapest bath bombs and bubble bars around town plus they are tops in my books. She has a slew of scents to choose from plus other very fun and exciting bath goodies but the Muse highly recommends her Bubble Bars, inexpensive and awesome stocking stuffers and gifts! Visit Red, White, and Blue Bonnet at http://stores.ebay.com/Soft-And-Sudsy-Bath-And-More My fav item? The “You Choose Bubble Bars” for $3.50 each. Choose a fragrance from the extensive scent list (100’s to choose from) and she’ll make it for your fresh! I also love the Cherry Cordial Bath Bomb as the cherry is actual a tiny piece of soap so after the bomb fizzes away you can use the soap to wash with. Pumpkin Mousse Bubble Bath Bar is another of my favs for this time of the year! If perfume is your deal…hey wait this isn’t for you! It’s supposed to be a gift! If perfume is your friend’s (or family’s) deal you can’t do better than stopping by Starring Fragrances for some foody and deliciously scented perfumes made by Ashley Peldon herself. These fragrances are some of the best I’ve tried with wonderful throw and linger but keep in mine they are sweet and foody with scents like Banana Bread Sundae. Coconut Vanilla Custard Creme, and Pink Marshmallow these are sure to tickle your sweet tooth. For an even more customized gift you can get Ashley to make a perfume for you or a friend, cousin, sister….just tell her notes you like or what scents you love and she’ll create a personalized perfume just for you! Visit Starring at www.starringfragrances.com For a deeper review see my Starring Fragrance Review. Little Shop of Beauty located in Canada has always had me at the front page. I click on and proceed to want to buy almost instantly. So hard saying no to the cute vintage packaging and interesting little products they sell in the bath and body arena. Loves it! Shipping is a tad on the slow side but it’s been a while in between my last order so it could have improved. They have really unique items that would make a super gift. My fav is the custom beauty bar which allows you to custom scent any number of items from moisturizers to shampoo to body sprays! Love, love personal beauty! Visit the Little Shop of Beauty at www.littleshopofbeauty.com Most Doctor’s wouldn’t consider adding sweet next to their name but this Doctor doesn’t mind in the least. Doctor Sweet Tooth is a fav little shop of mine that sells many a fine bath and body treat and even fragrance, scrubs, and more and of course you guessed it…in really SWEET scents! The Doctor is in at www.doctorsweettooth.com My favs: Handmade Wedding Cake Scented Cupcake Soaps ($8) Handmade Body Splash and Hair Perfume ($5.25) Try out scents like Cotton Candy, Fruit Loops, and Jelly Bean (Love!) Flavored LipGloss ($5.50) Love Gummy Bears, Grape, and Cherry Pie Well I sure do hope you had fun with this post and maybe located a unique and fabulous gift for a friend (or for yourself). I’ll be bringing you a second part in this series shortly with other unique offerings found around the Internet. Do tell me if you hauling anything! Disclosure: Please take note links included in this post are NOT affiliate links. They are simply links to online stores I’ve shopped from in the past and enjoyed. I do not make money from these stores, I am not paid to post about them nor do they even know they’ll be featured on my blog, this is a simple and fun gift guide created by me. You may also enjoy...

"['The Bathing Garden Creamy Sugar Scrub Review By Isabella Muse on June 3, 2014 5 Comments in Bath & Body , Bath on a Budget , Muse Approved , Online Shopping , Shower & Bath Purchased So you might recall the Bathing Garden Tarts which I cannot rave enough! Recently, I did my first order for some Bathing Garden Creamy Sugar Scrub…I’m not really sure when scrubs were introduced but this is the first time I indulged. When I discovered The Bathing Garden it was an Etsy shop . It moved to Facebook soon after and set up shop and even more recently a new website was launched where you can place orders. The shop is typically open once a month and features new fragrances with each re-open. The Creamy Sugar Scrub review I’m about to do falls at the right time because the shop is currently open for business with Circus themed tarts and scrubs available for purchase until June 5th at which time it will close again, get orders out, and re-open again with new fragrances! Needless to say I love this shop’s tarts! They are AMAZING! Fantastic throw, great linger, and really complex fragrances! Anyway, my recent order I decided to order some of the Creamy Sugar Scrubs and here’s some thoughts! Back in the day I used to love me some Isle of Eden Scrubs (remember the drama anyone!?) but I kinda got burnt out on ’em! I was all scrubbed out to say the least. So it has been a while since I’ve indulged in e-tailer scrubs so imagine my pleasant surprise when I tried the Bathing Garden’s Creamy Sugar Scrub and was terribly impressed. This formula is very, very good. It’s a creamy very refined sugar scrub. The texture is very soft and quite reminds me of the consistency of Fortune Cookie Soap’s new Talkin’ Smack Lip Scrub . The sugar is very soft and gentle yet still manages to buff away drier skin on legs, elbows, knees, etc…! It also breaks down and begins to lather the more you scrub and rinses clean away without making skin too oily. I love Philosophy Senorita Margarita Body Scrub or even their Pink Lemonade Scrub from years past but it does have a good deal of oil in it which makes my shower slippery plus the grains are very large and course. The Bathing Garden’s formula is far more gentle and still successfully whisks away drier skin and smooths and softens my skin. And of course, the fragrances are SO unique. I ordered three scrubs one of which was Pink Candy Queen and this is pretty much a spot on dupe for Lush Candy Fluff’s fragrance. I was also surprised the Rose Glace Scrub scent was spot on for Lush’s Rose Jam ! Rose Jam can be an overwhelming scent sometimes but Bathing Garden mixed it with brown sugar in a scrub called Brown Sugar Cream Rose Bouquet and that touch of brown sugar subdues the Rose Jam and creates a really pretty scent. I really wish that they offered fragrance mists in these fragrances because they are simply divine! There are plenty of Lush Dupe fragrances around e-tailers but I really thought the Bathing Garden did something special with theirs! I also picked Citrus Cake Batter which is an orange-y pastry cake scent that just makes you want to eat it! Mmmm! Needless to say I thought these scrubs were as incredible as the Bathing Garden tarts I so dearly love. I highly recommend checking them out! Please keep in mind that orders take three to four weeks to arrive prior to placing an order. Check them out at thebathinggarden.com. You may also enjoy...

It’s been a while inbetween updates and I apologize big time for that! But the good news is I have MANY fine things to share! I’ve got quite a haul of Japanese goodies the past week and a half, MAC is releasing Smoke Signals and Blue Storm today which I’ll pick up tonight, and I have a few other bits to share! So……………………back soon with great updates ? Laura Geller Baked Basics By Isabella Muse on August 23, 2007 Leave a Comment in Fall Collections 2007 , Laura Geller , Wish List It appears many brands are jumping on board the baked cosmetic bandwagon as of late! Since MAC’s newest hottest release of Flashtronic many other companies have been trying their hand at baking it up a bit! Laura Geller has had various baked powders around for a while on QVC however she’s just recently expanded her color collections to Sephora. With her move to Sephora she’s created some pretty neat little kits! This one struck me as a good little deal! A full size kabuki plus three baked completion powders (aka mineral skinfinishes for the MAC whores) all this for $48! Not a bad little deal that I may indulge in! The berry in this collection is especially appealing! I think this one is on the wish list! Want these? Too imitation MAC for you? Tell me ? I’m listening! Comment box at the ready!

"['Lancome’s Mystery Game Collection By Isabella Muse on August 19, 2007 5 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , First Impressions , Lancome Oh my the very my! The mail came on Saturday but I didn’t have a chance to open it till just this very second and to my delight what was in it? Lancome’s Mystery Game Collection! I was quite excited to get my greedy, sweaty, eager little hands all over the Cube of of Destiny! I ripped open the package and behold: I’m normally not a fan of Lancome’s general cosmetic line but this was too good to pass up! I’m actually quite happy I dove right in and purchased it because it’s quite a nice little conversation piece as well as usable (the sudden urge to wrap it in cotton, never use it, take it out for special occasions, pet it and tell it how pretty it is may strike at times but try to refrain and just use the damn thing! I should take my own advice shouldn’t I?). The Destiny Cube comes in two color variations Deep Fascination and Charisma. At first I thought it was one color option but there are, in fact, two color options to choose from! I purchased the darker of the two (although the overwhelming urge to buy the two colors was hard to argue with!) which is Charisma. I think it’s a much better Fall look than Deep Fascination. Deep Fascination Charisma I haven’t touched either shadows or glosses yet so I’m unsure of texture or pigment but I’ll be doing a deeper review of this later on! For now I’m just happy to take it out of it’s black velvet satchel and stroke it lovingly! The face chart included with the Cube is a nice little extra but highly exaggerated in my humblest opinion! There is no way on God’s green little earth that you’ll be able to create these looks with this one Cube! The colors are just off completely! In the chart the model is wearing a very lovely pink shade and shaded in with the green as a smoky look! The green shade is quite spot on but the pinkish shade you see is no where near what is available in the cube! The color is a soft lilac color and not pink at all! I feel the lip creams are off mark as well! It’s a nice little item to include but the colors are way off base! I also purchased Baume Baiser which is freaking amazing! This truly deserves a back-up! We need a case of these sent over as soon as possible! I originally read about this on the Make-Up Bag and the review was so outstanding that I had to nab this little guy for myself! This is part of the Mystery Game collection contrary to the fact that Lancome’s website doesn’t display it on the same pages as the Mystery Game! As Make-Up Bag said this is a highly addicting product! It contains a soft pillow of lip treatment that has a weird jello like texture and tastes like a dreamy, creamy, sweet marshmallow! It makes my lips feel absolutely soft and smooth! It’s quite like the box says…kiss a pillow! This balm is perfect for application all day, under lipstick or gloss, or just by itself! Truly money well spent! I need another one! Finally I purchased Blush Subtil Shimmer in Shimmer Pool Pink! I unknowingly purchased this only to have it arrive and realize I had already purchased this same color AGES ago! This is just a repeat that they have included with the Mystery Game color story and no reason to pick it up! Don’t make the same mistake I did on this one! Overall, Lancome’s outdone their selves with this nifty little collection! I’d love to see Lancome release some more of the fun items I’ve seen recently! This is truly something that has the avid cosmetic collector in mind when it was created! The entire collection is very usable but the Cube is a piece you’ll want to cherish! You may also enjoy...

These come in the same bottle as the lip stain (which I dearly love by the very way!) that was released winter of last year. I’m duly impressed with the variety of colors they are offering in this nifty little liner! 12 in all it appears! I do believe some of the colors promise sparkle too!

Better Late Than Never: Japanese Cosmetic Fall Haul Update By Isabella Muse on August 27, 2007 Leave a Comment in Babbling Bits , MuseTV My Better Late Than Never blog entry is being updated with the videos! Check back shortly and scroll to the bottom of the entry to see MuseTV’s latest video blog! You can view that blog by clicking here . Clowns Aren’t So Scary! By Isabella Muse on August 27, 2007 1 Comment in Shower & Bath When I was a kid (and now that I’m an adult) clowns terrified the bloody hell out of me! There is something so seriously scary about clowns! Don’t even sit their and deny it because you know exactly what I mean! Isle of Eden has kindly taken the scary out of clowns for me and made them deliciously sinful! Over the course of a year or so Isle of Eden has done various blends of their immensely popular Clowns line of body and bath care that has gotten quite a cult following (I’m a card holding member). This is just a tiny review of the Clowns series. The Clowns have evolved from a very simple scrub that was released for Halloween last year entitled “Can’t Sleep Clowns Will Eat Me” into a full line of different scent blends! The original, Can’t Sleep Clowns Will Eat Me, is still available for purchase in any number of bath and body products, haircare, and perfume! The scent is a house blend created by the owner of Isle of Eden and includes all of the following notes, pink cotton candy, funnel cake, and red apple! Since it’s original release Can’t Sleep Clowns Will Eat Me has had any number of notes added and taken away! Some of the blends I’ve gotten have included funnel cake, pink or blue cotton candy, cherry snowcone, strawberry, buttercream, pineapple, and many many other interesting tidbits! The blend started out as a scary treat for Halloween but soon evolved into a circus/carnival themed product! It later became something else completely and began to show really unusual notes blended together that worked quite well such as pineapple and funnal cake, pink lemonade and cotton candy, etc…! Some of my favorite Clowns were released shortly after the original house blend and were entitled Can’t Sleep Clowns Will Eat Me 1 through 4! Each blend consisted of something more wicked than the last! The blends were so gorgeous and amazing to smell that it was difficult not to dig into them with a spoon (I doubt they’d taste as good as they smelled!). Can’t Sleep Clowns Will Eat me Number 2 was a mixture of blue cotton candy, funnel cake, and juicy strawberries! Sounds weird right? Strawberries with funnel cake plus cotton candy? Sheesh sugar overload! But the strawberries binds the entire blend and creates a wickedly sinful body treat! Can’t Sleep Clowns Will Eat Me Number 3 consisted of Cherry Snow Cone, Blue Cotton Candy, and Funnel Cake. Can’t Sleep Clowns Will Eat Me Number 4 consisted of Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy, Funnel Cake, and Frozen Pink Lemonade. Sadly, these have made a trip into the great beyond and are no longer available in their original format! However, new Clowns are available and some contain these very same notes! Some products I highly recommend should you dive into purchasing some very delicious clown goodies would be the Whipped Bath Cream and of course, Isle of Eden’s specialty, body scrubs! The Whipped Bath Cream has the same consistency as a thick rich lotion but this is for your shower! A small amount and a shower puff will create mounds and mounds of luxurious suds that you can use to shave with, wash with, or even sneak in a hair wash with! I must say that a majority of Bath and Body goodies are almost always an in shower experience. Meaning as soon as you sud up and step from your shower the scent almost never lingers. I’ve found a majority of the Clown blends stick around for a bit through the day and I catch faint hints of Funnel Cake or strawberries, etc…through out the day! Which means the thrown, linger, and potency are pretty tops in my book! The scrubs are delightfully wonderful as well! The scrubs are not only great for exfoliation but also wonderful cleansers as well since they foam up! Sadly, Isle of Eden has one bad point. The wait time. Wait times for an order range from 1-3 months depending upon how busy they are at the moment. From what I understand they are working on decreasing that time but I’ve yet to see anything being done about it and it annoys me to have to wait that long for product! One other minor problem is if you’re sensitive these may not be good for you! I’ve heard many reviews stating that they have caused break outs on sensitive skin! I’ve never had a problem but I do not suffer from sensitive skin. That’s something to consider prior to ordering! Aside from that I highly recommend any of the wonderful Clown blends! You’ll see that Clowns aren’t as scary as you thought they were!

Basically what you see written on any one entry takes me a day or more to complete because I’m so nuts with work and life in general lately ? Reason I am telling you all this is I’m quite late displaying my latest Japanese Cosmetic Fall Haul! I got it ages ago and never had a chance to really take it out of the box and truly enjoy it aside from taking some pictures and doing a video of it AGES and AGES ago. I know MANY of you have already been exposed to the new Jill Stuart palettes, pressed blushes, etc…but I like to keep my blog updated with all my latest hauls so here goes anyway ? Hopefully it isn’t too much of a snore! Kose Airy Whip (The new love of my life! This could replace Purity for washing my make-up off in the evenings! It’s so light and lovely and removes all traces of my foundation, blusher, and eye makeup too!) Crystal Lash Pearls (These are great! An inexpensive way to enjoy lash pearls! Work just as well as Givenchy’s Lash Pearls!) Esprique Precious Gift Set (A real value! Tons of goodies for under $50) Esprique Precious Gift Set Illuminate Nuancer (Could possibly be better than Meteorites! Oops did I say that out loud? ) Canmake Goodies (Canmake is the one of the few inexpensive cosmetics that the Muse has room in her heart for!) Canmake Glitter Eyeliner Pencils (These are a bit to rough and hard in texture so hey may need to have a go under the hairdryer to soften them up prior to application) Canmake Lipgloss (Pretty brilliant! First Japanese brand that actually made a flavored gloss hehe) Canmake Glitter Shadow Trios Canmake Metallic Eyes Shadow Jill Stuart Brilliance Eyeshadow Palettes Fall 2007 (Both are gorgeous as you can see and the colors are surprisingly really nice! I was worried I’d never make any use out of these palettes but I’ve fallen in love) Jill Stuart Pressed Blush Compact (Bit sheer but haven’t tried them on my face as of yet) Jill Stuart Loose Powder Blush Majolica Majorca Single Eyeshadows Majolica Majorca Majex (This is going to work great during chapped lip season!) Tiffa Goodies (In love with Tiffa! This is my first haul from Tiffa and I’m loving the gloss and shadow) Tiffa Eyeshadow Duo Gransenbon Blushes Gransenbon Eyeshadow Palettes RMK Shadows RMK Cases Excel Single Shadows (LOVE these! So much sparkle and shimmer! Excel Mini Glitter Mascara Sofina Compact Case Fall 2007 (Best compact introduced yet in my humble opinion!) KATE Mascara Primer (Not entirely impressed with this yet! The fibers get caught in my lashes and are visible a bit which means I have to struggle to catch every fiber while applying mascara! Not sure I’m in love with this as much as I’d like to be!) KATE Lipgloss KATE and Lavshuca Super Sharp Eyeliner (Never seen a liquid liner with such a slim applicator!) Some presents from my angel!

"['Givenchy Fall Collection 2007 Prisme Again! Secret Blush Quartet Restocked By Isabella Muse on August 27, 2007 2 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , Givenchy If by slim chance you happened to have been struck by lighting or living under a rock and didn’t get a chance to order Givenchy’s newest blush you can safely set your lems to rest and run (really really really fast) as quickly as your little legs will carry you over to Sephora.com ! It appears the blush has been restocked and how long it remains available is anyone’s guess! But you can be sure the Muse ordered hers before she was shut out in the cold again yearning for a blush that’s been out of stock since first appearing on the site 3 weeks ago!

Beaute de Kose Star Twinkle Collection By Isabella Muse on August 23, 2007 16 Comments in Beaute de Kose , First Impressions , Hauls , Japanese Brands As you read in my prior blog one of my packages was lost for a few days! A majority of what was in the package wasn’t of much importance however these little gems were in that package and had me crying tears of joy when it finally popped back to me! Avast Ye! Behold! This be the treasure that was lost at sea! Beaute de Kose Star Twinkle Collection Star Twinkle Powder Umm..nothing to get too excited about here! Where’s the sparkle? The shimmer? The glitter? The shine? Did they make some sort of mistake? Was it lost with the package? The powder, as far as I can see and feel, has absolutely no sparkle to it at all! The twinkle has left the building. I’m seeing nothing in the way of glitter here! I’ve only swiped it very lightly but I can say confidently this may very well be a waste of money but it sure is pretty to look at isn’t it? Did I just contradict myself? Oops! This is a first impression but so far I’m a bit disappointed! The collection isn’t a total lost because I also got the Twinkle Cream shadows and these are fantastic! Bloody brilliant! Tons of shimmer, sparkle, and glittery bits are to be had! As I said before I don’t do cream shadows! But these come with my highest recommendation! The Muse loves ’em! She not only loves what’s inside but she’s loving the outside as well! The packaging is as sweet as candy! Personally if you’re a collector I’d go for the entire lot but if you’re just wanting to get one or two I’d go with the cream shadows and skip the powder! The purple and peach are nice colors but the real pudding is the gold, pink, and silver colors! Japense Cosmetics Goodies! By Isabella Muse on August 23, 2007 6 Comments in Hauls , Japanese Brands A little story behind this haul! I ordered these items about two weeks ago and they were shipped via EMS. Express shipping takes about 3-4 days to get from Asia to North America this translates as I blink and I have my items safely with me hehe! Sadly these little goodies got lost in the mail and I was beyond upset! After much dismay and thoughts that they’d never get to me I’m happy to say I have them in my hands! PHEW! Quite a nice few goodies to be had in this haul! Sana Shiny Mascara in Gold and Silver Comb Glitter Mascara that encrusts your lashes with sparkles! Yum! The Muse likey sparkles! Heroine Glitter Mascara God I love Kiss’s Heroine cosmetic line! How freaking cute is the advert on these? This is a heavy duty glitter mascara in pink! Encrusts your lashes with tons of glitter and sparkle! Oh la la! Sony Blackhead Oil Stick Hey Sony isn’t only good for electronics they also create a line of cosmetics in Japan! Cool right? This handy dandy little gadget is for rubbing on your nose! It promises that with a few strokes your blackheads will be erased! It works not so bad for a cheapie gimmicky product ? Pola Deep Cleaning Nose Mask, Cleansing Hot Gel, Deep Nose Wash Deep Cleaning Nose Mask works quite like the Body Shop’s Tea Tree Oil Mask . Apply a thin layer, wait till it drys, and rub off! I’ve been using it the past few days and haven’t noticed much difference in my blackheads! If possible the Sony Stick works better! Th Cleansing Hot Gel and Nose Wash I haven’t tried yet but very curious about both and somewhat worried since the Nose Mask was rubbish I have a funny feeling these will be too! Oh well! Comments? Questions? Got these items? Tell me what you think of ’em!']",02c308303f2e98e2b79385d09b4e51a784d5f8f3,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4284,

"['Makeup and Beauty Christmas Tree By Isabella Muse on November 10, 2016 8 Comments in Gift Ideas Affiliate I haven’t done so in a while but I love creating a makeup and beauty Christmas Trees for friends and family who enjoy makeup and skincare. Let me tell you creating a Makeup and Beauty Christmas Tree is so much easier than every before because there are SO many cute beauty ornaments to choose from. In the past, I used to have to hot glue ribbon to lipstick tubes to create ornaments! Nowadays, brands package up deluxe sizes of their most popular sizes and put them into tiny ornaments that have ribbon for hanging from a Christmas tree or to attached to a gift. I have a few different Holiday parties and for one of them I have a makeup and Christmas tree in my foyer. I allow my guests to choose one ornament from the tree at the end of the night. For my really good friends I used do an entire decorated tree that included all sorts of handmade beauty ornaments like mini mascaras, lipsticks, etc… Creating a Makeup and Beauty Christmas Tree is pretty easy! Here’s the deets! First you’ll obviously need a Christmas tree! You can get a mini one for as little as $12 to $20 on amazon.com ! You can go larger of course, but remember the larger you go the harder it is to gift the entire thing to your makeup loving friend. Now you’ll need lights! I have a fetish for fairy lights. I use them everywhere during the Holidays! I decorate my entire china cabinet with them around the Holidays, I wind them around centerpieces, etc…etc…add to the fact they have a timer and I’m a happy Muse! They are perfect for use on your mini beauty tree and you can get them in a wide variety of shades at amazon.com for $10 bucks! And the important part! This is the fun part! Makeup and beauty ornaments! There are so many different brands offering a variety of great little picks for your tree. Decorate it with items from Too Faced, It Cosmetics, Philosophy, and more! Each brand has unique Holiday ornaments that have a ribbon for hanging! There are mascaras to choose from, liquid lipsticks, perfumes, skincare, and so many other fun and fabulous makeup, beauty, and skincare ornaments that you can decorate your tree with which can be found at sephora.com , nordstrom.com , and ulta.com ! Beauty and makeup ornaments run anywhere from $10 to $15 each! My favorites can be found below. If you want to go cheaper you can grab yourself a hot glue gun, some fancy ribbon, and some cheaper products from NYX, Wet n Wild, and other drugstore brands and make your own ornaments! Turn on your JavaScript to view content Don’t forget the star to finish your Makeup and Beauty Christmas Tree! Now pop it somewhere in your home and allow your guests during the season to pick a lovely little treat from the tree. Or if you have someone special you can box the entire tree up, fully decorated, and gift it to your friend. I’ve done this for some of my closest friends and they were absolutely delighted with it.

"['Japense Cosmetics Goodies! By Isabella Muse on August 23, 2007 6 Comments in Hauls , Japanese Brands A little story behind this haul! I ordered these items about two weeks ago and they were shipped via EMS. Express shipping takes about 3-4 days to get from Asia to North America this translates as I blink and I have my items safely with me hehe! Sadly these little goodies got lost in the mail and I was beyond upset! After much dismay and thoughts that they’d never get to me I’m happy to say I have them in my hands! PHEW! Quite a nice few goodies to be had in this haul! Sana Shiny Mascara in Gold and Silver Comb Glitter Mascara that encrusts your lashes with sparkles! Yum! The Muse likey sparkles! Heroine Glitter Mascara God I love Kiss’s Heroine cosmetic line! How freaking cute is the advert on these? This is a heavy duty glitter mascara in pink! Encrusts your lashes with tons of glitter and sparkle! Oh la la! Sony Blackhead Oil Stick Hey Sony isn’t only good for electronics they also create a line of cosmetics in Japan! Cool right? This handy dandy little gadget is for rubbing on your nose! It promises that with a few strokes your blackheads will be erased! It works not so bad for a cheapie gimmicky product ? Pola Deep Cleaning Nose Mask, Cleansing Hot Gel, Deep Nose Wash Deep Cleaning Nose Mask works quite like the Body Shop’s Tea Tree Oil Mask . Apply a thin layer, wait till it drys, and rub off! I’ve been using it the past few days and haven’t noticed much difference in my blackheads! If possible the Sony Stick works better! Th Cleansing Hot Gel and Nose Wash I haven’t tried yet but very curious about both and somewhat worried since the Nose Mask was rubbish I have a funny feeling these will be too! Oh well! Comments?

"['Beaute de Kose Star Twinkle Collection By Isabella Muse on August 23, 2007 16 Comments in Beaute de Kose , First Impressions , Hauls , Japanese Brands As you read in my prior blog one of my packages was lost for a few days! A majority of what was in the package wasn’t of much importance however these little gems were in that package and had me crying tears of joy when it finally popped back to me! Avast Ye! Behold! This be the treasure that was lost at sea! Beaute de Kose Star Twinkle Collection Star Twinkle Powder Umm..nothing to get too excited about here! Where’s the sparkle? The shimmer? The glitter? The shine? Did they make some sort of mistake? Was it lost with the package? The powder, as far as I can see and feel, has absolutely no sparkle to it at all! The twinkle has left the building. I’m seeing nothing in the way of glitter here! I’ve only swiped it very lightly but I can say confidently this may very well be a waste of money but it sure is pretty to look at isn’t it? Did I just contradict myself? Oops! This is a first impression but so far I’m a bit disappointed! The collection isn’t a total lost because I also got the Twinkle Cream shadows and these are fantastic! Bloody brilliant! Tons of shimmer, sparkle, and glittery bits are to be had! As I said before I don’t do cream shadows! But these come with my highest recommendation! The Muse loves ’em! She not only loves what’s inside but she’s loving the outside as well! The packaging is as sweet as candy! Personally if you’re a collector I’d go for the entire lot but if you’re just wanting to get one or two I’d go with the cream shadows and skip the powder! The purple and peach are nice colors but the real pudding is the gold, pink, and silver colors! You may also enjoy...

"['Bobbi Brown Metallics Collection By Isabella Muse on September 4, 2007 21 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Fall Collections 2007 , First Impressions Bobbi Brown’s Fall Eye Palette Collection are out and available for purchase this week. I believe that I had sworn myself off Bobbi Brown for the rest of this lifetime and my next one after my fiasco with the Sand and Surf Palette (go on click it you’ll see the drama I mean)! But it seems that I’m a glutton for punishment because I decided that I’d just have a tiny sneaky peek at these new palettes when I was breezing through Nordies , I do that occasionally, breeze through department stores, I’m that fabulous! Where was I? Oh ya, Bobbi Brown! Yours truly wasn’t happy enough sneaking a tiny peek! The Muse got a bad case of Limited Edition anxiety and ended up purchasing 3 of the 4 palettes (she wants the fourth by the way). So the sales girl sold me some gimmick that these are tripled pigmented. I’ve never heard of anything being tripled pigmented but ok it sounds good to me that must mean I need these right? Obviously that was the case because I walked out out of the store swinging a $150 bag of palettes! Somebody stop me please! All in all I have to say that these are pretty brilliant. I think this is Bobbi Brown’s apology to me for the crummy Sand and Surf . I’ve come to the conclusion she may have just realized how it truly sucked and decided she must redeem herself in the Muse’s eyes thus she created the Metallics Collection. Ok first of all these may very well be tripled pigmented. These have some heavy duty color going on here. Color so bright, vibrant and eye popping that one swipe of my brush is all I need, no going back for second swipes! Secondly, if you’re insane for shimmer, these are the palettes for you! Highly, intensely shimmer packed! I’m talking fall out all over your cheeks and face! The SA I spoke to said apply the shadow prior to my foundation because I’d need some serious clean up time with these! And she is indeed right! These have to be applied super carefully to avoid a ton of chunky shadow falling all over your face! These are really an interesting texture. Very thick for a shadow but also loose. It’s almost as if the shadow was a loose pigment and pressed into the palette. As soon as you swipe a brush across a color it comes away with a ton of loose powder! I haven’t really used these yet on my eyes just swatched them on my hand and all in all I have to say these are a big thumbs up for me! If you’re currently looking for the perfect Fall palette I’d totally nab one or two of these. The good news is the Muse approves and gives them a big fat recommendation for purchase. The bad news is these are costly as hell at $45 per palette! I personally recommend all four if you have the spare change hanging around but if you don’t I recommend going with either Forest Metallics or Burnt Sugar Metallics. Burnt Sugar is probably the most versatile. It has a really good solid gold in it that can be used with just about anything you currently have. Of course the entire point is to use the palette’s three colors but you can easily take any of the three colors and use them with single shadows you may have. This palette is quite interesting to pair up with browns, golds, and even oranges or peaches! The other two I got were the Forest Metallics and Midnight Metallics. Now the Velvet Plum palette is a mystery to me as it looked almost identical to the Burnt Sugar except darker. I didn’t notice any plum in it just brown, brown, and more brown! I’m still tempted to purchase it as that weird Pokemon feeling comes across me with cosmetics. You know the feeling right? Have to collect them all! Well..I leave you with some pictures and a first impression! I’ll get around to doing a deeper review when I used them on a full eye look plus do some FOTD’s ! Forest Metallics Midnight Metallics Burnt Sugar Metallics MAC Blue Storm Haul By Isabella Muse on September 4, 2007 13 Comments in First Impressions , MAC Finally Blue Storm has arrived! I went to purchase this color story with Smoke Signals but sadly it wasn’t available at the time as the stock hadn’t come in! My MA offered to ship it my way as soon as it came and little did I know that it’d take nearly two weeks to arrive! SIGH! It did get here and I’m happy to have my greedy hands all over it! I didn’t bother getting any of the lipglasses or nail varnish with the collection. I just headed straight for the shadows and liners. Personally I think the gold was in the shadows and liners but I know a few people were pretty impressed with the polishes! The liners are quite outstanding colors and I think with both, Smoke Signals, and Blue Storm, they out did themselves in the eyeliner department! The shadows are all fantastic and the only shadow that I’m iffy on is Cumulus. The rest are really vibrant and perfect for rainy day blues ? Cloudburst has to be my favorite of the lot. It reminds me of Black Tied but with a bit of fine blue shimmer too it! Very nice shadow and well worth picking up! Overall another great collection from MAC! Your impressions? Did you get anything from Blue Storm? Talk to me! Comment box at the ready! Tarte EmphasEYES High Definition Eye Pencil Review By Isabella Muse on September 4, 2007 Leave a Comment in Fall Collections 2007 , Tarte I blogged about this previously when I happened across it in the Sephora Fall Catalog . I was generally curious about it so I decided to take the plunge and purchase this vastly overpriced eye pencil. Basically this is a nifty little tool for lining your waterline. I haven’t tried using it on anything but my waterline as that’s basically what this particularly liner is for. I guess if you wanted to get the most bang for your buck you could go ahead and line your entire eye with it but I haven’t ventured onto that path. It’s super skinny so I’m positive it’ll make a wonderfully thin line. The pencil itself is very slim so it fits right in all the nooks and crannies that you want it to. I struggled with it for about 10 minutes when I originally removed it from the packaging. I couldn’t get the pencil to twist it up and just sat there debating whether to return it or fling it out the window as it had me so damn frustrated that it wouldn’t rotate up! Finally I got it to twist up! As I said earlier I only used it for lining the waterline of my eye and it works a treat. The slimness of the pencil makes it a snap to work with it and one swipe will have your entire waterline done up quickly and easily. On the pro side it’s a great little tool to add to your beauty arsenal for making lining your delicate and sensitive inner eye area easy as 1, 2, 3. On the con side, at $18 per pencil the price just doesn’t sit right. Indeed it does make lining the waterline really a snap but not so much more than any other pencil you might have laying around such as MAC Technakohl. So really do you need this? I’d say no. Have some spare cash hanging around? Grab one it’s kinda sorta a nifty tool! Overall the Muse likes it but doesn’t deem it a must have! The Weekend Beauty Shopper By Isabella Muse on August 31, 2007 5 Comments in Lancome , Lavshuca , Majolica Majorca , Philosophy , Steals and Deals I’m away this weekend but I do believe taking a second out of my busy schedule to type up this Weekend’s Steals and Deals is always in order!

Lavshuca Single Eyeshadows are $8.80 Majolica Majorca eyeshadows are available for $8 Sadly colors are extremely limited but if you have a hardcore lemming these are a pretty ok deal! They aren’t jacked up too much price wise compared to the original price of $5 or so each Japan side! If I were you and I was in a bit of a shopping mood I’d click my mouse over to Drugstore.com and take advantage of the sale they have! $5 off $30 plus free shipping or $10 off $50 plus free shipping Drugstore.com is also having a Buy 1 Get 1 Free Sale which can be combined with the above deals (You’ll find a few goodies in this sale!

Lush Cosmetic’s Newest Haircare Line Up By Isabella Muse on August 29, 2007 Leave a Comment in Haircare , Lush Lush has always had a good solid haircare line! You’ve heard me babble some about the shampoo bars already but Lush also carries other shampoos and conditioners that I swear by as well! I was happy to hear that Lush will be expanding it’s haircare line and introducing not only new haircare but some styling items as well! This is a big step for Lush as they have had no prior styling products to boast of prior to these! I’m very curious how they will turn out! First up is Curly Wurly! Hmmm good news for the Muse as her hair is wavy and full of curls! Lush’s description of Curly Wurly Shampoo: This thick and rich marvel is so unlike any other shampoo that your hair will think it?s discovered a parallel universe, one where curls soften, relax and shine on command. Amazingly enough, we make it all happen without preservatives! Coconut butter, cocoa butter, avocado butter and jojoba oil control curls, weigh the hair down and smooth hair follicles. Shredded coconut aids in application and synthetic polymers are replaced by free-range eggs while lemons and papaya add extra cleansing and shine. Available early October. Next up a new conditioner of sorts entitled Jasmine & Henna Fluff Eaze! The name alone sold it for the Muse. Anything that contains the word “fluff” in it makes me want it all the more! Lush description for this new Fluffy product: Jasmine & Henna Fluff Eaze makes really fluffy hair smooth and encourages normal hair to behave. Henna infusion adds loads of shine and moisture, but it won?t change your color (even if it?s color-treated). Brazil nut oil and olive oil add even more shine, calm fluffiness and give control to the ends without taking all the life out of it. You?ll find this hair treatment detangles, stops static and helps prevent your hair from tying itself in knots. What?s more, the effects last for weeks! Best of all, the lovely scent of jasmine wafts around you like moonlit evenings in a Moroccan garden. Available early October. Now these have the Muse intrigued! All natural hair gels! The Big Tease The Big Tease can stand your hair straight up without feeling brittle — all with a texture a bit like glue (but in a good way). It?s loaded with natural, good-for-your-hair ingredients like glycerin for softer texture and cupua?u butter (pronounced: coo-poo-a-soo) from the Amazon rainforest. This acts a bit like lanolin, which means excellent conditioning that?s all vegan! You?ll be delighted when you sniff this gel too. It has the same refreshing (and very popular) fragrance as The Olive Branch shower gel, with orange flower, lemon and bergamot. Tease it high! Available early October Goth Juice Fans of The Mighty Boosh (a British cult comedy TV show) will be aware that real Goth Juice is made with the tears of Robert Smith. (That?s why it?s purple.) If you have no idea what we?re talking about, that?s cool, just take it from us that our Goth Juice is a medium-strength gel to hold and style your hair without drying it out. Glycerin, hemp and flaxseed oils nurture, strengthen and in general, take good care of your hair — even when they join forces to double the size of your head. It has a beautiful, dark green-forest scent of oakmoss and olibanum. Available early October. Holy cow the Muse definately wants this! She loves the Mighty Boosh and dare ye all who question her about it and know not of it’s origins! Off with your bloody heads for not being exposed to bloody brilliant britcom! Sadly this is also an earthy blend which means maybe the name and concept sounds brilliant but the general idea of oakmoss and other green bits aren’t what the Muse prefers her hair to smell like! Le sigh! How very depressing that Goth Juice doesn’t smell fruity! And lastly in the hair management department…. King of Mods This soft-hold gel takes soft, fluffy hair, controls it and makes it look cool. It shines hair, moisturizes it and holds it softly in place no matter the adventure. Like Mods themselves, it?s controlled but not hard. It?s also good for your scalp with eight percent almond oil and camellia oil (the one that Sumo wrestlers use to keep their long, black hair shiny). King of the Mods is perfumed with grapefruit and lime essential oils to wake you up in the morning and revive you for an after-work party (think Swinging London of the ?60s). Party on! Available early October. Overall looks like a nice little line up of additions to Lush’s already supremely awesome haircare line! I want to try the gels for sure and Curly Wurly is definately going to end up in my cart! Reviews to come when I buy some of these bits and pieces! MAC Stylistics Color Collection By Isabella Muse on August 28, 2007 2 Comments in Fragrance , Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 It’s the most wonderful time of the year! It appears MAC has quite a gorgeous collection in the works for us this Holiday season! Rumors are abound and everywhere the Muse looks some new information is popping up about the latest “It” collection from MAC! This could have the potential to be HUGE, as in the best collection I’ve seen released from MAC in quite a while! The collection won’t be out until November 29th but it hasn’t stopped the spread of rumors, speculation, and general chitchat about this exciting limited edition color story! Here’s what the Muse has gleaned so far from her travels through cyberspace: Check out Beyond Beauty Basics for an interesting little article about the collection! Not only is there a new Holiday color story to look forward to but a limited edition fragrance entitled Air of Style that will be released as well! From what I’m reading the scent will be extremely limited and once it’s gone it’s gone! The total collection is gem encrusted so these should be some pretty gorgeous compacts ala MAC Couture from last year! Which brings up another topic! I am wondering if this is similar to Couture’s release last year. Couture was released something in November I believe and than soon after Formal Black popped up! I’m wandering if Stylistics is merely a tease and prelude to the real Holiday color story! We shall see! Some interesting little photos of what could possibly be part of the collection have cropped up! The moral of the story is save your pennies because come November you’ll be flat broke after purchasing some of this collection! I’m already shaking in my designer flats! My very tiny collection of MAC Couture from last year: Chat and Be Happy! By Isabella Muse on August 28, 2007 3 Comments in Babbling Bits I have so much fun talking to each and everyone of you! I love replying to your emails, messages, and comments! It really brightens my day up! I know that sometimes I take a while to reply to some messages but I do my best to always answer everyone! I’ve decided to add a little chat room to my blog! If you scroll down the page a little and look towards your right hand side on my blog you’ll see a little button that says “Click to Chat”. If you click it (be sure your browser has popups disabled otherwise it won’t work) a little chat room will pop up and you can chat with each other or me if I am online at the moment! You’ll notice it lists the numbers of chatters but I don’t think this updates correctly so if it reads 0 chatters still pop your head in because it’s likely myself or someone will be in the room since it doesn’t appear to be updating correctly! I’ll be doing a schedule (when I have some free time) for live chat nights if anyone is interested so we can gather together and babble our hearts out about cosmetics, life, the universe, and everything ? I will, of course, leave the chatroom up and running when I am online so that if you happen to wander on you can say hello to me! Many thanks for all your comments it makes doing these blogs a pure joy! I look forward to talking to each and everyone of you! Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab Halloween Blends By Isabella Muse on August 27, 2007 5 Comments in Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab , Fall Collections 2007 , Fragrance With the new moon comes new perfume blends and of course it comes right on time to compliment tomorrow’s lunar eclipse! The goblins have been mighty busy at the Lab and have concocted an array of scary little treats to make your blood curl! The Trading Post has been equally busy creating it’s Halloween Trick or Treat perfume oil blends as well! I explained the Lab in a prior blog do check it out prior to reading this one! I believe I’m shivering with fright…errr…I mean excitement at the prospect of all the goodies that await us at the Lab this Halloween season! The Newest Halloween Blends are cut into three categories. The first which is simply entitled “Halloween Blends”. Lucky enough for me nothing is too appealing on this list as most of the blends are very earthy, herbal, or floral blends! If you’re the type of girl that loves a dark scent this category be for you! All Souls 2007 All Souls makes a reappearance year after year and of course each year it has a tiny touch of difference from the year before as no two scents are created equal! The Lab describes it as An incense blend that invokes the higher qualities of mercy and compassion, mingled with the soft, sugared currant scent of offertory soul cakes. Bonfire Night Bonfire Night is an entirely new blend for the Lab and has never been introduced prior to this year! The Lab describes it as Beer, woodsmoke, tar, and treacle. The Death of Autumn Another new blend! The Lab describes it as Dark amber, dead leaves, khus, saffron, bitter clove, chrysanthemum, camellia, galangal, and a drop of oud. Dia De Los Muertos 2007 (Day of the Dead) A blend that makes an appearance almost ever year and revisits to torture and torment! The Lab describes it as funeral bouquets, the candies, chocolates, foods and tobacco of the ofrenda, amaranth, sweet cactus blossom and desert cereus. October Yet another new blend! The Lab describes it as Dry, cold autumn wind. A rustle of red leaves, a touch of smoke and sap in the air. Samhain 2007 Another old friend that visits almost ever year! The Lab describes it as damp woods, fir needle, and black patchouli with the gentlest touches of warm pumpkin, clove, nutmeg, allspice, sweet red apple and mullein. Samhainiphobia 2007 Again, a visitor from the past that is knock knock knocking at our chamber door ! The Lab describes it as Menacing Haitian vetiver, patchouli, and clove with a shock of bourbon geranium, grim oakmoss, and dread-inspiring balsams pierce the innocuous scent of autumn leaves. Sugar Skull 2007 Last but never least in my book another old friend that the Muse purchases each and every year….The Lab describes it as A blend of five sugars, lightly dusted with candied fruits. Personally I’ll only be purchasing Sugar Skull 2007 from this lot the others are way too dark, earthy, and generally gross smelling to my nose! The second category is entitled Halloween Blends: The Haunted House. This category appeals very little to me as well sadly but hey…money saved! All blends in this collection are brand new and have never been released prior to this year! The Atrocious Attic Described as sugared nectar of carnivorous blooms, putrefying wet greenery, oozing sap, crushed rosary peas, withered climbing roses, and nightshade berries. The Lurid Library Described as The incense-tinged scent of forbidden tomes and the musk-laden remnants of infernal servants. The Perilous Parlor Described as soft white pear and sweet vanilla. The Twisted Oak Tree Described as Blackened, rotted oak wood blanketed in moss and choked by a cloak of grasping ivy. Lastly an old favorite of mine The Pumpkin Patch 2007 Set! As described in another blog of mine this is a great little set if you’ve never tried anything from Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab perfume! The blends in this set are truly a lovely little piece of Halloween and Fall! Some of these are revisited in a different format than prior blends and I’m not entirely sure if I am going to enjoy these variations as some sound a bit floral! The Pumpkins can be purchased together as a set or solely. They include the following perfume oil blends: Pumpkin I Pumpkin with pear, white wine grapes, and jasmine-laced tea. Pumpkin II Pumpkin with tobacco, champa flower, carnation, and tonka. Pumpkin III Pumpkin with white chocolate, caramel, pomegranate, and cream. Pumpkin IV Pumpkin with cactus blossom, sage, and sweetgrass. Pumpkin V Pumpkin wi th benzoin, bourbon vanilla, lemon peel, neroli, blood orange, and red ginger. If you purchase the pumpkins as a set they’ll also include an imp of a special oil entitled the Murder of Crows. The Lab describes it as Sleek iris and verbena, grey amber, benzoin, davana, and glossy herbs. The Halloween Blends are on sale and available for order up until November 10th. They will be than taken down and may or may not return next year as blends do change and rotate year to year! I’m excited that the Lab’s Trading Post has brought back it’s Trick or Treat Limited Edition perfume blends! These are something the muse wants to get her hands on! The Tricks aren’t as appealing as the Treats so the Muse really wants to get her hands on some Treats! The Treats Sugar-slathered Candied Apple With a dollop of caramel! Marshmallow Poof A gooey mound of white fluffiness! And yes, it is vegan! Pumpkin Cheesecake Graham crackery and cream cheesy! Cinnamon brown sugary! Just a little carroty! The Tricks Egg’d Mailbox! Fresh egg, just starting to warm nicely in the sun! Pumpkin Smash! Pumpkin pulp, beeswax candles, smoke, asphalt, and beer! TP’d Trees! Cypress, oak, and pine covered in 2-ply! And finally a special edition that’s neither trick or treat! Spiked Punch Chunky fruit punch with a generous splash of booze! These are on sale until October 10th and the chances of a revisit are slim to zero so get them while the going is good! Meaning they are highly limited edition! It appears the Lab is boiling up tons of goodies in it’s cauldron for this upcoming Halloween!']",e492ecd9fb50270d0100bfe05a870e63add92210,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4282,
"['Better Late Than Never: Japanese Cosmetic Fall Haul By Isabella Muse on August 27, 2007 23 Comments in Hauls , Japanese Brands , Jill Stuart , KATE , Majolica Majorca , MuseTV , Raycious I’ve been very busy lately and updating my blog normally happens either really, really, really late at night, during brief pauses at work if I am even remotely lucky to have any, or in spurts here and there. Basically what you see written on any one entry takes me a day or more to complete because I’m so nuts with work and life in general lately ? Reason I am telling you all this is I’m quite late displaying my latest Japanese Cosmetic Fall Haul! I got it ages ago and never had a chance to really take it out of the box and truly enjoy it aside from taking some pictures and doing a video of it AGES and AGES ago. I know MANY of you have already been exposed to the new Jill Stuart palettes, pressed blushes, etc…but I like to keep my blog updated with all my latest hauls so here goes anyway ? Hopefully it isn’t too much of a snore! Kose Airy Whip (The new love of my life! This could replace Purity for washing my make-up off in the evenings! It’s so light and lovely and removes all traces of my foundation, blusher, and eye makeup too!) Crystal Lash Pearls (These are great! An inexpensive way to enjoy lash pearls! Work just as well as Givenchy’s Lash Pearls!) Esprique Precious Gift Set (A real value! Tons of goodies for under $50) Esprique Precious Gift Set Illuminate Nuancer (Could possibly be better than Meteorites! Oops did I say that out loud? ) Canmake Goodies (Canmake is the one of the few inexpensive cosmetics that the Muse has room in her heart for!) Canmake Glitter Eyeliner Pencils (These are a bit to rough and hard in texture so hey may need to have a go under the hairdryer to soften them up prior to application) Canmake Lipgloss (Pretty brilliant! First Japanese brand that actually made a flavored gloss hehe) Canmake Glitter Shadow Trios Canmake Metallic Eyes Shadow Jill Stuart Brilliance Eyeshadow Palettes Fall 2007 (Both are gorgeous as you can see and the colors are surprisingly really nice! I was worried I’d never make any use out of these palettes but I’ve fallen in love) Jill Stuart Pressed Blush Compact (Bit sheer but haven’t tried them on my face as of yet) Jill Stuart Loose Powder Blush Majolica Majorca Single Eyeshadows Majolica Majorca Majex (This is going to work great during chapped lip season!) Tiffa Goodies (In love with Tiffa! This is my first haul from Tiffa and I’m loving the gloss and shadow) Tiffa Eyeshadow Duo Gransenbon Blushes Gransenbon Eyeshadow Palettes RMK Shadows RMK Cases Excel Single Shadows (LOVE these! So much sparkle and shimmer! Excel Mini Glitter Mascara Sofina Compact Case Fall 2007 (Best compact introduced yet in my humble opinion!) KATE Mascara Primer (Not entirely impressed with this yet! The fibers get caught in my lashes and are visible a bit which means I have to struggle to catch every fiber while applying mascara! Not sure I’m in love with this as much as I’d like to be!) KATE Lipgloss KATE and Lavshuca Super Sharp Eyeliner (Never seen a liquid liner with such a slim applicator!) Some presents from my angel!

"[""Victoria’s Secret Heavenly Face Palettes Fall Collection By Isabella Muse on September 10, 2007 5 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , First Impressions , Victoria's Secret If you remember not so long ago I was bragging about how delightful I found Victoria’s Secret latest cosmetic offerings ( Clickie for the previous blog entry). I was pretty chuffed with what they had introduced this Spring and Summer and now I must say that I’m happy once again with the palettes they have released for the Fall. Prior to these I had purchased the Heavenly Face Eye Shadow Quad and couldn’t rave enough about how cute, pigmented, gorgeous, and girly it was. I had a Doctor’s appointment today and I happened to wander into Victoria’s Secret because I had about 2 minutes to spare and I came across the latest Eye Shadow Quad and deemed it a must have! My little eye spotted the duo blush and I had to have it as well! I left the store feeling quite content that I nabbed two gorgeous palettes weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Dontcha love palettes? Both are Limited Edition palettes so get ’em while the getting is good! I find these palettes sell out pretty darn fast at Victoria’s Secret and I’d rather nab them in store than online because paying shipping on top of the price tag of $22 each is a bit obscene! If by chance you are unable to locate these they are most definately available online and I notice they sell out at a slower rate than in stores so it’s a second choice if your lemming comes on hard! I ended up getting a kinda good deal on these as I had a $10 coupon so I got both for around $34 plus taxes, not too bad. These new palettes come in a really blinged out box compared to the prior boring box of Spring/Summer. One is a gold glitter/shimmer box and the other is a pink glitter/shimmer box. I love the packaging this time around and will definately keep the boxes and store the palettes in ’em as the box is to darn pretty too toss out! As with the Spring/Summer palette the shadow and now the blush too has a cute gold shimmer design imprinted on each shadow and blush. This time it’s a little twirl and prior it was a cute star shape (you’ll see what I mean in the pictures below). The actual palette case is vastly different from the previous release. It now has the words “Heavenly Face” in script across the case where as the prior release had only a simple design on the cover. I like both actually and think they are super nice either way! The colors in the eyeshadow quad are very fall this time around. A shimmering dark brown, a shimmering gold, a shimmering beige/nude, and a shimmering bronze are included. The blush duo has a pale shimmering pink color and a darker shimmering pink. You can use them separately or together, personally I think the lighter pink color may be to sheer for my skin tone but I haven’t yet tried it that’s only based on looking at it not actually testing it. Sadly I couldn’t swipe any of these in store as the testers were behind a glass cube. Overall these are definately impressive. Victoria’s Secret shocks me somewhat as they have come such a long way with their cosmetic line. These are truly cute and girly to the max! I’m loving ’em! The Muse says go get ’em before they sell out! Here is the Spring/Summer Palette on the left hand side and the New Fall Palette! I’m loving the new packaging! Again the Spring/Summer Palette is on the left and features a design on the case of the palette while the newest Fall palette has the imprint “Heavenly Faces” on it! Color comparisons between the two palettes! The Spring/Summer (On the left again) palette had more vibrant, bold colors while the Fall palette gives us colors that are just as vibrant and bold but more geared towards the upcoming Autumn! Minimal Muse By Isabella Muse on September 10, 2007 14 Comments in Face of the Day Hello World, Have you missed me? Here I am minus my face! How very daring of me! No foundation, no lipgloss, no blush, *gasp* *shocked outrage* Normally I don’t go out of the house foundation-less but lately I’m been somewhat minimal to say the least. So this be the Muse minus her normal triple layer of eye make-up I’m not one for posting pics without makeup but I was feeling very daring tonight! Flaws and all for you to view! Be friendly with your comments hehe! Urban Decay Liners Update By Isabella Muse on September 10, 2007 Leave a Comment in Urban Decay A-Ha! The Muse has been tricked! The Urban Decay liners that I had mentioned in a previous post are NOT new items they are just repackaged. I’m quite a fan of UD but I never once took notice of their liners prior to them popping up in the new packaging! Ow well! The Muse does like the new packaging if that accounts for anything! Thanks to the Muse’s mate Erica, at Make-Up Bag, for clearing up this little mystery! L.A.M.B. By Isabella Muse on September 10, 2007 Leave a Comment in Fashion Mmm… L.A.M.B. opened at New York Fashion Week with a BANG! I’ve read article upon article upon article about how brilliant the new line up is. So maybe this is going to turn into a minor rant…. I can’t appreciate anything that L.A.M.B. puts out. I’ve surfed onto the site for the past two years and can’t really say I ever seen a single piece of couture that appealed to me (minus Harajuku Lovers from this equation because I really enjoy that line of kawaii goodies). Granted none of it will fit the Muse’s curvy body however that’s never stopped me from enjoying the look of high end fashion! First of all I should say I think that Gwen Stefani is one classy lady! Her sense of style is fantastic and I’ve never seen the girl look anything but absolutely chic and fabulous! She’s uber talented, amazingly beautiful, and in the cool kid book for me! But…her fashion line doesn’t have me bouncing from the ceilings in excitement. Gulp. This is hard to say…. but… Even the shoes aren’t all that fab. The entire concept of the brand which is inspired by a mad mix of Jamaican rastafarians, English school girls and Orange County teenages sounds like it could result in some awesome, flashy fashion! However, it falls short of the mark for me. I’m not entirely sure what everyone is getting so hyped about. To be fair I know I’m basing part of this rant on her website over the course of the last two years or so. To backup my rant I googled around to locate images from the new line up that was displayed at fashion week that everyone is finding so exciting and brilliant and Gwen Stefani is a God in the fashion industry, etc…etc…(maybe I made the God part up but it sounded good for effect)… Well I came across quite a few tidbits and again, not so impressed. I can’t really get excited about a line that has a lamb advertising the clothing. Since I’m on the advertising end doesn’t L.A.M.B. stand for Love, Angel, Music, Baby? This obviously means that Gwen was sorta kinda in a frame of mind promoting her latest CD at the time this “couture” (I use the term loosely) line was introduced. Ok I guess my rant is over. I don’t personally mean to attack the line but I just can’t take this all seriously and I’m somewhat shocked that it’s gotten the publicity it has and has opened with raving reviews. In my world it’s somehow like introducing Mary Kate and Ashley’s Walmart clothing lines on a New York Fashion Runway. That’s my 2 cents of the day! What’s your take? Am I being too harsh? Talk to me! Tarts: The Art of Home Fragrance By Isabella Muse on September 5, 2007 Leave a Comment in Fragrance So………… How many of you know what tarts are? The Muse indulges in masses and masses and masses of tarts to scent her home and indulge her sweet tooth minus the calories! Love ’em? Hate ’em? Want to hear more about ’em?

Survival Beauty By Isabella Muse on September 13, 2007 9 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Beauty Secrets I think, as a woman, I’ve asked myself the question, “What items would I need if I were stranded on a deserted island?”, a million times! You must ask yourself this too or have had a friend ask you what three or four items would you ABSOLUTELY need if you could have nothing else with you! Well..I’d answer…I need a stunning man (or two ) to climb trees for me and gather coconuts, and fish, and do all that manly stuff because I’m a delicate ladeeee ! And I’d also need a few beauty items. Sadly I’m unable to give you a list of three or four items I absolutely have to have because really I’d be lying if I said the list was that bloody short! Knowing me I’d need a u-haul truck full of cosmetics, skincare, and general girlish rubbish to keep me content on a deserted tropical island! I don’t give one flying leap it’s paradise! I need cosmetics damnit and I need them now! If I’m without I might as well jump into the ocean and perish! But have no fear I don’t have to go through such drastic measures as that! Victoria Jackson is here to save the day! If the ship was sinking and the rescue boats were waiting to whisk me to the deserted island in wait of help I’d grab up my Victoria Jackson Survival Kit and call it a day! YAY I can be fabulous and stranded! The Survival Kit is by far the coolest little gadget the Muse has set eyes on. The Muse likes nifty gadgets it must be the geek in her! Flip up the top and an eye pencil, lip pencil, and mascara await you! Split the kit open and two blushes and a mirror are on one side. Flip over the blush tray and another mirror (in case you didn’t feel fabulous looking at yourself in the first one!) and 5 lipcreams are at the ready to make you gorgeous! Slide the tray out on the side and 2 trays of 5 shimmering shadows (10 in total) are here to make your eyelids sparkle with color! Slip the tray out on the opposite side and a blush brush, shadow brush, and lip brush are enclosed to put your face on! How freaking cool is this? Thanks Victoria! We beauty junkies needed this! Might the Muse add that this is the perfect little treat to take with you on trips! With all the rigid airline rules in place I get very nervous packing my precious cosmetic items for fear they’ll be broken or taken away! Pack this up and I’d say you’re good to go and look elegant at the same time! The Muse Proudly Joins The Beauty Blog Network By Isabella Muse on September 12, 2007 13 Comments in Babbling Bits , Pieces of Life I know I know I know! I already posted this!

"['Spring Cleaning Updates By Isabella Muse on March 24, 2008 8 Comments in Babbling Bits , Miscellaneous Blogging Good Morning Lovies! Happy Monday! You may (or may not) have noticed that Musings has undergone a few minor changes. One important change for me was having a new domain name setup. You can now find Musings of a Muse at it’s new address, www.musingsofamuse.com! Yay! Exciting! If you by chance link me on your site if you could please as a personal favor to me update your link to reflect the change I’d be extremely grateful! Secondly, you’ll notice my layout changed a tiny bit. I felt like my three columns were a bit cluttered so I now have a column on the left and a column on the right and finally my posts are smack in the middle! Thirdly, I’ve added a cbox off to the right hand side of my column which you can use to comment randomly or just to say hey! I have a few ads up as well! If you find these irritating do let me know and I’ll try to come up with something else as I never want Musings to be about “commercial” or “corporate”. That’s not my aim with Musings at all so if you feel overwhelmed by ads you should tell me and I’ll do everything I can to reduce the clutter so you can have the content you come here for! I’ve temporarily moved my live chat room. I know it’s been ages since I held a live chat but I promise I’ll be adding it up soon and having a live chat ? A few items that are upcoming as you know are the Musings forum and some podcasts as well! That’s about it! I hope you’re as excited as I am about the changes! Maybe they’ll make your life a bit easier too when browsing around here as I believe it’s better organized now! Much Love and Hugs, From your Muse. You may also enjoy...

Plenty of treats full of sugar, fat, and high calories! Hmmm….avoid the calories and treat yourself (and your lips) to some tasty balms instead! Vintage Sister has introduced it’s Halloween lip balms and the Muse couldn’t be more excited! It’s a great round up this year with the Muse’s ever favorite Candy Corn flavored balm! Yums!

Yay for giftsets! The first to pop up are these 24/7 Travel Size Eye Liner Sets. How darling are these?

Urban Decay promises more of these great sets so keep your eyes peeled this Holiday Season to see what pops up! Do grab these while the grabbing is good as they are promising these will sell out fast! Maggie Gyllenhaal’s Agent Provocateur Layout By Isabella Muse on September 18, 2007 11 Comments in Agent Provocateur , Fashion Love Agent Provocateur . Not sure I love the Maggie Gyllenhaal layout. Hmmm…. Maybe I can’t appreciate these correctly but I’m seeing her as too much of a good girl in these pictures (contrary to how bad she can be). Not that she doesn’t look amazingly beautiful and super classy! I’m just seeing more of “I’m a good girl” in her facial expression. Hell, when you are wearing naughtiness from Agent Provocateur shouldn’t you have the “I’m a very BAD BAD BAD girl” on your face? Maybe it’s not even a good girl expression but more a sorta “who cares” feel too it…mmm…dunno just not doing it for me! What do you think? UPDATE: AHA! Maggie brings the “I’m bad” in this picture: Image Source Too Faced The Gift of Glam Holiday Collection By Isabella Muse on September 18, 2007 1 Comment in Holiday Collections 2007 , Too Faced , Winter Collections 2007 Well…geez….School just started, the leaves aren’t yet hitting the ground, and the warm weather is JUST turning a bit cooler.

Yum! $32.50 Mark ""Customize Your Shimmer"" Palettes By Isabella Muse on September 18, 2007 Leave a Comment in Fall Collections 2007 , Mark Mark is releasing some interesting little tidbits that may tempt the Muse into purchasing them! I’m not much of an Avon fan but I have been known to sneak a few pieces of Avon’s hipper, younger sister company, into my traincase! These look awesome: These are interchangeable, customizable shimmer palettes for face and eyes! From what I’ve read they are being introduced sometime in November so keep your eyes peeled for updates! I like the look of all the palettes and Mark is so cheap that you can afford to dive in and pick up the entire lot if your little heart so desired it! Customizable pieces like these are nothing new to Mark . They carry a slew of different interchangeable pieces on their website which range from shadow palettes to lipcreams, etc…. The thing that caught my eyes about these is of course those magic words that every girl loves, “shimmer”. One thing does bother me about these, the release date of November seems ages away and the colors seem very Fall to me. The general idea of a release day all the way in November for colors you’ll be wearing for about a month seems silly. I’d have liked to see these on the site already or even at the very least in the beginning of October! Oh well I guess that only applies to anal people like me that adjust eyeshadow color with the seasons and all that insanity ? Estimate on prices from past collections I’d say these will run about $4 for the pop in and the empty palettes maybe $6 bucks each, I’d bet money that they’ll be even cheaper on E-bay! Happy Days!']",bdb9d326e49c82fa3f16813180990c8cb70d5ce4,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4275,
"[""T’estimo’s Demise, Coffret D’Or Uprise! By Isabella Muse on September 18, 2007 4 Comments in Friends , Japanese Brands , T'estimo If you’re as much a fan as Japanese cosmetics as I am you’ll know that Kanebo is cutting T’estimo from it’s main line up and replacing it with a new line entitled Coffret D’Or. I’m mourning T’estimo in a major way! If you’d like a sneak peak at Coffret D’Or do head on over to my good friend Iris’s blog to see some great pics of the new line! The new line does look interesting enough but I’m still not completely convinced! Fellow Japanese cosmetics addicts what’s your take? Recreating Anna Sui’s Royal Romp Look By Isabella Muse on September 18, 2007 6 Comments in Anna Sui , Face of the Day I was messing around this morning and not feeling at all myself so I decided I’d go for something wild to cheer myself up! I tried recreating Anna Sui’s Royal Romp Look. Sadly I’ve no idea what they used on the model so I just dabbled around with colors I had to see what I could create and this is what came of it! Lightening up my face to the point it was so goth porcelain as the model’s skin in the picture was near impossible so I improvised slightly with that as well as the ultra vibrant red gloss she’s wearing (If I wore such a color I’d look like a clown)! What do you think?

That is all. By the very way……… This is just SOME of it! How broke do you feel? Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab Halloween Haul By Isabella Muse on September 17, 2007 2 Comments in Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab , Fall Collections 2007 , Fragrance , Hauls I got one of my orders from Bpal today! Please have a look at my prior blogs on BPAL here and here for further information prior to reading this blog so you aren’t too confused ? The Pumpkin Patch Set The new labels are delightful on this set of oils! Very cute! All smelled as great as last year! The Murder of Crow Imp smells like dish liquid soap to me but aside from that the rest are yummie Pumpkin goodness! Number 1 is vying for first place as my favorite! The fruity tartness of the pear and pumpkin blend together in perfect harmony! Number 2 I’m loving least! *burp* The tobacco kills the entire blend in my humblest opinion. It’s wearable but not nearly as good as it’s brothers! Number 3 is chocolate pumpkin overload with a good dry down scent of creamy fruit! Number 4 is too green for me! Another loser in the batch! It’s wearable but way to earthy for me to enjoy. Not getting much pumpkin in it! Number 5 Is all vanilla goodness to me mixed up with yummie pumpkin! The perfect fall scent! The Perilous Parlor. Libra and Sugar Skull The Perilous Parlor is part of the Haunted House Collection and is divine! It’s a boozy pear smell heavy on the vanilla and purely perfect in all ways! I think I need a backup bottle of this gem! Libra is quite gorgeous as well! Fruity and Floral! Sugar Skull is pretty much identical to last year with maybe a little more of a heavy hand on the sugar! This is one of my favorite scents and I adore when it’s released around Halloween! The Muse on Facebook By Isabella Muse on September 17, 2007 Leave a Comment in Babblings The Muse has decided that she needs something to keep her sane (because lately she’s insane ). And if you clicked “insane” you’re wondering who the hell R.M. Renfield, just don’t mind me, my sense of amusement runs to the weird and unusual. She joined Facebook last week in order to have some contact with her boyfriend’s sister. During that time she learned she kinda sorta liked Facebook and thought it’d be a wonderful place to start a little group. So…in order to keep my head in some straight and narrow order lately I’ve created a group on Facebook to share latest purchases, FOTDS, pictures, videos, hauls, general stashes, and upcoming color stories! Come over and visit with me! I’d truly love it! Musings.of.a.Muse is where you’ll find me ? And if you can’t find me just comment or e-mail your Facebook information and I’ll gladly add you as a friend plus invite you to the group! If you don’t have a Facebook, it takes all of 2 seconds to fill out for one! Hope to see some happy faces over there!""]",61b8904f5f60aa2996a7546be70f1409a2372e3f,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4276,

In her e-mail she explained that my videos had inspired her to make some of her own! I love looking at other people’s collections and this video deserves a look (A traincase full of goodies)! Aimee also happens to have some great tutorials up! The Muse recommends you have a peek! Thanks for the e-mail Aimee and keep up the great work with the videos! The Muse approves and loves ’em ? And of course she’s utterly flattered she’s inspired you in someway! Anna Sui Royal Romp Pressed Powder M By Isabella Muse on September 25, 2007 6 Comments in Anna Sui , Fall Collections 2007 , First Impressions An angel happened to help the Muse out in purchasing some of her recent lemmings for Anna Sui goodies! Upon seeing the new Royal Romp collection from Anna Sui on the Japan site the Muse swooned in delight! The entire collection is quite delightful but the thing that whispered to the Muse’s delicate little ears was the Pressed Powder M! Magical Pressed Powder to enhance my complexion! Oh my! The design on these delicate compacts is lovely gothic black and purple colors with a silver and purple butterfly emblem on top! Inside the powder has a slight shimmer to it and a purple puff that carries the strong, sweet, gorgeous scent of roses! Tre Chic! I’m quite pleased with these powders! It’s just the right amount of shimmer that you aren’t over doing a look. The texture is soft and perfect in all ways! And how cute to whip this out of your bag for quick touch ups right? The colors available are a pale pink/white (01), a beige/peach (02), and a darker pink (03). The Muse ended up going with 01 and 03 as 02 didn’t appeal to her. Overall these are a fantastic little find from the Royal Romp Collection and worth a peek or a purchase! They are limited edition so get ’em while to getting is good ?

If I had to pick a lipstick that I could never be without it’d have to be Rougue Unlimited. The Muse highly recommends checking out these sexy shades of red! Benefit’s Do It Daily! By Isabella Muse on September 25, 2007 Leave a Comment in Benefit , Skincare Benefit is asking if I Do It Daily and last time I checked I most definitely do it daily and nightly too! Stop thinking nasty little thoughts! I’m talking about moisturizing your face! Benefit is introducing a brand new moisturizer entitled Do It Daily! that’s good for all skin types and contains an SPF of 10. Personally I’m not running around in excitement over this as most skincare items I’ve tried from Benefit aren’t always that great! But the idea of a lightweight facial moisturizer with SPF 10 that takes the guess work out of skin type does sound neat! The Muse will have a think and consider it as a future purchase (the packaging sure is cute)! If you do happen to try it, comment, let us know what you think!""]",551e029fab8a8fbeffdf8b60aeecc266a7042d50,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4273,

And if you clicked “insane” you’re wondering who the hell R.M. Renfield, just don’t mind me, my sense of amusement runs to the weird and unusual. She joined Facebook last week in order to have some contact with her boyfriend’s sister. During that time she learned she kinda sorta liked Facebook and thought it’d be a wonderful place to start a little group. So…in order to keep my head in some straight and narrow order lately I’ve created a group on Facebook to share latest purchases, FOTDS, pictures, videos, hauls, general stashes, and upcoming color stories! Come over and visit with me! I’d truly love it! Musings.of.a.Muse is where you’ll find me ?

"['MAC Holiday By Isabella Muse on October 24, 2007 10 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 MAC Holiday is live and up on the website! It’s not yet available for purchase just yet but you can start viewing what’s up, prices, and of course start making your wish list! Tomorrow it’ll be on sale at counters and I’d say either later today or tomorrow it’ll be ready for purchase on the website! Wahoo! Keep in mind that tomorrow’s releases do not include Finery (the lip bag sets) or Curiousitease (mini pigments, glosses, etc…). Curiousitease and Finery will be available for purchase via the website but not at your counter until November 15th and the 21st! However, you may be luck because as I recall my counter had gotten in some of the dress sets from Formal Black’s release sort of early! What I’m wanting (depending how they look in person) are the eye palettes for sure, coral lip bag, and tan lip bag. I know my list is small but of course when I’m faced with all of it I might very well change my mind! The lip palettes I may nab one…probably a Viva Glam palette. Aside from that the rest I can safely skip! All the vials of pigment are tempting but I have the full sizes and don’t need any of these, the liners I have as well, and the glosses I’ll have to see maybe one will tempt me! As tempting as it all is I do find some of it disappointing. The fact that the eye palettes look identical to last year’s colors has me worried but you can never really go by the MAC website for color swatches so I’d rather get to my counter and view it for myself. If you happened to miss last year’s Formal Black release and some other color stories this is a good time to get what you may have missed out on! Some items that are popping up in these kits were LE from past collections and wonderful if you haven’t yet gotten your hands on them! I see Helium pigment, Softwash Grey pigment, etc…. Now is also a good time to grab the softsparkle eyeliner pencils! The first time I got these was with the Sweetie Cake collection and I loved them! Now is a good time to get A mini lot of them for $29.50! Can’t go wrong there! Overall it’s a beautiful collection and if you’re new to MAC this is such a great place to start! If you’re an older collector it can be a bit of a disappointment as many items are repromoted from past collections and colors are similar. The Muse will keep you posted when she gets her goodies on Thursday! What are you getting? You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Formal Black 2006 vs MAC Antiquitease 2007 By Isabella Muse on October 24, 2007 15 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 The Muse loves you. Since she loves you so much she decided that it would be a very good idea to haul out all of last year’s MAC Formal Black and do the comparison work for you! Go on tell me how great I am, don’t be modest! Here’s the lowdown my pretties. If you skipped out on MAC Formal Black last year or you’re a new MAC addict, this year’s holiday collection is all about you however, if you’re an avid collector, your color stories are up to date, and you’re just a general makeup whore (like the Muse) that would mean this collection is somewhat of a snore. Currently my wish list is leaning towards the eye palettes and everything else seems like I can do without it! Without further babble from me here’s the scoop on MAC’s Holiday Collection this year! The best place to start is the palettes last year we had 4 palettes just like this year. Those consisted of Smokey Eyes, Intense Eyes, Warm Eyes, and Cool Eyes. This year Metallic Eyes has replaced Intense Eyes. MAC Formal Black Cool Eyes Palette Click here to view the Antiquitease Cool Eyes Palette Overall, the palette appears very similar to last year’s Formal Black Cool Eyes Palette aside from a few colors that look different! I still have to see this year’s palette to in person to decide but this sadly might turn into a non buy for me! MAC Formal Black Smokey Eye Palette This almost appears identical to MAC’s Antiquitease Smokey Eye palette! Click here to see the palette and compare for yourself! MAC Formal Black Intense Eyes Palette I loved this palette last year and I love it to this day and it appears this wasn’t duplicated in anyway this year but it’s been replaced with the Metallic Eye Palette which I am definately adding to my list to get as I’ve seen photos of it and it’s very nice! Again, I have to see it in person myself but I’d say the Metallic Eye Palette is one to nab for sure! See it here . MAC Formal Black Warm Eyes Palette This year’s warm eyes palette appears a bit different but some colors seem similar so I’ll have to see at my counter tomorrow how much unlike they are! The eye palettes are always on my list because it’s a nice bit of product for the price at $36 USD plus this year’s design is simply stunning however if the colors are the same I can count them off my list! Looking forward to seeing these in person tomorrow! I didn’t purchase any holiday lip palettes last year and I rarely do because they are just too messy for me however I did purchase the Viva Glam lip palette simply to donate my money to a good cause. Last year we were gifted with six shades in a palette and I believe the price was $48 USD (don’t quote me on that). This year they are offering two palettes at $22.50 USD each with three shades per palette. That price is for the Viva Glam lip palettes not the regular holiday palettes. If I recall correctly the lip palettes were the same price last year as the eyeshadow palettes where this year it’s less product for a bit more considering if you purchase two that would be $45 USD for six shades in two palettes when last year it was $36 USD for six shades in one palette. If I’m wrong do comment! I’m pretty sure that was the cost per palette last year! MAC Formal Black Viva Glam Palette I never touched my palette from last year! *blush* I’ve broken down the Curiousitease sets for you so you can see what you’re getting, color wise, in each set. These are a complete waste of cash for me since I have all the colors and if you’re an avid pigment user, a collector, or just a general makeup junkie chances are you have all the colors already as well! However, if you’re new to MAC or just missed out on certain items this is a great time to nab a deal! $29.50 USD gets you 5 vials of pigment and if you’re familiar with pigment you know these will last AGES and AGES so a little goes a long way! A nice little bang for your buck! The Cool Set of Curiousitease Pigments includes: Helium Softwash Grey Naval Blue Forest Green Reflects Blue Glitter I just realized how splendidly all these colors go together when I set them out next to each other so thanks MAC! The Muse does not own Forest Green (I thought I did but I guess I don’t! Unless it’s playing Hide and Seek with me at the moment). Naval Blue, Softwash Grey, Helium, Reflects Blue Glitter MAC is offering a warm collection of pigments as well which is also $29.50 USD and includes five pigment vials. The Warm Set of Curiousitease Pigments includes: Lilywhite Dazzleray Copper Sparkle Sunpepper Reflects Gold Glitter Again, thanks MAC! These go pretty well together ? I never realized how nicely Dazzleray and Lilywhite look together ! Lilywhite, Dazzleray, Sunpepper, Copper Sparkle, Reflects Gold Glitter This year, in keeping with the theme of mini eye pencils (see my Urban Decay Mini 24/7 Eyeliner blog entry), MAC bundled together 5 mini softsparkle pencils. Again, such a great deal, $29.50 USD for all 5 pencils. I have all the softsparkle pencils but if I didn’t this would most definately be on my wish list! If you have none of these eyeliner pencils I highly recommend nabbing this smart collection! The Curiousitease Softsparkle Eyeliner Set Includes: Nightsky Peacocky Iris Accents Reflecto Goldenair Peacocky, Reflecto, Nightsky, Iris Accents, Goldenair MAC Formal Black Lipgloss Dress Sets The above picture is the lipglosses that were included with the Dress Sets last year. This year the colors are far different from what I’ve seen in photos. Keep in mind the glosses included with these set are mini versions so don’t expect to get 5 full size glosses Brush sets are another snore for me as I have a majority of the brushes! If you happen to have all these brushes too and are loving the case they come in, like the Muse, I highly recommend skipping on purchasing just because you’re convincing yourself you could use the brushes (but really you’re just wanting the bag). The good news for weird, diseased people like ourselves is we can safely skip buying the brush bags and go ahead and score JUST the bag on E-bay! Now if you happen to not have many good brushes in your collection this is a good chance to nab some great brushes at a super great price! If you break down the cost per a brush set it comes to about $9.60 per a brush! That’s a steep savings on brushes! Brush Sets are $48 usd per set and the special edition Heirloom collection is $45. The Muse has broken down each set so you can see what you’ll be getting should you purchase the sets! Face Brush Set The face brush set includes (as pictured from left to right) 194 (useless brush in my opinion), 190, 168, and 187. This set is a bit tricky because it includes the 194 which in my humblest opinion is garbage and useless. So that means you’ll be taking 3 brushes and dividing by the $48 price tag which comes out to $16 per a brush! Purchase the lot separately in full size and it’ll run you a nice hefty $200 or so! It’s worth mentioning that I hear high debates about the quality of the brushes in these sets. I’ve heard they aren’t as good as the larger size, they shed, and so on and so fourth. I personally own larger and smaller sizes of MAC brushes and I’ve never experienced any problems with the smaller sizes! I even LIKE the smaller sizes better! Easy storage, portable, clean up as good as the large size, and take less space in my makeup bag! So if you’re wondering if the mini sizes are any better or worst than the full size I would say it’s about the same quality as the larger size brushes. MAC makes some outstanding brushes whether they be mini or large size! Basic Brush Set The basic brush set includes (as pictured from top to bottom) the 266, 219, 229, 129, and (not pictured) 316. Eye Brush Set The eye brush set includes (pictured from left to right) the 252, 212, 275, 217, and 209. If you’re in high debate what would be the best brush set to lay your money on I’d say it would be the eye set or the face brush set! As for the Heirloom Brush Set that appears to have the same brushes as the basic brush set but in special clothing so if you’re yearning the basic brush set why not get the Heirloom Set and save yourself $3! Heirloom Brush Set $45 USD That’s all for my comparisons to this year’s collection and last year’s ? I hope it’s helped you decide what will be a hit for you and what will be a miss! The only thing I didn’t cover were Antiquitease Finery which are the lipstick sets. I did purchase lipsticks from last year but can’t recall the colors so I am unable to do the comparisons for you! I will say Coral Lips and Tan Lips look very similar to colors I got last year! Happy Shopping tomorrow and don’t forget to comment and let the Muse know what you got! She’s all ears!

"['MAC Royal Assets Holiday Collection 2007 By Isabella Muse on October 25, 2007 16 Comments in First Impressions , Hauls , Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 Ok, MAC Addicts. It’s that time you’ve all been waiting for ? The Muse’s haul is very tiny, actually, it’s bigger than I originally thought it would be! This morning I was fairly sure I was going to end up with one palette but, of course, like the diseased cosmetic whore I am, I ended up purchasing three of the four Royal Asset Palettes. Unless you’re as diseased as I am you only need one of the Royal Assets palettes in my opinion. This only applies if you are up to date with MAC Formal Black Holiday Collection 2006. If you didn’t partake of Holiday palettes last year this year is a good time to nab very similar palettes as 2006’s releases! I’m not sure what I think of the actual compacts yet. I’m sorta of loving them and I’m sorta hating them. They are very nicely made. Very classy, worldly, chic but they may have a little bit of an underlay of cheap. I’m not sure what exactly it is that’s turning me off but I feel a little cheap going on here. So, right now I’m in a love/hate relationship with the actual style. Contents are typical MAC eyeshadows that are very, very similar to Formal Black! The Muse took the guess work out of this for you and compared the palettes side by side. The only palette I totally skipped out on was the Smokey Eye because it wasn’t even close to last year’s in beauty! It was actually quite blah! The colors seemed all matte to me and not as beautiful as last year’s smokey palette! The good news is that I highly recommend nabbing the Royal Assets Metallic Eyes palette as that appears to be a bit similar to last year’s smokey palette! Let’s review. I ended up getting the Cool, Warm, and Metallic Eye palettes. Metallic Eyes Cool Eyes Warm Eyes Few differences in last year’s palettes and this years! Here we are comparing the warm palette from this year (on the left) to the warm palette from last year (on the right). Royal Assets Warm Eyes Palette vs. Formal Black Eyes Warm Palette I don’t have the names of last year’s shadows sadly. It’s not listed on the box or the insert and the Muse is a bit too lazy to look it up on the internet ? So I’ll give you a run down of the names of this year’s shadows and compare them to last years! Royal Assets Warm Eyes Palette Eyeshadows: Sunday Best (this is replacing a lighter gold color. It’s nude with a bit of a frosty shimmer to it) Star Voilet (this is replacing a copper color. It’s not nearly as nice as last year’s color. It’s a matte light brown) Club (this is replacing a beige gold color, last year was a nice color but this year the color is even better! It’s a nice shimmering gold) Showstopper (This is a bluish brown color and replacing a caca green/brown color from last year! I’m not sure I like this color! Prefer last years!) Nobility (This is matte dark brown color! Very blah! Last year was a lighter chocolate matte brown! Neither is pretty in my opinion) I’m comparing Formal Black’s Smokey Palette to this year’s Metallic Palette because 1. I didn’t get this year’s smokey palette as it was too blah for me to bother! And 2. These are a bit similar in color! Formal Black Eyes Smokey Palette vs. Royal Assets Metallic Eyes Palette The Metallic palette is definately a keeper! The colors are very workable and in my opinion it’s the best palette in the lot of the four that were released! It quite reminds me of last year’s outstanding smokey eye palette! Again, I don’t have last year’s color names as they aren’t listed so I am going to do a quick rundown comparison. Royal Assets Metallic Eyes Palette Eyeshadows: Honey Lust (This is nothing like the nude color that’s included with the Formal Black Smokey Eye Palette! It’s a gorgeous shimmering gold!) Silver Fog (Silver Fog is a silver white shimmering shadow that’s very similar to what was included in last year’s palette! Last year it was a bit of a darker silver shimmer.) Stately Black (This is a light copper shimmer that’s slightly similar to the brown shimmer we got but not quite the same!) Velvet Lady (Nothing like the smokey eye palette this is a beautiful dark blue with silver shimmer!) Creme Royal (Again nothing like last year’s color! This is chocolate brown with an almost iridescent green too it) Manor (Black Tied was included with the Smokey Eye Palette and this is quite similar but has much less silver than Black Tied and is much more subdued!) I made a mistake and had to edit this! Sorry ? Thanks to the reader that pointed out my error! This is a comparison between Intense Eyes from Formal Black and the Cool Eyes from Royal Assets! Cool eyes last year is a bit similar to the Royal Assets version however I find that Intense Eyes from Formal Black was more on the same base as this year’s Cool palette! Formal Black Eyes Intense Eyes Palette vs. Royal Assets Cool Eyes Palette Royal Assets Cool Eyes Palette Eyeshadows: Shadowy (This is a very light pale pink! Last year we had no light pink color like this.) Silverwear (This is a frosty matte silver! Again, nothing like this!) Modern Heir (Light Fuschia pink. Last year we had a similar pink but a bit more dark.) Queen’s Jewel (This is a light off purple color. Last year we had a true purple color in the cool palette) Medellin (Very similar but minus the frost. This is a matte dark chocolate color) Trophy (An iridescent bluish color, nothing like last year’s palette) Formal Black’s Intense Eye palette had much more POP! to it! This year the colors are nice but not nearly as beautiful as the previous palette which had a beautiful aqua, green, purple, etc….This year many of the shadows are a matte frost texture and not nearly as shimmery. MAC Royal Assets Palettes Metallic Eyes, Cool Eyes, and Warm Eyes Overall, it’s a nice collection but nothing you have to have unless you’re a serious MAC addict! I do suggest grabbing the Metallic Eye Palette as it is quite gorgeous! The rest I advise leaving and saving your money! The lip palettes are nice as well but they weren’t so appealing I had to have them so I skipped! Brush sets are very pretty as well but nothing I don’t already have. A good collection for new MAC users or people that skipped out on the Formal Black collection. Count the Muse as being a bit sad and depressed that the collection didn’t completely knock her socks off! Oh well we have the Stylists collection to look forward to right? You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Antiquitease Color By Isabella Muse on October 16, 2007 13 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 Choices, choices, choices! It all comes down to choices this Holiday season ? Antiquitease is up and available at MAC for your purchasing pleasure and will be at your local MAC counter on October 11th. The Muse hasn’t yet purchased her Alexander McQueen as of yet due to the fact that with so many MAC collections up and coming it’s difficult to decide on what to purchase and what to skip! Have I mentioned I hate deciding and making a choice? I just want it all, NOW! But realistically I need to decide what I really want as opposed to the inner demon that demands me to get it all! Soon after Antiquitease Color the rest of the line up will be releasing through October and into November which includes the brush kits, palettes, and lip sets. So it all comes down to choosing what I really need and leaving what I know I won’t use ?

"['Givenchy Holiday Collection 2007 By Isabella Muse on September 27, 2007 8 Comments in Givenchy , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 , Wish List Well..my German is rusty but if you happen to head over to Bjooti you can lay eyes on something that the Muse wants under her Christmas Tree this year! Diamonds. Givenchy is giving us girls our very best friend for Christmas! The Diamantisimme collection looks like something the Muse may likely kill for (not really but I can’t promise I won’t hurt someone for it! I’m kidding! I’m kidding!). This powder looks astounding! The Muse’s new mate and reader, Sarah, is possibly peeing her pants while reading this right now (She loves Givenchy just as much as I do)! Sarah, honey, I’m with you! The Muse is beyond excitement! Now if I can just brush up on my German and firgure out what’s being said about this collection hmmmmm……where’d I put that dictionary? This is on the Wish List for sure! Now the question remains how to find it before it sells out faster than the Muse can whip her credit card out! BREAKING NEWS on the MAC Front By Isabella Muse on September 27, 2007 Leave a Comment in MAC The Muse happened to scroll on over to Janice’s blog, the Queen of MAC in the Muse’s eyes. And I’m gobsmacked! Do have a peek and see for your very own eyes that Parrot may be making a reappearance soon! *waits for the gasps and screams of excitement* Alexander McQueen for MAC By Isabella Muse on September 27, 2007 2 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , MAC Alexander McQueen, a goddess in his own mind (and mine for that matter) brings to us a new MAC Collection. Now you might be lemming this for several reasons such as the vibrant, eyepopping colors. The fact that’s it’s limited edition must also be tempting you and of course it has cute packaging details that also might put you in that “want” frame of mind. But I think we can all be honest and admit that the reason we REALLY want the collection is for the coveted and long gone repromote of New Vegas Mineralize Skinfinish. I can’t tell you how often I’ve searched on E-bay for a New Vegas and failed finding one that hadn’t hit the $60 or more mark upon auction end (Stereo Rose is another item I’ve failed miserably at locating for a price that didn’t include a contract for my first born child!)! The Muse sometimes has to give herself limits and purchasing a MSF for $60 or more dollars is one of her cut off points (however she has been known to sell an organ for parrot but that’s another story for another day)! Well…girls…look no further New Vegas is back with a bang and we can all bow low to Alexander McQueen for it’s return! Aside from the very exciting repromote of New Vegas I’d say we have quite a nice lot of goodies to look forward to with this collection and truly if you love awe inspiring shades this be the color story for you! The colors look just perfect and not a doubt crosses my mine that they will be a nice little investment as well! These are bound to go up in price drastically after they are sold out so you can grab yourself a nice little piece of history here for it’s original, cheap price and next year you can laugh at all the n00bs who are searching their lemming out on E-bay and successfully finding ridiculously priced paint pots, MSF, and other yummie items from this color story! Although, the Muse highly recommends be nice and not laughing at the n00blets, after all, we were one ourselves at one time (as you can see the Muse has been playing far to much WoW and she’s reverted to leet speak ! Do forgive her! She’ll be back to her beautified, non geeky self shortly. Well back to beautified not being geeky might not be possible!)! The Muse says…GO YOU…GET TO THE STORE…and do purchase this collection! October 11th the Muse will bounce her way to her Nordie’s counter and give her monthly donation to the MAC counter so that she might have these wonderful, gorgeous goodies for her very own! Happy Shopping!

Bare Escentuals ""V"" Brush By Isabella Muse on September 27, 2007 Leave a Comment in Bare Escentuals , Fall Collections 2007 , First Impressions After much debate the Muse has decided to order the Smokey “V” Eye Kit from Bare Escentuals. I really didn’t need or want the kit when I originally seen it pop up online at Sephora however I’ve changed my mind since seeing the “V” Brush in action. I scoured around E-bay for the Brush and it looks like, at the moment, it’s going for anywhere between $14-22 USD. For that price I figured I might as well just dive in and buy the whole kit which is available on an E-bay auction for $29.99 plus free shipping or from Sephora for $32 (but then I’d have to pay taxes and shipping so E-bay seems a good idea!). Ok…anyway…let’s get back to the brush! The brush was intriguing when I first seen it but I wasn’t sure how exactly it was supposed to work. It basically resembles a fishtail and I was assuming that to apply you’d be dipping into your shadow and just using the brush in the outer corner of the eye where the area creates a “V” however since viewing a demo on QVC (which I am sad to say I am unable to locate for you to view) that’s not the case at all! Photos of the brush that I nicked from E-bay Ok so this might be hard to explain but basically to use the brush you’ll be dipping into your shadow or better yet coating both sides of the brush in whatever color you are using at the moment. After your brush is nicely coated in color you’ll be dragging the brush from the inner corner of the eye all the way outward to the V of your eye where you’ll proceed to twist the brush up slightly. The entire effect basically coats your crease and lower lash liner with color while avoiding your middle eye and lid area! The twist towards the end will emphasize the V area and create a more intense effect. So..that sounds really complicated but I promise you when I seen how it was used I was really delighted and instantly in “want” mode! The Muse has decided that she needs this kit and highly recommends scouring around E-bay for either the kit or to try to locate the brush at a decent price! It seems a really good tool to add to the beauty arsenal! All in all I’d say you’ll make good use of the shadow and glimmer that comes with the kit! They are perfect colors for the fall/winter and evening looks plus you end up with the nifty brush. Happy Hunting! Clio Blushes By Isabella Muse on September 27, 2007 15 Comments in Clio , First Impressions You might remember a few months ago I had gotten some Clio Eyeshadows that I really liked. I was dead curious about the entire line so I googled a little and came across the website for Clio . Upon viewing the website I fell in love with just about everything the line offers as the items are so damn cute! Of course when it’s cute that normally means it’s some sort of Asian cosmetic that the Muse will have a hard time getting her hands on! *sad sigh* Lucky enough the Muse happens to have friends in high places (sort of, kinda) and she ended up nabbing two of the Clio Blushes that were extremely difficult to locate here in the US! I must say these are everything the Muse wants in a MAC Skinfinish! They are silky, smooth, and pigmented! MAC Skinfinish are amazing but I’d love a bit more color to some of them, that, is in fact, where Clio picks up the bag. Clio Blushes give a gorgeous wash of color on the cheeks that looks amazingly natural and just downright pretty! The brushes they come with are very soft, no shedding, and nicely rounded and large for good coverage! I ended up getting two of these FINE blushes and I wish I could have gotten the other colors! If you have access do pick up a few of these as they are fantastic! I love the Clio eyeshadows I’ve purchased prior to this but I must say they out did themselves on the blushes! Bravo! Now..solving the problem of locating Clio stateside…hmmmmmmm……….']",2f4e59a90b88dd7c2f5167685af60cdc1f0f73ba,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4271,

"['MAC Beauty Powders By Isabella Muse on October 3, 2007 Leave a Comment in Beauty Babblings , MAC Hi! The Muse got her small haul of Beauty Powders from MAC Pro yesterday. She’s been too nuts at work to actually go in and grab them so she rang them up and paid the $7 to have them shipped to her home! At the time the actual move of paying taxes plus the additional $7 for shipping seems to make the original price tag of $21 per powder a bit much! However, she has good news, the powders are all that and a bag of chips and well worth the cost of shipping. I’ll be reviewing these shortly for your reading pleasure! The good news is they are wonderful, the bad news is I only ordered two of the eight colors and now I am seriously wanting the rest! Uh oh… Stay tuned for the review and pictures! If you need your Beauty Powder fix RIGHT NOW, Click on over to Temptalia and you can see swatches and pics of these great powders! MuseTV Presents: Spotlight on Visee Cosmetics By Isabella Muse on October 2, 2007 8 Comments in Japanese Brands , MuseTV , Spotlights , Visee Hey pretties! Well it’s that time again! Today’s Spotlight I’m bringing you some lovely Visee goodies to please and entice! Lucky for you I did a majority of my blogging during free time on Sunday night because I have been swamped silly this week with work! MuseTV Presents: A Spotlight On Visee Cosmetics You can visit the Visee website by clicking here . Visee is pretty much a virgin brand to me as I’ve only tried two products in the entire line! The good news is it’s brought to us by our lovely friends at Kose, the Muse likey Kose cosmetics! The palettes I’ve discussed in my video and the ones I will post pictures of in a moment have been reviewed by the masses and enjoyed by all and might the Muse add her two cents to that and say that she agrees with everything great and good that’s been said about these palettes! They are superb and well worth the cash! The palettes will set you back a mere $19 and change (USD) and with that donation to Visee you get yourself a brilliant shimmering, sparkley packed shadow quad that’s sure to make your eyes pop and dance in delight! Visee Jewel Crushed Eyes The palettes are pretty much on par with T’estimo and Jill Stuart and maybe..shhh..don’t tell anyone…possibly better. If you’re really a big fan of shimmer these shadows bring that and more! The thing about these is they are not airbrushed with a thin line of shimmer as some palettes are. The shimmer in these is right down to the core! Some brands do a thin airbrushing of shimmer ontop of the shadows, which for me, is obviously to score sales. In this case you’ll find that the shadows are just as they are from first use to last use, full of fine particles of glitter and shimmery bits and pieces! Each palette contains four shadows or darker shades can be used as a liner! These have plenty of pigment, fantastic staying power, and go on with a near perfect finish. If by chance you are either tired in the morning or shadow retarded (nothing to be ashamed about!) these are easy enough to apply because all the colors just work together! Don’t you love palettes like that? Sadly, like Jill Stuart, the palettes are for at home use only! Taking these with you will scratch up the lovely case they come in but hey if that doesn’t bother you, tote them away ? Contrary to what I had said in my video a little light bulb went off in my head and I remembered that I had tried two of the Visee Aqua Shining Eyes. These were recommended to me by a wonderful little lady and friend that I always talk about (You probably guessed who by now);) Visee Aqua Shining Eyes I randomly added these to my cart when shopping one day at Adam Beauty and I ended up just loving them! I’m not a big fan of cream shadows but props has to go to these fine shadows! They dry very quickly upon application, go on evenly without creasing, and have enough glittery bits to keep the Muse happy well into the day and night! These are around $16 USD each. A little steep in price but they work like an absolute dream! I do believe I need the rest of the colors ? Wish List anyone? Overall the Muse highly recommends checking out the Jewel Crush Palettes and the Aqua Shining Eyes and if you’re hungry for more definately check out the rest of the line because I know at least several items that are on my wish list from this brilliant Japanese brand! Visee Cosmetics can purchased for relatively good prices at Adam Beauty ! I hope you enjoyed this adventure in Visee! Stay tuned tomorrow for the next Japanese Brand Spotlight! Benefit’s Miss Popularity By Isabella Muse on October 2, 2007 6 Comments in Benefit , Fall Collections 2007 Do you want to be Miss Popularity? Look no further, Benefit has got you covered! Taken from the Benefit Site: Turn up your “all that” appeal with miss popularity. All you need is our new precision highlighter in all the right places and you’re “all that” just like that. This soft white shimmering highlighter makes it so easy. Tips and tricks: miss popularity’s secret lesson for highlighting: For bright eyes… apply to the triangle of the eyes & blend. Perk up your smile… apply to the outer corners of lips & blend. Slimify your nose… apply 3 dots down the middle & blend. To enhance cleavage… apply above your bra line and blend. Um ya…. Well we already know the story of “That Gal” don’t we? Oh you missed it? Click here and you’ll understand! I’m a little skeptical of a product that promises to brighten and highlight me after my fiasco with “That Gal” however, I might just give Benefit a second chance to make things right in our relationship! Anyone interested in this? Urban Decay Releases By Isabella Muse on October 2, 2007 6 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , Urban Decay , Winter Collections 2007 Ho Ho Ho! Some Urban Decay goodies await you at Sephora for your holiday gift giving pleasure or to fill your own stocking with joy! Behold yummie cosmetic goodies that even Santa will want under his tree! A Deluxe Shadow Box to make your eyes bright and cheery: I’m a big fan of Urban Decay Deluxe Shadows and I wish this was around when I had dove in and purchased a majority of the colors! The idea of having all the best colors in one nifty palette thrills the Muse! Yes, you can be excited about the palette but did I mention it also comes with a mini size of Urban Decay Primer Potion? That seals the deal for the Muse and she recommends purchasing this to spoil yourself this upcoming holiday season! The palette is $36 and includes 9 shadows plus the primer potion! If for some reason the Deluxe Eyeshadow Box failed to wow you let me introduce you to a smaller palette that packs a nice punch! A quad of delightful Urban Decay Shadows in Oil Slick, Stray Dog, Midnight Cowboy, and Flipside plus a brush all in a cute purple compact! Did the Muse happen to mention how much she adores purple? The palette is $24 and is available for purchase at Sephora right now! Urban Decay Foreshadow Quad A new year brings us a new arsenal of beauty this year it’s entitled the Urban Decay Survival Set! The set includes Mini Eyeshadow Primer Potion, XXX Lipgloss, Lip Envy, Eyeshadows in Chopper, Twiced Baked, Smog, and Glitter, 24/7 Glide On Eye Pencil, and Mascara! Just what you need to quickly look fabulous! Purchase the kit for $42 Urban Survival Kit Finally on the line is a new best of kit! The Best of Urban Set includes Midnight Cowboy Rides Again Eyeshadow, Mini Primer Potion, 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil in Bourbon, and Heavy Metal Glitter Eyeliner in Midnight Cowboy. The Glitter Liner in Midnight Cowboy hasn’t been released prior to this so that’s reason enough to want the kit! The kit costs $32 and available for purchase now! The Best of Urban Kit Yule Tide Cheer and all that good stuff right smack in the beginning of October my pretties! Makes you want to start Christmas shopping early doesn’t it? MuseTV Presents: Spotlight on Jill Stuart Cosmetics By Isabella Muse on October 1, 2007 7 Comments in Japanese Brands , Jill Stuart , MuseTV , Spotlights Work is swamped this week and I’ve been staying late! But I didn’t forget about you lovely ladies so here, as promised, the kick off of the first day of Japanese Cosmetics Week! I’m quite a girly girl in all aspects which means if it’s pretty I am all over it! As women, we are lucky enough to have an array of brands to choose from. Brands that run from practical and conventional, to cute and girlish, to plain and simple, and finally some brands can boast elegance and style. Jill Stuart is one brand that can most definately lay claim to elegance, style, and so much more. The sheer gorgeous packaging on a Jill Stuart product guarantees it’s bringing you the pretty as well as a high quality make-up item! I’m a great lover of many brands but I can’t honestly say I’ve run into any brands that are more beautiful and feminine than this line of cosmetics. I love being able to have a gorgeous product to use AND display on my vanity! You’re not only getting a beautiful make-up item to wear on your face but also an item that is presented in such a way that it’s outwardly beautiful to behold as well as use! I can honestly admit if the product happened to be of a shabby quality, which it is not, I would still want the items for the cute compacts and jars they come in. Possibly a waste of money but I must say the packaging most definately sells the product in this case. Their is no question that the product is a good one but I imagine a good portion of the sales are generated by fancy, lovely presentation! MuseTV Presents: A Spotlight On Jill Stuart Cosmetics Jill Stuart Blushes Jill Stuart has an array of loose powder blush to choose from, at the moment the general catalog contains 9 colors that are, to me, flattering on most skin types! The blushes overall are good quality items. The texture is like nothing I’m run across stateside. It’s a very chalky, thin powder. It goes on quite flawlessly if you get the correct color. If you happen to choose an unflattering shade chances are the flawless finish to the blush will actually look chalky and flaky. I have five of the nine colors and have only run across one that didn’t particularly work well for me which was orange plush but it’s a small problem that can easily be redeemed by applying a blusher over orange plush during application. These blushes come as I said loose and in a fancy plastic jar with their own brush. The jar itself can easily be mistaken for glass if you display it on your vanity but of course, upon picking it up, it’s only plastic. Don’t let the plastic put you off, it takes nothing away from the lovely packaging! Glowing Red, Cherry Frost and Aurora Rose Pink Passion and Orange Plush Each brush that comes with the blushes is quite good quality with no shedding problems. They are soft, solid brushes that work well with this style of powder blush! Application is as easy as applying your BareMineral foundation, swirl, dap, brush on! I’ve heard mixed reviews about application problems with the blush, I’ve experienced no such problems! Each jar of loose powder blush runs about $26 USD. Once your blush is gone you can purchase a replacement bag of the blush but I’m sadly unsure what the cost is for that! Overall I love the blush and highly recommend it with glowing cheeks ? Jill Stuart Loose Powder The Jill Stuart Loose Powder comes in a similar jar as the blushes but a bit on the larger side. The powder comes in four different formulas which are shine, sparkle, natural and glow. I’ve only tried one of the four and that would be sparkle. The powder comes with a cute powder puff applicator and I personally use this as a finishing powder after I’ve completely my look. It creates a sheer sparkle effect much like Bare Escentuals gossamer face powders. If you’re not a lover of sparkle and shimmer this is perfectly fine to use because it’s very sheer minus the disco ball effect! The powder runs about $38 USD. It’s a perfectly great powder and gets my high rating! Loose Powder Blush in Sparkle Jill Stuart Eye Shadow Palettes At the moment Jill Stuart has released seven eyeshadow palettes which contain four shimmering shadows in each compact. The textures of the shadows are on par with T’estimo palettes . The texture is silky smooth and application is a breeze as the powder smooths on easily. Color intensity depends on many layers of the shadow you apply. One layer will give you a nice, gentle wash of color while two to three layers will give you a more dramatic, intense eye look. The colors are sparkley and full of shimmer. I think, like other brands, the compacts sometimes come across with a strange combination of colors that give the appearance they won’t work together very well. Finding looks to come up with using some of these may prove difficult but with a little imagination you can create a fantastic eye look! The compacts are extremely beautiful but unconventional to use outside of your home. If you’re looking for a compact to throw in your bag for touch-ups I strongly suggest looking elsewhere. The palettes are easy to scratch up if you stow them away in a purse or a make-up bag. The price per a palette is around $43 USD. I adore these and can’t give them a big enough thumbs up! Jill Stuart Pressed Powder Jill Stuart has a line of pressed powders for every skin type. These are not foundation powders but just a pressed finishing powder or a powder you can use for quick touch ups. This formula, like the loose powder, comes in natural, shine, and sparkle. I only own one of the three and that would be…you guessed it..sparkle. The sparkle powder doesn’t have much in the way of sparkle however I find it works fantastic when touching up under your eyes or powdering an oily forehead or a shiny nose! It comes in, of course, an elegant compact with sponge applicator. Cost wise this carries a high price tag of $45 USD but is well worth it! The powder isn’t an absolute must have but it is a nice conversation piece. You can probably skip it if you’re low on cash but if you happen to have the extra money I strongly suggest nabbing one or two! Jill Stuart Pressed Powder Blush Finally, last but not least I give you the Jill Stuart Pressed Powder Blushes! There was much excitement and fanfare when these were introduced and many people were eager to get their hands on them. You can see why they were so eagerly anticipated. The compact is a gorgeous silver affair with a detachable silver jeweled brush! Our first views of these had many people worried about the practicality of having a brush that hung from a compact. How would we apply a blush with a brush hanging from the side? How would we store it? So many questions and a bit of disappointment for all! However, after further pictures were released in magazines and on blogs, much to our relief, we learned the brush was in fact detachable. The brush clips right off of the compact making for easy application and simple storage! The brush’s first reviews were poor ones. It was reviewed as being stiff and hard in texture but to my relief, upon getting my compacts, I found the brush was not so bad and quite soft without any shedding of any kind much like the loose powder brush but a little stiffer! I can’t review the blush as it’s just been too pretty to touch as of yet but I can tell you that I’ve heard various review in poor favor of this! It was awaited patiently and eagerly and when it finally got to shops and was purchased a majority of the purchasers were disappointed and cried out their dismay at the fact that the blushes were so sheer with very minimal pigment! I’ve come across more bad reviews than I have good but again, I can’t speak for myself as I’m still in the phase of stroking it lovely and telling it how gorgeous it is and quickly putting it back in my beauty vault! Blushes run about $38 USD. I’d recommend nabbing one just for the packaging alone if you have some extra cash! If not wait for the Muse to use hers and of course she’ll give you her honest opinion of it! Jill Stuart carries a full range of cosmetics which includes glosses, lipsticks, single eyeshadows, face care, and more… Check out the website by clicking here . I know of two online shops that carry the line but the prices are not what you’ll be paying retail sadly. Those shops are: Bobodave and Ichibankao Prices increases go from anywhere from $5-$25 on top of retail cost. You can find certain items on E-bay but again prices are jacked up! Most all my Jill Stuart was purchased by friends and shipped to me via airmail so if you happen to have a friend living in Japan that makes life easier and cheaper! Well… That’s it ? I hope you enjoyed exploring Jill Stuart cosmetics! Check back tomorrow for a new Japanese Brand Spotlight!

"[""theBalm: Balm Shell Lipgloss By Isabella Muse on October 1, 2007 2 Comments in Fall Collections 2007 , theBalm Remember those moving pens from yesteryear? I live in New York thus I am overexposed to crazy sovereigns of all kinds. Statue of Liberty keychains, I Love New York T-Shirts, Empire State Building figures, and of course the moving pen. Now if you’ve never seen a moving pen let me elaborate further. Basically it’s a regular everyday pen but the upper part would have some sort of scene. In my case it’d be a scene of New York and a taxi. The taxi part of the scene would move up and down the pen as you flipped the pen upside down to right side up! Brilliant right? A moving screwdriver pen with a truck that moves back and fourth: Fascinating isn’t it? Oh you wanted to know what the hell this has to do with cosmetics didn’t you? Sorry about that ? theBalm has decided to nick the idea of the moving pen and use it on their new lipglosses called Balm Shell. Each gloss has a different girly fun scene such as a day at the beach, a day shopping, etc..etc.. The moving illustration is unique to each shade and story line within the glosses little handle! When the lip-gloss is finished, the handle can be unattached and used as a keychain! Fun Fun! The Muse wants some of these just for the cute factor alone! Each gloss is $22 each and comes with the keyring. Bare Escentuals Classic Rock Flawless Diamond Color Collection By Isabella Muse on October 1, 2007 1 Comment in Bare Escentuals , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 , Wish List My Jill Stuart video and blog are a bit late coming today! But until I can post it I bring you the new Bare Escentuals Classic Rock Flawless Diamond Color Collection! Diamonds are most definitely a girl’s best friend this year! I see a trend developing here. Givenchy is delighting us with it’s Diamantisimme collection and now Bare Escentuals is bringing the bling with it’s newest set! If you remember prior to all this Victoria’s Secret had released it’s Sparkling Diamond collection this past summer. The Classic Rock collection has a similar promise as the Victoria’s Secret Sparkling Diamond collection which would be…drum roll please…..genuine diamond powder that is crushed into the minerals. I can really get excited about this. So I want it. Like now. The collection is $59 and includes Diamond Gossamer powder, Classic Rock Eyeshadow (white silver), Nice Rock Glimmer (chocolate), Diamond Laughter Blush (peach), Diamond Beautifully Luminous Lashes (black mascara and white Luminous Lashes to add a silver sparkle to lashes), Diamond Lip Polish, Full Flawless Face Brush, and a Diamond faux leather bag!

Latest Japanese Haul By Isabella Muse on September 30, 2007 14 Comments in First Impressions , Hauls , Japanese Brands , Shiseido , T'estimo The Muse went a little crazy and ordered a few new Japanese goodies ! Here’s her latest haul from the west end of the world: T’estimo Gift Set I’ve no idea how old this gift set is but it could be Christmas last year! After hearing the tale of T’estimo demise I went into mourning and soon after decided to make it my business to collect what remaining T’estimo I don’t already own and stash it away in my collection before it was gone for good! This nifty little kit contained two mini lipsticks and two cream eyeshadows in pink and gold colors! Overall it was quite a cute gift set and I’m thrilled to own it! Shiseido as we know it here, in the US, is not a cheap brand of cosmetic. It’s a high end of make-up that is purchased in posh shops. Shiseido is on a different sphere in Japan and how the Japanese know the brand. Shiseido is well known for not only expensive designer cosmetics in Japan but also cheaper drugstore brands such as Majorca Majolica , Maquillage, Etc… Shiseido has some amazingly inexpensive and fabulous branch offs in Japan that are not available in the states or Europe. Some of these brands are my truest love. The following are a new line, for me, that I came across. It’s a very inexpensive brand of cosmetic that Shiseido has out and quite nice for such a low end brand of make-up! Update: With a little help from your friends you can find just what you need! The website for this cheesy little brand can be found here: http://www.kesho-wakusei.com/lineup/makeup/index.htm Thanks so much to Flecks for the information! Trio Palette These palettes slide open to reveal two shadows and a glittering lipgloss. Not the best palette in the world but quite cute for a casual, minimal make-up look! Loose Powder Blushes I got two of these loose powder blushes. The pink is ultra sheer but does give a bit of a wash of color! The white is gorgeous and pretty pigmented, I probably won’t use it much on my cheeks but it will make a great base for shadows! Plenty of shimmer in the white too! The Muse likes shimmer! Dual Contouring Blushes/Highlighters Interesting blushes. One in glittering white and one in gold. Ok in the pigment department but does hold a nice glitter content, good for contouring or highlighting your face. One side holds a shimmering side and the other a matte side. Overall I’m pretty happy with these and I’m eager to try them out for size! Pinkolors Palette I’ve never seen this brand before and it’s brand new to my eyes. I’ve searched but I haven’t found a word about Pinkolors on the internet aside from some auctions selling it! This was a last minute purchase due to the cute packaging design! The colors in the palette are pretty nice but sheer. Good for a casual make-up day or using them as a base for a more vibrant shade! All in all some interesting little tidbits in this haul! Enjoy the pics and first impressions!

I may not need therapy after all. MAC Beauty Powders Take 2 By Isabella Muse on October 4, 2007 2 Comments in MAC Thanks for being so patient with me while I wandered around in a daze this week ? And for your patience, as promised , I reward you with the MAC Beauty Powders Review and Pictures! MAC Beauty Powders in Micro Pink and Natural Flare Yay! I ended up purchasing two of the eights colors and I know at least four more of the colors that are on my wish list ! Ok these confuse me slightly as I thought MAC had previously released a similar product. The other reason I am puzzling would be I am unsure if these are being released via MAC anytime soon or if these are a MAC Pro exclusive. I thought I had seen something about the release being with the Holiday goodies but I am too lazy to go looking at the moment ? So don’t quote me on that! I ended up with Micro Pink and Natural Flare both of which I am very happy with! Micro Pink should probably be kept with the fair skin group because it may appear slightly chalky on a deeper skin type and Natural Flare is good for all skin types in my opinion. I guess if you took a Mineralized Skinfinish and you cracked it up into finely milled powder and added a little sparkle you’d have a MAC Beauty Powder. Maybe it’s me but that is what I am getting in terms of finish and texture on my face! Which is great because who doesn’t want a loose powder format of Mineralized Skinfinish right? Plus sparkle? I’m all over that! For those of you yelling boo at the sparkle have no fear it’s a very natural finish and you’re not going to look like you’re ready for a night in a club or anything remotely glittery and loud. It applies with a nice, even finish and the sparkle is there but barely noticeable. These remind me of Bare Escentuals Rose Gossamer Powder for some reason! MAC Micro Pink Beauty Powder and Bare Escentuals Rose Gossamer I used Natural Flare this morning with a peach blush and it really made my blush pop up a little. It also made my blush a bit more subdued and natural looking! Excuse the crummy eye make-up! Last few days I feel like I’m rushed in everything I do ? So disregard the mucked up eyeshadow and concentrate on the gorgeous look Natural Flare gave my cheeks! I normally reserve my 187 for applying Mineralized Skinfinish but it dipped happily into my pot of Natural Flare this morning and worked wonderfully to apply the powder! I think the 187 , 188 , or a small kabuki would be great for application! If you want more of a loose effect I’d try applying with a puffier brush such as the 129 . Overall, I’d say nab a few of these to add to your collection because they are quite good! I’m loving the two I got and hopefully will get the others that I’m currently wanting! These are available via Phone from MAC Pro or if you happen to live near a MAC Pro store you can hop right in and purchase them for $21 USD. My camera doesn’t pick up swatches well and Micro Pink looked like I had nothing on however it did ok with Natural Flare.']",f87fc361c88eaba329dc6a928f2fa98c43322d31,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4267,

"[""MuseTV Presents: Spotlight on Canmake By Isabella Muse on October 4, 2007 17 Comments in Canmake , Japanese Brands , MuseTV , Spotlights If I may, allow me to introduce you to a wonderful little Japanese Brand entitled Canmake. Canmake is pretty much the bottom of the line in regards to cosmetics. It’s a cheap and cheesy little brand that packs a baby punch of goodness ? It’s cute, usable, and inexpensive. If you’re on a budget we are heading into the land of sweet cosmetics that will cost you a few dollars and leave you left over money for lunch! Yay! Canmake kinda reminds me of a time when I was 10 or 11 and Bonnie Bell was the epitome of fine cosmetics and if you had a lipgloss from Bonnie Bell you were the height of fashion, style, and sophistication (or maybe that was just me feeling this way hmmm). MuseTV Presents: A Spotlight On Canmake Cosmetics Canmake has both an English and a Japanese site. For some odd reason or another I enjoy visiting the Japanese site more than the American site, don’t ask me why, we’ve already established I could be mental. Canmake’s site is pretty darn helpful as they have diagrams for application all over the bloody place! I love user friendly sites don’t you? This isn’t something you’ll find in any brand stateside so enjoy the helpfulness of the Japanese and take advantage of the great tutorials and how to’s on some of these sites because I personally find them very helpful and just awesome! Canmake has a HUGE catalog of goodies and I only have a few of the items they carry! The entire line is pretty darn big. They carry a little bit of everything. Glosses, Blushes, Skincare, Perfume, Etc… One item that I failed to mention in my video that deserves a good healthy rave would be the Cheek Gradation. Basically this is a highlighter not a blush, which means don’t try wearing it by it’s lonesome, it’s not nearly pigmented enough to make any difference on a bare skinned face. Apply your blush and afterwards apply the Cheek Gradation of your choice and Presto! Chango! You’ll glow and elude a soft dewy look! Yum! The Gradations I’ve used are 01, 04 (we’ll take more about 04 in a second), and 02. Basically the Gradations give me a soft sparkle after using my blush and a cheaper Bobbi Brown Shimmer Brick effect. I liked all the ones I have but my favorite would be the limited edition color 04. I don’t normally like a bronzed look and 04 gives the appearance of being a somewhat bronzy color however, upon using it, you’ll find out that it’s the most pigmented of all the Gradations that Canmake makes. It could possibly be used alone as a blusher (I haven’t tried that yet). 04 oringally started out as a limited edition shade but my little eye spies it on both the Japanese and the American site so if you have the means try and grab this gem! The Cheek Gradations run about $7 bucks each and hey if you’re really wanting a Bobbi Brown Shimmer Brick but the price seems just a little too much right now…spend $7 and get yourself a Canmake Cheek Gradation and call it a day ? The Muse loves them and recommends them fully! Canmake Cheek Graduations 01, 04, and 02 Canmake makes quite a few different shadows, most of which I’ve tried. Sadly, you can’t expect too much from a Canmake shadow. Shadows are a good texture but they are very, very sheer depending on which shadow series you end up purchasing! The first shadows I’ll discuss are the Eye Nuanace Trios. These are tiny circular palettes that include three very workable shades! I should say that if you aren’t a fan of pigmented shadows or you like a sheer, no nonsense, minimalist look, these are great! I’ve used these on many occasions when I am just not up for a full on eye makeup look! The trios always have colors that work well together so if you enjoy colors that are neatly organized you’ll love these! I have six of these and my favorite of the lot is 11. The combos of green and yellow are just lovely and it goes on for a pretty nice look! Canmake Eye Nuance 03, 14, 11, 12, and 09 Oooo this guy got left out of the group picture my mistake ? Canmake Eye Nuance in 15 Overall, I’d say for around $5 you get what you pay for. If you have the means to get them do add them to you cart however, don’t pay more than retail for them! That’d be a waste! Next up on the eyeshadow line would be a favorite of mine, the Metallic Eyes single shadows. These little guys are great! They pack a nice sparkle to them and are pretty nicely pigmented for the price of $4.50 or so! I use these as a highbrow highlighter or an all over color wash. They go on pretty heavy with the first stroke and you can build the intensity as little or as much as you like! I give these a high recommendation because they do exactly what they promise! Canmake Metallic Eyeshadow 01, 11, and 08 Another that falls into my favorite list is the Glitter Eye palettes. These are pretty cute palettes. What I failed to mention earlier is the packaging these all come in is really tiny and small so it makes great for toting around! Now the Glitter Eye palettes are a favorite however, you have to be aware that some colors are more pigmented and others are very sheer. These are a tad on the grainy side, think the middle color in the Lunasol Geminate Eye Palettes , of course it’s not nearly as bad as that but as you get deeper into these palettes it gets a bit grainy. Most of the colors I can’t use alone for a look unless I really want a minimal no makeup look but I do use them as washes of colors to prep my eye area or as a highbrow highlighter and they work a treat! Purchase 06 or 05 if you want to wear these alone as those are the most pigmented I’ve come across for these! For $5 a pop these are worth getting one or two of just to try! The Muse recommends them! Canmake Glitter Eye Palette 06, 05, 04, 01, and 02 Almost done with shadows! Two more to go ? Next up the Dual Sparkle Shadow from Canmake. These are very sheer, so sheer they may be transparent. I don’t get too much sparkle from these but the good news is they do a great wash of color to prep my eye area for something that packs a better punch. I can’t say I don’t recommend buying these because I actually do. At about $4.50 you can’t afford not to at least try one or two! The colors offered are pretty nice and the shadows have a good, smooth texture to them. Canmake Dual Sparkle Shadow 03 and 02 Finally on our list is another favorite of mine! The Glow Twin color are pretty darn pigmented for the price of $5.50 each. These are fantastic for a really, super quick make-up look! Darn good multitasking shadow in that you can create a simple look, use them as highbrow highlighters, use them as color washes, or even dip a blush brush in and powder your cheeks with them for some sparkle! The texture is very smooth and almost creamy when applied. I find that the top color has a bit more shimmer than the bottom color. The bottom color almost appears matte in texture compared to the top! I really like these and give them a big thumbs up ? Canmake Glow Twin Color Shadows 03 and 02 Canmake has a really nice size line of glosses! I’ve only tried the Lip Essence and it goes right onto the recommendations list. It’s one of the few Japanese Brands that I’ve seen a sponge applicator with, as much as I like the spatula style applicator, sometimes it’s nice to have a sponge one ? Canmake Lip Essence Colors: Lip Essence and 02 The gloss is nice and slick minus any tacky, sticky feelings! The colors are very nice and you can wear them alone for a nice wash of gloss, shine, and a tiny bit of color. My favorite is 02 it gives me a nice reddish pink kissed look! $6 or so each and the Muse says it’s a steal for a great gloss! Our Canmake Spotlight comes to an end with the Super Glitter Liner! Looking for a cheap inexpensive glitter liner? Well, here it is! Works just as well as the MAC Glitter Liners, or Too Faced, or Pop, or any of the other designer brands that put out Glitter Liners ? Canmake Super Glitter Liners 01, 03, and Limited Editon 04 These liners are about $5 each and are perfect for adding a little sparkle to your lower and upper eye line! Wanna get the most bang for your buck? Use them as a liner, use them to smooth onto your lashes for a bit of sparkle, use by patting ont your shadow for some extra POP! Another fine product from Canmake! That’s all for today my friends! I hope you enjoyed getting to know more about my favorite inexpensive brand of cosmetic, Canmake! If you have any questions do give a shout and I’m happy to answer ? Reader’s Request: Angels On Bare Skin Tutorial By Isabella Muse on October 4, 2007 4 Comments in Lush , MuseTV , Reader's Request , Skincare , Tutorials A lovely reader left a wonderful comment for the Muse and had asked a question in regards to Lush and using Angels on Bare Skin. I’ve discussed Lush a plenty on my blog as it’s part of my main skincare/bodycare/haircare regime so I pimp it as much as possible as I’ve had such brilliant results with it and of course when it works good the Muse must pass that info onto all you lovely ladies ? I’m positive you recall my rather long post about Lush prior to this but if you happened to miss it do click here and have a look! Now her question was about a product called Angels on Bare Skin. Angels on Bare Skin is a Preservative Free Face Cleanser. First time users may be confused how exactly to use it! So…here’s a tutorial for Stephanie and anyone else who was interested in the best way to use Angels on Bare Skin! Stephanie thanks for your comments and your question! I hope this helps! MuseTV Presents: Angels on Bare Skin Tutorial (If the video doesn’t play right away please try back in a few) Spotlight Week Continues But First a Word from Our Sponsors! By Isabella Muse on October 4, 2007 5 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Japanese Brands , MuseTV , Spotlights Hello there! My Spotlight on Japanese Cosmetics will continue sometime later today or tonight depending on how busy I am ? While you’re waiting for the newest entry please check out one of my old Spotlights! Click below to view it! MuseTV Presents: A Spotlight on Majolica Majorca Enjoy! The Inner Geek Minus the Cosmetic Geek By Isabella Muse on October 4, 2007 Leave a Comment in Babbling Bits , Of Geeks , Pieces of Life If you happen to be as geeky as the Muse you’ll enjoy this clip I came across while wondering around on Wil Wheaton’s blog this morning! Absolutely nothing to do with cosmetics but I really need a good laugh and a smile today and most times when I am reading Wil’s blog or seeing some keynote he’s done here and there I just have to laugh! Seriously, who doesn’t love a Geek that’s animated when speaking? My favorite part is the “Enterprise” reference! Enjoy! Just to add I’ve seen Wil speak at several conventions, etc..prior to this and to watch it on video and see it in person is probably quite different but you can still feel his “life” in his words! MuseTV Presents: Spotlight on Lavshuca By Isabella Muse on October 3, 2007 12 Comments in Japanese Brands , Lavshuca , Spotlights I know quite a few people were excited and eager for the Lavshuca video! So here it is ladies! MuseTV Presents: A Spotlight On Lavshuca Cosmetics Lavshuca, like T’estimo, Tiffa, KATE, etc..is disturbed by Kanebo . You’ll do well to remember the name Kanebo because they put out some fantastic cosmetic brands! Lavshuca falls into my favorite group and I adore it! The brand is girlish and sweet and packs a whole lot of wonderful into such delicate packaging! I haven’t run across many items in the line that I don’t love but aside from those the rest have been amazing in the long run and the products are aces with the Muse! On the top of my list of Lavshuca products would have to be the Eye Color Select palettes. These palettes have four separate eye colors that just work. I can’t say enough about how I love palettes that have colors that just work! This is a no brainer! I don’t have to use a whole lot of imagination, I don’t have to be confused with which color would go with the other, etc…the palette has four colors and all four just work together. One fantastic thing about Japanese cosmetics is that most all brands come with a great tutorial for application so if you’re somehow confused about what color should be where have no fear there are simple instructions right on the back of the packaging or on the website that will guide your hand in perfect application using the palette (Of course the instructions are in Japanese but their is a diagram with colors labeled as 1,2,3, etc…). Eye Color Select Palette I believe I have all of the Eye Color Select palettes and each one is more perfect than the last! The colors are packed full of shimmer which by now is obviously something you know I love. The palettes are pigmented and the packaging is so sweet and pretty! The price is just right as well! BU1, PU2, and BR1 PK1, PU1, and BR2 I highly recommend nabbing these. Several shops online sell Lavshuca and the most reasonable I’ve come across would be Adam Beauty , JPmon , and Hi Japan . Palettes on these sites run from $14 USD or so. Since we are on the topic of eyeshadow we might as well discuss Lavshuca’s latest palettes the Grade Color Select. I think myself and a few others were wondering if Grade Color Select would be replacing the Eye Color Select palettes. At first it was unclear if this was a new style packaging or a new product. I’m happy to report that upon Grade Color Select’s release late this summer (for Lavshuca’s Fall Collection) that they also introduced a new Eye Color Select color which put my mind at ease that my beloved Eye Color Select palettes are here to stay (for now). Lavshua Grade Color Select Palette Grade Color Select is not nearly as good as the Eye Color Select but in their own right they have alot going on for them! The palettes are designed a bit different in mind and possibly easier in regards to the look you’ll be accomplishing with these palettes. Basically it’s pretty mapped in which are the shadows, which is the base color, and which is the liner. The base in these palettes is possibly my favorite item when prepping my eye area and I tend to use the base as an all over wash of color even when I am not using the rest of the colors in that particular palette! It’s a nice shimmering shade that’s perfect for highbrow highlighting and just an all over color to begin your eye look! Unlike many Japanese brands, the base color, is in fact a powder and not a cream. These palettes aren’t as full of shimmer as the Eye Color Select palettes not to say they don’t contain shimmer, they do, just not as much as their sister palette. The liner is pretty versatile in that it can be used as a shadow if you please. The entire palette is definately pigmented and long wearing but still I must say that the Eye Color Selects are far better in quality, pigment, and shimmer. The palette style is much more easier to work with than the Eye Color Select in my opinion. I like the straight across color design and as cute as the “flower blossom” look is on the Eye Color Select I have a bit of a hard time when working around each color. These are lined up in a neat row and make my application much easier! They are, of course, cute as pie too! I’m always in high debate with myself which design of the palettes I like more of the two and I lean slightly towards the Grade Eye Select as a favorite in style. They are smaller than a credit card and so smart and sweet to tote around for touch ups! The colors all work perfectly together. Price wise they are the same as the Eye Color Select and run from $14 USD or so! PU1, BR1, and PK1 GN1, BU1, and BE1 I definately recommend these but if you have to choose between the two styles of palettes my heart lays with the Eye Color Select for shimmer quality. Lavshuca makes a very cute, compact, and sweet lipstick entitled Jewel Lips. Now there are several reasons to love this great product. Believe it or not the main reason to love it would be it’s size! When I had purchased my very first Jewel Lipstick I had thought it was a full size product however, upon receiving it I was shocked to see it was actually a tiny, mini lipstick! Why is this exciting? It’s exciting because I have many lipsticks and glosses in my collection and these are just the right size! Does anyone truly get through a full size lipstick? Even when my collection was far smaller than it is today I don’t think I ever got through a full size lipstick! These make for easy storage, little waste, and are just cute as a button! What more could a girl want? Lavshuca Jewel Lips Lipstick The colors are pretty outstanding and they go on very smoothly with plenty of moisture! There are plenty of American brands that promise moisturizing lipstick but I’ve never across one that actually came through on the claim. These go on with a slightly slick feeling, so, gloss is entirely optional as you already have a nice sheen of color! The colors aren’t at all heavy so if you enjoy a more minimal, natural look these would be perfect for you. Price wise they are about $9 USD each which is kinda sorta steep depending on how you think about. We can all nab a lipstick from MAC for a few dollars more but we won’t get a cute packaged item for that price ? Lavshuca Jewel Lips Lipstick compared to a MAC full size Lipstick I recommend these highly if you have a rather large collection or just love cute, girlish items! Color Conc Rouge is the next item on the Lavshuca block and it gets my poor review sadly. I so wanted to love these! Please click here to view my prior impressions of this lipgloss! Lavshuca’s Color Conc Rogue Lipgloss PK2, RD2, BR1, and RD1 There isn’t much to say about Lavshuca’s newest gloss without rehashing what I had said in a previous review of the gloss. They are very cute in packaging but the product itself is a mystery in regards to application and getting a smooth, even look. It’s still in debate whether the formula of the gloss is at fault or the actual package design. Read my prior blog to see how I felt about these glosses! I’m always on the look out for the next best thing to make my eyes pop. Lavshuca has a great line of glitter mascara that’s just great! They have two colors available for these mascaras, one being a silver and the other a multicolor bluish purple color. Basically you use these on top of your regular mascara. Apply a coat of your favorite mascara, wait a sec for it to dry, and apply a coat of the Lavshuca glitter mascara. Ahhh..perfect sparkling eyelashes! The mascara basically encrusts your eyelashes with fine particles of glitter that, when caught by the light make your lashes sparkle and shine! Lavshuca Glitter Mascara The application is a breeze due to the nice bend in the mascara wand! Don’t be scared by this as it really doesn’t make you appear over done in any way! It’s a great product for around the holidays but it’s also equally very wearable for day to day use. Overall, I adore these and can’t recommend them enough! I just wish they had more colors available ? Finally on our list is the Lavshuca liner. I’m not normally a big fan of liquid liner. When I wear liner it’s normally either pot form or pencil with a few rare exceptions! The Lavshuca liquid liner is pretty darn fantastic and personally I think it’s great for women that either are liner beginners or have a problem applying liner. Lavshuca Liquid Eyeliner Pencil The liner applicator is very, very, very thin and skinny. It’s one of the thinest applicators I’ve seen in all my cosmetic travels. Don’t let it fool you into thinking it can’t create a large line it can multitask it’s way into applying a thin line of product or a larger dramatic line. The liner is pretty much a snap to use because of it’s ultra skinny applicator in my opinion. The Muse highly recommends this for beginners and advanced users alike! A product not featured in my video would be the Lavshuca Loose Powder. Lavshuca creates a loose powder that is similar in fashion to the Jill Stuart line! In this case it’s a sparkling loose powder with a cute ribboned puff. Pretty much on the same level as the Jill Stuart Loose Powder. It’s nothing that I don’t already have in regards to a powder but I think the packaging is ultra cute and the powder itself gives a lovely sheen to a complete makeup look! As much as I love Lavshuca it’s not without it’s flaws in my humblest opinion. One of which would be the blush. I’ve tried two styles of Lavshuca blushes one of which was the Cheek Select (no longer available) and the other would be their single blush line. Now as fantastic and wonderful as the line is they have somehow failed in the blush category. I know several people who liked both the Cheek Select and Single Blushes sadly, I can not lay claim to loving these products. Lavshuca Single Blush Lavshuca Cheek Selects (Top Row) and Single Blushes (Bottom Row) The blushes lack pigment and are far to sheer for the Muse! So one product, in my opinion, to skip, would be the blush. In the future I have high hopes Lavshuca will introduce a better blush lineup but for now I’m steering clear of what is available ? I hope you enjoyed learning more about this wonderful little Japanese Brand! If you have any questions do comment away! If you happen to own any of these products please let us know which and why you love them! Tomorrow I’ll be exploring a new Japanese Brand until then I bid you good night!""]",bff08a6369440121b1aca4000b55797b1c189694,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4268,
"['MuseTV Presents: Spotlight on Jill Stuart Cosmetics By Isabella Muse on October 1, 2007 7 Comments in Japanese Brands , Jill Stuart , MuseTV , Spotlights Work is swamped this week and I’ve been staying late! But I didn’t forget about you lovely ladies so here, as promised, the kick off of the first day of Japanese Cosmetics Week! I’m quite a girly girl in all aspects which means if it’s pretty I am all over it! As women, we are lucky enough to have an array of brands to choose from. Brands that run from practical and conventional, to cute and girlish, to plain and simple, and finally some brands can boast elegance and style. Jill Stuart is one brand that can most definately lay claim to elegance, style, and so much more. The sheer gorgeous packaging on a Jill Stuart product guarantees it’s bringing you the pretty as well as a high quality make-up item! I’m a great lover of many brands but I can’t honestly say I’ve run into any brands that are more beautiful and feminine than this line of cosmetics. I love being able to have a gorgeous product to use AND display on my vanity! You’re not only getting a beautiful make-up item to wear on your face but also an item that is presented in such a way that it’s outwardly beautiful to behold as well as use! I can honestly admit if the product happened to be of a shabby quality, which it is not, I would still want the items for the cute compacts and jars they come in. Possibly a waste of money but I must say the packaging most definately sells the product in this case. Their is no question that the product is a good one but I imagine a good portion of the sales are generated by fancy, lovely presentation! MuseTV Presents: A Spotlight On Jill Stuart Cosmetics Jill Stuart Blushes Jill Stuart has an array of loose powder blush to choose from, at the moment the general catalog contains 9 colors that are, to me, flattering on most skin types! The blushes overall are good quality items. The texture is like nothing I’m run across stateside. It’s a very chalky, thin powder. It goes on quite flawlessly if you get the correct color. If you happen to choose an unflattering shade chances are the flawless finish to the blush will actually look chalky and flaky. I have five of the nine colors and have only run across one that didn’t particularly work well for me which was orange plush but it’s a small problem that can easily be redeemed by applying a blusher over orange plush during application. These blushes come as I said loose and in a fancy plastic jar with their own brush. The jar itself can easily be mistaken for glass if you display it on your vanity but of course, upon picking it up, it’s only plastic. Don’t let the plastic put you off, it takes nothing away from the lovely packaging! Glowing Red, Cherry Frost and Aurora Rose Pink Passion and Orange Plush Each brush that comes with the blushes is quite good quality with no shedding problems. They are soft, solid brushes that work well with this style of powder blush! Application is as easy as applying your BareMineral foundation, swirl, dap, brush on! I’ve heard mixed reviews about application problems with the blush, I’ve experienced no such problems! Each jar of loose powder blush runs about $26 USD. Once your blush is gone you can purchase a replacement bag of the blush but I’m sadly unsure what the cost is for that! Overall I love the blush and highly recommend it with glowing cheeks ? Jill Stuart Loose Powder The Jill Stuart Loose Powder comes in a similar jar as the blushes but a bit on the larger side. The powder comes in four different formulas which are shine, sparkle, natural and glow. I’ve only tried one of the four and that would be sparkle. The powder comes with a cute powder puff applicator and I personally use this as a finishing powder after I’ve completely my look. It creates a sheer sparkle effect much like Bare Escentuals gossamer face powders. If you’re not a lover of sparkle and shimmer this is perfectly fine to use because it’s very sheer minus the disco ball effect! The powder runs about $38 USD. It’s a perfectly great powder and gets my high rating! Loose Powder Blush in Sparkle Jill Stuart Eye Shadow Palettes At the moment Jill Stuart has released seven eyeshadow palettes which contain four shimmering shadows in each compact. The textures of the shadows are on par with T’estimo palettes . The texture is silky smooth and application is a breeze as the powder smooths on easily. Color intensity depends on many layers of the shadow you apply. One layer will give you a nice, gentle wash of color while two to three layers will give you a more dramatic, intense eye look. The colors are sparkley and full of shimmer. I think, like other brands, the compacts sometimes come across with a strange combination of colors that give the appearance they won’t work together very well. Finding looks to come up with using some of these may prove difficult but with a little imagination you can create a fantastic eye look! The compacts are extremely beautiful but unconventional to use outside of your home. If you’re looking for a compact to throw in your bag for touch-ups I strongly suggest looking elsewhere. The palettes are easy to scratch up if you stow them away in a purse or a make-up bag. The price per a palette is around $43 USD. I adore these and can’t give them a big enough thumbs up! Jill Stuart Pressed Powder Jill Stuart has a line of pressed powders for every skin type. These are not foundation powders but just a pressed finishing powder or a powder you can use for quick touch ups. This formula, like the loose powder, comes in natural, shine, and sparkle. I only own one of the three and that would be…you guessed it..sparkle. The sparkle powder doesn’t have much in the way of sparkle however I find it works fantastic when touching up under your eyes or powdering an oily forehead or a shiny nose! It comes in, of course, an elegant compact with sponge applicator. Cost wise this carries a high price tag of $45 USD but is well worth it! The powder isn’t an absolute must have but it is a nice conversation piece. You can probably skip it if you’re low on cash but if you happen to have the extra money I strongly suggest nabbing one or two! Jill Stuart Pressed Powder Blush Finally, last but not least I give you the Jill Stuart Pressed Powder Blushes! There was much excitement and fanfare when these were introduced and many people were eager to get their hands on them. You can see why they were so eagerly anticipated. The compact is a gorgeous silver affair with a detachable silver jeweled brush! Our first views of these had many people worried about the practicality of having a brush that hung from a compact. How would we apply a blush with a brush hanging from the side? How would we store it? So many questions and a bit of disappointment for all! However, after further pictures were released in magazines and on blogs, much to our relief, we learned the brush was in fact detachable. The brush clips right off of the compact making for easy application and simple storage! The brush’s first reviews were poor ones. It was reviewed as being stiff and hard in texture but to my relief, upon getting my compacts, I found the brush was not so bad and quite soft without any shedding of any kind much like the loose powder brush but a little stiffer! I can’t review the blush as it’s just been too pretty to touch as of yet but I can tell you that I’ve heard various review in poor favor of this! It was awaited patiently and eagerly and when it finally got to shops and was purchased a majority of the purchasers were disappointed and cried out their dismay at the fact that the blushes were so sheer with very minimal pigment! I’ve come across more bad reviews than I have good but again, I can’t speak for myself as I’m still in the phase of stroking it lovely and telling it how gorgeous it is and quickly putting it back in my beauty vault! Blushes run about $38 USD. I’d recommend nabbing one just for the packaging alone if you have some extra cash! If not wait for the Muse to use hers and of course she’ll give you her honest opinion of it! Jill Stuart carries a full range of cosmetics which includes glosses, lipsticks, single eyeshadows, face care, and more… Check out the website by clicking here . I know of two online shops that carry the line but the prices are not what you’ll be paying retail sadly. Those shops are: Bobodave and Ichibankao Prices increases go from anywhere from $5-$25 on top of retail cost. You can find certain items on E-bay but again prices are jacked up! Most all my Jill Stuart was purchased by friends and shipped to me via airmail so if you happen to have a friend living in Japan that makes life easier and cheaper! Well… That’s it ? I hope you enjoyed exploring Jill Stuart cosmetics! Check back tomorrow for a new Japanese Brand Spotlight! Stay Tuned tomorrow for an FOTD using Jill Stuart Cosmetics! You may also enjoy...

"['MuseTV Presents: Spotlight on Visee Cosmetics By Isabella Muse on October 2, 2007 8 Comments in Japanese Brands , MuseTV , Spotlights , Visee Hey pretties! Well it’s that time again! Today’s Spotlight I’m bringing you some lovely Visee goodies to please and entice! Lucky for you I did a majority of my blogging during free time on Sunday night because I have been swamped silly this week with work! MuseTV Presents: A Spotlight On Visee Cosmetics You can visit the Visee website by clicking here . Visee is pretty much a virgin brand to me as I’ve only tried two products in the entire line! The good news is it’s brought to us by our lovely friends at Kose, the Muse likey Kose cosmetics! The palettes I’ve discussed in my video and the ones I will post pictures of in a moment have been reviewed by the masses and enjoyed by all and might the Muse add her two cents to that and say that she agrees with everything great and good that’s been said about these palettes! They are superb and well worth the cash! The palettes will set you back a mere $19 and change (USD) and with that donation to Visee you get yourself a brilliant shimmering, sparkley packed shadow quad that’s sure to make your eyes pop and dance in delight! Visee Jewel Crushed Eyes The palettes are pretty much on par with T’estimo and Jill Stuart and maybe..shhh..don’t tell anyone…possibly better. If you’re really a big fan of shimmer these shadows bring that and more! The thing about these is they are not airbrushed with a thin line of shimmer as some palettes are. The shimmer in these is right down to the core! Some brands do a thin airbrushing of shimmer ontop of the shadows, which for me, is obviously to score sales. In this case you’ll find that the shadows are just as they are from first use to last use, full of fine particles of glitter and shimmery bits and pieces! Each palette contains four shadows or darker shades can be used as a liner! These have plenty of pigment, fantastic staying power, and go on with a near perfect finish. If by chance you are either tired in the morning or shadow retarded (nothing to be ashamed about!) these are easy enough to apply because all the colors just work together! Don’t you love palettes like that? Sadly, like Jill Stuart, the palettes are for at home use only! Taking these with you will scratch up the lovely case they come in but hey if that doesn’t bother you, tote them away ? Contrary to what I had said in my video a little light bulb went off in my head and I remembered that I had tried two of the Visee Aqua Shining Eyes. These were recommended to me by a wonderful little lady and friend that I always talk about (You probably guessed who by now);) Visee Aqua Shining Eyes I randomly added these to my cart when shopping one day at Adam Beauty and I ended up just loving them! I’m not a big fan of cream shadows but props has to go to these fine shadows! They dry very quickly upon application, go on evenly without creasing, and have enough glittery bits to keep the Muse happy well into the day and night! These are around $16 USD each. A little steep in price but they work like an absolute dream! I do believe I need the rest of the colors ? Wish List anyone? Overall the Muse highly recommends checking out the Jewel Crush Palettes and the Aqua Shining Eyes and if you’re hungry for more definately check out the rest of the line because I know at least several items that are on my wish list from this brilliant Japanese brand! Visee Cosmetics can purchased for relatively good prices at Adam Beauty ! I hope you enjoyed this adventure in Visee! Stay tuned tomorrow for the next Japanese Brand Spotlight! You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Beauty Powders By Isabella Muse on October 3, 2007 Leave a Comment in Beauty Babblings , MAC Hi! The Muse got her small haul of Beauty Powders from MAC Pro yesterday. She’s been too nuts at work to actually go in and grab them so she rang them up and paid the $7 to have them shipped to her home! At the time the actual move of paying taxes plus the additional $7 for shipping seems to make the original price tag of $21 per powder a bit much! However, she has good news, the powders are all that and a bag of chips and well worth the cost of shipping. I’ll be reviewing these shortly for your reading pleasure! The good news is they are wonderful, the bad news is I only ordered two of the eight colors and now I am seriously wanting the rest! Uh oh… Stay tuned for the review and pictures!

"['MAC Holiday Collection Price List By Isabella Muse on October 10, 2007 Leave a Comment in Friends , Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Pimpin\' , Winter Collections 2007 The Muse’s lovely mate Janice has done all the hard work for us and has been busy like a bee compiling all the prices for the Holiday Color Collections. If you have your wish list and was wondering how many pennies you’ll need to save to make that list a reality do head on over to Specktra Blog and see the price list. Click! All prices are USD so if you happen to be in Europe, Asia, or some other exotic part of the world you can compare your country prices to the US prices (which I’m sure you’ll find are far more cheaper in comparison)! It’s Here! It’s Here! By Isabella Muse on October 10, 2007 2 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Givenchy , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 One of our lovely readers, Betsy, has alerted the Muse that the Givenchy Holiday Collection is for sale at Saks! The Muse wasted no time in calling Saks up and asking if she could come down and grab some of the yummies for herself! Much to my delight my MA told me I didn’t have to come down that she’d ship it all free plus load me up on some goodies! Wahoo! I couldn’t resist and I ordered the entire collection minus the nail polish (which I didn’t even know was part of the collection). SQUEAL! I can’t wait for it to arrive! I could have just gone over but it’s chilly, overcast and about to rain so while I’m driving home from work I can have visions of Diamonds and other yummie Givenchy bits run through my head! Thanks Betsy for the heads up! The Muse suggests heading out to your nearest Saks and grabbing this while the grabbing is good because I know for a fact this is going to FLY off the shelves before you can say I want it! I didn’t expect this collection for a good solid month yet and believe you me I’ve been stalking both the Saks and Sephora websites for updates! If it wasn’t for Betsy I wouldn’t have been so lucky to nab it! If you want more details on the collection do click my above link (Givenchy Holiday Collection is highlighted with an embedded link for your viewing pleasure) or head on over to visit with the Muse’s mate, Erika, to see the details on this very FINE collection! Click! Keep your eyes peeled for an early Holiday FOTD using this collection PLUS nice, juicy pictures and reviews when it arrives! Tis’ The Season for ""Mini"" Gift Sets By Isabella Muse on October 10, 2007 7 Comments in Bare Escentuals , Holiday Collections 2007 , Lorac , Smashbox , Stila , Tarte , Urban Decay I’m noticing a major trend in the cosmetic gift giving selection this year. That’d trend would be minis! Yay! I mean we obviously love full size products but hell don’t we love mini versions that we can tuck in our purses and makeup bags for touch ups here and there and everywhere? Urban Decay has graced us with it’s mini 24/7 Kit which you can check out by clicking here . Benefit has it’s new Powder Pop! palette available which contains mini versions of it’s popular powder line. You can droll over it by clicking here . Stila has a mini kit of it’s lipglazes which I purchased yesterday! You can see my first impression here . And now some more minis that are popping up at Sephora for the Holiday Season! Let’s have a look. Napoleon Perdis Lip Couture Set for $35 Ok so these might not qualify for mini but I’m making the big assumption these aren’t the big sizes. Next on our menu the Bare Escentuals Buxom Babes Lip Polish Set for $28 Next on our list of minis would be the Bourjois Paris Kisses From Paris Set for $18 A cocktail of lipglosses for you! Lorac Mini Mini Mocktail Bar for $25 The best deal yet (I believe this might be full size but don’t quote me on that) would be the Smashbox Light Speed Lip Gloss Collection for $29! Tarte has a new trio of cheek stains as well which are $30 and entitled We Wish You Happiness Mini Cheekstain Set . This isn’t very new because Tarte has these as normal catalog items and plus they offer them almost every holiday season however from year to year the case they come in changes which is fun! Minis aren’t new to Sugar Cosmetics but they always have some of the cutest minis I’ve come across ? This one is called Glitterati and has glitter on one end a light matching cream base on the other! The set is $32. So..what’s so great about minis anyway? Well minis are great for toting around for touch ups plus they are so lightweight that they fit in the smallest of places which makes for easy storage! You also get a slew of variety and bang for your buck by purchasing these sets! It’s such a great way to try several items in one cute kit. Get shopping ? Grab some of these as gifts while you’re at it! theBalm Overshadow Review By Isabella Muse on October 10, 2007 1 Comment in theBalm As much as I wanted to wait for Sephora’s Friend and Family Discount to take place I couldn’t do it and my lemmings got the better of me! Thus I ended up purchasing all of the new Overshadows from theBalm. Really! Honest! I did try to refrain but they were so tempting in their cute little pots all shimmery and glimmering! I think I heard them whisper, “buy me, buy me”…Oh wait maybe that was just me whispering it to myself. I had previously blogged about these gems and you can read my first impression here . These are $14 each so they aren’t going to break the bank too much and a little goes a long way. There are four colors available and of course yours truly, had a hard time firguring out which I wanted so all four somehow got plopped into my cart. The shadows are super pigmented and can easily be worn as a shadow if you so choose but you’ll be nicely rewarded if you use them as per the instructions which would be over your shadow. I find that these work a treat on spicing up matte shadows (I don’t have too many matte shadows but these do a great job of taking matte into wow) or adding that extra bit of sparkle you need to make your eyes pop! If you’re a glitter hater these are not for you as they have tons of yummie shimmery bits and pieces to keep the Muse very happy! These are a snap to use and a tiny bit on your brush is enough to light up your eyes and take any old eyeshadow and turn into a new sparkling shade! The four shades available are: If You’re Rich, I’m Single This is a mauve shimmer but it can pass for almost brown in color. Works perfect over purples, browns, and blacks. No Money, No Honey My favorite of the lot. This is a shimmering gold color and works well on top of yellows, oranges, pinks, blacks, and browns. Work Is Overrated Another fav of mine this is a shimmering light pink color and works well over golds, browns, pinks, and purples. You Buy, I’ll Fly Yet another fav of mine this one is a gorgeous shimmering cooper shade and works fantastic on top of brown mainly! It also works well on oranges and yellows. I have to say even if the quality didn’t sell me I’d probably be so diseased as to purchase them for the mega cute packaging! Each pot has a different glamorous girl on the case which really adds a sweet touch to the cosmetic ? The Muse recommends them! Cynthia Rowley For Avon By Isabella Muse on October 9, 2007 2 Comments in Avon , Fall Collections 2007 As some of you may or may not know Cynthia Rowley had a cosmetic collection out sometime ago. You can read about it by heading over to PJ’s site. A wonderful article with pictures await you at A Touch of Blusher ! Click! When I heard that Avon was doing a new collection with Cynthia Rowley I went into want mode as I had read PJ’s article and was intrigued plus the cute design of the packaging, as always, sold me. Aside from mark I have never tried anything Avon prior to this that I know of…maybe a lipbalm or something ages ago? I can’t really recall every buying any Avon before this. I do ADORE mark and give it a big hearty recommendation but Avon I know nearly nothing about. The bad news is Avon sucks in regards to delivery. The entire process of ordering online and receiving the Cynthia Rowley Collection I ordered for myself and a friend took about two weeks I believe or more. First of all the order took about a week to arrive which is fine since that’s about the time it takes Urban Decay to get my goodies to me (standard delivery). Second rant I have with Avon is the fact that two powders arrived broken into a zillion pieces ? However, I can’t rant too much as a short call to customer service and they told me keep the broken powders and we’ll send two new ones out right away! Another week went by and finally I got the powders. The third major, major rant I have with Avon is that all the cosmetics I ordered appeared used. The boxes were crushed, the shadows had little chips in them, the lipstick had a small crack, and the brush on one of my glosses was all twisted up. To say I was pissed is an understatement. This particularly bothered me because half this order was for a good friend and I didn’t want her thinking that I was opening her items up and tried them or something! After all this drama I have to give a really, really surprised and great review for the entire Cynthia Rowley Collection. For the price I was expecting it all to be utter rubbish and a complete waste of cash but I’m happy to say even though the ordering process was traumatic in the long run it was worth it for the cosmetics! My friend and I ended up ordering practically the same items aside from the Finishing Powder and I’m looking forward to hearing her reviews on these products as we almost always agree in regards to cosmetics. The first item I’d like review since I just mentioned it is the Finishing Powder. I can’t begin to say how properly pleased I am with this. The powder has somewhat the same finish as Raycious powder. It’s a light, natural color that should be flattering on light and medium skin types. It did an excellent job of covering up my very weary, tired eyes! Plus it’s freaking $10 people! Cute little compact with ultra awesome powder for 10 bucks? Where can you find that? I was messing around after waking up this morning and just smoothed it under my eyes and on either side of my nose and I happened to glance in the mirror and thought WOW I look like I got 15 hours of sleep and drank about 25 glasses of water! My skin was looking happy! It comes with a cheesy, thin application sponge but as thin and crummy as it is it does the job and smooths on the powder perfectly! The powder has the words Pretty! embedded in it which is just the cute extra touch that the Muse always loves. So what do I think? I think I need back up! Two thumbs way up! Cynthia Rowley For Avon Finishing Powder Two eyeshadow quads are available and at first glance I was thinking uh-oh old lady shadows (I’m old I shouldn’t say that!). The second thought that popped into my head was these are SO not going to work together. But I thought what the hell for $8 bucks I wasn’t going broke by getting both! The two choices available are Plum Orchid and Very Violet. I haven’t tried Very Violet but I can give a healthy go ahead on Plum Orchid. The colors are pigmented enough and they look quite natural and elegant and yes they work together just fine! Much to my utter delight the back of the packaging has a nifty little “how to” for applying these and if you follow the instructions you end up with a pretty nice Autumn eye look! A bit understated for me but nice none the less. I’m shocked! How delightful! $8 dollars for a cool quad! Cynthia Rowley for Avon Eyeshadow Palette Very Violet and Plum Orchid The collection also happens to have a brush set available and again my skeptical little mind was thinking how horrible these would be! But I’m happy to report that the brush wallet is cute as hell with a little mirror and the brushes are awesome! I’m particularly loving the big chunky powder brush this set came with! Three brushes and a brush wallet sets you back $15! The eyeshadow brush is fast becoming a favorite as well with it’s tiny slant it fits into my crease and contours my eye perfectly! No shedding and these are quite soft. Sweet! Cynthia Rowley for Avon Brush Set I picked up a lipstick and some glosses as well and again, the Muse is shocked right out of her socks how great they are! The lipstick color could possibly become a favorite of mine. I ordered Plum Orchid (four other shades are available) and it’s a luscious shade for the cooler weather and works with the entire look that the quads and rest of the collection aims to create. The lipstick is super moisturizing, applies slickly and looks beautiful on! And guess what..it cost me $4.50!!!!!!!!!! Cynthia Rowley for Avon Lipstick Next I tried the glosses and again how great are these! Slick, pigmented, and perfect! The glosses are just right for applying by themselves. I don’t need to stain my lips or use lipstick prior to slicking these on. The color is so bold that it goes on perfectly without the aid of an extra color under it. The two colors I got were Plum Orchid and Very Violet (all these names that are the same are confusing me). Applying Plum Orchid on top of the lip color I got makes my lips pop up and say Hellooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo there! Cynthia Rowley Lipgloss Finally, the best for last, the all over face powders! I got both of these bad boys and really I think this was the one thing that had originally tempted me to purchase the collection. And I’m happy to say my original line of thought was correct these are wonderful! I got both the light/medium and the dark/medium colors and both are great! These aren’t pigmented enough to wear alone but they work wonderfully over your own blush and give a bit of shimmer and finish to your face plus they are so pretty to look at! These were $10 bucks each! Hello? $10! Cynthia Rowley for Avon All Over Face Powder The line also included nail polish and blush sticks, both of which I didn’t get. Cynthia Rowley for Avon Blush Stick Cynthia Rowley for Avon Nail Varnish So…I guess this is where I apologize to Avon for being such a harsh critic and say just wow. I am still in shock that this collection is so good and so cheap. I guess I’ll be checking out the Avon website much more often! Hmmm I wonder what else I can try for dirt cheap……………..! The Muse says head on over to Avon and pick some of this line up for yourself! You can’t afford not too! Get Free Shipping using code ENTAV2007 Face of the Day using some of the Cynthia Rowley Avon Collection I’m not entirely sure why I look shocked here. Just chalk it up as I’m so cool look!

"['MuseTV Presents: Spotlight on Lavshuca By Isabella Muse on October 3, 2007 12 Comments in Japanese Brands , Lavshuca , Spotlights I know quite a few people were excited and eager for the Lavshuca video! So here it is ladies! MuseTV Presents: A Spotlight On Lavshuca Cosmetics Lavshuca, like T’estimo, Tiffa, KATE, etc..is disturbed by Kanebo . You’ll do well to remember the name Kanebo because they put out some fantastic cosmetic brands! Lavshuca falls into my favorite group and I adore it! The brand is girlish and sweet and packs a whole lot of wonderful into such delicate packaging! I haven’t run across many items in the line that I don’t love but aside from those the rest have been amazing in the long run and the products are aces with the Muse! On the top of my list of Lavshuca products would have to be the Eye Color Select palettes. These palettes have four separate eye colors that just work. I can’t say enough about how I love palettes that have colors that just work! This is a no brainer! I don’t have to use a whole lot of imagination, I don’t have to be confused with which color would go with the other, etc…the palette has four colors and all four just work together. One fantastic thing about Japanese cosmetics is that most all brands come with a great tutorial for application so if you’re somehow confused about what color should be where have no fear there are simple instructions right on the back of the packaging or on the website that will guide your hand in perfect application using the palette (Of course the instructions are in Japanese but their is a diagram with colors labeled as 1,2,3, etc…). Eye Color Select Palette I believe I have all of the Eye Color Select palettes and each one is more perfect than the last! The colors are packed full of shimmer which by now is obviously something you know I love. The palettes are pigmented and the packaging is so sweet and pretty! The price is just right as well! BU1, PU2, and BR1 PK1, PU1, and BR2 I highly recommend nabbing these. Several shops online sell Lavshuca and the most reasonable I’ve come across would be Adam Beauty , JPmon , and Hi Japan . Palettes on these sites run from $14 USD or so. Since we are on the topic of eyeshadow we might as well discuss Lavshuca’s latest palettes the Grade Color Select. I think myself and a few others were wondering if Grade Color Select would be replacing the Eye Color Select palettes. At first it was unclear if this was a new style packaging or a new product. I’m happy to report that upon Grade Color Select’s release late this summer (for Lavshuca’s Fall Collection) that they also introduced a new Eye Color Select color which put my mind at ease that my beloved Eye Color Select palettes are here to stay (for now). Lavshua Grade Color Select Palette Grade Color Select is not nearly as good as the Eye Color Select but in their own right they have alot going on for them! The palettes are designed a bit different in mind and possibly easier in regards to the look you’ll be accomplishing with these palettes. Basically it’s pretty mapped in which are the shadows, which is the base color, and which is the liner. The base in these palettes is possibly my favorite item when prepping my eye area and I tend to use the base as an all over wash of color even when I am not using the rest of the colors in that particular palette! It’s a nice shimmering shade that’s perfect for highbrow highlighting and just an all over color to begin your eye look! Unlike many Japanese brands, the base color, is in fact a powder and not a cream. These palettes aren’t as full of shimmer as the Eye Color Select palettes not to say they don’t contain shimmer, they do, just not as much as their sister palette. The liner is pretty versatile in that it can be used as a shadow if you please. The entire palette is definately pigmented and long wearing but still I must say that the Eye Color Selects are far better in quality, pigment, and shimmer. The palette style is much more easier to work with than the Eye Color Select in my opinion. I like the straight across color design and as cute as the “flower blossom” look is on the Eye Color Select I have a bit of a hard time when working around each color. These are lined up in a neat row and make my application much easier! They are, of course, cute as pie too! I’m always in high debate with myself which design of the palettes I like more of the two and I lean slightly towards the Grade Eye Select as a favorite in style. They are smaller than a credit card and so smart and sweet to tote around for touch ups! The colors all work perfectly together. Price wise they are the same as the Eye Color Select and run from $14 USD or so! PU1, BR1, and PK1 GN1, BU1, and BE1 I definately recommend these but if you have to choose between the two styles of palettes my heart lays with the Eye Color Select for shimmer quality. Lavshuca makes a very cute, compact, and sweet lipstick entitled Jewel Lips. Now there are several reasons to love this great product. Believe it or not the main reason to love it would be it’s size! When I had purchased my very first Jewel Lipstick I had thought it was a full size product however, upon receiving it I was shocked to see it was actually a tiny, mini lipstick! Why is this exciting? It’s exciting because I have many lipsticks and glosses in my collection and these are just the right size! Does anyone truly get through a full size lipstick? Even when my collection was far smaller than it is today I don’t think I ever got through a full size lipstick! These make for easy storage, little waste, and are just cute as a button! What more could a girl want? Lavshuca Jewel Lips Lipstick The colors are pretty outstanding and they go on very smoothly with plenty of moisture! There are plenty of American brands that promise moisturizing lipstick but I’ve never across one that actually came through on the claim. These go on with a slightly slick feeling, so, gloss is entirely optional as you already have a nice sheen of color! The colors aren’t at all heavy so if you enjoy a more minimal, natural look these would be perfect for you. Price wise they are about $9 USD each which is kinda sorta steep depending on how you think about. We can all nab a lipstick from MAC for a few dollars more but we won’t get a cute packaged item for that price ? Lavshuca Jewel Lips Lipstick compared to a MAC full size Lipstick I recommend these highly if you have a rather large collection or just love cute, girlish items! Color Conc Rouge is the next item on the Lavshuca block and it gets my poor review sadly. I so wanted to love these! Please click here to view my prior impressions of this lipgloss! Lavshuca’s Color Conc Rogue Lipgloss PK2, RD2, BR1, and RD1 There isn’t much to say about Lavshuca’s newest gloss without rehashing what I had said in a previous review of the gloss. They are very cute in packaging but the product itself is a mystery in regards to application and getting a smooth, even look. It’s still in debate whether the formula of the gloss is at fault or the actual package design. Read my prior blog to see how I felt about these glosses! I’m always on the look out for the next best thing to make my eyes pop. Lavshuca has a great line of glitter mascara that’s just great! They have two colors available for these mascaras, one being a silver and the other a multicolor bluish purple color. Basically you use these on top of your regular mascara. Apply a coat of your favorite mascara, wait a sec for it to dry, and apply a coat of the Lavshuca glitter mascara. Ahhh..perfect sparkling eyelashes! The mascara basically encrusts your eyelashes with fine particles of glitter that, when caught by the light make your lashes sparkle and shine! Lavshuca Glitter Mascara The application is a breeze due to the nice bend in the mascara wand! Don’t be scared by this as it really doesn’t make you appear over done in any way! It’s a great product for around the holidays but it’s also equally very wearable for day to day use. Overall, I adore these and can’t recommend them enough! I just wish they had more colors available ? Finally on our list is the Lavshuca liner. I’m not normally a big fan of liquid liner. When I wear liner it’s normally either pot form or pencil with a few rare exceptions! The Lavshuca liquid liner is pretty darn fantastic and personally I think it’s great for women that either are liner beginners or have a problem applying liner. Lavshuca Liquid Eyeliner Pencil The liner applicator is very, very, very thin and skinny. It’s one of the thinest applicators I’ve seen in all my cosmetic travels. Don’t let it fool you into thinking it can’t create a large line it can multitask it’s way into applying a thin line of product or a larger dramatic line. The liner is pretty much a snap to use because of it’s ultra skinny applicator in my opinion. The Muse highly recommends this for beginners and advanced users alike! A product not featured in my video would be the Lavshuca Loose Powder. Lavshuca creates a loose powder that is similar in fashion to the Jill Stuart line! In this case it’s a sparkling loose powder with a cute ribboned puff. Pretty much on the same level as the Jill Stuart Loose Powder. It’s nothing that I don’t already have in regards to a powder but I think the packaging is ultra cute and the powder itself gives a lovely sheen to a complete makeup look! As much as I love Lavshuca it’s not without it’s flaws in my humblest opinion. One of which would be the blush. I’ve tried two styles of Lavshuca blushes one of which was the Cheek Select (no longer available) and the other would be their single blush line. Now as fantastic and wonderful as the line is they have somehow failed in the blush category. I know several people who liked both the Cheek Select and Single Blushes sadly, I can not lay claim to loving these products. Lavshuca Single Blush Lavshuca Cheek Selects (Top Row) and Single Blushes (Bottom Row) The blushes lack pigment and are far to sheer for the Muse! So one product, in my opinion, to skip, would be the blush. In the future I have high hopes Lavshuca will introduce a better blush lineup but for now I’m steering clear of what is available ? I hope you enjoyed learning more about this wonderful little Japanese Brand! If you have any questions do comment away! If you happen to own any of these products please let us know which and why you love them! Tomorrow I’ll be exploring a new Japanese Brand until then I bid you good night! You may also enjoy...

By Isabella Muse on May 5, 2008 8 Comments in Beauty Babblings , MAC Since MAC Mutiny Pigment is my current obsession I’ve been looking through my collection for various items to pair up with it!

"['Philosophy Essential Oil Sets By Isabella Muse on October 11, 2007 Leave a Comment in Philosophy Remember way back in the day when The Body Shop had essential oils for relieving stress, waking you up, calming you, etc… I remember being in High School at the time and one in particular that my friends and I had toted around was a wake up temple oil that smelled of cooling peppermint. You’d take it and place a bit on the temples of your head and on the pulses of your wrist and supposedly this would keep you awake through long lectures (in my case it was the religious study ones that put me out like a light! I went to an all girls private catholic school which meant an hour and a half of religious instruction twice a week!). Anyway. Philosophy has recaptured this idea and are selling essential oil sets. I find the entire idea sort of intriguing. Especially since the descriptions sound really interesting! Logically speaking I don’t think the smell of lavender is going to make me sleep but hey at least it comes in a cute gift box right? They have two sets available with two oils per gift set (.12oz) for $25. Philosophy ‘Stuffies & Stressies’ has two oils with congestion-relieving eucalyptus to give you the pick me up you need during the yucky flu season! Of course ‘Stuffies and Stressies also promises to relieve anxiety and stress! The Muse needs a liter of this stuff as her anxiety and stress levels are full on lately. Obviously, I’m not buying the stress and anxiety relief but I am intrigued to see if it helps my stuffy nose during a harsh cold! Philosophy ‘Sleepies & Weepies’ is another set the Muse can use as it promises to fight fatigue *yawn*! It also happens to ease depression and make you happy! And just as I was saying earlier, it does all this through the cooling scent of peppermint and citrus oils! Cool right? Well the bad news is if you’re depressed, tired, feeling stressed, or just sad I hate to say it but I doubt essential oils are going to help but the good news is these make damn cute novelty gifts ? Wanna relieve your stuffies, stressies, sleepies and weepies? Head on over to Nordstrom to purchase these cute gift sets for yourself! Stila Holiday Collection Palettes By Isabella Muse on October 11, 2007 Leave a Comment in Holiday Collections 2007 , Stila , Winter Collections 2007 I dare do say that I spy with my little eye on the Stila site the new holiday palettes. The Muse isn’t thrilled with these, but who knows I may be upon actually seeing them in person, at the moment they really aren’t anything I am writing home about. I know at least one other Stila Fan that probably won’t think much of these either. The palettes are $34 each and available for purchase right now on the Stila site! If you’re yearning these it’s possible the 20% off coupon is still working! Click here to get the details about the coupon! Each palette contains three eyeshadows, one blush, and a lipgloss. Stila Guinevere’s Deluxe Palette Stila Scarlett’s Deluxe Palette Stila’s also added up a few holiday sets which can be seen by clicking here. An interesting, but boring, Holiday collection for Stila. I’m pretty happy, this saves me money when I am yearning many, many, many other things at the moment! Guerlain Forever Gold By Isabella Muse on October 11, 2007 2 Comments in Guerlain , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 Quickie Post…I know I know but I’m not yet off the Guerlain topic! How sick! Wanted to update you on the size of the Forever Gold which is 0.35oz for $72! EEP! Kinda small..do we need two? The Muse finds it difficult to practice control when forever and gold are in the same sentence….! Logically speaking I’m curvy and round so I can’t dust myself with 0.35oz of gold in one go. I may need 10 of these to cover my entire body! If you happen to be in the Muse’s gorgeous city head on over to Saks and have a look at the collection its now available for your purchasing pleasure! Guerlain Holiday 2007 Price List By Isabella Muse on October 11, 2007 Leave a Comment in Guerlain , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 Hello there! Here’s a quickie compiled list of the prices for the Guerlain Holiday Collection. I was curious how much Forever Gold was going to be and had nightmares about it being $175 or something obscene. I’m happy to report that the collection is affordable. If you’re an avid collection you’ll consider this not bad for the price range. I really expected much worst. Here’s a look (all prices USD) Forever Gold $72 Meteorites Gold Temptation Pearls $49 Golden Lash Topcoat Mascara $30 Ombre Eclat Euo & Liner $50 I didn’t get the prices for the gloss or the lipsticks but they are normally in the $26-30 range. The only thing that is far above my price range is the pressed meteorites powder which is a whopping $155 per compact. I figured as much since the pressed compacts are normally obscene amounts at Neiman’s. I was hopeful that the compact would be somewhere in the $99 range but ado we can’t have everything in life and sometimes we have to know our own limits. The good news is for about $200 (plus tax) you can nab a majority of the important pieces in the collection and make them your very own! What are you getting? Love this collection? Hate it? Talk to me! Comment box at the ready!

Nordstrom and Saks Beauty Event By Isabella Muse on October 10, 2007 2 Comments in Steals and Deals I should have blogged about this way earlier but I’ve had so much going on in my life at the moment it utterly slipped the mind and didn’t pop back into my brain until I was discussing it with a reader and friend on here! Now is a good a time as any to nab the new holiday collections at Saks and Nordstrom since both are having their Beauty Events at the same time. I’m sure you all know the drill ? but if not the Muse brings you some Steals and Deals a little early! Head on over to Saks and spend $100 on Beauty Items or More (Might the Muse suggest the Givenchy Holiday Collection ?) and recieve a tote bag stuffed with all sorts of yummie goodies! Enter promo code REELBEAUTY And of course Nordies competes with that offer and counteracts with it’s deluxe beauty tote filled with juicy morsels after you spend $95 or more (Might the Muse suggest Alexander Mcqueen for MAC ?). Your gift will automatically enter your cart as soon as your total reaches $95! Purchasing cosmetics is always a joy for the Muse but getting something free while doing the purchasing is truly lovely! Happy Shopping!

They have fittingly named it Ghost. Ghost supposedly has a floral, lily of the valley scent. Count the Muse as being intrigued about the scent and wanting a bottle. I’m not normally one for floral scents but I’m curious. Prices are not set yet and this is available via North America Mail Order only I believe. If you want to nab a bottle head on over to the following link and fill out your information to be alerted when it’ll be available for purchase! Hopefully we don’t all love it because it is limited edition so when it’s gone, sadly it’s gone (either that or this is a gimmick to get us all to buy 10 bottles each and drown ourselves in a shower gel we might not even like the smell of).

Wish list anyone? Guerlain Holiday 2007 Collection By Isabella Muse on October 14, 2007 4 Comments in First Impressions , Guerlain , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 I have to say that it’s been a long while in between collections that have wow’ed me. As much as I adore cosmetics I can’t honestly say any collections from the past few Holiday seasons have really knocked me back. Last year Givenchy’s Christmas collection was gorgeous but nothing that I got insanely excited over. MAC’s collection last year was lovely as well (and this year) but again nothing to make me bounce off the walls! Of course I always look forward to the Holiday season to see what will be released and this year there is no exception. Two collections have not failed to wow me this year and I’m pleased with both and can highly recommend them to you. If you’re on a tight budget this year or just not looking to spend a whole lot on cosmetics my personal picks of the season would have to be from Guerlain and Givenchy’s line up. They have truly out done themselves. You can see the Givenchy Holiday Collection by clicking here . Now… On to the good stuff ? Givenchy brings us Diamonds but Guerlain went for a completely opposite effect. Guerlain brought us the gold. My collection arrived in the mail today and to say I’m excited would be an understatement. The collection is beautiful and this is truly something you’re going to want to add to your cosmetic stash if you’re serious (and have a passion) about owning some seriously posh makeup items. The star of the show is Forever Gold of course. A radiant shimmering gold powder for your face and body housed in a gorgeous vintage style perfume bottle. The powder is amazingly soft, silky and just pure perfection. I was slightly discouraged after hearing there was only .35oz in the bottle but it didn’t prevent me from wanting this. Of course seeing pictures that look larger than life probably have you skeptical about its size or at least I was worried about it. I purchased this quite blindfolded without seeing it in person but really its a spray bottle full of gold shimmering powder how much more do I need to know before saying I WANT THAT! I expected to be disappointed and even set myself up for disappointment. I had convinced myself that it would arrive and be the size of a nail polish bottle or smaller! I was shockingly delighted to see that it’s much larger. It’s about 1.7oz in size (50ML) which is fantastic because you can sit it on your vanity and convince yourself that 1.7oz’s of the most gorgeous shimmering powder awaits you (when in reality you’re only getting about .35oz or less of powder). Would I recommend this? Of course. No question about it. If you have the money to spend on it I’d highly recommend nabbing it. I haven’t even sprayed the bottle yet and I know how gorgeous it is. I can only review this from the stand point of ripping off the protective label on the sprayer. The label had a quite a large bit of powder on it. I’m, of course, on protective mode so the general idea of spraying this and wasting any is a big no no right now. However, I took the label and rubbed it on my arm and the shimmer is outstanding on this. I’m not entirely sure I can get away with actually spraying it on my face but it’s going to make my eyes pop and my cleavage will thankfully be shimmering gold in color this Holiday Season! I’m worried that the sprayer will clog up but aside from that the entire package is just beautiful and if you want to spoil yourself this holiday season do consider grabbing this! The second item I got is the Ombre Eclat Duo and Liner. The compact is a heavy gold with pretty white snowflakes on the cover. It comes encased in a velvet bag and of course is a magnet for fingerprints. The two shadows you’ll receive are a light shimmering white gold color and a deeper gold color. Both appear very pigmented but I can’t say for sure yet. The liner seems slightly out of place as it’s a bronze brownish color but I believe it could work well with the two eyeshadows. If you’re a serious collector you’re going to want to add this to your stash for sure. It’s very pretty. The compact is just gorgeous and of course the makeup that lays within is equally outstanding! What would a Guerlain collection be without Meteorites? For the Holiday Collection and keeping with the gold theme, Guerlain gives us Gold Temptation Meteorites. The box is gold with an identical snowflake image as the Ombre Exclat Duo and Liner compact. For some odd reasons the meteorites appear just a bit smaller in this box than the normal size ones but that’s ok it makes for easier application in my opinion. They are highly shimmering beads of a beige gold color. Again, perfection. Lastly I ended up with the Gold Lash Top Coat Mascara which is a golden coat to apply over your mascara. Again, fitting with the theme, the casing matches perfectly with all of the pieces in the collection and is gold in color with the snowflake emblem. The applicator is brushless so you’ll be slipping this across your lashes after mascara application to add a shimmering shade of gold to your lashes! Very, Very nice! Some items I didn’t get were the lipsticks and gold gloss all of which were lovely but not something I absolutely had to HAVE. One item I also couldn’t even begin to think about affording was the pressed meteorites powder. At $155 the price tag screamed at me to say absolutely NOT! However, my lovely friend and reader, Betsy, pointed out that it is refillable so it’s not entirely a bad deal but still sometimes the Muse has to know her limits and a $155 palette is a limit she can’t reach even if she wants it badly! Overall, it’s very difficult for the Muse to pick out one or two must haves from this collection because they are all simply stunning. As much as I adore the Givenchy Collection I’m loving (and possibly favoring) the Guerlain Collection. If you’re on a budget I’d highly recommend removing yourself from any department stores that may contain a Guerlain counter. Because you’ll see all of this in person and most definately have a hard time saying NO! The Muse strongly recommends selling off a kidney, a child, or a soul on E-bay (you know I’m kidding of course!) to nab yourself this glamorous collection! The Ghosts of Christmas Past Collections By Isabella Muse on October 14, 2007 6 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Benefit , Bobbi Brown , Bourjois Paris , Givenchy , MAC , Pout , Smashbox , Stila , Tarte From year to year as collections come and go and change and rearrange I like to look over what I’ve stashed away over the years and compare price increases, quality, quantity, etc… Some of my most favorite cosmetic possessions are from Holiday Collections and every year I am always excited to see what new items will be introduced. Allow me to take you back on a journey into Christmas Past Collections! Maybe some of these are in your own personal stash, maybe you remember when they were released, and maybe you are still lemming them and hoping to find them on MUA or E-bay or some out of the way place that may still carry that particular item that has been on your wish list since it’s release from a Christmas that’s since past. I’ve only taken on a few select pieces from my Holiday Collections! Hell if I did them all it’d make a bible of an entry ? Do enjoy the ones I’ve included in this post! This year Smashbox hasn’t a single item that I’ve been tempted by but I remember being quite excited about last year’s Holiday Collection that was entitled Winter Nights. The collection consisted of two parts, single cosmetic items plus kits and palettes named after legendary nightclubs. Smashbox The Winter Lights Series Avalon Consisted of two double-ended mini eyeshadow and shimmer duos. The picture of Avalon can be seen above on the far right hand side of the group photo! Spider Club Consisted of a white leather carrying case which included a double ended palette (one side lips and one side shadow) plus three brushes Troubadour Consisted of a similar white leather carrying case as the Spider Club and included a lipgloss trio and lip pencil The Derby Consisted of a cream eyeliner trio and a flat end liner brush The single cosmetics collection included a soft lights powder in Smashing Halo which was a soft shimmering white that showed up pink on your cheeks! It’s gorgeous and remains one of my favorite items from Christmas Past Collections! Also released was a shadow duo in shimmering shades of white and brown, a duo cream liner which included a shimmering gray liner and a shimmering white liner, and finally another of my favorite items, the Lux Shimmer Overlay which is a shimmering gold gel that can be apply to lips, eyes, and face. Smashing Halo, Dual Liner, Dual Shadow and Lux Shimmer Overlay Smashbox, in my opinion, has not released a nicer collection than this in a long time. I can’t recall a time that Stila has introduced a Holiday collection that I have actually wanted. It’s been too long a time that I’ve really had any hard lemmings for a Stila holiday collection! This year is another year of snore and thankfully so because it saves me money in the long run for other more interesting collections. I believe it was two years ago (or last year I can’t really recall which) that the Stila Star Studded Event All Over Shimmer coffret was introduced. This consisted of four shimmers in a gorgeous box with a draw that pulled out to reveal four brushes! Really a lovely set! Stila Star Studded Event All Over Shimmer Set Stila also did the grand collection which really needs no introduction from me. As you can see with your eyes while it was titled so! The Stila Grand Collection Benefit has since resorted to just throwing together gift sets that include age old favorites. They take a little dandelion, a bit of bad gal mascara, a lipgloss or two and slap it in a brightly wrapped bag, mark down the price and Happy Holidays! Not that there is anything wrong with Benefit’s version of Holiday cheer but a special product or two is always appreciated by the masses. Two years ago (again I believe it was two! I have so many collections I tend to forget when items were released) they had introduced two pretty little kits one of which the Muse happened to pick up which was entitled Dancing Darlings. The kit included 4 mini shimmering lip glosses in gold, pink, bronze, and white! Benefit I speak for all of us please do something like this again! Tarte introduced a quad of four shimmers in a hard plastic case which was lovely! I believe this was around 2-3 years ago and I remember happily being able to purchase this at such a nice price because the shimmers are normally expensive and here was a little kit that included not 1 but 4 shades! The glistening powders you received were cute little pots that could stack into the plastic case all together! Tarte also graced us with the Glitterati set which contained a mascara, silver glitter mascara, and silver glitter liner! Tarte’s Glitterati Set Tarte’s Glistening Powder Set While in jolly old England last year around the middle of November I went to Pout and purchased three palettes from their very interesting Holiday lineup! One of which I don’t believe was introduced here in the states. Masque de Jour, Masque de La Nuit, and Spoilt Senseless each included a trio of shadows, a cream blush, a gloss, and a brush for application! I have high hopes that Pout will do a similar style palette this year! I believe, correct me if I am wrong, the Limited Edition Gold Shimmer Brick from Bobbi Brown was introduced last holiday season! However, I purchased mine in the summer at Nordies who still had one lonely palette in stock. This year I’m actually kind of excited to see the pink limited edition Shimmer Brick they are putting out! Ahhhh Givenchy. I remember going nuts searching out the Prismissime palette all over this bloody city. It was sold out virtually everywhere but by some chance I got it around the first week of January when it popped back in stock at the Times Square Sephora plus I happened to nab the elusive Lash Pearls to go with it! Bare Escentuals gave us the lovely Rose Gossmaer Gift Set which the Muse uses daily and adores! This year they bring us a new set entitled Precious Diamonds which is virtually the same style kit with a new exciting powder. Bourjois Paris gave us thee most gorgeous shimmering shades of gold and silver loose powder shadows with it’s Suivez mon Regard Eyeshadows. Dior gave us a few backstage items that the Muse had trouble locating and finally, bless her weak heart, she was able to locate both at Nordies. The coveted Lash Pearls and the limited edition Glitter Top Coat in Gold for lips (they have since released a silver version as well). I can remember a time when Dior was a bit of a funky, fun brand. It’s since been introducing more elegant, couture themed palettes. The Diorglam palettes were on of the few items that were released in both colors something us statesiders are not used to getting! Prescriptives got exciting one year with it’s Startlight Shimmer Powder and Brush set! I can remember lemming this little set quite hard ? Around this time last year MAC surprised us with it’s anticipated Couture collection and the masses ran to the stores to snatch up these highly coveted items! The Muse only happened to get four pieces from the set. Those were the Richmetal Highlighter and believe you me she regrets not nabbing more from the collection! And finally MAC introduced us to it’s Formal Black Holiday collection which included gorgeous palettes in lovely black compacts with a swinging beaded tassel and the elegance of a compact that made you the envy of your friends when you whipped it out for a touch up! I hope you enjoyed this look at Christmas Past I’ll bring you Christmas Present in a future entry. It’s only October but already the shops are filling up with an array of treats to tempt and tease your credit card and cash right out of your very wallet. Heck, you don’t even have to hand over either they will gladly walk right up to the counter for you and make their own purchases ? What are your favorite Holiday Collections from Christmas Past? Have any of these? Love them? Tell me what you miss or want back! My ears are always open. Bare Escentuals Smoky ""V"" Eye Kit Review By Isabella Muse on October 12, 2007 7 Comments in Bare Escentuals You may remember my prior post a week or two ago about this kit. If not click on over here to have a peek! Bare Escentuals Smoky “V” Eye Kit I just got this in the mail today so I thought I’d review it all for you. Originally I was excited about the very interesting little brush this came with but after trying it for myself I’m up in arms about how I feel about the entire kit, including the brush. I’m very confused whether I like this or find it useless. Mixed emotions here and it’s very difficult to say whether I can recommend this or say don’t bother. At this point I’m sort of leaning towards don’t bother but I am also feeling like this is a kinda sorta ok kit for people that find application difficult. Hell I’m clueless when it comes to doing makeup application but I think I do ok and my blending isn’t all that bad. Um..wow this is a tough one. I guess I should start by saying that the eyeshadow this came with, pacific heights, is boring as sin and not very pigmented. You really have to work this bad boy in to get some color payment on your lid. The glimmer it came with, 1990’s, is a very nice shimmering shade of purple and pretty pigmented. I guess this evens out the score because to achieve the look you need a good light shade (pacific heights in this case) and a nice darker shade (1990’s). 1990’s Glimmer and Pacific Heights Eyeshadow The instructions are perfect on this. I really, really give them props for good presentation on the packaging with the instructions being simple and easy to follow and very detailed! The brush doesn’t work exactly the way I thought it would. It’s a bit difficult to use and it makes my completed smoky eye look more like a bruised eye. Maybe I need a bit of practice with the brush. Overall I’d say the brush could be a handy tool with a bit of practice. The look it creates is similar to the picture of the girl on the cover which is a purple slanted upwards eye look. However, I’m not really getting a smoked out look to my eye after completing all the steps and using what was provided in the kit. At least not my idea of a smoky eye look. Can you achieve this with another brush in your collection? Yes. Do you need the kit and brush to do it? No. I guess I’d say I recommend this for people who haven’t quite mastered eyeshadow application correctly. The instructions are a pure treat and explain in simple terms exactly how to achieve the look! The brush is good and I think it may have the potential to be great with a little practice using it. The glimmer is nice but I’m not so impressed with the shadow. Nay or Yay? Nay. I’d skip it. Unless, like I said, you want to learn more about shadow application and have the bucks to lay out! Only digging the brush? No problem! Check E-bay!

"['Spooky Time at Lush Cosmetics By Isabella Muse on October 10, 2007 11 Comments in Lush , Shower & Bath Lush Cosmetics is getting into the spirit of Halloween and is offering a Limited Edition Shower Gel to haunt your shower this season! They have fittingly named it Ghost. Ghost supposedly has a floral, lily of the valley scent. Count the Muse as being intrigued about the scent and wanting a bottle. I’m not normally one for floral scents but I’m curious. Prices are not set yet and this is available via North America Mail Order only I believe. If you want to nab a bottle head on over to the following link and fill out your information to be alerted when it’ll be available for purchase!

"['""I Love Dior"" Deluxe Holiday Palette By Isabella Muse on October 12, 2007 4 Comments in Dior , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 Wait a second…. The Muse decided to get the keys to her beauty vault and pull out her Dior D’Trick palette to compare it to the new “I Love Dior” Deluxe Holiday Palette. Upon originally seeing the deluxe holiday palette I was racing around in circles in excitement but today I wandered onto Nordstrom to see a close up picture of it and to my shock it appears that the “I Love Dior” palette is the Dior D’Trick palette in new clothes! Hey stop the train I wanna get off! This is so not right! How could they crush my desire for this so easily? What the hell? Everything looks exactly the same right down to the lipgloss!!!!!!! I purchased my Dior D’Trick palette from the YesAsia beauty section one year ago sometime in July or August. Granted stateside we get none of the special bits that Asia and Europe get. I guess I shouldn’t be all that surprised that the palette is identical to the D’Trick. I have to say I actually like the D’Trick’s pretty pink packaging better anyway! I believe I paid $72 for the D’Trick and I’m curious to see what the “I Love Dior” will cost. I also have one other palette similar in style that was purchased in a UK airport at a Duty Free shop. That has entirely different colors than these two thankfully. Hmmmmm…interesting…. Maybe I’m wrong but it appears these are one and the same. Which is good news because I have a few dollars extra to add to my growing MAC wish list but it’s also crushingly disappointing as I adore Dior. Le sigh. Count the Muse heartbroken! Back to the vault to stow away the D’Trick palette! “I Love Dior” Deluxe Holiday Palette as seen on Nordstrom Dior D’Trick Palette Tarte We Wish You Wealth Palette By Isabella Muse on October 12, 2007 4 Comments in First Impressions , Holiday Collections 2007 , Tarte , Winter Collections 2007 Hello There! Well it’s quite dark out and quite cold (38 degrees) and the Muse thinks that Friday night is best spent home in her warm, cozy bed with her powerbook tucked safely on her lap and Torchwood playing on her telly (God Bless the man that made Tivo otherwise the Muse would be unable to rewind and hit pause on scenes that contain John Barrowman in all his glory). While the Muse catches up on episodes she missed what better way to spend some of her time then blogging about her favorite topic…..Cosmetics ? I had mentioned I ordered the Tarte We Wish You Wealth Palette for a friend this week and it arrived just today tucked safely in a Sephora box with a bright red ribbon tied around it! Many of you asked after this palette and wondered if it was worth purchasing and if I was going to purchase it, etc… This is not on my wish list and I won’t be purchasing it however I can give you my first impression from viewing my friend’s palette and let you know if I think you should or should not get it. First of all obviously if you’re a Tarte fan this is of course on your wish list and by default you’re in want mode. If you’re not a Tarte fan or never purchased Tarte prior to this I’d say here’s your really big chance to nab something that Tarte is virtually giving away for free (it’s that cheap! In price not quality!). There is ALOT of hype around this palette and if you happen to spend every waking moment (or some waking moments) on MUA you know how crazed people are about this. It’s gathering a cult following and it’s reaching Sephora Blockbuster Palette heights (you remember that drama last year don’t you?! No? E-mail I’ll happily provide you with the delightful details). Now the hype is there for obvious reasons and that would be price, quality, quantity, and of course obsessive compulsive cosmetic collector’s NEED (I have this disease). First of all price. The palette is $52 and with that amount you get yourself quite a stash of delightful goodies to play with. Let’s discuss quantity and what you’re getting for your $52 bucks. Here’s what’s inside the palette: 16 brand-new eyeshadows (Full Size) 16 brand-new lipglosses 4 gel eyeliners 4 cheek stains 3 24/7 lip sheers Eyelid primer Luminizer Eyeshadow & eyelining brushes Now if you take 16 and you multiply it by $17 each per a shadow you come out with the grand old total of $272. Tarte is basically giving you $272 worth of shadows in this palette. They want to be nice to you this holiday season it seems. The colors aren’t particularly eye popping but they are soft and shimmering shades that can create a perfectly elegant look. So you’re getting 16 eyeshadows plus they decided to throw in a buncha of other awesome stuff. Ok so the thing that caught my eye was the lipglosses they are perfectly wearable and quite gorgeous shades. Can you count to 16? That’s what they slapped in here. 16 glosses to go with those 16 shadows I just mentioned! The rest my friends is just bonus material. Cheek Stains, Eye Liners, and more await you in this palette. I’d say you can create quite a nice group of looks just using the one palette all year long! I have tried Tarte shadows and I can report they are pigmented, I’ve tried their glosses as well and can say those too are of high quality. I’ve tried many Tarte products and all are good solid products so the quality is there in this palette for sure! Overall this is a sweet palette however it does have it’s faults. I’m not loving how it opens. It slides open on a slant and folds back. And I think this has the potential to make a major mess sadly. All I can say is if you get it use caution when opening and closing it. The design of the case is pretty gorgeous. It’s quilted and deep, dark purple in color. Beautiful really. I’m duly impressed at the small size and all that’s tucked inside of it. One tiny stupid pet peeve would be that they only included one sponge applicator for the eyeshadows. Sheesh couldn’t they throw in like 6? 3 on either side or something? What the heck can you do with one? I also picked up the We Wish You Happiness Mini Cheek Stain Kit with this (Again, not mine for a friend) and I’m so chuffed at the cute box these come in. It’s purple and quilted too and goes fantastic with the We Wish You Wealth palette! It has a gold snap, large mirror, and will be a perfect little case for carrying around makeup and other bits! This is the best case they have done with the minis! I’m really loving this guy. Overall, I’d say this is a perfect gift for someone or for yourself. It’s ALOT of bang for your buck and well worth a purchase. I’m personally not getting one because it’s not something I’ll make proper use of. My eyeshadow tastes run to the more extreme and as much as I am loving the glosses it’s not worth the price for me to just use the glosses! If you’re a great lover of highly shimmering shades of color than this isn’t for you. The eyeshadows do contain some shimmer but not enough to make me want them! If you’re wanting this I highly suggest nabbing it now because if the hype continues I imagine you’ll wake up sometime at the end of the month or middle of November and see it out of stock, never to make a reappearance! Gone, disappeared, finished. And you’ll sadly hang your head and cry that you have to fulfill your need by purchasing it on E-bay for triple the price! Personally everyone is going to be reaching for this during the Sephora Friends and Family discount or at least a majority of the masses will be so don’t expect to wait till then to get it. If you’re REALLY wanting it, get it now before it’s too late. The Muse most definately recommends it for purchase! Enjoy the pics (apologies but I kept the protective film on the palette as this isn’t mine and I need to take special care of it for the special person I ordered it for!)

Sign your ‘x’ on the line! Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight! Come and trim my Christmas tree with some decorations bought at Tif-fa-ny! I really do believe in you, lets see if you believe in me! Oh my I got a bit carried away there! I was feeling the Christmas spirit as I ripped (and bit) through the fedex box that arrived on my doorstep from Saks today! Inside was Givenchy’s Diamantisimme holiday collection! Oh my the very my! Just the pick me up I needed today! I ended up getting all of the collection aside from the nail varnishes. First off, which I’m sure you’re all dying to hear about, would be the Prisme Solitaire Precious Diamond All Over Powder. What’s to say really? It’s perfection. The box is too cute for words! It’s in the shape of an engagement ring box(could possibly be more exciting than a ring lol) and inside is the most precious, glittering, shimmering powder I’ve ever had the pleasure of laying my eyes on. It’s perfectly fantastic that it’s multitasking as both a face, body, and eye powder. I love multitasking products and this is no exception to the rule. The powder is slightly grainy in texture and that, my friends, does not bother me one bit. I think I can safely say this may not make it onto my face! Bit to discoball in effect but my eyes and cleavage will thank Givenchy for such a perfect powder full of gorgeous bits of silver and white shimmer! The powder is of course pigmented so it’s not going to take a whole lot to make you look gorgeous! The only difference with this palette is there is no where to store the brush it comes with. Givenchy palettes and powders always have that nifty little bottom chamber to tuck your brush under but this sadly lacks that. The brush comes in a velvet carrying case but can’t be stored in the palette or on top of the powder. I don’t really mind because the cute ring box is adorable and totally makes up for the fact that you can’t store the brush inside it. Next up the Crystal Pop Gloss which is equally gorgeous as the powder and full of lovely shimmering bits and pieces to keep me delighted all holiday season long! Two colors are available which would be Pure Diamond and Fancy Diamond. I’m loving the Fancy Diamond the best of the two. it’s a lovely shimmering pink shade. The Pure Diamond is a clear gloss with silver, white, and tiny specks of pink shimmer! Beautiful just beautiful! According to my MA at Saks the Captiv’ Eyes Mascara is a hot seller and only three were left! It looks like an amazing mascara. It’s black with tiny specks of silver shimmer in it. Whether or not the silver will show upon application remains to be seen but it sure does look pretty! I purchased the Rogue Interdit in Rose Desire as well but this purchase was a bit blind folded. I’ve only seen photos of the collection and this item looked the least appealing! But at the risk of missing out on something major I told my MA stick that in the bag too please. I should have waited and seen it in store because it appears it’s a bit too “mod” pink for me. It’s a matte pink color and it has that weird “mod” look to me. A la Twiggy. Anyone know what I mean? I’m in high debate whether to try it or return it. If you’re ordering online don’t bother with this until you’ve seen it in store to determine if it’s the right shade for you. Last but never least would be the Lash Sparkles! Ok I’ve seen images of this as well and wasn’t sure about the application on it but assumed it would be like the Dior Lash Pearls from Christmas ’05 (Believe it was 2005 correct me if I’m wrong) and even thought I knew what to expect I’m still a tiny little bit disappointed. Application is a brush wand (instead of the plastic applicator like the Dior Lash Pearls) where you twist up and the product disperses on the brush. I always, always find these difficult to work with because too much product pushes into the brush and causes a major mess (and waste). I haven’t twisted it up so I can’t tell you how these are yet. I’m sorta at that stage where I’m being maternal towards the collection and whispering to it how pretty it is while stroking it lovingly. I don’t yet have the nerve to twist because I’m worried about product waste! As soon as I go to wear these, you my friends, will be the first to know and see what the product looks like! The Lash Sparkles can be used two ways which would be brushing them on to encrust your lashes with sparkle OR applying from the brush onto the tips of your lashes to create a beaded look. This is a nice option as the Dior Lash Pearls only gave you an option to create a beaded look due to the applicator which is to say that the Givenchy Lash Pearls from last year allowed you to do both, brushing and beading! Dior’s Lash Pearls (This too makes for tricky application! But I think that the Givenchy Brush could save me waste as compared to the Dior Lash Pearls because once it’s twisted the product has no where to go! At least with the Lash Sparkles it can be disputed on the brush and sort of saved!) Givenchy Lash Pearls Holiday ’06 (These are by far the easiest to use and I loved this entire package! I wish the new lash sparkles came the same way!) Overall this collection is stupendous and just gorgeous! If you’re on a budget I’d grab at least the powder, mascara, and lash sparkles.

"['Guerlain Holiday 2007 Price List By Isabella Muse on October 11, 2007 Leave a Comment in Guerlain , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 Hello there! Here’s a quickie compiled list of the prices for the Guerlain Holiday Collection. I was curious how much Forever Gold was going to be and had nightmares about it being $175 or something obscene. I’m happy to report that the collection is affordable. If you’re an avid collection you’ll consider this not bad for the price range. I really expected much worst. Here’s a look (all prices USD) Forever Gold $72 Meteorites Gold Temptation Pearls $49 Golden Lash Topcoat Mascara $30 Ombre Eclat Euo & Liner $50 I didn’t get the prices for the gloss or the lipsticks but they are normally in the $26-30 range. The only thing that is far above my price range is the pressed meteorites powder which is a whopping $155 per compact. I figured as much since the pressed compacts are normally obscene amounts at Neiman’s. I was hopeful that the compact would be somewhere in the $99 range but ado we can’t have everything in life and sometimes we have to know our own limits. The good news is for about $200 (plus tax) you can nab a majority of the important pieces in the collection and make them your very own! What are you getting? Love this collection? Hate it?

"['Philosophy Essential Oil Sets By Isabella Muse on October 11, 2007 Leave a Comment in Philosophy Remember way back in the day when The Body Shop had essential oils for relieving stress, waking you up, calming you, etc… I remember being in High School at the time and one in particular that my friends and I had toted around was a wake up temple oil that smelled of cooling peppermint. You’d take it and place a bit on the temples of your head and on the pulses of your wrist and supposedly this would keep you awake through long lectures (in my case it was the religious study ones that put me out like a light! I went to an all girls private catholic school which meant an hour and a half of religious instruction twice a week!). Anyway. Philosophy has recaptured this idea and are selling essential oil sets. I find the entire idea sort of intriguing. Especially since the descriptions sound really interesting! Logically speaking I don’t think the smell of lavender is going to make me sleep but hey at least it comes in a cute gift box right? They have two sets available with two oils per gift set (.12oz) for $25. Philosophy ‘Stuffies & Stressies’ has two oils with congestion-relieving eucalyptus to give you the pick me up you need during the yucky flu season! Of course ‘Stuffies and Stressies also promises to relieve anxiety and stress! The Muse needs a liter of this stuff as her anxiety and stress levels are full on lately. Obviously, I’m not buying the stress and anxiety relief but I am intrigued to see if it helps my stuffy nose during a harsh cold! Philosophy ‘Sleepies & Weepies’ is another set the Muse can use as it promises to fight fatigue *yawn*! It also happens to ease depression and make you happy! And just as I was saying earlier, it does all this through the cooling scent of peppermint and citrus oils! Cool right? Well the bad news is if you’re depressed, tired, feeling stressed, or just sad I hate to say it but I doubt essential oils are going to help but the good news is these make damn cute novelty gifts ? Wanna relieve your stuffies, stressies, sleepies and weepies? Head on over to Nordstrom to purchase these cute gift sets for yourself! You may also enjoy...

"['Early Gift Giving from Bath and Body Works By Isabella Muse on October 16, 2007 3 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Shower & Bath , Steals and Deals It’s never too early to start shopping and my little eyes have spied some nice deals on Bath and Body Works all wrapped up and ready for buying and giving! $15 will nab you a duo of a jumbo 12oz size of Hand and Body Lotion plus a Hand Soap in a cute caddy! These are available in the three popular winter scents that are always available at Bath and Body Works around the Holiday Season and those are Winter Candy Apple, Vanilla Bean Noel, and Frosted Cranberries. Personally, for $15 each these make a cute little gift for your mail lady (if you have a woman delivering your mail), something for a neighbor, a nice grab bag gift, or it’s just nice having these around for what I call “the unexpected”. We all get unexpected gifts sometimes and it’s always nice to have a little extra gift tucked away for those times when we can whip it out and offer it to the person who has unexpectedly surprised us with something sweet! These are $15 at the moment and I’m sure as the Holidays approach they’ll go back to their regular $22 price range so why not nab a few now and save some money ?

Now Christmas has arrived early and a new batch of goodies are up and available for purchase at my favorite bath shop!

Red Nose smells of sweet christmas ribbon candy with an underlay of light flowers! Yum! Frosted Star is another intriguing little bath bar to make your bathing experience a seasonal joy! This bubble bar slice smells of blackberries warmed by musk with an little twist of basil! Hm! Count the Muse as being curious about this interesting bar! Finally, a most favorite scent, Snowbelle! Snowbelle is wrapped up in a bubble bar this season and the Muse couldn’t be happier as she adores the sweet minty fresh scent of Snowbelle! Snowbelle smells of sweet, juicy berries swirled with Christmas peppermint! It’s the perfect blend of cool and sweet! Each bubble bar slice is $5.95 and shipping is free on orders of $80 or more!

"['Tarte We Wish You Wealth Palette By Isabella Muse on October 12, 2007 4 Comments in First Impressions , Holiday Collections 2007 , Tarte , Winter Collections 2007 Hello There! Well it’s quite dark out and quite cold (38 degrees) and the Muse thinks that Friday night is best spent home in her warm, cozy bed with her powerbook tucked safely on her lap and Torchwood playing on her telly (God Bless the man that made Tivo otherwise the Muse would be unable to rewind and hit pause on scenes that contain John Barrowman in all his glory). While the Muse catches up on episodes she missed what better way to spend some of her time then blogging about her favorite topic…..Cosmetics ? I had mentioned I ordered the Tarte We Wish You Wealth Palette for a friend this week and it arrived just today tucked safely in a Sephora box with a bright red ribbon tied around it! Many of you asked after this palette and wondered if it was worth purchasing and if I was going to purchase it, etc… This is not on my wish list and I won’t be purchasing it however I can give you my first impression from viewing my friend’s palette and let you know if I think you should or should not get it. First of all obviously if you’re a Tarte fan this is of course on your wish list and by default you’re in want mode. If you’re not a Tarte fan or never purchased Tarte prior to this I’d say here’s your really big chance to nab something that Tarte is virtually giving away for free (it’s that cheap! In price not quality!). There is ALOT of hype around this palette and if you happen to spend every waking moment (or some waking moments) on MUA you know how crazed people are about this. It’s gathering a cult following and it’s reaching Sephora Blockbuster Palette heights (you remember that drama last year don’t you?! No? E-mail I’ll happily provide you with the delightful details). Now the hype is there for obvious reasons and that would be price, quality, quantity, and of course obsessive compulsive cosmetic collector’s NEED (I have this disease). First of all price. The palette is $52 and with that amount you get yourself quite a stash of delightful goodies to play with. Let’s discuss quantity and what you’re getting for your $52 bucks. Here’s what’s inside the palette: 16 brand-new eyeshadows (Full Size) 16 brand-new lipglosses 4 gel eyeliners 4 cheek stains 3 24/7 lip sheers Eyelid primer Luminizer Eyeshadow & eyelining brushes Now if you take 16 and you multiply it by $17 each per a shadow you come out with the grand old total of $272. Tarte is basically giving you $272 worth of shadows in this palette. They want to be nice to you this holiday season it seems. The colors aren’t particularly eye popping but they are soft and shimmering shades that can create a perfectly elegant look. So you’re getting 16 eyeshadows plus they decided to throw in a buncha of other awesome stuff. Ok so the thing that caught my eye was the lipglosses they are perfectly wearable and quite gorgeous shades. Can you count to 16? That’s what they slapped in here. 16 glosses to go with those 16 shadows I just mentioned! The rest my friends is just bonus material. Cheek Stains, Eye Liners, and more await you in this palette. I’d say you can create quite a nice group of looks just using the one palette all year long! I have tried Tarte shadows and I can report they are pigmented, I’ve tried their glosses as well and can say those too are of high quality. I’ve tried many Tarte products and all are good solid products so the quality is there in this palette for sure! Overall this is a sweet palette however it does have it’s faults. I’m not loving how it opens. It slides open on a slant and folds back. And I think this has the potential to make a major mess sadly. All I can say is if you get it use caution when opening and closing it. The design of the case is pretty gorgeous. It’s quilted and deep, dark purple in color. Beautiful really. I’m duly impressed at the small size and all that’s tucked inside of it. One tiny stupid pet peeve would be that they only included one sponge applicator for the eyeshadows. Sheesh couldn’t they throw in like 6? 3 on either side or something? What the heck can you do with one? I also picked up the We Wish You Happiness Mini Cheek Stain Kit with this (Again, not mine for a friend) and I’m so chuffed at the cute box these come in. It’s purple and quilted too and goes fantastic with the We Wish You Wealth palette! It has a gold snap, large mirror, and will be a perfect little case for carrying around makeup and other bits! This is the best case they have done with the minis! I’m really loving this guy. Overall, I’d say this is a perfect gift for someone or for yourself. It’s ALOT of bang for your buck and well worth a purchase. I’m personally not getting one because it’s not something I’ll make proper use of. My eyeshadow tastes run to the more extreme and as much as I am loving the glosses it’s not worth the price for me to just use the glosses! If you’re a great lover of highly shimmering shades of color than this isn’t for you. The eyeshadows do contain some shimmer but not enough to make me want them! If you’re wanting this I highly suggest nabbing it now because if the hype continues I imagine you’ll wake up sometime at the end of the month or middle of November and see it out of stock, never to make a reappearance! Gone, disappeared, finished. And you’ll sadly hang your head and cry that you have to fulfill your need by purchasing it on E-bay for triple the price! Personally everyone is going to be reaching for this during the Sephora Friends and Family discount or at least a majority of the masses will be so don’t expect to wait till then to get it. If you’re REALLY wanting it, get it now before it’s too late. The Muse most definately recommends it for purchase! Enjoy the pics (apologies but I kept the protective film on the palette as this isn’t mine and I need to take special care of it for the special person I ordered it for!) Tarte’s We Wish You Wealth Palette and We Wish You Happiness Mini Cheek Stain Set 16 Full Size Eyeshadows 16 Luscious Lipglosses (My Favorite Part of the Palette) 4 gel eyeliners, 4 cheek stains, 3 24/7 lip sheers, Eyelid primer, Luminizer, and eyeshadow & eyelining brushes Palette Fully Opened Tarte’s We Wish You Happiness Mini Cheek Stain Collection You may also enjoy...

"['Philosophy Back to Nurture Deeply Replenishing Beauty Sleep Mask Review By Isabella Muse on June 30, 2015 6 Comments in Facial Mask Reviews , Muse Approved , Philosophy , Skincare Affiliate Link Purchased I am currently obsessed with Philosophy Back to Nurture Deeply Replenishing Beauty Sleep Mask ($55). This is a super rich sleep mask that replenishes moisture and hydration to skin overnight so you’ll wake up with smooth, soft, well rested skin that looks freaking incredible. Dry, dull skin? You need it! I purchased Philosophy Back to Nurture Deeply Replenishing Beauty Sleep Mask during one of Philosophy’s many sales this month (there’s a sale right now for those interested with up to 30% off your order using promo code hotsavings! It’s a tier based promo code so the more you spend the bigger the discount which ranges from 10 to 30% off your total). If you’re never used a sleep mask you should definitely read my article giving you more info on what sleeping packs or sleeping masks are . I don’t always find sleeping masks very beneficial to my normal routine and I actually prefer a regular PM moisturizer so I was highly skeptical about trying this. Sleeping masks aren’t very common in the US market but the Asian market is flooded with them and the ones I’ve tried aren’t super hydrating so I just prefer using a regular anti-aging moisturizer vs a sleeping mask. Granted, sleeping masks aren’t the end all in moisturizer but they are something nice to treat your skin to once or twice a week. But as I said most aren’t moisturizing enough for me so I don’t really bother indulging. Now, Philosophy Back to Nurture Deeply Replenishing Beauty Sleep Mask is expensive and I had my reservations about indulging but I was able to get it 40% off during a recent Philosophy sale so I felt a lot better about the price. However, I will say that at the full $55 price I would indulge again because I loved it! Philosophy skincare almost always impresses me (sometimes I get a little miss here and there but a majority of their skincare is very good to my skin!) and this is a product I feel comfortable raving about! Of course, at the moment it is a little useless to be since along with the warmer weather my skin is producing a lot more oily so I need a lot less moisturizer! But in the Winter? My skin is going to love this stuff! This is a very thick gel-like texture and it smells a lot like Miracle Worker Moisturizer with a fresh, floral scent. I use it once a week but in the Winter I imagine I’ll use it more often. I simply take a quarter size amount and I rub it gently between my fingers, now I press it gently onto my face. Don’t massage it on, you don’t want it to fully absorb, just press it gently onto your skin. You can even palm your face if you like by gently placing the palms of both your hands on your cheeks, forehead, and chin to allow the mask to absorb. It doesn’t leave a film behind and it does fully absorb as you gently work it into your skin. You can even give yourself a little massage with it should you like! Now head to sleep! In the morning, your face will feel incredible smooth and soft. This is highly moisturizing! It not only gives my skin a much needed boost of moisture but my duller skin looks brighter and well rested in the morning. Seriously, this stuff gives you that eight glasses of water look! Loves it! Big Muse Approval for this one. Dry, duller skin types need it. Philosophy Back to Nurture Deeply Replenishing Beauty Sleep Mask is available now at philosophy.com. You may also enjoy...

"[""Technical Difficulties By Isabella Muse on October 17, 2007 Leave a Comment in Babbling Bits Hello Pretties! Musings of a Muse is experiencing some slight technical difficulties that I thought you should know about. If you’re wandering around my archives (how the very dare you! Get out of my closet!) you’ll notice some of the font color on my entries is off and you’re unable to read any of it! I’m slowly switching around the html code on those entries so the text will be readable! I apologize for the problem ? It probably occurred during my big move from mySpace to Blogger! Please excuse the mess while the Muse cleans it all up nice and tidy for you! The Muse Hits Rocketqueen’s Blog By Isabella Muse on October 17, 2007 2 Comments in Pimpin' The Muse would like to say hello to the Rocketqueen and a big thank you and hug for featuring my review on your site! Rocketqueen’s blog looks awesome the Muse wishes she could read Swedish so she can do more than look at the pretty pictures ? You can visit with the Rocketqueen by clicking your way over here. I’m loving the green FOTD do check it out! Make Up For Ever Aqua Eyes Holiday 2007 By Isabella Muse on October 17, 2007 Leave a Comment in Holiday Collections 2007 , Make Up For Ever , Winter Collections 2007 Urban Decay’s 24/7 Travel Eyeliner set may be on your wish list this holiday season and at $29 for the lot who doesn’t want it? If you want to shell out an extra $6 you can nab the Make Up For Ever Aqua Eyes Mini Collection for $35. Make Up For Ever Aqua Eyes Mini Collection as seen on Sephora The set includes 5 mini Aqua Eyes Eyeliners in vibrant shades that are very appealing to this girl! Or you could always get both sets and call it a day! Make Up For Ever Diamonds For Ever Kit By Isabella Muse on October 17, 2007 Leave a Comment in Holiday Collections 2007 , Make Up For Ever , Winter Collections 2007 Ahh diamonds ! All our favorite brands of cosmetics are promising to bling us out this season with diamonds ? Diamonds For Ever as seen on Sephora Make Up For Ever wants in on the Diamond act so they created the lovely Diamonds For Ever Kit to make us sparkle and shine this Holiday Season! This set is $49 and includes a vanity pouch, diamond powder, diamond shadow, mascara, eyeliner, and lipgloss! For some odd reason the price tag is putting me off for some reason. You do get a good bit of product for the price but I’ve seen other kits with a bit more for my buck! My collection has a single Star Powder in it from Make Up For Ever and I must say that it’s super pigmented, blends a treat, and gives me a bit of sparkle which tempts me to purchase this collection! I’m most definitely getting into all the diamond craze and hype this season! Count the Muse as maybe wanting this cute little kit of sparkle and shine! DKNY Delicious Night By Isabella Muse on October 17, 2007 2 Comments in Fragrance Allow me to introduce you to the newest parfum in the Be Delicious collection of fragrances. DKNY Delicious Night as seen on Bloomingdale’s Website DKNY Delicious Night is available exclusively at Bloomingdale’s and is the third fragrance in the popular Be Delicious line! The notes in this sound interesting enough, Frozen Pomelo, Crushed Ginger, Blackberry Martini Accord, and Purple Freesias…. Hmmm! Could be yummie! I am a fan of the original Be Delicious but I’m not such a big fan of Red Delicious. Let’s see how big a fan of Delicious Night I’ll be ? The Muse will let you know what she thinks when she’s had a whiff of this! Want it?

"[""Chat with the Muse By Isabella Muse on October 16, 2007 11 Comments in Chat Hello there! The Muse would like to chat with you ? I guess the question to ask is do you want to chat with the Muse ? I know many of you are in Asia, Europe, and spread out across the US (and other exotic lands) so the best thing to do when arranging this chat is to ask what particular times are good for everyone! So if you’re interested in having a live chat with readers, myself, and maybe fellow Beauty Blog Members do comment and let me know times and dates you are free! I’ll choose the time and date according to how many people reply and what looks like a good time frame! The last time I held a chat only one reader, Sarah, turned up sadly and quite a few of my fellow bloggers on the Beauty Blog Network! We had a rather fabulous time (at least I think we did lol) and Sarah was an absolute joy to speak too! I know that’s because many of you are 5-6 hours off from my own time so this is a good way to see when everyone is free! Soooooooooooooooooo….. If you’d like to chat about all good things cosmetic and otherwise my ears are open! Comment box at the ready! Throw some dates and times my when we can all get together for a giggle and a babble! Bobbi Brown Forest Metallics FOTD By Isabella Muse on October 16, 2007 11 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Face of the Day , Reader's Request Gosh after a LONG time I finally got around to doing the FOTD that was requested when I originally purchased the Bobbi Brown Forest Metallics palette! You can see my prior FOTD (and review) using the Burnt Sugar Metallics Palette by clicking here . You can see my first impressions about the palettes by clicking over here . Ok….I hadn’t yet used this palette until this morning and I have to give everyone a fair warning if you haven’t used yours or if you are about to purchase this. The warning is this is a very, very, very, very dark palette. Obviously when you see the palette you’ll notice how dark the greens are but they go on even darker and it’s a bit of a challenge to create a look with this! Not to say I don’t love the palette, I most certainly do, however it is a bit hard to work with as the colors are difficult to blend correctly without the entire look looking BLACK. So a word to the wise prior to using or buying this practice caution with your application ? What I Used: Bobbi Brown Forest Metallics Palette MAC Technakohl in Jade Way KATE Gel Mascara KATE Mascara Primer Kiss Passion New York Division Eye Nuance in 08 MAC Technakohl in Black Bare Escentuals Glimmer in Lime Sana Egopri Silver Glitter Mascara Overcoat Givenchy Lash Sparkles on a Budget By Isabella Muse on October 16, 2007 2 Comments in Beauty on a Budget Givenchy Lash Sparkles aren’t so expensive at $22 per a pen but certain bits factor into that cost and the Muse will happily share those factors with you! For one thing the possibility of the Lash Sparkles selling out before you have a chance to purchase them is very high! Secondly, the pen doesn’t hold a whole lot of product and you’ll get quite a few looks from them but you’ll be wary of applying too much for fear when it’s gone it’s gone as it is limited edition (at least, as a cosmetic collector, I have that fear!). The good news is the Muse offers you some slightly cheaper ways to make your eyes sparkle and pop with glittery bits of silver without having to spend $22 or having a deep fear of using these if you did purchase them ? Some of what we’ll be discussing: For $18 you can nab yourself some Urban Decay Heavy Metal liner and swipe it across your lashes (instead of lining your eyes with it) to encrust your lashes with funky glittery bits for the holiday season (or any season you deem as a good time of the year to sparkle!). Urban Decay Heavy Metal Liner Now $18 isn’t such a big savings over $22 however you’re getting a bit more product in the liner than you are in the Lash Sparkles and it’ll last quite a while longer plus it’s not limited edition so when it’s gone you can drop by Sephora or head over to Urban Decay.com and nab yourself another one! Glam Rock would be the most fitting color in the lot that matches what you’d receive if you purchase the Givenchy Lash Sparkles. It’s silver in color and has a high sheen of glittery bits to keep you shiny and sparkley all season long! Too Faced has a similar style liner called Starry-Eyed Liquid Eyeliner and works in the same fashion as the Urban Decay liner but the price tag is a bit less! $17.50 will get your lashes all glammed up! The best color to get the same effect as the Lash Sparkles would be Ooh & Aah! Too Faced Starry-Eyed Liquid Eyeliner For $25 you can nab not one but three glitter liners that again will basically do the same thing as Givenchy’s Lash Sparkles. Sugar Cosmetics has a trio of glitter liners in blue, pink, and the perfect silver which matches the look we are trying to achieve! Sugar Cosmetics Glitterama Glitter Liquid Eyeliner Trio One of the Muse’s favorite Japanese Brand (when is a Japanese Brand not a favorite brand of mine right?), Sana, has out Shiny Mascara which is a silver overcoat to top your lashes with! It works a treat too might I add! Shiny Mascara is available in gold and silver and of course to keep with the theme of things the best way to achieve the Givenchy look would, of course, would be to get the silver one! This has a comb on applicator and makes it easy to swipe over your lashes! Sana’s Shiny Mascara can be purchased off of E-bay for around $7.99 (plus airmail shipping costs). Sana is exclusive to Japan so e-bay is the only option for purchasing at the moment however, if you have some lovely friend in Japan they can snatch you up a few and ship them your way! Sana Shiny Mascara The comb makes for easy application! If you’re willing to shell out $59 you can purchase Bare Escentuals Classic Rock or Pure Platinum kits which includes Luminous Lashes in silver toned colors to add sparkle to your lashes! At the moment Luminous Lashes is available for sale by itself but the colors available won’t achieve the look we are seeking so purchasing the kit is the only way of getting these special overcoats that are included in each kit! A slightly expensive way of getting the look but still you do get a buncha of other goodies with your purchase ? At the moment their are quite a large array of different products you can use to create the same look that Givenchy’s Lash Sparkles will give you! Some of these products may not be the cheapest however I find they contain more product for the price and therefore are appealing if you’re on a budget! As much as I adore limited edition products I also enjoy the safe, secure feeling of knowing an item I love to use will be around for a good, long while! A majority of these products offer the security of being available when you need them plus as I said they contain more product for your dollar! Get out there and glam your lashes up ? MAC Antiquitease Color By Isabella Muse on October 16, 2007 13 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 Choices, choices, choices! It all comes down to choices this Holiday season ? Antiquitease is up and available at MAC for your purchasing pleasure and will be at your local MAC counter on October 11th. The Muse hasn’t yet purchased her Alexander McQueen as of yet due to the fact that with so many MAC collections up and coming it’s difficult to decide on what to purchase and what to skip! Have I mentioned I hate deciding and making a choice? I just want it all, NOW! But realistically I need to decide what I really want as opposed to the inner demon that demands me to get it all! Soon after Antiquitease Color the rest of the line up will be releasing through October and into November which includes the brush kits, palettes, and lip sets. So it all comes down to choosing what I really need and leaving what I know I won’t use ? Antiquitease Color consists of all of the following yummie goodies: Pigment Your Ladyship Gold Stroke Sweet Sienna Mineralized Eyeshadow Duo Silversmith Earthly Riches Engaging Family Silver Mi’ Lady Lipstick Her Fancy Queen’s Sin Antiquitease Budding Lust Guilty Kiss Lipglass Majestic Red Romp Corsette Trifle Fluidline Uppity Blacktrack Fibre Rich Lash All Black Nail Lacquer Vestral White Gold Veneer We already established the Muse is mad with want for it all ? So what are you getting ? Might the Muse direct you to her favorite source for all good things MAC!

Pop Day to Play Palette By Isabella Muse on October 16, 2007 1 Comment in Holiday Collections 2007 , Pop , Winter Collections 2007 , Wish List I do indeed like the look of the new Pop Day to Play Palette ! Count the Muse as possibly adding this to her wish list ! This new limited edition palette has 24 eyeshadows that range from eye popping to soft and subdued! Lots of room for play in this palette and the colors are good enough for venturing from work to play, day to evening in a snap! $42 nabs you this wallet full of fun ? but sadly it’s out of stock at Sephora ! Keep checking back to see if it pops back soon! I’m not entirely sure about the price tag at this point but I do already own one of the Pop wallet palettes which I really like so this could possibly be worth the high price tag ? We shall see!

We all get unexpected gifts sometimes and it’s always nice to have a little extra gift tucked away for those times when we can whip it out and offer it to the person who has unexpectedly surprised us with something sweet!

"['Botched Up ""Her Fancy"" Face Chart Attempt FOTD By Isabella Muse on October 19, 2007 5 Comments in Face of the Day I felt like playing with Antiquitease this morning and I was a bit lazy so instead of thinking up how I’d use the colors I just snatched a face chart from MAC, printed it out, and went to work. Sadly it came out nothing like I had planned and I was probably better off doing my own FOTD rather then using a face chart for the look! The “Her Fancy” Face Chart is simple enough to follow but the end result is nothing like the photo sadly! Her Fancy Face Chart is available from at MAC’s website The good news is I’m more in love with Mi’ Lady than I was yesterday! It’s such a wicked little color and quite deceiving in the pot! I am a tad disappointed that it’s not the red I was hoping for but I’m still quite properly chuffed that it’s such a lovely shimmering orange/copper color! It reminds me of a subdued firespot (MAC Moonbathe) with beautiful silver sparkle! It’s just gorgeous! Sadly, this is a botched up Face of the Day, my apologies but I wanted to share it with you anyway! Got an Antiquitease FOTD you want to share with us? E-mail it to the Muse and she’ll post it up! What I Used: MAC Mi’ Lady Mineralized Eyeshadow Duo MAC Engaging Mineralized Eyeshadow Duo MAC Your Ladyship Pigment MAC Technakohl in Black MuseTV Presents: MAC Antiquitease Color By Isabella Muse on October 18, 2007 22 Comments in First Impressions , Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , MuseTV , Winter Collections 2007 MAC Antiquitease Color popped up in stores today and of course the Muse walked as fast as her little legs could carry her to get her haul of Antiquitease goodies! The entire collection is quite lovely with very few misses and quite a few hits! MAC Antiquitease I ended up purchasing the lot of mineralized shadows duos, one lipglass, one lipstick, all the pigments, the new fluidline, and a plushlash! The shadows are stunning and these are as great as the Flashtronic shadows (sorry I had a brain fart while filming the video and I had said the last shadow collection with mineralized shadows was Rushmetal! Apologies ? I had meant Flashtronic!). Almost all of the shadows have a gorgeous bold silver veining that runs through the shadow and have quite a dose of shimmer. I’ve already applied some on my eye and that silver veining contains quite a healthy pop once your brush connects with it! Gorgeous! Mi’ Lady appears to be my favorite of the bunch so far because of it’s ultra bold red and purple coloring. Yum! I’m eager to create a look with this! Don’t let the red fool you though as the color actually shows almost orange on the the eye! It’s very interesting color! Mi’ Lady Family Silver is going to a be nice base shadow or highlighter for me as the colors are lighter in this shadow as compared to the others in this collection. Mineralized Eyeshadow in Family Silver Silversmith and Engaging are both beautiful colors as well. Silversmith is a wonderful duo of silver and gold while Engaging has a very pretty peachy pink color and a bronze. Mineralized Eyeshadow in Silversmith Mineralized Eyeshadow in Engaging The only duo that has me wondering whether I am loving it or not is Earthly Riches. It’s a bit of a darker duo and I’m unsure how it’ll look but I grabbed it anyway at the risk of it selling out before I can make my mind up (I can always swap it off later if I hate it!). Mineralized Eyeshadow in Earthly Riches The star of the lipglasses and the lipsticks were the too outrageously bold red colors offered which were Red Romp and Queen’s Sin. I’m not one for red lipstick but Queen’s Sin was calling my name when I laid eyes on it! It’s quite a nice shade of red and perfect for the Holiday Season! Royal Romp is going to look amazing over it! I was in high debate whether to grab the Royal Romp Lipglass because it reminded me so much of Boundless In3D lipgloss but turns out that Royal Romp is a more subdued maroon when compared to the brighter, truer red of Boundless! Royal Romp Lipglass and Queen’s Sin Lipstick Royal Romp and Boundless (You can see the difference between the two) The pigments are all quite nice and I’m loving Your Ladyship best as it reminds me of a beefed up Provence with tons more shimmer. Gold Stroke is a nice brown with bits of gold swirled in. The website says it’s bits of red but I’m seeing gold. Sweet Sienna is a grey color with silver shimmer and again I have to disagree with the website as it says it’s a brown color with grey pearl but I don’t see any brown in it! Your Ladyship, Gold Stroke, and Sweet Sienna Finally I grabbed Uppity Fluidline which is gold in color. This will make a great base color and is perfect for the holidays and will look great combined with some of my other gold collections! Uppity Fluidline Overall, I’d say the collection is utterly wearable and very pretty! I’m loving all of it! I did skip on many of the lipglasses and lipsticks because they were just too nude in color for me so those in my opinion aren’t worth the purchase however everything else is a go and the Muse says get to your counter and grab some of this before it’s gone! The holiday collections are full on and more collections will be popping up very soon!

Today I was feeling a bit pink so I hauled out an array of products to use on this look! Sadly, I got some major fall out all over my eyes and it just didn’t want to clean up this morning! Oh well! I was discoballicious at work all day ? Okee dokee! Off to meet my mate Jen at the mall so we can grab ourselves some MAC Antiqutease! Be back soon with details! What I Used: MAC Fuchsia Pigment MAC Frost Pigment MAC Vanilla Pigment Vincent Longo Wet Diamond Shadow in Libertango Vincent Long Wet Diamond Shadow in Galaxy Mist Urban Decay Deluxe Eyeshadow in Sting Victoria’s Secret Sexy Little Things Douse me with Diamonds Eyeshadow in Dazzle Stila Smoky Palettes By Isabella Muse on October 18, 2007 4 Comments in Stila Hello World! You may recall me mentioning that the Stila site had undergone some construction and soon after it returned they had a little sale with 20% off (which is ongoing until the 21st of this month)! At the time nothing of too much interest was wowing me from the site but I did happen upon the new smoky palettes and decided I might as well snatch them up with the discount. Stila’s Smoky Eye Palettes I had already purchased the original smoky eye palette some months ago and was pretty pleased with it so I dove in and purchased the two newest colors. I’m going to say you don’t need these unless you wanna splurge a little. There isn’t anything to wow you about the palettes and you don’t need to rush off and purchase them right away (wait for the Stila Warehouse Sale). The pro side of the purchase is that the shadows are very pigmented and the liner cakes these come with are quite good however you really don’t absolutely have to have these. I’m just diseased thus they ended up in my stash of cosmetics ? I do give them a good solid review because Stila makes some very good shadows and you get quite a nice palette for the price! With the discount I only paid $32 a palette. If you’re a minimal girl or you don’t like alot of nonsense when it comes to your eye makeup these are perfect. They do exactly what they promise to do which is create an elegant smoky eye look that’s perfect for the day or evening. These are also pretty darn nice if you have a difficult time achieving a smokey eye look. They also happen to have a little button you can press that allows you to listen to a tutorial recording giving you step by step instructions on how to apply the shadows. Pretty nifty eh? The Emerald Palette The Bronze Palette The Original Smoky Palette [email protected] @K The Muse was even thoughtful enough to make you a video to show you how the talking tutorial works! Overall these are a nice edition to any collection and they make eyeshadow application a snap on the days that applying makeup seems too much of an ordeal! And It Begins……………!

"['Givenchy Lash Sparkles on a Budget By Isabella Muse on October 16, 2007 2 Comments in Beauty on a Budget Givenchy Lash Sparkles aren’t so expensive at $22 per a pen but certain bits factor into that cost and the Muse will happily share those factors with you! For one thing the possibility of the Lash Sparkles selling out before you have a chance to purchase them is very high! Secondly, the pen doesn’t hold a whole lot of product and you’ll get quite a few looks from them but you’ll be wary of applying too much for fear when it’s gone it’s gone as it is limited edition (at least, as a cosmetic collector, I have that fear!). The good news is the Muse offers you some slightly cheaper ways to make your eyes sparkle and pop with glittery bits of silver without having to spend $22 or having a deep fear of using these if you did purchase them ? Some of what we’ll be discussing: For $18 you can nab yourself some Urban Decay Heavy Metal liner and swipe it across your lashes (instead of lining your eyes with it) to encrust your lashes with funky glittery bits for the holiday season (or any season you deem as a good time of the year to sparkle!). Urban Decay Heavy Metal Liner Now $18 isn’t such a big savings over $22 however you’re getting a bit more product in the liner than you are in the Lash Sparkles and it’ll last quite a while longer plus it’s not limited edition so when it’s gone you can drop by Sephora or head over to Urban Decay.com and nab yourself another one! Glam Rock would be the most fitting color in the lot that matches what you’d receive if you purchase the Givenchy Lash Sparkles. It’s silver in color and has a high sheen of glittery bits to keep you shiny and sparkley all season long! Too Faced has a similar style liner called Starry-Eyed Liquid Eyeliner and works in the same fashion as the Urban Decay liner but the price tag is a bit less! $17.50 will get your lashes all glammed up! The best color to get the same effect as the Lash Sparkles would be Ooh & Aah! Too Faced Starry-Eyed Liquid Eyeliner For $25 you can nab not one but three glitter liners that again will basically do the same thing as Givenchy’s Lash Sparkles. Sugar Cosmetics has a trio of glitter liners in blue, pink, and the perfect silver which matches the look we are trying to achieve! Sugar Cosmetics Glitterama Glitter Liquid Eyeliner Trio One of the Muse’s favorite Japanese Brand (when is a Japanese Brand not a favorite brand of mine right?), Sana, has out Shiny Mascara which is a silver overcoat to top your lashes with! It works a treat too might I add! Shiny Mascara is available in gold and silver and of course to keep with the theme of things the best way to achieve the Givenchy look would, of course, would be to get the silver one! This has a comb on applicator and makes it easy to swipe over your lashes! Sana’s Shiny Mascara can be purchased off of E-bay for around $7.99 (plus airmail shipping costs). Sana is exclusive to Japan so e-bay is the only option for purchasing at the moment however, if you have some lovely friend in Japan they can snatch you up a few and ship them your way! Sana Shiny Mascara The comb makes for easy application! If you’re willing to shell out $59 you can purchase Bare Escentuals Classic Rock or Pure Platinum kits which includes Luminous Lashes in silver toned colors to add sparkle to your lashes! At the moment Luminous Lashes is available for sale by itself but the colors available won’t achieve the look we are seeking so purchasing the kit is the only way of getting these special overcoats that are included in each kit! A slightly expensive way of getting the look but still you do get a buncha of other goodies with your purchase ? At the moment their are quite a large array of different products you can use to create the same look that Givenchy’s Lash Sparkles will give you! Some of these products may not be the cheapest however I find they contain more product for the price and therefore are appealing if you’re on a budget! As much as I adore limited edition products I also enjoy the safe, secure feeling of knowing an item I love to use will be around for a good, long while! A majority of these products offer the security of being available when you need them plus as I said they contain more product for your dollar! Get out there and glam your lashes up ?

"[""Victoria’s Secret Limited Edition Heidi Collection By Isabella Muse on October 23, 2007 Leave a Comment in Victoria's Secret It was just a matter of time before we got Heidi Klum cosmetics from Victoria’s Secret don’t you agree? Victoria’s Secret Limited Edition Heidi Collection as seen on Victoria’s Secret The collection is up and available for sale at Victoria’s Secret and the Muse is slightly interested as her love affair with Victoria’s Secret cosmetics has not diminished quite yet! The collection looks interesting enough if not a bit on the boring side! Let’s have a look see at the products being offered. Mosaic Eyeshadow Palette $18 USD The palette looks interesting enough but a bit of a snore for me. Colors are too standard and you know the Muse loves her vibrant, bold shades! The actual palette looks very pretty done in gold with Heidi’s image on the front but the actual shadows aren’t very appealing to me! Perfect Lipstick $12 USD The lipstick does have me intrigued as it seems to be shimmery. Bit too nude for me to love but I’m still liking the shimmer in it and I’m wondering if that runs straight through the actual lippie formula! Hmmm…! Possible wish list here! Lipgloss $12 USD This might be a possible hit as well since it looks like it’ll be nice over the nude lipstick they are offering! Glitter Eyeliner $10 USD Nothing special here! I have plenty of glitter eyeliners! Overall, it’s a really nice collection and it’s quite pretty but the colors aren’t anything that I absolutely have to have! I will most definitely consider getting the lipstick and the gloss if it happens to pop up on sale (and it will for sure at the semi-annual) but for now I’ll skip! It’s inexpensive to begin with but imagine the deals you’ll nab after Christmas! It’s worth mentioning as Victoria’s Secret, as you know from my previous blogs , has been really making a mark in my cosmetic world! Love It? Hate It? Tell the Muse all about it! Biteki Magazine Holiday Collections Feature By Isabella Muse on October 22, 2007 9 Comments in Friends , Japanese Brands Sometimes I think I need my mate Betsy on board to keep this blog updated ? Without her you wouldn’t get this special little treat I’m about to give you! The Muse hadn’t checked Biteki’s site in a bit and it appears, thanks to Betsy for alerting me, that the Holiday Collection pull out is up and available on the site. Biteki is a Japanese magazine that is sadly not available here in the US! Sometimes if you happen to be lucky you can nab older copies on E-bay or the Muse wanders through drugstores in Chinatown in hopes of nabbing a copy! On a rare occasion you can get a copy that’s…..wait for it….6 months to a year old *sigh* However, the good news is you can always visit the website! The Muse just happens to be picky and likes to have a hard copy of the mag in her hand! Anyway. The good news is the holiday collections are up and on the site! You can check them out by clicking here . 17 pages of pure Holiday bliss! This features US and Japanese brands so you get a little mix of great and wonderful! Sincerely, take a look at the site because it really does give a great break down of holiday “It” collections! I truly wish the US offered a better beauty magazine that did this! Of course Betsy should be taken out and beaten for making the Muse’s wish list triple! But I love her so I’ll forgive her! Just this once. ? Enjoy the Holiday Previews in Biteki! And let the Muse hear all about your wish list! My comment box and my ears are open! Update: Duh! I just noticed that Rouge Deluxe also has a feature on Biteki and also Voce! Click here to have a peek! Beautiful is Christmas in Japan By Isabella Muse on October 22, 2007 11 Comments in Aube , Holiday Collections 2007 , Lavshuca , Majolica Majorca , Winter Collections 2007 Here in the US we have our fair share of gorgeous cosmetics but you know that my heart always lays with the gorgeous collections that my most favorite Japanese brands put out for the Holiday season! What better way to learn all about what’s coming out this season then visiting with the Muse’s very good mate Iris at Rouge Deluxe ! Iris has been making the Muse very happy with all her posts about the goodies that Lavshuca, MJ, Paul and Joe, Gransenbon, and many other brands have in store for us this Christmas Season! Some of the items I am looking forward to this Holiday Season are included in this little blog entry! The entire Majorca Majolica collection! Iris has just posted the details and the Muse is drooling in delight at what’s being offered! Two (not one but two! Celebrate good times come on!) new Majolook Line Impact palettes! Oh my and one looks purple with shimmery bits and pieces! Go right ahead and count the Muse in as being excited about these! If you’d like a look at past Majolook palettes please see my prior blog Spolight on Majorca Majolica by clicking here . Lash Freeze Glitter Mascara! OH.MY.GOD! You know I want this don’t you? Count me in for two of these please! I love the old glitter mascara they introduced and this is on my MUST MUST MUST HAVE TO HAVE OR DIE LIST! Oh sorry was I being a bit too dramatic? Glitter does that to me. And finally Snow Carat Face Powder which sounds like something very yummie that I must have as well ? MJ looks like it’s coming out with quite a gorgeous range for Christmas! You can see the pictures, prices, and first impressions from Iris by visiting her here . Next up on the list is Lavshuca’s two new Holiday palettes! The packaging on these looks adorable! You can see both by clicking here and here . Puffy’s back as Lavshuca’s model for the palettes! Yes, I know I know everyone is groaning but the Muse likes Puffy! I’m not entirely sure I’m loving her hair in these promo images but I still think she looks gorgeous! Anyway enough babbling about Puffy back to the palettes! The palettes are a bit weird in color as these appear more Autumn than Winter however they both look quite nice and too good to use! Beauty Vault anyone? They consist of three strips of shadows and two lip creams! Yum the Muse is writing her Letter to Santa now! Dear Santa, Please bring me two each of the new Lavshuca palettes and I’ll be sure the cookies are extra good this year! Promise! Much love, the Muse! Sonia Rykiel has caught my eye with the sparkling face powders they are introducing for the season! You can click over here and see them. I’m thinking all three need to make an appearance under my Christmas tree! Aube Christmas line looks pretty darn nice as well! The new Jewelry Shower eye palette has caught the Muse’s eye! If you’d like to see the past Jewelry Shower eyes click here . My Japan/Asian wish list is growing quickly and I’m happy that most of my US shopping has been done (aside from the MAC bits that have to make an appearance). The Muse has to go count her pennies and see about making all these wonderful items her very own ? Visit with Iris on Rouge Deluxe for your Japanese Beauty fix but don’t say I didn’t warn you! Japanese makeup makes you broke and poor kids! Don’t be annoyed when the Muse says “I told you so!” when she hears your wallet screaming in pain! Look for these at your favorite Japanese online shops starting around the end of the month and the beginning of November! I wannaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa here you guys talk! Comment! Tell me what you are getting this year from these lines or other Japanese lines! New to Japanese cosmetics? Check out the Muse’s Spotlights on Japanese Brands to learn more! Got a question about Japanese Cosmetics? Ask away! Philosophy Sugar Plum Fairy Gift Set By Isabella Muse on October 22, 2007 1 Comment in Holiday Collections 2007 , Philosophy , Shower & Bath , Winter Collections 2007 Ah something to make the Muse happy ? A gift set that contains her most favorite Philosophy shower gel that makes a special appearance every Holiday Season! The Sugar Plum Fairy! You can get both the gloss and a shower gel in this Nordstrom Exclusive set for $16! Sugar Plum Fairy is a bit deceiving (at least for me she is). I originally purchased my first bottle two seasons ago off the Philosophy website without knowing what she smelled like! In my minds eye I had assumed she’d be a spicy sort of scent boy was I wrong! She’s quite fruity and sweet! Some people may find she smells a bit plastic like but I really enjoy the smell! It’s very difficult to explain exactly what it smells like! It smells almost like some sort of fruity gum or candy with a faint, faint underlay of pineapple. It’s so yum and I buy it every year! The lipgloss is a complete contradiction to the scent of the shower gel! Go firgure! This is what I had originally thought the shower gel would smell like! It’s spicy and warm and almost gingerbread like but not quite (real gingerbread not Philosophy’s version of gingerbread!). I purchase it every year and at $16 for the gloss and an 8oz bottle of Shower Gel it’s back on my wish list for another season! Especially for gift giving reasons! In celebration of Sugar Plum Fairy’s return I cracked open my last bottle I purchased last year! Ahhh now I can safely use it (without fear it wasn’t making a come back) and stash up on some more! Tis the season to smell fruity and delicious! Twisted Peppermint Body Spray (but there’s a catch!) By Isabella Muse on October 22, 2007 Leave a Comment in Bath and Body Works , Holiday Collections 2007 , Shower & Bath , Winter Collections 2007 Well…I heard about Twisted Peppermint Body Spray way back in the summer! If you remember I had blogged about the Fall and Christmas releases in a previous blog . First of all I must say that I’m really loving the Temptations line at the moment and I might go ahead and say I actually may even like them more than the Philosophy 3 in 1 Shower Gels. The scent is stronger, the linger much longer than the Philosophy Shower Gels, and hell they are cheaper! Anyway. Prior to this they have never released the line in a Body Spray. You could get it in several popular formats such as Shower Gel and Lotion but never Body Spray. This year they have released one single body spray that I had also mentioned in a previous blog ! More good news is that they have released a second body spray which is in the Muse’s VERY favorite scent, Twisted Peppermint! Twisted Peppermint Body Spray as seen on Bath and Body Works Website The bad news? It’s $11 as compared to the normal $8 price tag. More bad news….it’s shimmering body spray sigh. Oh woe. Sigh! Great dramatic tears of disappointment! Why couldn’t they just give us a normal body spray why does it have to be a freaking shimmering body spray? As much as the Muse adores shimmer, sparkle, glitter, and shine she doesn’t want it in her body spray thanks very much! I always find body sprays that contain shimmer sticky and they stain good blouses and shirts ? I guess this isn’t on the wish list! I’m so disappointed. I was hopeful for a simple body spray with the sweet minty fresh smell of Twisted Peppermint instead they give me a shimmering body spray! Thanks alot Bath and Body Works you’ve ruined my Monday! Want it? Hate it? Tell me!""]",94a0b412d9794eeca50943345c9b91bc92ad5d84,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4253,

"['NYX Dewy Finish Long Lasting Makeup Setting Spray Review By Isabella Muse on February 28, 2013 7 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Drugstore Makeup Brands , Facial Mist , NYX , Skincare , Spring Collections 2013 Looks like my run in with NYX’s Matte Finish Makeup Setting Spray was a fluke! NYX Dewy Finish Long Lasting Makeup Setting Spray ended up working out a whole lot better for me considering I had a few hiccups with the spritzer on the bottle of Matte Finish I recently reviewed. NYX Makeup Setting Sprays are lightweight mists that where recently introduced and come in a matte or dewy finish that prolong your makeup wear. Take a peek! Now originally the Matte Finish Bottle was a misting out a steady stream of product which kinda caused chaos for makeup. You want a finer mist when you’re working with these setting sprays and Matte Finish just wasn’t delivering that! It appears my bottle might have been faulty because I didn’t have the same issue with the Dewy Finish formula. It does mist a good deal of product out but it does produce a finer mist so I’m not left feeling like I had a run in with my sprinklers. The Dewy Finish, for my drier skin, is definitely the better option for right now particularly if I’m wearing powder. It creates a more refined finish if I set with powder or wear a powder foundation. As no matter how much I prime some powder will def accentuate drier areas but a little mist of this will definitely hydrate the area and give a softer, smoother appearance to my makeup. If you’re a chronic mineral or powder foundation user I think mists like this are an essential part of finishing your makeup. Dewy Finish is actually much like the Matte Finish formula for me. I didn’t feel particularly hydrated after the first use or throughout it. It kinda sets to a matte finish and does indeed prolongs the wear of my makeup every so slightly. Foundation seems to last out a good deal longer without fading when I set with this. That’s rare considering I’ve tried mists like this before and didn’t have as good a success rate. It also seems to work mighty well with cream blush. Cream blush seems to really disappear on me quickly and this extended the wear by a good two hours. One thing I didn’t love is it did produces some tightness and also had my powder looking a little cracked after dry down. That sounds weird I guess but if I set with powder or I applied a powder foundation (tested both ways) I noticed it looked less than smooth and somewhat clumpy, patchy, and drier. My skin is dry as I mentioned but this mist seemed to work to make the area even drier. That’s odd considering at first application it seems to set to a dewy, hydrated finish but as the wear progresses it becomes drier. Overall, I’m going to probably give both formulas a better test in the Summer when my skin is a bit more combination. I was relieved that the spritzer was working much better on this bottle than my last. At $8 it’s a considerably cheaper option than some other setting sprays out there. If you regularly use mists like this you might find the formula a good pick. It sorta worked for me with mixed results on a whole. It’s available now at Ulta, Ulta.com, as well as online from NYX directly. Has anyone tried these? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"['Sue Devitt Naughty or Nice Steals and Deals By Isabella Muse on October 21, 2007 10 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Steals and Deals , Sue Devitt Two seasons ago Sue Devitt introduced two gorgeous palettes that I was and am still very much in love with! They were entitled the Naughty or Nice palettes and they packed a whole lot of gorgeous into one very, very cute palette! Sue Devitt’s Naughy or Nice Palettes Now the Muse is telling you this for two reasons. One, she wants you to have a gorgeous, shimmering Holiday face and Two, she wants you to nab an awesome deal! I believe at the time these palettes had cost $38 or $35 each (Don’t quote the Muse, she’s growing older and her memory isn’t as good as it once was). But you can have them both for prices ranging from $7.99-$14.99! Both of them for that price! That’s like $4 bucks a palette! If you search E-bay for “Sue Devitt Naughty Nice” you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the very nice, low prices these palettes are selling for! Why is the Muse telling you this? Another two reasons if you will. One, if you’re on a budget this season and want to look gorgeous these are both fabulous palettes to have in your beauty arsenal and Two, did I mention these are selling for practically FREE!? Now if I haven’t sold you with the price alone allow me to tell you a little about each palette! If you happen to love shimmer and sparkle and shine and glittery bits and pieces as much as the Muse does, these, my friends, be the palettes for you! Naughty is my favorite of the two (not that Nice isn’t equally as gorgeous I just have a thing for the name! “Naughty” how very bad!). The Naughty palette contains two shimmering shades of shadow and two glittering lipglosses. The shadows included are a deep silver shimmer and a gorgeous frosty white. The lipglosses are a bitten red with silver sparkle and a deep pink with silver sparkle. The overall look the palette creates is a frosty holiday face that’s sure to please! Add a little liner from your own stash and you’ll be looking so Naughty it’ll be nice ? Sue Devitt’s Naughty Palette Now the Nice palette is as equally as gorgeous as the Naughty! If you happen to be a brunette these are most flattering shades indeed! This palette includes a gorgeous sparkling bronze eyeshadow and a sparkling beige that reminds me of Stila’s popular Kitten eyeshadow but with way more sparkle! The two lipglosses included are a bronze with gold sparkle and a copper with gold sparkle! The naughty palette isn’t only for the holidays you can easily get away with the look for Autumn or Summer! The effect this palette creates is a very elegant bronzed look with tons of beautiful shimmer! Sue Devitt’s Nice Palette Each palette also includes a lipbrush although for some odd reason or another they failed to include an eyeshadow applicator but that doesn’t take away from the fact that these are and remain a favorite Holiday Palette! Sue Devitt hasn’t wow’ed the Muse in a few years and these, at the time, had most definately wow’ed me! I’d grab these off E-bay it’s such a good deal you can’t really lose out! Being beautiful doesn’t have to cost a fortune ? Bare Escentuals iQuad Eyeshadow Compact By Isabella Muse on October 21, 2007 Leave a Comment in Bare Escentuals Bare Escentuals has graced us with a new iQuad palette and the Muse couldn’t be happier! I really enjoy these little compacts and you get some nice product with the quad for $28. Sadly, the newest quad is out of stock, however, I’m positive it’ll pop into stores again soon! Until then I bring you a review of last year’s quads! Newest Bare Escentuals iQuad as seen on Sephora Last year Bare Escentuals released two of these compact quads with the a liner compact quad much to the delight of BE fans everywhere I’m sure (I’ll do a review on the liner quad another time day!). The quads are a heavy plastic so it’s not your typical compact. It includes a brush and four loose powder shadows. The shadows each have a lid that you can flip up to use the color. Each time I flip the lid on a color I feel like I’m an artist that’s going to work on a masterpiece canvas! (The heavy plastic on these make it easy to tote them around in your purse for touch ups!) The colors are completely usable in both compacts and match perfectly for one to several different looks. The brush is soft, doesn’t shed, and makes application a snap! It’s rare I use one brush to apply a look but hey when you’re in a rush this little compact is a snap to use and create a genius look! I must say that the compact is very cute and very portable however I do get slightly irritated when I snap one of the lids open I create a bit of a mess when loose powder spills out all over the place. This makes for crummy clean up and waste of product! The good news is with a little work using the compact you get a feel for it so you see less and less of spillage and more and more of snapping the lids opened and closed without suffering from waste! It just takes a bit of practice with the lids to get it just right! (Snap Lids Keeps Glimmers, Glimpses, and Shadows Safe but makes for a bit of a mess for the unpracticed user of this palette!) As I said the colors are all completely wearable and you can create one to several different looks and of course use other shadows in your collection to create something extremely different! The colors all contain plenty of shimmer and are pigmented. The quads include a glimpse, two eyeshadows, and one glimmer (if you know BE products you’ll know the difference between the three! If not check out Sephora’s site for details!) (The colors are all very wearable and are gorgeous shades full of shimmer and sparkle!) These also come with a card that gives you three easy looks to create with step by step instructions on how to achieve the desired look! Quite handy! I’m pretty excited to see this new quad that they introduced! The colors look very Fall and will make an elegant eye look with the browns, golds, and beiges in the compact! Sadly it doesn’t appear as if the older iQuads are available on Sephora’s site however the new one is and if you’re lemming these older ones after my review you can pick them up from QVC ! Overall, I’d say these contain a nice punch of product for the money and they simplify makeup looks which sometimes is a blessing in disguise when we are running late in the morning! Do you have these? Love ’em? Talk to me! The Muse loves her two and she’s definately ordering the third when it pops up in stock again! The Muse Makes an Appearance on Lilta’s MMU Blog By Isabella Muse on October 21, 2007 2 Comments in Babblings Lilta’s blog is about mineral makeup and is quite interesting! She features and blogs about inexpensive brands of mineral makeup that she likes and has tried (some of which I am now wanting to try). She does a daily entry of her FOTD and what she’s used to create her looks! I was pleasantly surprised that she blogged about me in her daily blog! I’m mostly a MAC girl as Lily says in her blog ? but I’m enjoying her blog so much that I’ve decided I’ll be doing more FOTD’s using minerals! I have so many glimmers, shadows, etc…from BE plus a ton of etailer brand minerals that I don’t use nearly enough! So..Lily..count the muse inspired by your lovely post about my looks and I aim to do more mineral looks in the future! Thanks so much for featuring me on your blog! Visit with Lily at Lilta’s MMU Blog. MAC Antiquitease Color Hits and Misses By Isabella Muse on October 19, 2007 6 Comments in Hits and Misses , Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 I thought I’d clarify a bit on the Hit and Misses in the MAC Antiquitease Color Story! I think this helps if you’re ordering online or you’re on a budget and just want to keep things to a minimal in what you purchase! I’ve broken all of it down into what was released and what I’d buy and what I’d skip! Of course this varies from person to person since your skin type or coloring may flatter colors better than my own ? Plus you just might see something that’s really appealing to you and you want it! So this guide is just what I personally think would be a Hit and a Miss in the color story and may or may not be helpful when making your selections and choices! I love all of it but I think breaking it down to a HIT and MISS makes life easier for sure ? Plus if you do have the cash to throw down I’d totally grab a majority of it! Comment and let me know what you think is a HIT or a MISS! Curious minds. Happy Shopping ? Also, a most wonderful reader and friend, Betsy, provided the Muse with a delightful little code for MAC online which is GLOSS. This code gets you free shipping all year long! Thanks to Betsy for that! The Muse hearts you! Saving your pennies?

I went over to visit and I was delighted when I seen my review for the Bare Escentuals Smoky “V” Eye Kit was up on the site! I was loving the site but I couldn’t make much out of it as sadly it wasn’t in English! With that said I now bring you good news! Rocketqueen is now in English! Wahoo! The Muse is excited! I’m not only a writer of my own blog but a big reader of blogs and this is quickly making it’s way onto my favorite list! The site consists of a ton of great items that I look for in a blog. Great reviews, FOTD’s, product photos, and all that latest, greatest bits about beauty that I adore reading about! Today Rocketqueen has an interview with Erika from Makeup Bag up on her site which I enjoyed reading!

"['Blog Spotlight: Nessasary Makeup By Isabella Muse on October 25, 2007 4 Comments in Babblings ‘ello there! Allow the Muse, if she may, to share with you a most interesting little blog! I came across Nessasary Makeup when checking my stats one day (kinda of like I ran across Rocketqueen’s! Stats are good they let me discover awesome cosmetic blogs! Teehee). The blog is too awesome and I really love it and I find myself checking it twice a day or more. At the moment it, with Rocketqueen and Bjooti , is a favorite of mine. I was originally going to present the blog after copying an FOTD I seen on the blog but I haven’t gotten a chance to do that particular FOTD and today was a good day to share this blog with you as some interesting little items have popped up on Nessasary Makeup! First of all I love the personal feel to this blog (reminds me of my own). The girl that runs it is friendly, always answers her comments, does awesome q&a sessions, etc…. She does FOTD’s (which are always an interested to me), shows her collection, does tons of swatches, etc…. Overall, it’s a cool blog! The main reason I’m telling you this is today she has up the new MAC Holiday Palettes which is exciting and disappointing. Exciting to see these in close up but disappointing as they really do look identical to last years! Either way do wander over and have a visit at Nessasary Makeup !

MAC Formal Black 2006 vs MAC Antiquitease 2007 By Isabella Muse on October 24, 2007 15 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 The Muse loves you. Since she loves you so much she decided that it would be a very good idea to haul out all of last year’s MAC Formal Black and do the comparison work for you! Go on tell me how great I am, don’t be modest! Here’s the lowdown my pretties. If you skipped out on MAC Formal Black last year or you’re a new MAC addict, this year’s holiday collection is all about you however, if you’re an avid collector, your color stories are up to date, and you’re just a general makeup whore (like the Muse) that would mean this collection is somewhat of a snore. Currently my wish list is leaning towards the eye palettes and everything else seems like I can do without it! Without further babble from me here’s the scoop on MAC’s Holiday Collection this year! The best place to start is the palettes last year we had 4 palettes just like this year. Those consisted of Smokey Eyes, Intense Eyes, Warm Eyes, and Cool Eyes. This year Metallic Eyes has replaced Intense Eyes. MAC Formal Black Cool Eyes Palette Click here to view the Antiquitease Cool Eyes Palette Overall, the palette appears very similar to last year’s Formal Black Cool Eyes Palette aside from a few colors that look different! I still have to see this year’s palette to in person to decide but this sadly might turn into a non buy for me! MAC Formal Black Smokey Eye Palette This almost appears identical to MAC’s Antiquitease Smokey Eye palette! Click here to see the palette and compare for yourself! MAC Formal Black Intense Eyes Palette I loved this palette last year and I love it to this day and it appears this wasn’t duplicated in anyway this year but it’s been replaced with the Metallic Eye Palette which I am definately adding to my list to get as I’ve seen photos of it and it’s very nice! Again, I have to see it in person myself but I’d say the Metallic Eye Palette is one to nab for sure! See it here . MAC Formal Black Warm Eyes Palette This year’s warm eyes palette appears a bit different but some colors seem similar so I’ll have to see at my counter tomorrow how much unlike they are! The eye palettes are always on my list because it’s a nice bit of product for the price at $36 USD plus this year’s design is simply stunning however if the colors are the same I can count them off my list! Looking forward to seeing these in person tomorrow! I didn’t purchase any holiday lip palettes last year and I rarely do because they are just too messy for me however I did purchase the Viva Glam lip palette simply to donate my money to a good cause. Last year we were gifted with six shades in a palette and I believe the price was $48 USD (don’t quote me on that). This year they are offering two palettes at $22.50 USD each with three shades per palette. That price is for the Viva Glam lip palettes not the regular holiday palettes. If I recall correctly the lip palettes were the same price last year as the eyeshadow palettes where this year it’s less product for a bit more considering if you purchase two that would be $45 USD for six shades in two palettes when last year it was $36 USD for six shades in one palette. If I’m wrong do comment! I’m pretty sure that was the cost per palette last year! MAC Formal Black Viva Glam Palette I never touched my palette from last year! *blush* I’ve broken down the Curiousitease sets for you so you can see what you’re getting, color wise, in each set. These are a complete waste of cash for me since I have all the colors and if you’re an avid pigment user, a collector, or just a general makeup junkie chances are you have all the colors already as well! However, if you’re new to MAC or just missed out on certain items this is a great time to nab a deal! $29.50 USD gets you 5 vials of pigment and if you’re familiar with pigment you know these will last AGES and AGES so a little goes a long way! A nice little bang for your buck! The Cool Set of Curiousitease Pigments includes: Helium Softwash Grey Naval Blue Forest Green Reflects Blue Glitter I just realized how splendidly all these colors go together when I set them out next to each other so thanks MAC! The Muse does not own Forest Green (I thought I did but I guess I don’t! Unless it’s playing Hide and Seek with me at the moment). Naval Blue, Softwash Grey, Helium, Reflects Blue Glitter MAC is offering a warm collection of pigments as well which is also $29.50 USD and includes five pigment vials. The Warm Set of Curiousitease Pigments includes: Lilywhite Dazzleray Copper Sparkle Sunpepper Reflects Gold Glitter Again, thanks MAC! These go pretty well together ? I never realized how nicely Dazzleray and Lilywhite look together ! Lilywhite, Dazzleray, Sunpepper, Copper Sparkle, Reflects Gold Glitter This year, in keeping with the theme of mini eye pencils (see my Urban Decay Mini 24/7 Eyeliner blog entry), MAC bundled together 5 mini softsparkle pencils. Again, such a great deal, $29.50 USD for all 5 pencils. I have all the softsparkle pencils but if I didn’t this would most definately be on my wish list! If you have none of these eyeliner pencils I highly recommend nabbing this smart collection! The Curiousitease Softsparkle Eyeliner Set Includes: Nightsky Peacocky Iris Accents Reflecto Goldenair Peacocky, Reflecto, Nightsky, Iris Accents, Goldenair MAC Formal Black Lipgloss Dress Sets The above picture is the lipglosses that were included with the Dress Sets last year. This year the colors are far different from what I’ve seen in photos. Keep in mind the glosses included with these set are mini versions so don’t expect to get 5 full size glosses Brush sets are another snore for me as I have a majority of the brushes! If you happen to have all these brushes too and are loving the case they come in, like the Muse, I highly recommend skipping on purchasing just because you’re convincing yourself you could use the brushes (but really you’re just wanting the bag). The good news for weird, diseased people like ourselves is we can safely skip buying the brush bags and go ahead and score JUST the bag on E-bay! Now if you happen to not have many good brushes in your collection this is a good chance to nab some great brushes at a super great price! If you break down the cost per a brush set it comes to about $9.60 per a brush! That’s a steep savings on brushes! Brush Sets are $48 usd per set and the special edition Heirloom collection is $45. The Muse has broken down each set so you can see what you’ll be getting should you purchase the sets! Face Brush Set The face brush set includes (as pictured from left to right) 194 (useless brush in my opinion), 190, 168, and 187. This set is a bit tricky because it includes the 194 which in my humblest opinion is garbage and useless. So that means you’ll be taking 3 brushes and dividing by the $48 price tag which comes out to $16 per a brush! Purchase the lot separately in full size and it’ll run you a nice hefty $200 or so! It’s worth mentioning that I hear high debates about the quality of the brushes in these sets. I’ve heard they aren’t as good as the larger size, they shed, and so on and so fourth. I personally own larger and smaller sizes of MAC brushes and I’ve never experienced any problems with the smaller sizes! I even LIKE the smaller sizes better! Easy storage, portable, clean up as good as the large size, and take less space in my makeup bag! So if you’re wondering if the mini sizes are any better or worst than the full size I would say it’s about the same quality as the larger size brushes. MAC makes some outstanding brushes whether they be mini or large size! Basic Brush Set The basic brush set includes (as pictured from top to bottom) the 266, 219, 229, 129, and (not pictured) 316. Eye Brush Set The eye brush set includes (pictured from left to right) the 252, 212, 275, 217, and 209. If you’re in high debate what would be the best brush set to lay your money on I’d say it would be the eye set or the face brush set! As for the Heirloom Brush Set that appears to have the same brushes as the basic brush set but in special clothing so if you’re yearning the basic brush set why not get the Heirloom Set and save yourself $3! Heirloom Brush Set $45 USD That’s all for my comparisons to this year’s collection and last year’s ? I hope it’s helped you decide what will be a hit for you and what will be a miss! The only thing I didn’t cover were Antiquitease Finery which are the lipstick sets. I did purchase lipsticks from last year but can’t recall the colors so I am unable to do the comparisons for you! I will say Coral Lips and Tan Lips look very similar to colors I got last year! Happy Shopping tomorrow and don’t forget to comment and let the Muse know what you got! She’s all ears! Boring Japanese Brand FOTD By Isabella Muse on October 24, 2007 3 Comments in Face of the Day This morning I was rushing around like a lunatic (I’m already a lunatic but when I’m late I’m even crazier) and I ended up doing this really simple, boring FOTD instead of the brighter colors I had planned! But, for your viewing pleasure, here it be! I used all Japanese cosmetics to create the look ? What I Used: Cheeks: Gransenbon Blush in 02 Eyes: KATE Gradical Eyes in BK-1 Canmake Sparkling Lame Liner in 01 Kiss Volumizing Mascara K-Palette Mascara Tears Overcoat in Silver Lips: Lavshuca Jewel Lipstick in PK2 Lavshuca Color Conc Rouge in RD2 The Muse and E-mail By Isabella Muse on October 24, 2007 Leave a Comment in Babbling Bits Hello World! I’m slowly catching up on e-mails and it’s a process to say the least! If you’ve written to me please know I do my best to get back to all e-mails ? If I haven’t replied for some reason it’s probably because my inbox is sickeningly disorganized ? The good news is I believe I am up to date on all my E-mail as of today (aside from a few personal friend e-mails)! If you’re awaiting a reply, have a question, or just want to say hello you can always comment and get a super fast reply ? Or e-mail me again and I promise now that my inbox is somewhat back to normal I will return your reply in a shorter amount of time! Many thanks for all the e-mails, comments, etc! I appreciate all of you and their would be no Musings without you to read them!

"[""Victoria’s Secret Ultimate Sexy Set By Isabella Muse on October 24, 2007 Leave a Comment in Holiday Collections 2007 , Victoria's Secret Victoria’s Secret always comes out with delightful gifts and this year is no exception! I came across the Ultimate Sexy Set while browsing around Victoria’s Secret website. The set is $100 and it is well worth the price however the Muse highly recommends checking the website the week of Christmas and the day after Christmas to nab a huge deal on it! As we know everything is always cheaper AFTER Christmas and I have no doubt the set will go from $100 to $50 to $20 or lower in the days after Christmas and that’s a great time to cash in any gift certificates you may have gotten and nab yourself a nice little collection of yum! Victoria’s Secret Ultimate Sexy Set The set includes a lovely little black bag with “Angel” sequined across the front and inside it’s chock full of cosmetics! Perfect Lipstick, Mosaic Blush, Lipgloss, Lip Plumper, Mosaic Bronzer, Mosaic Eyeshadow, Silky Eyeshadow, Mascara and more! This is a pretty stocked tote of goodies! If you HAVE to have it right now the Muse says use code GIVEVS and get $15 off your total which brings the Ultimate Sexy Set down to $85 or you can wait for the Semi-Annual sale like the Muse and maybe nab it for far, far less! Happy Shopping! Bare Escentuals Classic Rock and Pure Platinum Sets By Isabella Muse on October 24, 2007 2 Comments in Bare Escentuals You may recall that the Muse’s wish list was updated with the Bare Escentuals Classic Rock Collection ! Bare Escentuals Classic Rock Collection Now she happened to wander onto Nordstrom’s site a few weeks back and came across the Pure Platinum collection! Oh my! Diamonds, Diamonds, and more Diamonds! Bare Escentuals Pure Platinum Collection A Nordstrom Exclusive I was having quite a difficult time deciding between the two sets as they looked identical to each other but I’m happy to report (Thanks to the Muse’s friend and reader, Betsy) the two sets are very different! Betsy’s been so kind as to share images from both her collections and we can see the difference between the two! These images are taken by Betsy’s and you can see the gossamer powder that comes with these are vastly different! On the left hand side the Classic Rock gossamer powder comes in a white shimmering powder and on the right hand side you can see the Precious Platinum gossamer powder is a silver shimmering powder! Above the powders you can see the beautifully luminous lashes overcoat and mascara. This is a dual ended mascara that has black mascara on one side and the other side has the overcoat. You can see in the photos that the overcoat is completely different as well! One is white and one is silver! Below are images of the shadows, glimmers, and blushes included in the kit! As you can see these are completely different colors as well! The good news is that the sets are utterly different and gorgeous! I had originally wanted the Classic Rock Collection and when I seen the Pure Platinum that was on my list but I was somewhat confused if it was the same collection! I’m now utterly adding the Pure Platinum Collection to my wish list! Thanks so much to Betsy for clearing this up, sharing her photos, and making the Muse’s wallet scream in pain! If you’ll looking for a perfect Holiday set to make you glamorous and gorgeous these two would be it! Each Kit is $59 and has an array of delicious goodies to keep you happy all season long! Betsy also informs the Muse that the brushes have pretty little rhinestones/diamonds embedded in the handles! MAC Holiday By Isabella Muse on October 24, 2007 10 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 MAC Holiday is live and up on the website! It’s not yet available for purchase just yet but you can start viewing what’s up, prices, and of course start making your wish list! Tomorrow it’ll be on sale at counters and I’d say either later today or tomorrow it’ll be ready for purchase on the website! Wahoo! Keep in mind that tomorrow’s releases do not include Finery (the lip bag sets) or Curiousitease (mini pigments, glosses, etc…). Curiousitease and Finery will be available for purchase via the website but not at your counter until November 15th and the 21st! However, you may be luck because as I recall my counter had gotten in some of the dress sets from Formal Black’s release sort of early! What I’m wanting (depending how they look in person) are the eye palettes for sure, coral lip bag, and tan lip bag. I know my list is small but of course when I’m faced with all of it I might very well change my mind! The lip palettes I may nab one…probably a Viva Glam palette. Aside from that the rest I can safely skip! All the vials of pigment are tempting but I have the full sizes and don’t need any of these, the liners I have as well, and the glosses I’ll have to see maybe one will tempt me! As tempting as it all is I do find some of it disappointing. The fact that the eye palettes look identical to last year’s colors has me worried but you can never really go by the MAC website for color swatches so I’d rather get to my counter and view it for myself. If you happened to miss last year’s Formal Black release and some other color stories this is a good time to get what you may have missed out on! Some items that are popping up in these kits were LE from past collections and wonderful if you haven’t yet gotten your hands on them! I see Helium pigment, Softwash Grey pigment, etc…. Now is also a good time to grab the softsparkle eyeliner pencils! The first time I got these was with the Sweetie Cake collection and I loved them! Now is a good time to get A mini lot of them for $29.50! Can’t go wrong there! Overall it’s a beautiful collection and if you’re new to MAC this is such a great place to start! If you’re an older collector it can be a bit of a disappointment as many items are repromoted from past collections and colors are similar. The Muse will keep you posted when she gets her goodies on Thursday! What are you getting? Queen’s Sin and Red Romp FOTD By Isabella Muse on October 23, 2007 21 Comments in Face of the Day Ahhh the Muse has finally located a red lipstick that she actually LIKES! I used my Queen’s Sin Lipstick and Red Romp Lipglass today and I’m in absolute lust with them! These two are a MUST MUST MUST have from the MAC Antiquitease collection! The Muse gives these a hearty thumbs up for purchase! I’ve never run across a red lipstick that works for me and Queen’s Sin just works perfectly and Red Romp on top makes my lips look amazing! I’ll leave you to judge for yourselves!

"['MAC Antiquitease Color Hits and Misses By Isabella Muse on October 19, 2007 6 Comments in Hits and Misses , Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 I thought I’d clarify a bit on the Hit and Misses in the MAC Antiquitease Color Story! I think this helps if you’re ordering online or you’re on a budget and just want to keep things to a minimal in what you purchase! I’ve broken all of it down into what was released and what I’d buy and what I’d skip! Of course this varies from person to person since your skin type or coloring may flatter colors better than my own ? Plus you just might see something that’s really appealing to you and you want it! So this guide is just what I personally think would be a Hit and a Miss in the color story and may or may not be helpful when making your selections and choices! I love all of it but I think breaking it down to a HIT and MISS makes life easier for sure ? Plus if you do have the cash to throw down I’d totally grab a majority of it! Comment and let me know what you think is a HIT or a MISS! Curious minds. Happy Shopping ? Also, a most wonderful reader and friend, Betsy, provided the Muse with a delightful little code for MAC online which is GLOSS. This code gets you free shipping all year long!

"['Bare Escentuals iQuad Eyeshadow Compact By Isabella Muse on October 21, 2007 Leave a Comment in Bare Escentuals Bare Escentuals has graced us with a new iQuad palette and the Muse couldn’t be happier! I really enjoy these little compacts and you get some nice product with the quad for $28. Sadly, the newest quad is out of stock, however, I’m positive it’ll pop into stores again soon! Until then I bring you a review of last year’s quads! Newest Bare Escentuals iQuad as seen on Sephora Last year Bare Escentuals released two of these compact quads with the a liner compact quad much to the delight of BE fans everywhere I’m sure (I’ll do a review on the liner quad another time day!). The quads are a heavy plastic so it’s not your typical compact. It includes a brush and four loose powder shadows. The shadows each have a lid that you can flip up to use the color. Each time I flip the lid on a color I feel like I’m an artist that’s going to work on a masterpiece canvas! (The heavy plastic on these make it easy to tote them around in your purse for touch ups!) The colors are completely usable in both compacts and match perfectly for one to several different looks. The brush is soft, doesn’t shed, and makes application a snap! It’s rare I use one brush to apply a look but hey when you’re in a rush this little compact is a snap to use and create a genius look! I must say that the compact is very cute and very portable however I do get slightly irritated when I snap one of the lids open I create a bit of a mess when loose powder spills out all over the place. This makes for crummy clean up and waste of product! The good news is with a little work using the compact you get a feel for it so you see less and less of spillage and more and more of snapping the lids opened and closed without suffering from waste! It just takes a bit of practice with the lids to get it just right! (Snap Lids Keeps Glimmers, Glimpses, and Shadows Safe but makes for a bit of a mess for the unpracticed user of this palette!) As I said the colors are all completely wearable and you can create one to several different looks and of course use other shadows in your collection to create something extremely different! The colors all contain plenty of shimmer and are pigmented. The quads include a glimpse, two eyeshadows, and one glimmer (if you know BE products you’ll know the difference between the three! If not check out Sephora’s site for details!) (The colors are all very wearable and are gorgeous shades full of shimmer and sparkle!) These also come with a card that gives you three easy looks to create with step by step instructions on how to achieve the desired look! Quite handy! I’m pretty excited to see this new quad that they introduced! The colors look very Fall and will make an elegant eye look with the browns, golds, and beiges in the compact! Sadly it doesn’t appear as if the older iQuads are available on Sephora’s site however the new one is and if you’re lemming these older ones after my review you can pick them up from QVC ! Overall, I’d say these contain a nice punch of product for the money and they simplify makeup looks which sometimes is a blessing in disguise when we are running late in the morning! Do you have these? Love ’em? Talk to me! The Muse loves her two and she’s definately ordering the third when it pops up in stock again! You may also enjoy...

"['Sue Devitt Naughty or Nice Steals and Deals By Isabella Muse on October 21, 2007 10 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Steals and Deals , Sue Devitt Two seasons ago Sue Devitt introduced two gorgeous palettes that I was and am still very much in love with! They were entitled the Naughty or Nice palettes and they packed a whole lot of gorgeous into one very, very cute palette! Sue Devitt’s Naughy or Nice Palettes Now the Muse is telling you this for two reasons. One, she wants you to have a gorgeous, shimmering Holiday face and Two, she wants you to nab an awesome deal! I believe at the time these palettes had cost $38 or $35 each (Don’t quote the Muse, she’s growing older and her memory isn’t as good as it once was). But you can have them both for prices ranging from $7.99-$14.99! Both of them for that price! That’s like $4 bucks a palette! If you search E-bay for “Sue Devitt Naughty Nice” you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the very nice, low prices these palettes are selling for! Why is the Muse telling you this? Another two reasons if you will. One, if you’re on a budget this season and want to look gorgeous these are both fabulous palettes to have in your beauty arsenal and Two, did I mention these are selling for practically FREE!? Now if I haven’t sold you with the price alone allow me to tell you a little about each palette! If you happen to love shimmer and sparkle and shine and glittery bits and pieces as much as the Muse does, these, my friends, be the palettes for you! Naughty is my favorite of the two (not that Nice isn’t equally as gorgeous I just have a thing for the name! “Naughty” how very bad!). The Naughty palette contains two shimmering shades of shadow and two glittering lipglosses. The shadows included are a deep silver shimmer and a gorgeous frosty white. The lipglosses are a bitten red with silver sparkle and a deep pink with silver sparkle. The overall look the palette creates is a frosty holiday face that’s sure to please! Add a little liner from your own stash and you’ll be looking so Naughty it’ll be nice ? Sue Devitt’s Naughty Palette Now the Nice palette is as equally as gorgeous as the Naughty! If you happen to be a brunette these are most flattering shades indeed! This palette includes a gorgeous sparkling bronze eyeshadow and a sparkling beige that reminds me of Stila’s popular Kitten eyeshadow but with way more sparkle! The two lipglosses included are a bronze with gold sparkle and a copper with gold sparkle! The naughty palette isn’t only for the holidays you can easily get away with the look for Autumn or Summer! The effect this palette creates is a very elegant bronzed look with tons of beautiful shimmer! Sue Devitt’s Nice Palette Each palette also includes a lipbrush although for some odd reason or another they failed to include an eyeshadow applicator but that doesn’t take away from the fact that these are and remain a favorite Holiday Palette! Sue Devitt hasn’t wow’ed the Muse in a few years and these, at the time, had most definately wow’ed me! I’d grab these off E-bay it’s such a good deal you can’t really lose out! Being beautiful doesn’t have to cost a fortune ? You may also enjoy... Sue Devitt Eye Intensifier Pencil Trio Giveaway Wet n Wild Disney Villains Makeup Collection Arrives Coffret D’Or On Sale!

"['Hard Candy Fast & Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray Review By Isabella Muse on March 18, 2015 3 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Drugstore Makeup Brands , Facial Mist , Hard Candy , Skincare , Spring Collections 2015 Affiliate Link Purchased Hard Candy Fast & Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray ($6) is a new permanent makeup setting spray that launched with the Hard Candy Spring/Summer 2015 Collection . Makeup setting sprays at the drugstore are a trending at the moment as L’Oreal released Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray a short time ago for Spring 2015. I’m a not a huge, huge lover of setting sprays. I love facial mists with a passion but actually setting my makeup with a mist kinda freaks me out. It makes me feel like I spent a ton of time on my makeup and I’m proceeding to mist myself with water right after. It’s a weird concept to me! But none the less they are very, very popular and makeup lovers adore them so I’m always willing to give them a try and see if they work for me. Up until now I’m not a huge fan but maybe, just maybe Hard Candy Fast & Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray could change my mind. Hard Candy Fast & Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray comes in a 2.2 oz so it is a budget option compared to products like NYX Long Lasting Makeup Setting Spray which is 2.02 oz in size at $8, Urban Decay Setting Sprays at $30 for 4 oz, and L’Oreal Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray at $17.99. Out of many makeup spray options, Hard Candy does win the budget friendly award coming in at a mere $6 bucks. Hard Candy Fast & Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray doesn’t have a ton of the same ingredients as many setting sprays I own and have used in the past. It does in fact contain alcohol which isn’t a fab ingredient in skincare but it isn’t drying of that’s your main concern. It does contain Ethanol (listed as SD Alcohol 40-B on the ingredients) and this is typically an alcohol that is drying but I didn’t experience any issues. Sensitive skin might be averse to Ethanol so you want to be careful here. Ingredients aside, the spray actually does work fairly well! I spray it in an X on my face after I’ve applied all my makeup (blush, foundation, etc..full face). It sets quickly but I hate, hate, hate how it intensifies the look of my blush and just makes my makeup look wet. However, it does dry down and sets very quickly so that little weird issues disappears quickly enough. It doesn’t tighten it doesn’t nor does it leave behind a film. My foundation lasts anywhere from six to seven hours depending on what I use. For example BB Creams wear for a good seven hours on me, some of my favorite foundations like Shiseido Perfect Refining Foundation I can get a nice five to six hours from, other foundations I own are sometimes shorter at four hours. I decided to wear it with one of my foundations that wore the shortest time to see how it would hold up with this. I also purposely wore a concealer that faded quickly as well. I sprayed it once in an X motion on my face and once again straight down my face from the middle of my forehead right down to my chin in a quick burst. I gave in a few seconds to allow it to set and headed out for the day. It did great! My foundation looked fresh through a seven hour period, my concealer looked excellent, my blush remained vibrant, my makeup looked as good as it did the first time I applied it! I mean sure, I looked a little tired at the end of the day but my makeup still looked nice. I’ve used it a few times last week and was happy with the results each time. I STILL dislike the fact it makes me look like I was caught in the rain on the initial mist but after the set my makeup looks fine again! One warning for those sensitive users as it does have a cucumber fragrance. It isn’t super strong but it is there! All in all for six bucks it performs quite good! I was impressed and makeup setting sprays are something that fail to impressed me. Hard Candy Fast & Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray is available now exclusively at Walmart and Walmart.com.

"['NYX Matte Finish Long Lasting Setting Spray Review By Isabella Muse on February 26, 2013 33 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Drugstore Makeup Brands , Facial Mist , NYX , Skincare , Spring Collections 2013 NYX Matte Finish Long Lasting Setting Spray is one of two new setting sprays the brand introduced for Spring 2013. These are 2 oz bottles for $8 each. I’m a little iffy on Setting Sprays as I’m always sorta wary of spritzing a just made up face with what is essentially water combined with some other ingredients. It’s kinda like, wait, hold on a second, I just did my makeup now you want me to mist myself madly with water? Ummm no…! But actually some do have benefits. Particularly if you’re a mineral girl or you use powder to set. A small amount of setting mist actually will give your makeup a more refined finish and in some cases they really do prolong the wear of makeup. Does NYX’s version work? NYX created their setting sprays in two finishes meant for both shiny and dry faces. Matte Finish Long Lasting Setting Spray is obviously the one that would be best suited for those with oily skin. To use simply do your makeup as normal and as the final step in your regime mist onto your face by holding the bottle several inches away from your face. Now I had two issues with this mist. 1. The 2 oz bottle at $8 is a little costly at a glance. Taking into account these bottles typically come in a 4 oz size for twice that amount it is actually a good budget pick. Eight dollars seems a lot at first for a mere 2 oz bottle but do the math on either Urban Decay or Skindinavia’s bottles and you’re saving a good deal of money. 2. TOO strong a mist. Here’s where things got bad…..these should produce a fine mist when spritzed onto face. However, something went terribly wrong with NYX’s mister (bottle) as it delivers a BLAST of mist into your face that does more harm than good. I found it difficult to mist evenly onto my face as it felt like the spritzer was on steady stream rather than a simple mist one. I ended up with too much of the product everywhere and it smudged my mascara, liner, and blush a bit due to that steady stream. I literally had to pat it off with a washcloth. I find I have to have the bottle VERY far away from my face and follow up with a tissue to pat it into place. I didn’t want to have to do this but in order to test it best I had too. On the upside it does well mattifying my shine forehead and keeping it matte for a good four to five hours. I have drier skin but my forehead is oily. So long as I pat it into place correctly it won’t mess up my makeup and thus creates a visible barrier between my skin and the open air. You can feel it get a little tighter after application but it’s not an uncomfortable tightness. My eyeshadow and blush weren’t terribly extended with this nor was my BB Cream or foundation. Overall, the faulty packaging doesn’t make me terribly inclined to recommend it. I’m hoping the other formula has a better bottle/mister. Unfortunately, I felt like I was hosing myself down rather than aiding it to keep anything in place for longer wear. Le sigh! Really wanted to like this. It’s available now at Ulta. Anyone try it? What sort of results did you get with it? You may also enjoy...

After telling you all about the virtues of Philosophy’s Sugar Plum Fairy in a previous post I’m excited to tell you that the line has been extended to a salt scrub! Philosophy Sugar Plum Fairy Body Scrub Wahoo! This scurb is a Nordstrom Exclusive and available for purchase now! The scrub is $25 which is a good deal as they are heavy duty jars full of yummie scrub to make your rough bits nice and soft! I just purchased Senorita Margarita scrub for a dear friend as a gift and this I believe would make a very nice Christmas pressie if she ends up loving the scrub! You can purchase your Sugar Plum Fairy by clicking your way over to Nordies ! It’s in the Muse’s cart already! Sephora Enchanted Eye Palettes By Isabella Muse on October 30, 2007 2 Comments in Sephora I’m doodling around making my wish list for the Sephora Friends and Family Event and I think I’m kinda sorta wanting the new Sephora Enchanted Eye Palettes. Sephora Purple Enchanted Eye Palette as seen on Sephora.com Sephora Gold Enchanted Eye Palette as seen on Sephora.com These are $26 each and include eight different textured shades of shadow (most shimmer! Yay the Muse loves her shimmery shadows!) in a slick compact. Two color options are available for these and they are Gold and Purple. After discount they’ll be about $21 so not a bad deal eh? I had mentioned these in my previous post and they hadn’t been listed on site yet but they are up and now available for sale ? Count the Muse curious about these little palettes! Want ’em? Need ’em? Waste of Money? Tell the Muse all about it! Esprique Precious Illuminate Nuancer Review By Isabella Muse on October 30, 2007 6 Comments in Esprique Precious , Japanese Brands One of favorite companies, Kose , has some great brand branch offs that I adore. Kose, like Kanebo, is made up of several companies that make some wonderful high end cosmetics. Some of these companies you may be familiar with they consist of Visee, Fasio, Beaute de Kose and one that I’ll be discussing today, Esprique Precious . Esprique Precious has a great line up of various cosmetic items and the one I’ll be reviewing today is the Esprique Precious Illuminate Nuancer Pearls. These pearls quite remind me of Guerlain’s Meteorites at a fraction of the cost. These come in two color variations 01 and 02. 01 is the color I have and I’m currently wanting 02. 01 is a sheer, shimmering, iridescent powder while 02 appears to have a bit of color to it and almost a bronze look! The brush the pearls come with is very soft and full and it offers a nice area of coverage on your cheekbones and face when applying plus no shedding which is a pet peeve of mine ? I give these quite a good, solid review and recommendation they work fantastic at lightening up your face and giving a soft, dewy glow after blush application or you can always use these on a fresh bare face for a bit of a soft, light to your cheeks! When you run the brush across these you don’t pick up a ton of powder which pleases me as I hate the messy application I sometimes run into when using Meteorites and the loads of powder one stroke of my brush comes up with! With the Illuminate Nuancer pearls I end up with a very fine layer of powder that I can stroke on gently and not end up with tons of fall out! If you’re fair skinned these will work wonderfully at making your cheeks glow, if you’re medium skin they will give your skin a dewy look, and I assume if you’re a bit of a dark skin tone you’d notice a bit of a shine to your face (a nice shine). The shimmer isn’t insane in this powder so no worries about looking like you have a ton of glitter on your face. It’s just a very fine shimmer that all mixes well with the iridescence of the powder to create a glowing look! I personally use mine as a sort of finishing powder to complete a look. After blush application I apply a quick stroke or two of this and I’m looking pretty and bright! It does a good job of waking my face up and I like to stroke some under my eyes which makes me look like I had quite a few hours of sleep when in reality I haven’t! For the life of me I can’t remember where I purchased these. It could be JpMon! But I will give you a rundown where you can purchase them! Adam Beauty has these in both colors for $29 plus reasonable shippings costs. JPmon has these for $36 plus shipping costs. These have become a must have in my morning makeup routine! I recommend grabbing some for yourself and giving them a whirl! They are most definitely Muse approved! Sephora Friends and Family Discount Rumors By Isabella Muse on October 30, 2007 2 Comments in Steals and Deals Hello Pretties. Just a little update on the Friends and Family front. From what I am seeing the sale may begin November 3rd and the discount code might be FF2007. These are all rumors of course so we’ll have to see! I’ll keep you posted with details as I see/hear them! Sephora Holiday Catalog 2007 By Isabella Muse on October 29, 2007 7 Comments in Sephora It’s official. The Sephora Holiday Catalog 2007 is Live and Ready for your viewing pleasure on Sephora.com! I collect the Holiday catalogs from year to year and I’m happy to say that the cover model is gorgeous this year! I’m liking the “fairy tale”, “enchanted” theme! Last year’s Carnival didn’t thrill me so I’m quite happy to say that this year’s cover is fabulous and the entire theme sounds great! Sephora Holiday Catalog 2007 Inside is just as good with bold, vibrant eye looks in a wonderful array of ultra awesome color! A few items that caught my eye: Urban Decay Flavored Body Powders….wow how retro! I loved these when they first came out but I think they may past their sell by date! Don’t get me wrong I adore these and use them in looks all the time but the general idea of repromoting them in the Sephora Holiday Catalog makes me scratch my head slightly! Check out page 18-19 Flipping through I’m seeing a trend of repromoting older items such as Urban Decay Deluxe Eyeshadow on pages 2-3…hmm how boring. Sephora’s new bath line mmm…..you’d think by now that they’d have gotten this right! Aren’t these the same exact bottles we had ages ago? Again another vintage tale of woe! I remember these going for like 99% off after the Holiday one year! Oh Sephora please just stop with the Bath items! Check out page 24-25 The White Croc Pop Up Brush Set at $45 looks quite interesting as does the Sephora Prestige Brush Set at $150 (Looks like quite a haul of brushes for the price). Check out page 36-37 I see a Sephora Holiday palette in purple on page 14-15 this could make the wish list! Hmmm…. Sephora’s Color Eye Palette $26 (Purple Compact) The Muse thinks they did a great job with the catalog. The looks are gorgeous, the theme sounds fantastic, and the layout looks very nice! However, the products and gifts inside fail to wow me which is good and bad. Good as it saves me money for more Japanese Holiday Collections. Bad because it’s been so very long since a Sephora Catalog has had me jumping around in circles! Keep in mind some of the items in the catalog are not yet live on the website so if you’re planning on ordering wait for at least 24-48 hours while they update! I’ve noticed a few items such as the Prestige Brush Collection and the Sephora Holiday Palette are not yet available for purchase! Oh well! Money saved! What do you think? Want any of this? Love it? Hate it? Snore? Tell me!']",34a9abbd781daf110660c69008c021e7f59e94f9,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4247,

"['Your Resource for Japanese Cosmetic Reviews By Isabella Muse on October 30, 2007 2 Comments in Friends , Japanese Brands I’ve been meaning to get to this for ages and never had a chance! If you’re by chance looking for a review on older or new Japanese Cosmetics I’ll tell you my #1 resource to find out if I should or shouldn’t purchase an item! You’re thinking I’m going to recommend you visit Rouge Deluxe but actually I’m not. Now I visit my lovely, sweet, gorgeous friend Iris at Rouge Deluxe obsessively 5 times or more a day ( Hey I’m her biggest fan!)! But when I’m seeking out a review on Japanese products I must deem Kathi the Queen of reviews. You probably know her from Cozy or you probably know her from MUA. She’s an absolute walking encyclopedia for all good things Japanese! With that said I recommend you have a visit with her and go through her archives of over 200 cosmetics that she’s used, taken photos of, and reviewed (I find myself drooling whenever I go back to some of her older reviews)! If you’re an MUA member you can check here out by clicking here . If you’re not an MUA member you’ll have to become a member to read the reviews ? Being an MUA member has it’s benefits and it’s well worth your time as it’s a good source of cosmetic information! Kathi’s a sweetie and a wonderful girl and takes time out of her busy schedule to do some incredible reviews! I dunno what I’d do without her! So an Ode to Kathi and her great reviews on MUA!

"['Avon Horizon Blush by Jillian Dempsey Color Comparisons By Isabella Muse on March 17, 2008 25 Comments in Avon , Beauty Babblings Ok so I finally laid my hands on Pink Horizon which I was moaning about sometime last week ( Click! ). Since we were all musing and wondering what the hell the difference was between Pink and Apricot Horizon I decided to do pictures. I was finally able to locate Pink Horizon on E-bay since it’s still unavailable at Avon’s website yet but after much bitching, moaning, whining, and pissing about how much I wanted it I scored on E-bay and it popped into my mail box on Saturday! I was properly chuffed to have it as I was so utterly in love with Apricot Horizon I knew that the pink variation would be true love as well! I wasn’t wrong. As soon as I opened Pink Horizon I fell deeply in love once again! It’s perfectly pigmented, beautiful, and gives my face the perfect touch of color. I said it before and I’ll say it again these are well worth the effort of tracking down and purchasing for your own! Pink is truly pink. After the many musings we had over how Apricot Horizon looked so pink I’m happy to report that pink is truly pink. The pink variation of this is a truer pink then it’s peach sister and you can obviously see when the two are side by side which is the peach version and which is the pink. Apricot Horizon even appears more peachy then pink when it’s beside Pink Horizon. Color pay off is different from Apricot and I get more of a pinched pink look from Pink Horizon and more of a peachy glow from Apricot Horizon. All and all the colors are most definately different! After all that babbling here they are side by side: Apricot Horizon Pink Horizon Have these? Want ’em? Loving the shades? Tell the Muse! You may also enjoy...

"['The Muse Wants a Bathroom She Can Play Baseball In By Isabella Muse on October 29, 2007 Leave a Comment in Pieces of Life I’ll need a credit card that’s got no limit….. The Muse has decided to trade her life for fortune and fame! She’s even going to cut her hair and change her name! Hehe…a girl can dream ? The Muse is Live on Specktra By Isabella Muse on October 29, 2007 9 Comments in Babblings Your Muse has made the jump and she’s live on Specktra! In a prior blog I had told you I’d be joining up with Specktra to write a weekly column. So this week mark’s a new part of Musings of a Muse as I join up with Specktra to bring new and exciting products to delight and tempt you ? Every Wednesday I’ll go from being just the Muse and convert myself into Specktra’s Product Muse! I’m very excited to take this project on and hopefully I can bring you some new and exciting reviews, products, and general awesome cosmetics bits and pieces! You can read my very first introductory post at Specktra by clicking here ! Bath and Body Works Holiday Tempations Line Up By Isabella Muse on October 29, 2007 2 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Holiday Collections 2007 , Shower & Bath , Winter Collections 2007 As you can probably tell from my past blog entries I’m really loving the Temptations line at Bath and Body Works ! I can’t help it I have that “collect ’em all” disease when it comes to these fabulous Three in One Shower Gels. I used to be a true Philosophy Girl and adored the Three in One’s but I find that the Temptation line is better in quality, cheaper, and has a larger scent selection so as of the past few months Bath and Body Works has my money in the shower gel department sorry Philosophy! Check out the new Holiday line up and try to convince me you don’t absolutely want some of these! Oh my the Muse does like the idea of Sassy Strawberry ! This new shower gel from Bath and Body works is scented in Strawberry and Mint! A Marriage most divine in the Muse’s opinion! If you’re on a bit of a mint kick check out the Dreamy Chocolate Mint ! My mouth is watering! Since you’re feeding your sweet tooth I’d say that the Glittery Gumdrop sounds just sweet enough to bring a sugar and sweet to your shower! It’s been said that the Muse is made up of Sugar and Spice and all things Nice (you can add cheeky into the mix too if you so please!)! So why shouldn’t she have those things in her shower! Sugar and Spice sounds just the shower gel for me! The line up looks amazing and you know that these most definitely will end up stuffed in my stocking this year just don’t think the Muse too cheap if she waits for Boxing Day to purchase them so she might nab them at $3-$6 instead of the original $12 price tag! She highly recommends ordering these Christmas Eve Night (or the day after Christmas) when she knows they’ll most definitely be on sale! Want these? Nordstrom Exclusive: MAC Keepsake By Isabella Muse on October 29, 2007 2 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Friends A most gorgeous friend and reader of Musings of a Muse has pictures up of her latest haul! Check out Stephanie’s blog by clicking here to view her haul! She has up pictures from the Nordstrom MAC Exclusive that I didn’t get! I have Shimmertime pigment and the Softsparkle Pencil already which was why I didn’t purchase this set but now seeing Steph’s pictures I’m wanting this set! You can also see the rest of her Holiday haul ? Good purchases Steph! Thanks for sharing with us and the Muse can’t be held responsible if a ton of people want to kidnap Daisy after seeing her on your blog ? Bath on a Budget: Fantasy Bath By Isabella Muse on October 29, 2007 Leave a Comment in Bath on a Budget , Shower & Bath I know sometimes Musings has many posh, high end cosmetics and body products so lately I’ve been slowly incorporating cheaper options into my entries! Items that I use and have found effective that are high quality and inexpensive! The Muse loves a good deal. When it’s a good deal and works well she likes to share it with the world! I know of one lovely reader in particular who was looking for options aside from Lush for bath bombs! The weather is getting colder now and nothing feels better to me then sinking into some hot water at the end of a hard day with a gorgeous bath bomb fizzing away while I indulge in reading some good book or magazine! As much as I adore Lush bath bombs I have to admit that they are expensive at $6 and upwards per a bath! I give my utmost approval and recommendation when it comes to Lush and I can’t say enough good things about the high quality bombs they sell however when you’re ready to venture into something a bit more unusual and inexpensive you can wander over to Fantasy Bath and you can stock up on some wonderful bombs for half the price as some other shops! Now Fantasy Bath has an array of products but I’m going to be concentrating on the Bath Bombs as I’ve tried those and find them fantastic! Now as much as I love bombs it deserves to be mentioned that they also sell fizzing bath powder which works in the same fashion as a bomb but it’s in powder form! I’ve tried the bath powder and I must say I really enjoy it! They sell it in 1lb and 3lb bags which gives you plenty of powder in a ziploc baggie that you can use as little or much as your heart desires! These bombs are highly moisturizing and when you step out of the tub and dry off your skin will be quite happy! I normally don’t have to moisturize after my bath with one of these as they leave my skin feeling quite dewy and slick. A majority of the bombs are 9oz in size at around $4.25-$4.95 per bomb that’s quite a nice deal because if you’re being frugal you can get two baths out of one bomb. Lush bombs are 6.3oz in size and run about $5.50-6.95 and upwards. You can see you’re getting a larger bomb for a little less of the price which is, as Martha Stewart would say, a good thing! One of my favs in the lineup at Fantasy Bath is Snow Wonder! Yum this is so good! The bomb is a combo of Cranberry, Apple, Yuzu, Mint, and Amber. For me I just get tart, fruity yum! This is something I’d normally not pick for myself because I’m not a fan of amber however when I sink into a tub full of Snow Wonder all I smell is a cocktail of tart fruits and almost a hint of some sort of floral! This is a strong, lingering bomb that will leave your hair (if you’re a dunker) and body beautifully scented for hours (even a day) after your bath! Wake Up Sleepy Head is another of favorite of mine and the perfect bath experience if you’re looking for an exhilarating, wake up bath! Sometimes you’ve had a long day at work on a Friday and you really want to go out but your body is protesting! This be the perfect bath bomb to wake you up, refresh you, and ready you for a late night of Friday fun! This bomb is scented with grapefruit, lemons, lime, tangerines and a hint of vanilla! I don’t quite get the vanilla when I sink into the tub but I most definitely get the eye opening tart citrus combo that jolts me in the face when I’m lazing in the tub! This is a delightful bomb that the Muse fully enjoys and recommends! These are just two of my favorites from Fantasy Bath but do look out for some others that are fantastic as well such as Peaches n’ Cream, Margaritaville, and Key Lime Pie! As fantastic as Lush is you won’t ever find something as foody as Key Lime Pie in a bath bomb from them ? The Muse likes to spoil you so she kindly asked the owner of Fantasy Bath if she’d be so kind as to extend some sort of discount to readers of Musings and she’s granted the Muse’s request! Yay for you guys! If you purchase something from Fantasy Bath they will kindly gift you with a Holiday Bath Bomb, of their choice, FREE of charge! Just enter into the comment box at checkout that you heard about them from my blog and they’ll gift you with your free bomb! You can also receive free shipping on orders of $50 and up!

"['Happy Halloween from This Muse’s House to Yours! By Isabella Muse on October 31, 2007 4 Comments in Babbling Bits To all my readers here at Musings of a Muse the Muse wishes you a Creepy, Spooky, Happy, and Safe Halloween! Bath on a Budget: Skindazzles By Isabella Muse on October 31, 2007 2 Comments in Bath on a Budget , Shower & Bath In continuing with my Bath on a Budget hot topic of the moment today I present to you some nice goodies from Skindazzles ! Two bath products that I adore from Skindazzles are the Bath Bombs and the Shea Boom Candy! The Bath Bombs and Shea Boom Candy are rotated in scent as seasons and holidays change so check back often for new scents on both! At the moment my little eye spies scents like Candy Cane Cake and Gingerbread in celebration of Christmas, which will soon be upon us! Bath Bombs are your standard bath fizzies that fizz, pop and swirl around in your tub making your bath water soft and beautifully scented! I find the scents in the bombs quite strong and lasting! I have many places I buy bath bombs from and Skindazzles makes some of my favorites! Skindazzles Bath Bomb Shea Boom Candy is a treat for your body! If you like your bath water moisturizing and soft these wonderful candies are what you seek! They are soft and squishy and melt away happily in your tub as you bath scenting the water and making your skin soft and sweet! I normally crumble this under running water but you can float it in your bath water and laze while it melts away! Upon exiting your bath you’ll see how gorgeously smooth your skin will feel! Skindazzles Shea Boom Candies Bath Bombs and Shea Boom Candy at Skindazzles are most definately fitting for bathers on a budget, bombs are $3.70 and candies are $3. Please keep in mind prior to ordering from Skindazzles that airmail shipping applies as it’s a business located within Canada however shipping prices are fairly reasonable if you get a few items! Starring Fragrances by Ashley Peldon By Isabella Muse on October 31, 2007 4 Comments in Fragrance You’re Muse happens to love unique perfumes that she can’t get in regular shops that sell fragrance! My tastes in fragrance run to the unusual I guess and when I’m seeking something sweet, foody, or unique I visit with the gorgeous Ashley Peldon at Starring Fragrances to get my fix! I have many, many, a bottle of cocktails that Ashley, herself, has created! The scents at Starring Fragrances are mostly in the foody range so if you’re a grave lover of scents that smell of cookies, cakes, or gorgeous decadent foody items this would be the spot you want to grab some very interesting blends! Ashley has recently extended her popular perfume line and is now doing custom blended hair and body care items such as lotions and shampoos! I haven’t personal tried any of the new products but I can give my Muse approval to the wonderful perfume blends that are created at Starring Fragrances! The thing that totally sells me on these perfumes is the incredible staying power and special notes within each perfume! One or two sprays is all you need to smell completely edible and delicious all day long! Upon spraying one of these you can distinctively pick out the notes with the perfume which is so amazing. If I spray myself with my favorite blend, The Scream Queen, I don’t get one particular scent from the perfume I can smell all sorts of notes through the blend all day long! As the day progresses and the perfume dries down and heats up with my body temperature I can smell the tart sweetness of the berries, the luscious vanilla ice cream, and the yummie bubble gum! If you’re looking for a unique experience in your perfume world Starring would be a great place to start! Some of the Muse’s favorite blends: The Scream Queen Yummie Berries, Vanilla Ice Cream and Bubble Gum! Yellow Marshmallow Yellow Cake with fluffy marshmallow! Red Licorice Strawberry and Cherry Licorice! Mmmm! Who Spiked the Cupcakes? Yummie cotton candy, vanilla cupcakes, and frosting! Oh my how decadent! With a Cherry on Top White Cake, Marshmallow, and of course Cherries! Starring also does a line of tarts which are fantastic as well! If having your house scented with yummie baked treats sounds tempting do check out the tart line up! Starring Fragrances is Muse approved and I can’t say enough good things about this great little e-shop! The customer service is fantastic and packages are shipped in a very timely manner with little to no wait time! Ashley is extremely sweet and accommodating with requests if you should have any! Starring does ship via parcel post which makes the Muse impatient as her goodies normally end up taking from 7-10 days to arrive. This can’t be helped as all liquid must be shipped via US parcel post by law! Starring even has a Frequent Buyer Reward System that offers various discounts with each order you make! The Muse always tries to get nice goodies for you and Ashley has been kind enough to offer readers of Musings of a Muse a special treat and as it’s Halloween it’s always nice to get a treat or two! You can try out a 1oz perfume for 1/2 Price from Starring Fragrances by entering code MUSE during checkout! This is a great deal as perfume’s run $26 at the normal price! Go get yourself a sweet treat for Halloween and tell the Muse all about it! HSN Sephora Steals and Deals By Isabella Muse on October 31, 2007 6 Comments in Steals and Deals Bit early for Steals and Deals but HSN has been featuring many Sephora brands at some great deals ? The Muse has knocked up the best deals she noticed and slapped them into a nice little blog just for you! You can thank me and tell me how great I am later! Make Up For Ever Star Powder Trio for $45 with Free Shipping These normally run $18 each and that’d be $54 for three with the HSN option you’ll be getting three at a discount of $9 plus you have an option to pay for these with their flex pay plan. Flex pay basically cuts the cost in half and charges the payment to you this month and the following month! Kinda cool if you’re wanting to space your payments apart! The Cargo Travel Collection Portable Makeup Box Set may be exclusive to HSN as I’ve never seen these items bundled together prior to this! This set is $29 with Free Shipping and includes 30 Pack a Day Lipgloss, 28 Color Cards, and Liquid Powder Foundation in a cute tin! These are great for traveling, quick makeup looks, and heck they’d make a great gift! Color Cards are $24 on Sephora and 30 Pack a Day Lipgloss is $12 so that’s a total of $36 for those two items if you purchase them separately. For an extra $4 you can get the HSN kit that includes the cute tin and Liquid Powder Foundation! I personally have the gloss packs and love these! I’ve never tried the color cards but this is a perfect excuse to do so at the price! These are just some of the great deals I came across on HSN. I’m really liking that Sephora has teamed up with HSN for one main reason, that would be the freaking awesome Free Shipping option! I think it’s so great I can just log onto HSN and get Free Shipping on say a Dior Mascara or a Cargo Blush as compared to Sephora where I have to spend $75 before getting Free Shipping! Do check out HSN for more interesting goodies! Your Specktra Product Muse Presents: Awake Stardom Eyegloss Review By Isabella Muse on October 31, 2007 3 Comments in Babblings Hello Pretties!

If you’re by chance looking for a review on older or new Japanese Cosmetics I’ll tell you my #1 resource to find out if I should or shouldn’t purchase an item! You’re thinking I’m going to recommend you visit Rouge Deluxe but actually I’m not. Now I visit my lovely, sweet, gorgeous friend Iris at Rouge Deluxe obsessively 5 times or more a day ( Hey I’m her biggest fan!)! But when I’m seeking out a review on Japanese products I must deem Kathi the Queen of reviews. You probably know her from Cozy or you probably know her from MUA. She’s an absolute walking encyclopedia for all good things Japanese! With that said I recommend you have a visit with her and go through her archives of over 200 cosmetics that she’s used, taken photos of, and reviewed (I find myself drooling whenever I go back to some of her older reviews)! If you’re an MUA member you can check here out by clicking here . If you’re not an MUA member you’ll have to become a member to read the reviews ? Being an MUA member has it’s benefits and it’s well worth your time as it’s a good source of cosmetic information! Kathi’s a sweetie and a wonderful girl and takes time out of her busy schedule to do some incredible reviews! I dunno what I’d do without her! So an Ode to Kathi and her great reviews on MUA! Thanks for making the world of Japanese Cosmetics all the more brighter my friend!']",c1eee3ba78f19ad623b6607e5f9cf732e4bad520,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4246,
"['Sephora Holiday Catalog 2007 By Isabella Muse on October 29, 2007 7 Comments in Sephora It’s official. The Sephora Holiday Catalog 2007 is Live and Ready for your viewing pleasure on Sephora.com! I collect the Holiday catalogs from year to year and I’m happy to say that the cover model is gorgeous this year! I’m liking the “fairy tale”, “enchanted” theme! Last year’s Carnival didn’t thrill me so I’m quite happy to say that this year’s cover is fabulous and the entire theme sounds great! Sephora Holiday Catalog 2007 Inside is just as good with bold, vibrant eye looks in a wonderful array of ultra awesome color! A few items that caught my eye: Urban Decay Flavored Body Powders….wow how retro! I loved these when they first came out but I think they may past their sell by date! Don’t get me wrong I adore these and use them in looks all the time but the general idea of repromoting them in the Sephora Holiday Catalog makes me scratch my head slightly! Check out page 18-19 Flipping through I’m seeing a trend of repromoting older items such as Urban Decay Deluxe Eyeshadow on pages 2-3…hmm how boring. Sephora’s new bath line mmm…..you’d think by now that they’d have gotten this right! Aren’t these the same exact bottles we had ages ago? Again another vintage tale of woe! I remember these going for like 99% off after the Holiday one year! Oh Sephora please just stop with the Bath items! Check out page 24-25 The White Croc Pop Up Brush Set at $45 looks quite interesting as does the Sephora Prestige Brush Set at $150 (Looks like quite a haul of brushes for the price). Check out page 36-37 I see a Sephora Holiday palette in purple on page 14-15 this could make the wish list! Hmmm…. Sephora’s Color Eye Palette $26 (Purple Compact) The Muse thinks they did a great job with the catalog. The looks are gorgeous, the theme sounds fantastic, and the layout looks very nice! However, the products and gifts inside fail to wow me which is good and bad. Good as it saves me money for more Japanese Holiday Collections. Bad because it’s been so very long since a Sephora Catalog has had me jumping around in circles! Keep in mind some of the items in the catalog are not yet live on the website so if you’re planning on ordering wait for at least 24-48 hours while they update! I’ve noticed a few items such as the Prestige Brush Collection and the Sephora Holiday Palette are not yet available for purchase! Oh well! Money saved! What do you think? Want any of this? Love it?

"['Esprique Precious Illuminate Nuancer Review By Isabella Muse on October 30, 2007 6 Comments in Esprique Precious , Japanese Brands One of favorite companies, Kose , has some great brand branch offs that I adore. Kose, like Kanebo, is made up of several companies that make some wonderful high end cosmetics. Some of these companies you may be familiar with they consist of Visee, Fasio, Beaute de Kose and one that I’ll be discussing today, Esprique Precious . Esprique Precious has a great line up of various cosmetic items and the one I’ll be reviewing today is the Esprique Precious Illuminate Nuancer Pearls. These pearls quite remind me of Guerlain’s Meteorites at a fraction of the cost. These come in two color variations 01 and 02. 01 is the color I have and I’m currently wanting 02. 01 is a sheer, shimmering, iridescent powder while 02 appears to have a bit of color to it and almost a bronze look! The brush the pearls come with is very soft and full and it offers a nice area of coverage on your cheekbones and face when applying plus no shedding which is a pet peeve of mine ? I give these quite a good, solid review and recommendation they work fantastic at lightening up your face and giving a soft, dewy glow after blush application or you can always use these on a fresh bare face for a bit of a soft, light to your cheeks! When you run the brush across these you don’t pick up a ton of powder which pleases me as I hate the messy application I sometimes run into when using Meteorites and the loads of powder one stroke of my brush comes up with! With the Illuminate Nuancer pearls I end up with a very fine layer of powder that I can stroke on gently and not end up with tons of fall out! If you’re fair skinned these will work wonderfully at making your cheeks glow, if you’re medium skin they will give your skin a dewy look, and I assume if you’re a bit of a dark skin tone you’d notice a bit of a shine to your face (a nice shine). The shimmer isn’t insane in this powder so no worries about looking like you have a ton of glitter on your face. It’s just a very fine shimmer that all mixes well with the iridescence of the powder to create a glowing look! I personally use mine as a sort of finishing powder to complete a look. After blush application I apply a quick stroke or two of this and I’m looking pretty and bright! It does a good job of waking my face up and I like to stroke some under my eyes which makes me look like I had quite a few hours of sleep when in reality I haven’t! For the life of me I can’t remember where I purchased these. It could be JpMon! But I will give you a rundown where you can purchase them! Adam Beauty has these in both colors for $29 plus reasonable shippings costs. JPmon has these for $36 plus shipping costs. These have become a must have in my morning makeup routine! I recommend grabbing some for yourself and giving them a whirl! They are most definitely Muse approved! You may also enjoy... Est?e Lauder Shimmering Powder Pearls Coffret D’Or On Sale!

"['Bath on a Budget: Fantasy Bath By Isabella Muse on October 29, 2007 Leave a Comment in Bath on a Budget , Shower & Bath I know sometimes Musings has many posh, high end cosmetics and body products so lately I’ve been slowly incorporating cheaper options into my entries! Items that I use and have found effective that are high quality and inexpensive! The Muse loves a good deal. When it’s a good deal and works well she likes to share it with the world! I know of one lovely reader in particular who was looking for options aside from Lush for bath bombs! The weather is getting colder now and nothing feels better to me then sinking into some hot water at the end of a hard day with a gorgeous bath bomb fizzing away while I indulge in reading some good book or magazine! As much as I adore Lush bath bombs I have to admit that they are expensive at $6 and upwards per a bath! I give my utmost approval and recommendation when it comes to Lush and I can’t say enough good things about the high quality bombs they sell however when you’re ready to venture into something a bit more unusual and inexpensive you can wander over to Fantasy Bath and you can stock up on some wonderful bombs for half the price as some other shops! Now Fantasy Bath has an array of products but I’m going to be concentrating on the Bath Bombs as I’ve tried those and find them fantastic! Now as much as I love bombs it deserves to be mentioned that they also sell fizzing bath powder which works in the same fashion as a bomb but it’s in powder form! I’ve tried the bath powder and I must say I really enjoy it! They sell it in 1lb and 3lb bags which gives you plenty of powder in a ziploc baggie that you can use as little or much as your heart desires! These bombs are highly moisturizing and when you step out of the tub and dry off your skin will be quite happy! I normally don’t have to moisturize after my bath with one of these as they leave my skin feeling quite dewy and slick. A majority of the bombs are 9oz in size at around $4.25-$4.95 per bomb that’s quite a nice deal because if you’re being frugal you can get two baths out of one bomb. Lush bombs are 6.3oz in size and run about $5.50-6.95 and upwards. You can see you’re getting a larger bomb for a little less of the price which is, as Martha Stewart would say, a good thing! One of my favs in the lineup at Fantasy Bath is Snow Wonder! Yum this is so good! The bomb is a combo of Cranberry, Apple, Yuzu, Mint, and Amber. For me I just get tart, fruity yum! This is something I’d normally not pick for myself because I’m not a fan of amber however when I sink into a tub full of Snow Wonder all I smell is a cocktail of tart fruits and almost a hint of some sort of floral! This is a strong, lingering bomb that will leave your hair (if you’re a dunker) and body beautifully scented for hours (even a day) after your bath! Wake Up Sleepy Head is another of favorite of mine and the perfect bath experience if you’re looking for an exhilarating, wake up bath! Sometimes you’ve had a long day at work on a Friday and you really want to go out but your body is protesting! This be the perfect bath bomb to wake you up, refresh you, and ready you for a late night of Friday fun! This bomb is scented with grapefruit, lemons, lime, tangerines and a hint of vanilla! I don’t quite get the vanilla when I sink into the tub but I most definitely get the eye opening tart citrus combo that jolts me in the face when I’m lazing in the tub! This is a delightful bomb that the Muse fully enjoys and recommends! These are just two of my favorites from Fantasy Bath but do look out for some others that are fantastic as well such as Peaches n’ Cream, Margaritaville, and Key Lime Pie! As fantastic as Lush is you won’t ever find something as foody as Key Lime Pie in a bath bomb from them ? The Muse likes to spoil you so she kindly asked the owner of Fantasy Bath if she’d be so kind as to extend some sort of discount to readers of Musings and she’s granted the Muse’s request! Yay for you guys! If you purchase something from Fantasy Bath they will kindly gift you with a Holiday Bath Bomb, of their choice, FREE of charge! Just enter into the comment box at checkout that you heard about them from my blog and they’ll gift you with your free bomb! You can also receive free shipping on orders of $50 and up!

Jelly Pong Pong Review By Isabella Muse on November 4, 2007 17 Comments in Jelly Pong Pong I got a very nice package this week filled with gorgeous bits and pieces from Jelly Pong Pong ! Since I have all this lovely new makeup to play with I thought I’d share a review of it with my gorgeous readers! Remember how much I hate bronzer? Well I’m happy to report that the Jelly Pong Pong Omnibronzer is quite an interesting little product! Jelly Pong Pong Omnibronzer It comes in a faux leather case (this will keep my spare change from getting lost on the bottom of my purse) that you can unzip to get to the actual compact, very chic and cute in the Muse’s opinion! The compact is tiny and quite sweet with the powder on top and a flip lid to reveal the super soft brush beneath. So I’m very weary of bronzers of any kind they just don’t agree with me or my skin however this particular bronzer shows up a lovely healthy peach color on my skin!! I was shocked as the actual color of the powder is a typical brownish muddy color that I detest with a passion but upon stroking it on my cheeks it makes me look quite fresh and healthy! To say I’m impressed is an understatement! I need a back up of this amazing stuff! The bronzer is a universal color and should work on all skin types! It’s available for $29usd from Jelly Pong Pong and well worth the price tag as it could be the most perfect shade of peach I’ve come across! Next up the Supermodel Stain which like the Omnibronzer comes in a cute little compact! This compact is super small but has quite a nice bit of product inside! It’s pink in color and features three “models” on the cover (guess that’s where the name comes into play right?). The color I got is Slenderella and I was a bit weary as it’s really a pale shade of pink which would be much better suited to a very fair skinned person! However, I’m happy to report that it works perfectly on my skin tone and it gives me a sweet flush of color! Anytime I use cream stains or blushes I always get the look of “just out of the cold weather” and this is no different it gives my cheeks a bite of color that’s very natural and young! 5 colors are available from the website and each compact is $19usd! The Muse is now lemming Nymphette and Cupcake Pout which both look quite appealing! The item I’ve been lemming for a while and wanting to try is the Gourmet Lip Therapy and I’m lucky enough to have gotten my chance to try it in the flavor Real Honey! First of all the packaging on this is ultra cute with a pop up design when opened (you’ll see my pictures in this post for yourself). The actual gloss tastes like I’m slathering honey on my lips minus the stickiness of real honey! It’s quite a slippery emollient lipgloss which is exactly the way I prefer my gloss as it glides on easy and doesn’t leave my lips feeling tacky, sticky and just gross! Gourmet Lip Therapy comes in three flavors and are $16usd! Jelly Pong Pong Gourmet Lip Therapy Love multitasking makeup? I do. On the days I’m too bloody lazy to bother with a full face I turn to the easiest and simplest ways to make myself presentable and pretty! Jelly Pong Pong offers Love Rouge to multitask my way through cheeks and lips in one easy step! Love Rouge is a duo of colors that can be used as a touch of color on your cheeks or a slip of color across your lips! Easy, Simple, Out the door quickly! I love multitasking makeup ? $16usd nabs you a cute duo of color to make makeup simple when life is being complicated! Jelly Pong Pong Love Rouge Teint Sublime is something that actually DOES what Benefit That Gal promises! When I originally seen the color of this I was thinking it was a big no for me. It’s a baby pink that could not look great on me! However, upon trying it I’m shocked to say that it brightened my rather dull skin up and created a nice soft matte finish to my skin for makeup application! Now this is actually to combat skin problems such as dull skin, red spots, etc….however I found it works great as under makeup primer! I even felt like I didn’t need to wear foundation after using it! Interesting little product! It’s available in a variety of formulas to combat common skin problems and in my opinion well worth the price! I do believe I need more of this! $20usd gets you a nice size amount to clear up skin woes and make you gorgeous! I forgot to add the packaging is kinda awesome on this (hey I’m a geek! Packaging sales cosmetics for me)! It’s a cardboard box with a zipper that actually works! How freaking nifty is that? Sorry but these little touches really tickle me! Jelly Pong Pong Teint Sublime One product that fails to wow the Muse was Gloss BonBon ! This is a multitasking gloss and cheek stain like Love Rouge. I haven’t actually used it on my face as of yet but I did use it on my lips and didn’t like the texture. It was a really weird chalky gloss that was doing nothing for my lips! I’m curious how it’ll look on my cheeks but I’m not sure after trying it on my lips if it’ll be any better on my face! This is available in a variety of colors for $12usd and maybe one of the other colors would work better on me I’m not sure but this one wasn’t great for the Muse! Jelly Pong Pong Gloss Bonbon Overall I’d say Jelly Pong Pong has some very interesting little products that I really enjoyed trying out and reviewing for you! My wish list is quite huge after wandering on the site and I feel the urge to do an order very shortly! Stay tuned ? I’ll update you with what I get and what I think! Already a Jelly Pong Pong user and lover? Tell the Muse what you’ve tried and why you love or hate it! Early Christmas Shopping Guide By Isabella Muse on November 2, 2007 7 Comments in Steals and Deals Instead of my normal Steals and Deal entry this weekend I thought I’d present you with an early Christmas shopping guide! I normally start Christmas shopping around the second week or so of November but so many good deals are around now is a good time to start! If you’re looking for a special beauty product for your friends, family, or maybe even a neighbor (or hey maybe you’re looking for a little something to spoil yourself) here are some great deals that will please any girly girl on your list! I’m not partial to it myself but the Sephora Blockbuster Palette would make a great gift for the cosmetic lover in your life! $48usd nabs you an array of goodies and if you happen to purchase it during the Friends and Family Event it’ll cut the cost to $38usd! If you happen to live outside of the US I’d say this is still a good deal because it’ll probably cost about $12-15 to ship via airmail so you end up with about the original price tag when purchasing during the discount! Sephora Blackbuster Palette The palette includes 64 eyeshadows, 32 lip colors, 7 blushes, one shimmer powder, four applicators, two blush brushes, and two lip brushes! Obviously with all that packed into one very sleek, smart palette it’s a steal and a deal! It may seem like a weird gift but I can’t think of a single person who wouldn’t love a big old bottle of Philosophy Candy Cane Three in One Shower Gel! You can get a HUGE helping of Candy Cane (32oz’s of creamy, minty shower gel) for $25! The 16oz size is normally $20 so, hey, for $5 bucks more go super size and grab a nice large helping to get you through Christmas and beyond! You can nab this large size from QVC just search for item number A69545! Philosophy Candy Cane Three in One Shower Gel as seen on QVC Since you’re going super size on the Candy Cane you can pick up the 32oz size of Gingerbread Man for $22.80usd! Just search for item number A74732 to nab yourself this deal. The Muse isn’t a fan of this but she can’t disagree on the great price! Philosophy’s The Gingerbread Man Three in One Shower Gel as seen on QVC The prices just keep getting lower and for $21.97 you can grab the 32oz size of one of the Muse’s favorite scented shower gels from Philosophy, Cinnamon Buns (I like mixing a little Candy Cane and Cinnamon Bun together! Yum!)! Item Number A61756 grabs you a nice large helping of Cinnamon Buns minus the calories! Philosophy Cinnamon Buns Three in One as seen on QVC QVC is probably the only place I’ve seen these large sizes available and I can’t begin to say what a great deal they are! My target audience here at Musings of a Muse are from Asia and Europe so a little tip for you my pretties! If by chance you are lemming these fine items the Muse will tell you a nice little secret! You can purchase two or three of these and have them shipped via airmail for a flat rate of $37usd! The prices for the gels are quite obscene Euro side so this will most definitely save you a ton of cash! In your case if you purchased three of these and used the flat rate shipping method it would cost you about $35usd per a bottle which again is a great deal! If you happen to have a friend or family member to split the bottle with you’ll each be paying about $17usd per 16oz which is almost the original price of a smaller bottle here in the US! A good deal all around in the Muse’s opinion! I’ve already previously mentioned this but it does deserve a re-mention you can get three 16oz Philosophy Shower Gels (these include little gift bags as well!) for $35usd! Purchased separately that would be $48usd! Item Number A5322 gets you all three with gift bags! A Few Good Men Philosophy Shower Gel Trio Available at QVC Here’s another little product that the Muse has previously mentioned but thought was worth a re-mention! Bath and Body Works has a duo of Hand and Body Lotion and Hand Wash for $15usd! These are jumbo 16oz sizes and at $15usd bucks you can’t go wrong! A 3.3oz bottle of one of the Muse’s favorite perfumes, Agent Provocateur, will set you back $110 but you don’t have to pay that much for the large bottle! How about saving $33 on the large bottle and nabbing it for $76.99. Sweet deal in the Muse’s opinion! If you (or yourself) have someone very special (like your mum or best friend) to spoil this season this is a posh deal! You can nab this deal at Costco (Yes, yes I know shopping for AP at Costco isn’t exactly glamerous but hey the price is right!). Ok kids get shopping! That’s it for this weeks Christmas Shopping Steals and Deals! I’ll bring you more as I see them pop up! Ready, Set, Save! Sephora Friends and Family Discount is a Go! By Isabella Muse on November 2, 2007 1 Comment in Sephora , Steals and Deals Ok pretties! Get your wish lists, shopping lists, and credit cards ready! Sephora Friends and Family Discount is a go! Promo Code FF2007 Get shopping and after come back to visit the Muse and tell her what you purchased! PS the good stuff is still in stock if you hurry!

"['The Muse’s Gift Ideas: Philosophy Shower Gels on the Cheap! By Isabella Muse on December 7, 2009 10 Comments in Gift Ideas , Philosophy , Shower & Bath The Muse doesn’t think she ever gets tired of gifting Philosophy during the Holidays. Philosophy has always been a number one spot for grabbing fantastic, rich looking gifts that won’t break my bank. If you want to break it up even further check out my ways to give (or get) Philosophy on the cheap this year! This weekend the Muse’s very beautiful aunt was here from Canada visiting. She wanted to do a bit of shopping and honestly the Muse has no trouble with doing that so away we went. She specifically asked if we could head to Marshalls and to my surprise and utter delight they had a a wonderful array of Philosophy Shower Gels which I hauled pretty hard for not only gifts but myself. Each gel was $12.99 each for 8oz or 16oz sizes. I got for myself Fruit Pinch, Cherry Cola, and Spicy Gum Drop. For friends and family I hauled hard on Spicy Gum Drop, The Gingerbread Man, Belgian Waffles, and Spiced Apple Cider. They also had a really sweet gift set for $29.99 which had four, 4oz bottles in different scents some of which I never heard of like peony! It was called the seasonal pack and each bottle represented a season (Winter, Summer, Fall, etc…). Honestly, for the price it was a nice surprise savings. I highly suggest heading to Marshalls and snagging some if you can. Get some lovely gift bags with beautiful tissue paper, stick a bottle inside each bag with a shower puff, a loofah, and maybe a sponge or pretty wash cloth. I guarantee it’ll be a smashing success with whoever receives it. If your Marshalls doesn’t have any take advantage of Philosophy’s own sale by purchasing 3 bottles for $33 by entering promo code DELICIOUS at checkout. Choose from over 15 different scents! Visit www.philosophy.com Philosophy Shower Gels makes a perfect little gift in this Muse’s opinion especially when it’s cheap. Likey!

"['Lush Carrot Top Bubble Bar Review By Isabella Muse on March 28, 2013 12 Comments in Bath & Body , Bath on a Budget , Lush , Shower & Bath , Spring Collections 2013 PR Sample Affiliate Link If you’re the frugal gourmet when it comes to luxurious baths the new Lush Carrot Top Bubble Bar is for you! I can’t begin to tell you how many of my friends think how absurd it is for me to drop a $5 to $8 bath bomb or bubble bar in my tub and use it once. Hell, one of my close friends says I’m burning money when I burn tarts from Yankee Candle. Dude! How could you? But I get it. It’s true. A fiver on a bath is quite a luxurious treat. That’s why you’ll love Lush’s new Carrot Top Bubble Bar, it’s the bubble bar that keeps on giving! Typically Lush Bubble Bars are for single uses. Lush wants you to toss the entire damn thing in the tub so you’ll have a crazy amount of bubbles, a wicked amount of fun, and an overall awesome bath. However, there are those that choose to slice that Bubble Bar into numerous pieces and spread it out into several baths versus one. Good for you, you’re very economical and I’m spoiled and possibly far from thrifty because I have been known the toss an entire bar in and enjoy my bath until I turn into a raisin. Now Lush Carrot Top is one of Lush’s newer creations. Lush started creating these reusable bubble bars in the last year or so. Yes, they are reusable. You basically grab the stem of your little carrot bubble bar and swish it around in your bath water. It’ll creates lovely bubbles and scent your bath with lemon and buchu (it kinda smells like a carrot on citrus crack). Swish, swish, swish until you get enough bubbles now leave your carrot to try on top of a paper towel or washcloth. After he dries off place him in a plastic baggie and bring him out to use for your next bath! He’ll last over 7 to 10 baths! Nifty right? That’s a buck a bath! Plus he scents your skin with a beautiful citrus scent and makes it smooth and soft to the touch! See? Carrots aren’t only good for your eyes but your body as well!

"[""Teen Corner: Pigment Pressing Tutorial By Isabella Muse on November 6, 2007 Leave a Comment in Friends , Pimpin' If you’re a great reader of beauty blogs like the Muse you must make several stops to Makeup Bag a day (it’s ok you can admit your addiction to this great site)! A wonderful and beautiful lady runs the site by the name of Erika and she has three gorgeous daughters one of which writes a column each week entitled Teen Corner. This week I did so have to share with you, if you hadn’t already seen it, Bree’s (Erika’s daughter) fantastic Pigment Pressing Tutorial! I’ve seen plenty pigment pressing tutorials but I find Bree’s entertaining and fun to read and quite helpful so I really HAD to link her! Go visit this adorable girl ? I’m sure her mum is very, very proud of her fantastic, witty, and clever beauty posts! Ahhh…the future of beauty blogging lays in the hands of the young (the Muse is feeling old today lol) ? Dita Von Teese for Frederick’s of Hollywood By Isabella Muse on November 6, 2007 6 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Holiday Collections 2007 I admit that I have a girl crush on Dita Von Teese. I can’t help myself! She’s gorgeous and perfect and I wish I was lucky enough to have won the same genetic lottery this girl did! Dita is modeling the Frederick’s of Hollywood Holiday lineup and I’m having quite fun looking through the images on the site and being all star struck by the pretty pictures! I’m a huge fan and collector of pin-up art and I’m loving some of the images they have on the site! Do have a visit and see for yourself what all my excitement is about! And after that why not visit with Christine at Temptalia and read her interview (and listen to her podcast ) with thee gorgeous Dita Von Teese, herself! Lucky Christine!

Ready To Wear Couture Finish Powder and Bronzer By Isabella Muse on November 6, 2007 1 Comment in Online Shopping I came across this interesting powder and bronzer while browsing around HSN. For some reason or another the shape of the compact and the large brush really appeal to me! I wish a posher cosmetic company put out something similar because I’m not sure how much I trust a HSN house brand but I’d say the general concept sounds interest and the price isn’t too crazy that you’ll kick yourself if it sucks after trying it out! Hmmm…. Ready To Wear Couture Finish Powder as seen on HSN Ready To Wear Couture Finish Bronzer as seen on HSN Vincent Longo Diamante Quad By Isabella Muse on November 6, 2007 2 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , Vincent Longo , Winter Collections 2007 , Wish List Lookiee what the Muse found! A quad of Vincent Longo’s Wet Diamond Eyeshadow! Are you excited? I’m excited. I have a few of these shadows in the full size and I adore them and now two different quads are available with four colors each! Yay! The shadows are normally $24 each and this palette is $40 ($32 with your Friends and Family Discount this week!) that my dears is a deal and a half! These shadows are super glittery, super shimmery, big time pigmented, and practically perfect in every way (much like the Muse and Mary Poppins). The quads come in two color combos which are Cassini and Roja! I’m curious if these are shades I already own because if not I’m all over these and most definitely snatching up some during the discount! Want ’em? Love ’em? Tell the Muse! Majorca Majolica’s Holiday Collection By Isabella Muse on November 6, 2007 2 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , Majolica Majorca MJ’s website has been updated with the Holiday collection but no cool story *sniff*(not that the Muse can read the story but she likes the pretty flash that goes along with it!) to go with it…hmmm maybe they’ll update upon release! Cross your fingers! Anyway the goodies are up with pictures! If you want to see close up shots click here . Everything looks great but I’d have liked some more then a Majolook palette. It’s very pretty but something special for the holidays would have been nicer! The Muse wants it all with a few backups ?

"[""Bare Escentuals Pure Platinum Collection Review By Isabella Muse on November 8, 2007 6 Comments in Bare Escentuals I purchased the Bare Escentuals Pure Platinum Collection from Nordstrom.com this past week and it arrived in the mail yesterday! Yay! It’s quite an interesting little kit and I’m very eager to get my hands on the Classic Rock Collection as well now. You might recall I did a comparison of the two in a previous post thanks to a dear friend and reader, Betsy, who had purchased both sets! You can click here to see the post. I’ll give you a break down of what we have in this set and the price and cost per item. The kit is $59USD with tax it’ll run you about $64 give or take a few cents. You get a total of 9 items (10 if you’re counting the double ended mascara as a dual product). Broken down that would mean you are paying about $7 per an item ($6.40 if you count the dual end as two products) which isn’t such a bad price. The good news is that all the items in the kit are highly usable so you aren’t left with some items you love, a few you like, and a few you’ll never use. All the items are good, high quality items that are well worth the $7 bucks a piece you’ll be shelling out for ’em! The kit includes all of the following: Platinum Gossmaer Face & Body Color Platinum Glimmer Twlight Eyeshadow Posh Blush Ripe Fig Natural Lip Color Dual Ended Classic Black Mascara and Platinum Beautifully Luminous Lashes Full Flawless Face Brush Full Tapered Shadow Brush Crease Defending Brush The three brushes alone, purchased separately, would run about $50. So I guess you can say you’ll be buying the brushes and getting a buncha of free stuff with those! Pictured from Top to Bottom: Tapered Shadow Brush, Flawless Face Brush, and Crease Brush Bare Escentuals make pretty ok brushes but some do shed however the ones included with this kit did not shed thankfully. The Flawless Face Brush is a nice brush for buffing on color. It’s very soft and as I said thankfully no problems with shedding. The shadow brush was equally as good for spreading shadow on without a hiccup however the crease brush was a bit stiff to me. Usable but very stiff bristles. Overall, I’d say the brushes included with the kit are pretty good and the Flawless Face Brush is the best of the three in quality. Ripe Fig Natural Lip Color The lipstick included in the kit is very good as well however the color isn’t totally me. It’s a muddy nude rose shade that does nothing for my complexion however it can easily be redeemed by slicking on some tinted lipgloss in a softer pink. I found it tones down the color and makes it wearable after mixing with gloss! It’s most definately moisturizing and applies flawlessly with one coat it’s just the color that is somewhat turning me off but the actually quality of the lipstick is good. Dual Ended Classic Black Mascara and Platinum Beautifully Luminous Lashes The Dual Ended Mascara is an ok product as it does what it’s supposed to in lengthening your lashes. However, I am a mascara snob so this isn’t a product I’m exactly hyped over. It’s good quality but does nothing impressive to my lashes that makes me get up and shout in excitement. The product is dual ended and has a Beautifully Luminous Lashes on the other side. I have a love/hate relationship with Beautifully Luminous Lashes as it doesn’t quite accomplishment what I’d like it to do and I’ve found better Japanese brands that do what this product promises. If you’ve never heard of the product let me explain. It’s basically a colored overcoat that you use after your mascara to give your lashes a touch of sparkle and shine. I do love the look it creates by using this but it takes a bit of work to get it on correctly and I believe that’s due to the brush applicator. I think this would work wonderfully if it was brushless but none the less a nice product all the same. Posh Blush Posh Blush isn’t all that I wanted it to be sadly. It’s a bit of a muddy rose color and similar in style to the Ripe Fig lip color. It’s almost a perfect match actually for the lip color! If you like warmer colors this would be a perfect blush but I’m more for bolder shades that light up my face this I guess gives me more of a sophisticated look that isn’t entirely suited to my face. Twlight Eyeshadow Twlight Eyeshadow is nice and pigmented and contains just the right amount of sparkle! I really like this color and it goes well with the rest of the items within the set. Platinum Glimmer Platinum Glimmer is quite gorgeous. Shimmery, Sparkley and pigmented! This too goes well with everything within the kit! It contrasts wonderfully with Twlight! Platinum Gossmaer Face & Body Color My favorite piece in the collection is the Gossamer! It’s full of sparkle and it looks positively perfect as a highbrow highlighter, within the crease, on the lid, on your cheeks, or dusted on your cleavage! I love multitasking makeup ? And the flawless face brush applies it perfectly!!!! I tried the kit this morning and wasn’t impressed with the results as I attempted using only items I got with it (plus my own foundation of course) and I wasn’t so thrilled so I think basically if you use it in conjunction with items you already have you can make a stunning face! It’s quite a nice kit and really when you break it down the price is very good. I do sometimes over analyze items so don’t mind me ? I’d say it was most definately something nice to pick up for yourself or a friend this Holiday season! And, of course, I’m still wanting the Classic Rock Kit as well! MAC Pro Blushes By Isabella Muse on November 7, 2007 9 Comments in Beauty Babblings , MAC Ah do insert a happy sigh right here my pretties! Your Muse has just popped back from the MAC Pro shop and she got two fabulous blushes that she’s in lust with at the moment! Around July or maybe June MAC Pro had introduced a few blushes and eyeshadows (Visit with Christine and you can see swatches of all the shadows and blushes that were released!) that were exclusive to Pro shops only. It’s been a while since I dragged myself into a MAC Pro store so I decided to hop in today as I needed a bit of cheering up! My little eyes did indeed spy two gorgeous shades of blush that were introduced in the line I was just talking about above and those are Full Fuchsia and Salsarose. I’m positive if I showed these two colors to a professional makeup artist they’d yell and scream at me for purchasing such loud, bright, vibrant colors for my complexion but bloody hell I’m so used to breaking every cosmetic law in the book that I firgure I might as well go on and not stop now! Both colors are utterly illegal and it’s possible I could be arrested for purchasing these vibrant shades but like I said I’m just not caring! I love these! Full Fuchsia is just what you’d expect from a fuchsia colored blush! Holy cow it might very well glow in the dark if I switch the lights off my dears! It’s quite full on! When I wear it I look like I’m stepped in from a really cold winter’s night and I just adore that look as it makes me appear younger than I am hehe…! Full Fuchsia The shade is truly fabulous and I’m absolutely ecstatic to use it with some vibrant shade of fushica eyeshadow (Hey why stop at blush! I want the ENTIRE look!). I’m not entirely sure how many people (or myself for that matter) can pull this color off but I’m positive you’ll (and I) will have tons of fun trying to find just the right look using it! Now Salsarose is much more subdued than Full Fuchsia (not by much). Salsarose is a coral red color that again gives me the just out of the cold (or pinched) look! It’s just as vibrant and gorgeous as Full Fuchsia and I’m really looking forward to using it in a full makeup look! Salsarose Overall, I’m so saddened I hadn’t picked these up when they were originally released because truly they are gems! Several other colors I wanted were out of stock and are equally in your face vibrant and yum! If you live near a Pro shop do stop in to peek at these! If not you can always dial any Pro shop in the US and they’ll promptly deliver these or anything else your little heart desires for $7 UPS shipping fee! Your Muse(y) approves of full on blush colors and highly suggests having a peek at these to see if they are just right for you ? Benefit Dandelion Review By Isabella Muse on November 7, 2007 15 Comments in Benefit I know, I know, I don’t give enough love to Benefit do I? Honestly, I do like Benefit regardless of past entries ! It’s just sometimes they have really miss products that make me want to throw myself on the floor and have a bit of a tantrum (well maybe nothing that drastic!). Some items I’ve purchased from Benefit are absolute gems and one such item would be Dandelion. You need this. No questions. You need it. Dandelion has to be thee perfect powder I have come across in this life (and maybe the next). As many misses as Benefit has in my book there always comes along one particular product that they create that I just fall in love with and need with me should I be stranded on a deserted island (Hmmm well maybe I’d need a hot guy too! We can discuss that later though!). Dandelion, of course, is one of those products that I adore. It’s so difficult to explain this fine powder but I shall do my very best. I can only speak for my own skin tone but this powder weirdly enough, contrary to it’s sheer, rather colorless state within the box, is quite pigmented and actually gives my cheeks a stroke of color that is so very natural and flawless! Like I said the powder, strangely enough, is a very sheer pink (with almost a touch of peach). It comes in a cute little box with a strong sturdy brush with slightly harsh hairs (but I still love the brush). You’d never think looking at it that it would pack such a powerful punch. You can use it in one of a few ways. You can stroke it across your face as a finishing powder, you can use it for touch ups, you can use it alone for a pretty flushed look, and you can use it over your blush to tone it done some! I’m positive it has any number of uses and those are just a few ways I’ve used it for! You simply can’t go wrong with this nifty little powder! FINALLY a HIT from Benefit! The Muse loves you for giving her Dandelion ? Have it? Love it? Hate it? Want it? Tell me all about it! (Just a note you can comment without an account as I received a few e-mails from lovely readers saying they weren’t able to comment!) T’estimo Pure Layer Loose Powder Blush Review By Isabella Muse on November 7, 2007 Leave a Comment in T'estimo T’estimo has a similar style of blush out as Jill Stuart (actually quite a few Japanese brands do similar loose blushes). T’estimo Pure Layer Loose Powder Blush The difference of course in the two would be price and quality. Sadly, as much as I love T’estimo the blush is lacking something for me! The packaging is an adorable domed container with a soft brush that will look quite lovely on your vanity displayed with your other cosmetic items however the blush inside leaves a bit to be desired! I have these in two flavors WT-04 and P-K20. I’ll get to the WT-04 in a minute but first let me explain PK-20. PK-20 appears to me the darker of the two pink shades that are offered from T’estimo. Sadly, the blush is very sheer and even after building up color with a few strokes it still fails to wow me. The texture is quite the same as the Jill Stuart blushes I own which is an almost sheer, chalky feel but unlike the Jill Stuart this is not so pigmented. PK-20 It’s so strange that a company that makes such amazing, pigmented eyeshadows makes such a weak blush! I think it’s safe to say that if you are fairer of a skin you might very well be able to pull PK-20 off but for me I’m sadly left desiring something more when it comes to this blush! The good news is the WT-04 is gorgeous and it’s just about near perfect for the upcoming Holiday season! WT-04 is a sheer shimmering shade of white that I use for a touch of sparkle and to contour around my cheeks and face! It’s delightfully simple in it’s shimmer and it’s not at all over done! I’m not sure why the fit it in with the blush but for me it’s a multitasking tool! I use it on my face as well as my eyes and across my cleavage for some barely there shine! Truly I heart WT-04 and if you’re considering purchasing any of these I’d most definately pick this little guy up! WT-04 T’estimo Pure Layer Blush is available in four shades total which are the two I’ve already mentioned and two others that are OR-21 which is an orange/peach shade and PK-21 which is the newest and a softer shade of pink than PK-20. The blushes are available for purchase from JPMon and Adam Beauty for about $23usd per a blush. Now might be a good time to grab yourself some of these since T’estimo is slowly being fazed out and being replaced with a new brand! The Muse approves of at least one color in this line but the rest she says skip ’em and buy something else! Lanc?me Ombre-Eclair Eyeshadow Pencil By Isabella Muse on November 7, 2007 Leave a Comment in Holiday Collections 2007 , Lancome , Winter Collections 2007 The Muse’s mates from Kiss and Makeup featured these fine pencils about two weeks ago and I must say they sound intriguing to say the least! The pencils are available in Silver, Emerald, and Sweet Quartz and every single one is on my wish list! It’s all a matter of deciding whether I should wait for these to make a guest appearance at my local Cosmetics Company Store or getting them now at full price! Choices, Choices!""]",6d0684c19f4f4f8db31a0974aa6a29431e95157a,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4239,

"['GoSMILE 5 Senses Toothpaste Kit By Isabella Muse on November 12, 2007 10 Comments in Beauty Babblings I’m really anal about brushing my teeth. I mean super anal. I mean so anal that I am doing it three or four times a day. I think when I was young my mum had somehow instilled in me the virtues of clean, sparkling teeth and it’s stuck with me every since. Thanks mum! In all seriousness I do have a thing for brushing my teeth quite a bit and the irony of it is I hate actually smiling with my teeth! I normally keep my mouth close lipped whenever I smile! But that doesn’t prevent me from wanting a Hollywood sparkling white smile that might have Colgate knocking on my door asking might I appear in their next TV commercial…. Sorry…I lost track of the conversation for a second there. Onward…. Your teeth. Allow the Muse to introduce you to a very cute set of toothpastes for quite a cute little price! $20 bucks ($25 if you nab it after the Friends and Family Discount! Wow I should get paid for pimping Sephora so much lately!) gets you 5 mini tubes of GoSMILE toothpaste and a cute little travel toothbrush! GoSMILE 5 Senses Toothpaste Kit as seen on Sephora I have this set, my sister stuck in my stocking last year as a bit of a joke (see even my family knows how anal I am about brushing my teeth!) and I must say it’s a darn cute set and makes a great gift for people like me in your life ? The set includes toothpastes in Mango Paradise Smile, Aloha Tropical Smile, Lemonade Smile, Ginger Cookie Smile, and Peppermint Candy Smile! The Muse got one for her dentist last year and her dentist was quite tickled over it to say the least! The moral of the story is that you don’t have to always have minty fresh breath! Why not have Ginger Cookie scented breath or Lemonade scented breath!!!!!!! I like a little variety and the little things really get me happy thus this kit most definately gets a smile (a sparkling one) from your Muse! The Muse’s Lush Christmas List By Isabella Muse on November 12, 2007 17 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , Lush , Shower & Bath Each and every year Lush always tempts me with a wonderful array of yummie goodies for my bathing pleasure! This year, like any other year, is no different. I’m eager to start making my Lush list and checking it twice! I always end up purchasing a ton of Lush for myself and tons for friends and family members! Lush always has a year end promotion with free goodies and such but I just can’t wait for that! I need my Lush RIGHT AWAY! Here’s my Lush Wish List: Christmas would simply not be Christmas if your Muse can’t have a nice big block of Snowcake under her tree! Snowcake Soap Creamy, moisturizing, marzipan goodness! My love affair with Snowcake is known far and wide and I end up with quite a bit stashed into gifts from friends and of course, purchased for myself! This year the kind people at Lush UK have even offered up a yummie Snowcake Shower Gel to keep the Muse happy so I’ll be singing “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year” in my shower for the next several months with both my stash of soap and shower gel! Head into your local Lush for a nice big chunk to hold you out till next year because sadly, my dear friends, when it’s gone, it’s gone and won’t make it’s reappearance until next year! Now since we are on the most lovely topic of Snowcake might the Muse mention that she has added Lush Pud Bath Bomb to her wish list! If you happen to be new to Lush or this is your first Christmas with Lush than you probably don’t know that Lush Pud is scented with our most beloved scent of Snowcake! Mmmm! Lush Pud This year we have two flavors of Pud to choose from. It’s regular Bath Bomb size and a Jumbo Bath Bomb which includes two Holiday soaps, Snowcake and Bob! Jumbo Lush Pud Bath Bomb Gift Set Lush never fails to come out with something jumbo in all the years I’ve been purchasing it. Last year they had a most wonderful large size Santa’s Hat bomb that was scented in the delightful Honey I Washed the Kids (It was so big I still have left over pieces from last year!) and the year before on Valentine’s Day they offered a heart shaped bomb that was scented in Creamy Candy Bath! Mmmm! The moral of the story is that this is a great deal because you can get quite a few baths out of this LARGE bomb! I normally place mine in a large ziploc bag and drop the bag onto the floor once or twice and it’ll split into pieces big enough to plop in your bath! Of course, the Muse has seen a few people that are daring enough to just throw the entire thing into the tub and have a most expensive bath! Something that always, always, have I said always? Always ends up in my cart come Christmas would be Snow Fairy. The best way to describe Snow Fairy is to call it crack in a bottle. Indeed, it’s that addicting. I get at least 5 large bottles (At one time it was 10) each year to keep me happy and sweetly scented until it’s reappearance next Christmas! Again, like Snowcake, when it’s gone, it’s gone and may or may not be back next year so the stashing and hoarding it away is a normal routine for your Muse! Snow Fairy is a most difficult scent to describe but I shall do my best. It’s a fruity, cherryish, vanillish, with an underlay of the most gorgeous candy! It’s exactly what all girly girl’s need in their shower! I even wash my hair with it when I’m feeling quite frisky and daring! Oh my I imagine I’m breaking some sort of hair law by washing my locks with a shower gel but one whiff of Snow Fairy and I imagine I can convince even the snottiest stylish this is a must! Snow Fairy Shockingly enough Lush US is actually offering Cocktail Soap! Cocktail is a scent exclusive to Lush’s sister store Bnever and has never been available outside of the UK. Bnever shops are exclusive to the UK (although rumors abound that they may be headed to the US soon). Now, Cocktail is quite a favorite scent of mine and difficult to explain. It reminds me of glamorous Old Hollywood! It’s quite floral and with so many notes that the actual blend is too complicated to pick apart. The good news is that if you adore sophiscated floral blends this would be the soap for you! The Muse normally picks up Cocktail soap from Bnever when she travels into London or she gets it packaged into her UK orders from Lush however she’s happy, very happy, to say that Lush US is offering Cocktail Soap for your pleasure this Holiday season! Could this be an omen of things to come? Your Muse hopes so! Cocktail Soap Last year, the Muse’s beloved Bubble Bar was renamed and called “Holiday” bubble bar. The Muse is on strike and she REFUSES to call it that! It’s original name, and the name the Muse sticks to, is Ruby Red Slippers. Why the name change the Muse hasn’t a clue but the good news is that Ruby Red Slippers (aka Holiday) is back in stock and ready for my purchasing pleasure! Ruby Red Slippers are glittery red and sexy as sin! The scent is a warm, spicy smell of carnations with a touch of vanilla and 100% perfection! I stock up on as many of these as I possibly can to get me through the long, cold winter! The luxury of slipping into a tub full of red sparkly water with tons of bubbles and a warm, spicy scent is something the Muse adores spoiling herself with! So Ruby Red Slippers (aka Holiday) always make an appearance on my wish list! Ruby Red Slippers aka Holiday Bubble Bar Slice The sparkling, effervescent scent of Champagne Snow Showers is a favorite of mine but sadly the jelly just makes me cry in agony. Lush Jellies aren’t the most easiest thing in the world to use! Thankfully I don’t have to miss out on this gorgeous blend of sparkling citrus! I just load my cart with Christmas Party Bath Bombs and I have the same scent as Champange Snow Showers in my bath! Some girls hate her because she contains a ton of glitter and bits and pieces to SURPRISE you in your bath! I personally love her and she’s right properly deemed a Christmas Party as once she hits the water she fizzes, spins, and whirls around my tub showering it with tiny stars, sparkles, and other fun bits and pieces (if you really can’t stand the though of these bits in your tub the Muse suggests placing her in a knee high before lowering her into the tub and all the bits will be trapped within the knee high and not your tub!) Christmas Party Bath Bomb Butterball is quite a favorite bomb of mine but I’ll tell you a secret shhhhhh….I really like when he converts himself to MR BUTTERBALL for the Holiday season! I’m not sure why he becomes so proper during the Holiday season but I do enjoy the look of him during Christmas! He turns from an ordinary little Butterball into a cute, chubby Snowman during the Holidays and the Muse delights in what a wonderful little extra gift he makes for friends or family! He doesn’t last in this cute size for long so if you love him get a few before he disappears and makes his reappearance as plain old Butterball! That’s Mr Butterball to YOU! If you happen to love Snow Fairy as much as this girl does then you might just want to get your hands on a few Candy Cane bubble bar slices. The name is quite deceiving so don’t go around thinking that this might smell of mint because that it does not. Candy Cane bubble bar slice is another product, like our Butterball, that transforms itself from Creamy Candy Bar to Candy Cane come the Holidays! It smells much the same as Snow Fairy with a bit more vanilla and less fruity but it’s all quite candy and creamy to me! And fear not it won’t disappear when Christmas is over! It’ll just go back to being Creamy Candy Bubble Bar instead and available for your purchasing pleasure year round! Candy Cane Bubble Bar Finally my list would not be complete without including some Christmas Angels into my shopping cart! These fine bombs are scented in a minty chocolate combo that will have you feeling quite the refined lady whilst soaking away in your tub! Christmas Angel is quite ready and available for your shopping needs after Christmas so don’t go to crazy in ordering tons of these guys! As cute as they are you can get your share after Christmas by simply buying it without it’s Holiday clothes in simple Haagen Bath form! Christmas Angel Bath Bomb I do believe that pretty much wraps up what I want from Lush this year! How about you? New to Lush? Love Lush? What are you getting for yourself or friends and family?

Bourjois Paris Eau De Gloss Review By Isabella Muse on November 9, 2007 10 Comments in Bourjois Paris Imagine a gloss that felt like a refreshing sip of water on your lips. Now imagine it coming in an array of fabulous shades. What if I told you there was such a product available? Well look no further ? Bourjois Paris’s Eau De Gloss contains 14% water content and is a slick, glossy, moisturizing treat for the lips! I have two of these glosses and I adore them! I’m a big lover of lipgloss but I really hate how many brands leave my lips feeling tacky and sticky which is one reason Eau De Gloss gets the Muse’s approval for a great gloss! The gloss has a rather short bristle brush for applying so one application is never enough and I find I have to re-dip two or three times but aside from that minor flaw the gloss itself is a great formula as it does exactly what it advertises. It leaves my lips feeling refreshed and glossy minus the tack and stick of other glosses I use. It lasts quite a while with about a 3 hour time span before retouching up! I have this in Eau fraiche which is a clear color that’s perfect after I stain my lips or apply some lipstick. Slick some on and my lipstick or stain becomes gloriously glossy and shiny! I also have this in Framboise Glacee which is pigmented enough to wear with or without your favorite lipstick or lipstain beneath! Each gloss is $15USD which isn’t too bad as you get quite a large bit of product! Overall, these are a staple in my beauty arsenal and I definately love ’em! I wish more glosses used the same formula as I wouldn’t mind the slick without the sticky!

"['Duwop Pretty Mystic Limited Edition Palette By Isabella Muse on November 14, 2007 3 Comments in DuWop Your Muse spends alot of time searching around for new and exciting make-up bits for you and she’s found something quite sweet this time! The Duwop Pretty Mystic Palette as seen on Beauty.com : This cute palette includes three eyeshadows, three lipcreams, a luminizer, and a blush! DuWop makes some pretty high quality items and this little palette looks darling! I’m particularly loving the shades of eyeshadow in this compact! The palette is only available from Beauty.com and exclusive to them! It’s $32 a bit steep but still quite a nice array of goodies for the price! I sure do wish it was around when the 20% Friends and Family Discount at Beauty.com was going on! Want it? Bare Minerals bareGold Pure Luxury Color Collection First Impression By Isabella Muse on November 13, 2007 2 Comments in Bare Escentuals , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 Today I received my Bare Minerals bareGold Luxury Color Collection in the mail and I must say I’m pretty impressed! You can view my previous blog about this collection by clicking here . The collection wow’ed me a bit more than the Bare Esentuals Pure Platinum Collection (Bare Minerals is the same company as Bare Esentuals if you were wondering). You can see my impression of the Pure Platinum Collection by clicking here. For starters the collection comes in a far better box than the Platinum Collection. The box is highly reusable and perfect just to keep the entire collection together. Plus it has an awesome flip up mirror which is ideal for application. Don’t get me wrong the Platinum Collection had quite a nice box as well but this is just quite a deal better! In my opinion the bareGold Collection is much more wearable for the Autumn than it will be for the winter and holiday season as the colors lean more towards browns and golds while the Pure Platinum Collection contains cooler colors that are better suited for the colder weather and the upcoming holiday season! Like the Pure Platinum Collection the bareGold Collection comes with three brushes however the similarities end with the Full Flawless Face Brush. The other two brushes are completely different. Where as the Pure Platinum Collection comes with a crease brush and a shadow brush the bareGold Collection comes with a liner blending brush and an eye shaping brush! I’m somewhat thankful that these came with different brushes as having duplicates is somewhat pointless! The brushes are pretty ok quality so far that I see and no shedding as of yet! The liner blending brush is a bit pointless and I’d have prefered some sort of eyeshadow brush but I’ll find a use for it I’m sure. My favorite in the lot of three brushes would be the eye shaping brush. It’s pretty soft and it has a nice curve to it so I can fit it precisely into the crease of my eye quite nicely. It’ll serve well as a multitasking brush for my lid and crease area. From Bottom to Top: Flawless Face Brush, Eye Shaping Brush and Heavenly Liner Blending Brush The collection comes with a Mineral Veil in full size which was was missing from both the Classic Rock and Pure Platinum Collections. Mineral Veil is actually one product I do approve of in the BE line of foundations products so getting a full size Veil with this set is such a nice extra! My favorite item in the set is most definately the Gold Gossamer powder. It’s shimmery and gorgeous and just perfect to use just about anywhere you want a bit of gold sparkle! Eyes, Face, Body, wherever you desire a bit of glittery gold you can apply this lovely Gossamer! This is a tiny bit more wearable than the Platinum Gossamer powder because it’s such a universal color that’ll work well with most all skin types! Gold Gossamer The glimmer this set comes with is called Golden Earth and is quite a gorgeous brown shade with golden sparkle! Upon viewing some of these colors you’ll see why I believe they are better suited for the Autumn than the Winter! Golden Earth Glimmer Gilded Taupe glimpse is is a beige color with specks of gold and quite lovely. I’ve noticed that the gold infused in all these colors is much more prominent than the crushed diamond in the Platinum Collection! Gilded Taupe Last but most definately not least in the shadow department is the Gold Mine Liner Shadow. This can be used a liner or an eyeshadow and it’s my favorite of the several eye products in this collection! It’s a deep mineral brown color with tons of gold! I’m so loving this and I’m envisioning several looks I can do with it! Gold Miner Liner Shadow The blush in this set I find much more flattering than Posh Blush which was included with the Platinum Collection! This blush is called Riches and it’s a shimmering rosy peach with quite a nice dose of gold! Riches Blush Finally another win for me is the lipcolor in this collection! The Platinum Collection included a muddy rose color that I’m not entirely in love with where as this collection included a brownish peach color with a bit of gold! I’m most definately favoring this set over the Pure Platinum Collection plus it was cheaper!!!! The only thing missing from this set was a mascara and beautifully luminous lashes duo but the good news is I already have gold beautifully luminous lashes so I’m covered ? As with most BE collection and eye sets this comes with great instructions for application! Anything that makes makeup easy is always a plus for me! It’s so nice to open a package and have some really helpful hints, tips, and general step by steps for applying what where and how! Sometimes colors can stump us all and it’s difficult to firgure out just where something should be on our eye area and BE always seems to simplify that stressful part of application! This set would make an amazing gift and like I said the price is just too sweet to pass up! I’m eager to get my Classic Rock Collection now and see how it is and make my final decision about which could be my favorite! Do see my original post about this collection to nab it for yourself at a very nice price! Click! Want it? Love it? Hate it? Tell your Muse! Lavshuca Winter Make Palettes 2007 By Isabella Muse on November 13, 2007 10 Comments in First Impressions , Holiday Collections 2007 , Lavshuca , Winter Collections 2007 Yay! I got my Lavshuca Holiday Palettes today! These actually arrived I think Friday or Saturday but I was unable to collect them until today from the post office ? They are now in my greedy, sweaty little hands and I couldn’t be more pleased! Lavshuca Winter Make Palette in 01 Lavshuca Winter Make Palette in 02 The palettes came in the cutest little gift box and if you happen to have a Japanese cosmetic lover in your life these would be the perfect gift! They come packaged in separate parts. One part is the empty compact and the second part is your lipgloss, eyeshadow, and applicators. I assume that they package the parts separately for beautiful display reasons, it also keeps things nice and tidy during shipping, and finally it’s just good, old plain fun to put it all together into the compact yourself! The compact isn’t a hard shell it’s a durable cardboard which may sound worrying because you might be thinking this means it’s on the cheap and shoddy side. Fear not! The cardboard is quite sturdy and not cheap in the least. It’s covered in either a pink or gold foiling depending which color you end up purchasing with the lovely Lavshuca emblem on top. Inside there are two separate spots for the sponge eyeshadow applicator and lipbrush on either side with the eyeshadow and gloss smack in the middle. The Lavshuca emblem again graces the inside top of the palette. I haven’t yet tried any of the colors but from what I can see the strip of eyeshadows are quite shimmery and gorgeous and I’m hoping it isn’t a spray of glitter but a sparkle straight to the core. You’ll also receive a sparkling lipgloss and a matte lipcream. The size of the shadow strip is a tiny bit disappointing because it’s really NOT a whole lot of product but if you generally collect tons of palettes and shadows you won’t mind too much because chances are you won’t go through this very quickly! However, if you don’t own a ton of different shadows and you’ll be using this daily chances are you’ll get through it very quickly as it’s not a whole lot of product! I have to say that at the moment I find them both very pretty but I do favor the 02 palette better than the 01. 02 eyeshadows consist of a white shimmering gold color, a shimmering yellow gold, and a shimmering brown with gold specks. The gloss is a sparkling golden brown color while the lipcream is a orange brown. Layering the gloss and lipcream will surely make a striking combo! 01 is just as pretty and consists of a shimmering white with, it appears, to me, pink, a shimmering pink shade, and a darker purple. The gloss is a sparkling pinkish purple affair while the lipcream is rosebud pink. Overall, I’d say they are most definately worth a pick up! The Lavshuca Winter Make Palettes are Muse Approved for purchase! Do visit PJ to see A Touch of Blusher’s impression on these palettes you can also visit with RF at Make Up & Stuff and see some more about the Lavshuca’s Holiday Palettes! Love ’em? Have ’em? Tell me! MAC Stylistics By Isabella Muse on November 13, 2007 3 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , MAC , Winter Collections 2007 MAC’s newest color story, Stylistics, is releasing November 29th. Stylistics is similar to last year’s Couture collection in quality, design, and price. My Stylistics Invitation The collection is a much more posh and upscale collection in comparison to what MAC normally releases and consists of several gorgeous compacts, lipshades, brushes, and quite a few other goodies! I have to say that this collection is a bit more appealing to me than last year’s Couture collection in design. Couture was elegant and classy but Stylistics’s compact design is quite beautiful to my eye. You can see some of my Couture collection by clicking here . The good news is it’s pretty affordable however the bad news is that this isn’t something you can tote around in your purse for touch ups. It’s a “made for vanity” in my opinion and that’s awesome for display purposes but pretty impractical for tucking into your purse. However, if you’re super careful I’m sure you’ll do just fine in carrying it along with you on special nights! Won’t you be the envy of every lady in the powder room when you’re touching up with a gorgeous pearl encrusted compact! Yum! Personally I think the prices are outstandingly good for high quality makeup plus the glam of a gorgeous design on the packaging! I got my invitation to reserve the collection today and I’ll share the link with you! Click here to reserve any or all of this beautiful collection! The collection consists of the following: Lipsticks $22USD Each In Vogue Soft Pout Stylistic The Scene Lipglass $20USD Each Conversational Witty Tastemaker Hyper Chic Sheersparkle Pressed Powder Compacts $22USD Each Solitaire Warm Ice Pave Fashionette Sheer Mystery Powder $45USD Each (Comes with Refill) Model Chic Lighthearted Dark Secret Air of Style Perfume $60USD Stylistic Clutch $75USD 129 Special Edition Powder Brush $42USD 224 Special Edition Eyeshadow Brush $32USD 316 Special Edition Lip Brush $22USD For me a majority of the collection is appealing but some of the prices on the brushes, clutch, and perfume are a bit much! However, the cosmetic side has some pretty nice prices and not bad overall! I’m happy to see the Sheer Mystery Powder is back as I didn’t get last year’s version during Couture’s run! I’m also highly interested in the Sparkle Powders and I’m hoping they aren’t cream like last year’s highlighters! All in all I’d say there are some definite hits for me in this collection!

"['Pieces of Life: The K-Drama Edition By Isabella Muse on February 3, 2009 2 Comments in Babblings , K-Dramas/T-Dramas , Pieces of Life Hey guys! I’m on my latest K-Drama kick so I thought I’d do a “Pieces of Life” Edition about it as I’m wondering what everyone is watching at the moment. I’m currently trying to get through I Really, Really Like You but for some reason it’s slow going so far…hmmmmm…must be me being tired perhaps! Jump ahead to read more! I’m positive that I’m not only tired but the bloody subtitles are moving so fast that I can’t take a breath to actually watch anything hehe! But so far it’s a bit on the meh side. I waited ages to purchase it via YesAsia but they only ever had the Part 1 Box Set in stock (finally Box Set 2 is out) and I just couldn’t wait any longer so I had it CP’ed from Malaysia. Impatient is the Muse but hey it actually worked out way cheaper but only prob is the damn subtitles! There really hasn’t been much in the way of releases that I’ve really wanted to see aside from Iljimae . Lurve me some Lee Jun Ki, WANT! I just recently finished re-watching Sweet 18. I dunno what happened but one day I was listening to the soundtrack and suddenly the urge to re-watch it was upon me, glad I did it’s such a fab drama! Anyway!

"['The Muse’s Lush Christmas List By Isabella Muse on November 12, 2007 17 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , Lush , Shower & Bath Each and every year Lush always tempts me with a wonderful array of yummie goodies for my bathing pleasure! This year, like any other year, is no different. I’m eager to start making my Lush list and checking it twice! I always end up purchasing a ton of Lush for myself and tons for friends and family members! Lush always has a year end promotion with free goodies and such but I just can’t wait for that! I need my Lush RIGHT AWAY! Here’s my Lush Wish List: Christmas would simply not be Christmas if your Muse can’t have a nice big block of Snowcake under her tree! Snowcake Soap Creamy, moisturizing, marzipan goodness! My love affair with Snowcake is known far and wide and I end up with quite a bit stashed into gifts from friends and of course, purchased for myself! This year the kind people at Lush UK have even offered up a yummie Snowcake Shower Gel to keep the Muse happy so I’ll be singing “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year” in my shower for the next several months with both my stash of soap and shower gel! Head into your local Lush for a nice big chunk to hold you out till next year because sadly, my dear friends, when it’s gone, it’s gone and won’t make it’s reappearance until next year! Now since we are on the most lovely topic of Snowcake might the Muse mention that she has added Lush Pud Bath Bomb to her wish list! If you happen to be new to Lush or this is your first Christmas with Lush than you probably don’t know that Lush Pud is scented with our most beloved scent of Snowcake! Mmmm! Lush Pud This year we have two flavors of Pud to choose from. It’s regular Bath Bomb size and a Jumbo Bath Bomb which includes two Holiday soaps, Snowcake and Bob! Jumbo Lush Pud Bath Bomb Gift Set Lush never fails to come out with something jumbo in all the years I’ve been purchasing it. Last year they had a most wonderful large size Santa’s Hat bomb that was scented in the delightful Honey I Washed the Kids (It was so big I still have left over pieces from last year!) and the year before on Valentine’s Day they offered a heart shaped bomb that was scented in Creamy Candy Bath! Mmmm! The moral of the story is that this is a great deal because you can get quite a few baths out of this LARGE bomb! I normally place mine in a large ziploc bag and drop the bag onto the floor once or twice and it’ll split into pieces big enough to plop in your bath! Of course, the Muse has seen a few people that are daring enough to just throw the entire thing into the tub and have a most expensive bath! Something that always, always, have I said always? Always ends up in my cart come Christmas would be Snow Fairy. The best way to describe Snow Fairy is to call it crack in a bottle. Indeed, it’s that addicting. I get at least 5 large bottles (At one time it was 10) each year to keep me happy and sweetly scented until it’s reappearance next Christmas! Again, like Snowcake, when it’s gone, it’s gone and may or may not be back next year so the stashing and hoarding it away is a normal routine for your Muse! Snow Fairy is a most difficult scent to describe but I shall do my best. It’s a fruity, cherryish, vanillish, with an underlay of the most gorgeous candy! It’s exactly what all girly girl’s need in their shower! I even wash my hair with it when I’m feeling quite frisky and daring! Oh my I imagine I’m breaking some sort of hair law by washing my locks with a shower gel but one whiff of Snow Fairy and I imagine I can convince even the snottiest stylish this is a must! Snow Fairy Shockingly enough Lush US is actually offering Cocktail Soap! Cocktail is a scent exclusive to Lush’s sister store Bnever and has never been available outside of the UK. Bnever shops are exclusive to the UK (although rumors abound that they may be headed to the US soon). Now, Cocktail is quite a favorite scent of mine and difficult to explain. It reminds me of glamorous Old Hollywood! It’s quite floral and with so many notes that the actual blend is too complicated to pick apart. The good news is that if you adore sophiscated floral blends this would be the soap for you! The Muse normally picks up Cocktail soap from Bnever when she travels into London or she gets it packaged into her UK orders from Lush however she’s happy, very happy, to say that Lush US is offering Cocktail Soap for your pleasure this Holiday season! Could this be an omen of things to come? Your Muse hopes so! Cocktail Soap Last year, the Muse’s beloved Bubble Bar was renamed and called “Holiday” bubble bar. The Muse is on strike and she REFUSES to call it that! It’s original name, and the name the Muse sticks to, is Ruby Red Slippers. Why the name change the Muse hasn’t a clue but the good news is that Ruby Red Slippers (aka Holiday) is back in stock and ready for my purchasing pleasure! Ruby Red Slippers are glittery red and sexy as sin! The scent is a warm, spicy smell of carnations with a touch of vanilla and 100% perfection! I stock up on as many of these as I possibly can to get me through the long, cold winter! The luxury of slipping into a tub full of red sparkly water with tons of bubbles and a warm, spicy scent is something the Muse adores spoiling herself with! So Ruby Red Slippers (aka Holiday) always make an appearance on my wish list! Ruby Red Slippers aka Holiday Bubble Bar Slice The sparkling, effervescent scent of Champagne Snow Showers is a favorite of mine but sadly the jelly just makes me cry in agony. Lush Jellies aren’t the most easiest thing in the world to use! Thankfully I don’t have to miss out on this gorgeous blend of sparkling citrus! I just load my cart with Christmas Party Bath Bombs and I have the same scent as Champange Snow Showers in my bath! Some girls hate her because she contains a ton of glitter and bits and pieces to SURPRISE you in your bath! I personally love her and she’s right properly deemed a Christmas Party as once she hits the water she fizzes, spins, and whirls around my tub showering it with tiny stars, sparkles, and other fun bits and pieces (if you really can’t stand the though of these bits in your tub the Muse suggests placing her in a knee high before lowering her into the tub and all the bits will be trapped within the knee high and not your tub!) Christmas Party Bath Bomb Butterball is quite a favorite bomb of mine but I’ll tell you a secret shhhhhh….I really like when he converts himself to MR BUTTERBALL for the Holiday season! I’m not sure why he becomes so proper during the Holiday season but I do enjoy the look of him during Christmas! He turns from an ordinary little Butterball into a cute, chubby Snowman during the Holidays and the Muse delights in what a wonderful little extra gift he makes for friends or family! He doesn’t last in this cute size for long so if you love him get a few before he disappears and makes his reappearance as plain old Butterball! That’s Mr Butterball to YOU! If you happen to love Snow Fairy as much as this girl does then you might just want to get your hands on a few Candy Cane bubble bar slices. The name is quite deceiving so don’t go around thinking that this might smell of mint because that it does not. Candy Cane bubble bar slice is another product, like our Butterball, that transforms itself from Creamy Candy Bar to Candy Cane come the Holidays! It smells much the same as Snow Fairy with a bit more vanilla and less fruity but it’s all quite candy and creamy to me! And fear not it won’t disappear when Christmas is over! It’ll just go back to being Creamy Candy Bubble Bar instead and available for your purchasing pleasure year round! Candy Cane Bubble Bar Finally my list would not be complete without including some Christmas Angels into my shopping cart! These fine bombs are scented in a minty chocolate combo that will have you feeling quite the refined lady whilst soaking away in your tub! Christmas Angel is quite ready and available for your shopping needs after Christmas so don’t go to crazy in ordering tons of these guys! As cute as they are you can get your share after Christmas by simply buying it without it’s Holiday clothes in simple Haagen Bath form! Christmas Angel Bath Bomb I do believe that pretty much wraps up what I want from Lush this year! How about you? New to Lush? Love Lush? What are you getting for yourself or friends and family?

"['GoSMILE 5 Senses Toothpaste Kit By Isabella Muse on November 12, 2007 10 Comments in Beauty Babblings I’m really anal about brushing my teeth. I mean super anal. I mean so anal that I am doing it three or four times a day. I think when I was young my mum had somehow instilled in me the virtues of clean, sparkling teeth and it’s stuck with me every since. Thanks mum! In all seriousness I do have a thing for brushing my teeth quite a bit and the irony of it is I hate actually smiling with my teeth! I normally keep my mouth close lipped whenever I smile! But that doesn’t prevent me from wanting a Hollywood sparkling white smile that might have Colgate knocking on my door asking might I appear in their next TV commercial…. Sorry…I lost track of the conversation for a second there. Onward…. Your teeth. Allow the Muse to introduce you to a very cute set of toothpastes for quite a cute little price! $20 bucks ($25 if you nab it after the Friends and Family Discount! Wow I should get paid for pimping Sephora so much lately!) gets you 5 mini tubes of GoSMILE toothpaste and a cute little travel toothbrush! GoSMILE 5 Senses Toothpaste Kit as seen on Sephora I have this set, my sister stuck in my stocking last year as a bit of a joke (see even my family knows how anal I am about brushing my teeth!) and I must say it’s a darn cute set and makes a great gift for people like me in your life ? The set includes toothpastes in Mango Paradise Smile, Aloha Tropical Smile, Lemonade Smile, Ginger Cookie Smile, and Peppermint Candy Smile! The Muse got one for her dentist last year and her dentist was quite tickled over it to say the least! The moral of the story is that you don’t have to always have minty fresh breath! Why not have Ginger Cookie scented breath or Lemonade scented breath!!!!!!! I like a little variety and the little things really get me happy thus this kit most definately gets a smile (a sparkling one) from your Muse! You may also enjoy...

"['Bare Minerals bareGold Pure Luxury Color Collection First Impression By Isabella Muse on November 13, 2007 2 Comments in Bare Escentuals , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 Today I received my Bare Minerals bareGold Luxury Color Collection in the mail and I must say I’m pretty impressed! You can view my previous blog about this collection by clicking here . The collection wow’ed me a bit more than the Bare Esentuals Pure Platinum Collection (Bare Minerals is the same company as Bare Esentuals if you were wondering). You can see my impression of the Pure Platinum Collection by clicking here. For starters the collection comes in a far better box than the Platinum Collection. The box is highly reusable and perfect just to keep the entire collection together. Plus it has an awesome flip up mirror which is ideal for application. Don’t get me wrong the Platinum Collection had quite a nice box as well but this is just quite a deal better! In my opinion the bareGold Collection is much more wearable for the Autumn than it will be for the winter and holiday season as the colors lean more towards browns and golds while the Pure Platinum Collection contains cooler colors that are better suited for the colder weather and the upcoming holiday season! Like the Pure Platinum Collection the bareGold Collection comes with three brushes however the similarities end with the Full Flawless Face Brush. The other two brushes are completely different. Where as the Pure Platinum Collection comes with a crease brush and a shadow brush the bareGold Collection comes with a liner blending brush and an eye shaping brush! I’m somewhat thankful that these came with different brushes as having duplicates is somewhat pointless! The brushes are pretty ok quality so far that I see and no shedding as of yet! The liner blending brush is a bit pointless and I’d have prefered some sort of eyeshadow brush but I’ll find a use for it I’m sure. My favorite in the lot of three brushes would be the eye shaping brush. It’s pretty soft and it has a nice curve to it so I can fit it precisely into the crease of my eye quite nicely. It’ll serve well as a multitasking brush for my lid and crease area. From Bottom to Top: Flawless Face Brush, Eye Shaping Brush and Heavenly Liner Blending Brush The collection comes with a Mineral Veil in full size which was was missing from both the Classic Rock and Pure Platinum Collections. Mineral Veil is actually one product I do approve of in the BE line of foundations products so getting a full size Veil with this set is such a nice extra! My favorite item in the set is most definately the Gold Gossamer powder. It’s shimmery and gorgeous and just perfect to use just about anywhere you want a bit of gold sparkle! Eyes, Face, Body, wherever you desire a bit of glittery gold you can apply this lovely Gossamer! This is a tiny bit more wearable than the Platinum Gossamer powder because it’s such a universal color that’ll work well with most all skin types! Gold Gossamer The glimmer this set comes with is called Golden Earth and is quite a gorgeous brown shade with golden sparkle! Upon viewing some of these colors you’ll see why I believe they are better suited for the Autumn than the Winter! Golden Earth Glimmer Gilded Taupe glimpse is is a beige color with specks of gold and quite lovely. I’ve noticed that the gold infused in all these colors is much more prominent than the crushed diamond in the Platinum Collection! Gilded Taupe Last but most definately not least in the shadow department is the Gold Mine Liner Shadow. This can be used a liner or an eyeshadow and it’s my favorite of the several eye products in this collection! It’s a deep mineral brown color with tons of gold! I’m so loving this and I’m envisioning several looks I can do with it! Gold Miner Liner Shadow The blush in this set I find much more flattering than Posh Blush which was included with the Platinum Collection! This blush is called Riches and it’s a shimmering rosy peach with quite a nice dose of gold! Riches Blush Finally another win for me is the lipcolor in this collection! The Platinum Collection included a muddy rose color that I’m not entirely in love with where as this collection included a brownish peach color with a bit of gold! I’m most definately favoring this set over the Pure Platinum Collection plus it was cheaper!!!! The only thing missing from this set was a mascara and beautifully luminous lashes duo but the good news is I already have gold beautifully luminous lashes so I’m covered ? As with most BE collection and eye sets this comes with great instructions for application! Anything that makes makeup easy is always a plus for me! It’s so nice to open a package and have some really helpful hints, tips, and general step by steps for applying what where and how! Sometimes colors can stump us all and it’s difficult to firgure out just where something should be on our eye area and BE always seems to simplify that stressful part of application! This set would make an amazing gift and like I said the price is just too sweet to pass up! I’m eager to get my Classic Rock Collection now and see how it is and make my final decision about which could be my favorite! Do see my original post about this collection to nab it for yourself at a very nice price! Click! Want it? Love it? Hate it? Tell your Muse! You may also enjoy...

"['Vincent Longo Diamante Quad First Impression By Isabella Muse on November 16, 2007 6 Comments in First Impressions , Vincent Longo Here’s a few more items that I purchased with my Friends and Family order discount ! The Vincent Longo Diamante Quad’s in Roja and Cassini! These are fabulous and I’m well and properly chuffed that I put these in my shopping cart when ordering. These are regularly $40 each but I paid $32 after the discount! I already own a few of the Vincent Longo Wet Diamond Eyeshadows and adore them so having a palette of four shades is thrilling your Muse! If you love shadows that have major fall out these be the palette for you! They contain a huge amount of shimmer, sparkle, glitter, and shine! They also happen to be super pigmented! Add that all together and it equals a must buy for me! The colors in these palettes are all yummie and range from darker for a smoky eye look to lighter for a nice soft look! When creating these I don’t think they had any plans for combining all four shades into one looks but have no fear you can do some pretty gorgeous looks just using two colors or even one! Cassini contains a gorgeous shimmering purple, an elegant sparkling black, a beautiful beige and a softer shimmering pink! Roja contains two beautiful bronze colors (one darker than the other), one darker pink and one lighter pink! I find Roja has the best complimenting shades as you can do nice contrasting eyes using the two bronze/copper shades in the palette or the two pinks! I’d say it’s a great bang of shadow for your buck whether you are paying the original $40 or the discounted price! The Muse most definately approves! Cassini Roja NARS Night Series Palette First Impression By Isabella Muse on November 15, 2007 1 Comment in First Impressions , Holiday Collections 2007 , Nars , Winter Collections 2007 I got my Sephora Friends and Family order a few days ago and inside lay my gorgeous Night Series Palette from NARS! Oh My! This is beyond yummie my friends and well worth the money! I had blogged about this previously and must take back any bad thought I had about it! The palette just looks boring when you view it online! It looks matte and unexciting and just not something that I must have! So really when I originally seen it pop up on Sephora I just passed over it really quickly and chalked it up as rubbish that I didn’t need! However, upon seeing it in store I fell in deep lust and it ended up on my WANT, MUST HAVE NOW list! The palette is $55 regularly but I got it for $44 with the 20% discount. $55 may seem a bit much but if you break it down it’s less than $10 per a shadow which is a pretty good deal! I must say that I prefer paying $44 for it in comparison to it’s original price tag of $55 however I’d pay the regular price if I had to because the palette is most definately a high quality item in my humblest opinion. The palette contains a favorite shadow of mine which is Night Star! I love this shadow! It’s an understated gold sparkle affair that is fantastic as a base or all by itself. The rest of the shadows I don’t have but all of them are gorgeous. One of which I’m deeply in love with is the Night Snow which is a gorgeous shimmering white sparkle that’s going to be absolutely perfect for many great Holiday eye looks! Other shadows included are Night Fever which is a black with tons of red glitter, Night Clubbing which is black with gold glitter, Night Rider which is purple with silver glitter, and Night Fairy which is lilac with gold glitter! I love the two blacks in this palette because the shimmer has totally transformed the colors from being basic black to something completely WOW! Overall, the palette is most definately on my awesome list! I’m completely loving it and it’s Muse approved for sure! Have it? Love it? Want it? Hate it? Tell me! I’m curious what you think! Tiny Holiday Beauty Treasures On A Budget By Isabella Muse on November 15, 2007 4 Comments in Bath on a Budget , Beauty on a Budget Here’s a nice list of Christmas Goodies that won’t break the bank!

These slices of Soap run from about $5-$10 or so and are HUGE!!!!! Plus they look like the real thing (and smell like it)! I just find them ultra cute and I think they’d make such a killer stocking stuffer or little Christmas gift for your mailgirl (if you have a mail girl), or a nurse at your doctor’s office, or anyone really! I mean who wouldn’t want a big old slice of cake that smells yummie, lathers up like a dream, and comes shaped like a big chunk of delicious cake! I know the Muse is liking these! What do you think? Chocolate Cream Pie Slice of Soap Oreo Cookie Chocolate Pie Slice of Soap Key Lime Pie Slice of Soap Neapolitan Ice Cream Slice of Soap If cake is not your bag that’s ok Sunflower Gardens has brownies, ice cream, pies, cupcakes, poundcake, cheesecake, and anything else your mind (and stomach) might be dreaming about in a soap!

Check out Sunflower Gardens for yourself! I’m positive you’ll find at least one item that will strike you as a cool gift!']",4354347c82d268010a1a0731324632ce05666ec3,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4233,
"['mark Little Block Box ""Customize Your Shimmer"" Palettes By Isabella Muse on November 15, 2007 4 Comments in Mark A few months ago I blogged about mark’s new Block Boxes that allowed you to customize a palette with little cubes of shimmer for eyes and face. Remember? No? Click here and you can read my original post. The Little Block Box is finally available for purchase from mark ! Finally! I was waiting on these for ages! The good news is these look quite interesting! The bad news is I want them all so they become a bit more expensive when you are wanting one of everything hehe! Basically you have to purchase the “block box” first at $6 you then proceed to customize it for face and eyes by purchasing blocks of color at $5 for eye blocks and $6 for face blocks. Block Box $6 (Empty) When you first see it you think this might run you a few dollars but in reality you’re running up a bill of $26 for 4 eye blocks and one block box! That isn’t too shocking as I’ve spent more on palettes before but those were posh brands not Avon (mark is Avon’s younger sister brand). I honestly do want to try some of these because the shimmer looks great in them but the price is just making me scratch my head slightly. The fun of customizing this case is great the price however leaves a bit to be desired! Maybe if it was just put together and offered in a few color selections and have say…mmm a $15 price tag that would seem fair! But spending $18 and upwards for a cheaper cosmetic brand seems a bit too much! I’ve tried several combos and prices range from $18 up to $26 or so per palette. $18 bucks gets you the block box and two face shimmers while $26 would get you the block box and four eye shimmers and if you want a combo it’ll set you back $22 for one block box, one face shimmer, and one eye shimmer. Eye Shimmer Blocks $5 Face Shimmer Blocks $6 I’m doing the math on these and it’s boggling my mind a little bit because I can get a far superior MAC palette for $10 bucks more and mark is in no way the same quality as MAC! Oh no the Muse is being cheap (it doesn’t happen often so enjoy the novelty before it wears off!). But I can’t help it! The prices seem really off to me! To be honest I’m diseased and I’ll probably buy at least one because my curiiosity is getting the better of me and I’m wondering what these are like! Sigh!

"['Basin Christmas Soaps By Isabella Muse on November 13, 2007 Leave a Comment in Shower & Bath You may remember Basin from a previous post I did a few months ago. The Basin website has been updated with some Christmas goodies and my little eye did spy some rather cute Christmas soaps for gift giving (and since I did Lush’s Christmas post yesterday I thought maybe Basin deserved a little mention as well!).

But Daniel you didn’t leave the Muse an e-mail address ? So if you’d kindly e-mail me your address I can ship all your goodies out! Thanks again for everyone that participated! Bare Escentuals Classic Rock Collection First Impressions By Isabella Muse on November 20, 2007 Leave a Comment in Bare Escentuals , First Impressions , Holiday Collections 2007 , Winter Collections 2007 I’ve done first impressions on both the Gold and the Platinum Collections that Bare Escentuals introduced and now I have the Classic Rock Collection which is more of a sparkling white diamond in comparison with the silver and gold of the other collections! If you missed either of the posts about the other collections you can click here and here to view them! This collection is quite nice but a bit smaller than the others as it doesn’t contain nearly as much product and goodies as the others do! I’ll be doing a comparison post of all three sometime next week but this definately contains a considerably amount less product than the Gold and Platinum Kits however it is still nice. The first thing that deserves mentioning is the Buxom Lip Gloss included with this kit. Bare Escentuals must be listening because they have changed the applicator on the Buxom Lips from a sponge to a brush. Many complaints have arisen about the Buxom Lips being a great product but the sponge applicator wasn’t distrubing enough product and you would be triple dipping to get enough gloss to apply on your lips. Well, have no fear, this Buxom Lip Gloss has a brush applicator and makes application simple. It’s entitled Dominique and is a gorgeous clear gloss with a ton of sparkle. Our other two sets did not include a gloss but a lipstick. While this failed to include a lipstick the gloss is gorgeous enough to make up for that! Dominique Buxom Lip Gloss YAY Out with the Sponge Application and in with the Brush Applicator! This set included two brushes instead of the normal three as seen with Gold and Platinum however they brushes are far more prettier than those collections in that they have a cute little rhinestone on the handle! You get a Flawless Face Brush and a Tapered Eyeshadow Brush with this kit! Both are pretty soft and I haven’t seen any shedding yet after applying blush with the Flawless Face Brush this morning! So far so good! You also, like the Platinum Collection, get a Beautifully Luminous Mascara Duo. If you’re worried about getting repeat products when purchasing both sets you can rest easy knowing that both sets are dramatically different color wise. Where as the Platinum Kit contains a silver Beautifully Luminous Mascara this kit includes a sparkling white one! You can read my review on Beautifully Luminous Mascara by clicking here . The Diamond Gossamer included with this kit is a gorgeous sparkling white color! They recommend using the Gossamer’s as a body powder for arms, legs, cleavage, etc…I personally like using it on my eyes, face, and body! It’s possibly my favorite Gossamer aside from the gold that was included with the bareGold Kit! Classic Rock Eyeshadow is a sparkling silver color much like the silver color that was included with the Platinum collection but it is a bit lighter so it’ll be nice to use both in a look for contrasting! The blush you’ll get is called Laughter and is a peachy color which is very nice! I fail to see too much diamond sparkle in it though! It appears quite matte to me but it’s still a nice color. Nice Rock Glimmer is a sparkling chocolate brown and you can most definately see the touches of diamond powder in it! I’m eager to give this a try! And finally you get a cute little white clutch which I’m in love with. The other two kits did not include clutches but instead sturdy boxes to store your bits in! However, I am loving the clutch as it’s quite lovely! Overall, the collection is quite nice but I’m happy I didn’t pay the original price tag of $59 for it. It’s a nice set but the shadows included just don’t seem to match up in my eyes (silver and chocolate?!?!). There are definately some plus posh items in the lot such as the gossamer and clutch plus the brushes but it still fails to give me that WOW that I’m looking for! It’s definately a nice gift or for yourself but don’t pay $59 for it! Nab it now while 20% at Sephora is still ongoing so you can save a few bucks on the kit! Nice but no wow factor! The Muse likes it but felt it was missing something! Got it? Love it? Need it? Tell me! Lush Cosmetics Limited Edition Ghost Shower Gel By Isabella Muse on November 20, 2007 7 Comments in First Impressions , Lush , Shower & Bath I’m celebrating Halloween a month late as I just now received my lot of Ghost Shower Gel from Lush UK (I should add that it’s no fault of Lush UK that shipping took so long! I was participating in Lush Retro Races and my Ghost order was part of my Retro Race order thus the wait time!)! You may remember me previously blogging about this if not you can always take a skip through my past and click here to read all about Ghost prior to reading this review! If you’re a fan of Lush Cosmetics you might remember a little cult item called Skinny Dip from ages past! Ghost quite reminds me of Skinny Dip with a bit of a twist! Skinny Dip was luscious, thick, creamy, and gorgeous and much to fans dismay, discontinued (as you become more and more of a Lush fan you realize how much hoarding and stashing large quantities of Lush away is essential to survival! Because once it’s gone it’s a difficult time mourning the lost of a hair product, bath bomb, or other essential item that you may use from day to day and suddenly have disappear!). If you suddenly develop a case of the lems for Skinny Dip you can always get it in it’s new form as a Buttercream but I will tell you the Buttercream is nothing like the original, gorgeous shower gel which I still mourn to this very day! I secretly believe that Mark decided to axe Skinny Dip because it had a tendency to go bad after 6 months or so (at least for me it did! I’d be the one that was stashing bottles of Skinny Dip in my fridge to keep them from going bad before I could use them! Later on in life I may (or may not) admit to purchasing a mini fridge to store all my Lush in but that’s a story for another day!) instead of it’s year expiration date but he’ll tell you it was because it wasn’t popular! Anyway….I guess that was a rather long eulogy about my love affair with Skinny Dip and at this point you might very well wonder what I am on about! Well…Ghost is much like my beloved Skinny Dip and I’m so happy I did a nice large order for it! I ended up purchasing 5 bottles because I had figured if I hated it at least it would make great swap bait on MUA! BOO! But swap bait be damned it’s now a part of my beauty vault as it’s wonderfully delightful! I was somewhat worried about the “scent of lillies” in a shower gel but to my delight it does somewhat smell like an offbeat Skinny Dip version! It’s quite milky, creamy, very, very very thick and just yum all the way around! When I say thick I’m talking about taking the cap off and putting the bottle over your head top side down and watching how it doesn’t slide out of the bottle at all! It doesn’t move! Magic my friends! Yummie Ooey Gooey Ghost! Now this is just from sniffing it in the bottle mind you! I’m not sure if the smell will be better or worst once I use it in the shower but I think it’s safe to say that this will turn out for the better once I lather up with it! All in all I should have never been worried about Ghost not being a fabulous product because really it’s rare I run across something Lush puts out that isn’t blessedly wonderful! The only disappointing thing about Ghost would be it’s 250ML size (8.4oz)! I’d rather have had the 500ML (15oz) size offered at a bit more on the price tag but sadly I guess, for marketing purposes, they settled on making it in 250ML size! It’s ok I still heart it! Cheers to Ghost! I think I might hop into a shower right now just so I can use it! Got it? Tell me what you think! Need it? It’s gone from both Lush US and Lush UK but you can always check E-bay or MUA! Tell your Muse what you think if you ended up purchasing it!

Bare Escentuals Beautifully Luminous Lashes Review By Isabella Muse on November 19, 2007 6 Comments in Bare Escentuals I did a “Givenchy Lash Sparkles on a Budget” post a few weeks ago which was a list of alternative lash sparkles you could use that were cheaper options! You can read that post by clicking here . In the same vein Bare Escentuals Beautifully Luminous Lashes does something similar to Givenchy Lash Sparkles but with a bit of a different effect. Beautifully Luminous Lashes are actually a colored mascara gel that you can use as an overcoat over your own mascara to create a gentle shimmer of color to your lashes! I do really like these but there are some pros and cons to the use of it! The main reason I am mentioning these is because a new color has been introduced which looks lovely for the Holidays! That color is Sapphire which is a gorgeous twinkling blue color! I have these in all the colors offered including some not offered any longer and one that was included in the Platinum Kit which is a gorgeous silver affair ( Click here to see it! )! Currently there are two colors available plus two colors that are included with kits. The two colors you can purchase minus a costly kit are Gold and Sapphire. Each overcoat is $15 which isn’t too bad a deal! These are a bit tricky to use but with a little bit work you can do well by them! The brush loads up with color really quickly and you think that would make application easy enough but sadly it does not. When I brush this over my mascara coated lashes I get next to no sparkle or shine on my lashes! I don’t understand the why or the how but it just doesn’t distribute the product correctly for whatever reason! I’m still in debates whether it’s the formula or the brush that causes this problem! The brush is really fat and chunky and you’d think that would make application a breeze however it’s a no go! So…. After all that ranting the solution is simple. Basically the way I get this to work correctly is by using the tip of the brush to coat my lashes with color and then proceeding to swipe the color over my eyes using the full brush! The results: Beautiful lashes with a sparkle of the color I’m using! Overall, the product is inexpensive and pretty nice aside from that fact that application is such a challenge! I’d say they are worth trying out but only if you have the extra money! If not, hold out for something better!']",3b2a7610869d53894c214eaacc40a7d8be275e1d,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4231,

"['Basin: A Cheap Alternative to Lush By Isabella Muse on September 24, 2007 2 Comments in First Impressions , Shower & Bath As much as the Muse loves Lush she admits that each year the price raise on bath goodies is a bit extreme. She recalls a time when she could find a bath bomb from Lush for a small chunk of change. Sadly, that’s no longer the case. I only order my Lush from the UK and it’s quite cheaper compared to the US site but prices do lean towards a bit much at times. Good news ahead! The Muse has found an interesting little shop entitled Basin! Basin offers an array of cheaper imitation Lush products for a fraction of the cost. The Muse must admit that many of the products are a bit too close to the names and ideas of Lush however these are interesting to sneak a little peek at! I’ve only purchased soap from the company so far and must say I’m quite pleased. The soaps are too cute for mere words! Take a look for yourself: From looking at the site it appears that the actual store has a wider selection of soaps than they do online! They also carry a huge array of Bath Bombs, Shampoo Bars, and other bath and body goodies for the masses! Many of the items, as I mentioned previously, are a bit to close for comfort in design, scent, and idea to Lush items! Comparing Basin to Lush: Basin’s Butter Sensuous, Invigorating, Exotic–This moisturizing Bubbler has a velvety vanilla and coco-butter fragrance that’s sure to make you swoon. Reminiscent of a tropical breeze off an island paradise. Drop a Bubbler into a filled tub and watch the magic begin. The Bubbler releases a host of all-natural essential oils and fragrances, transforming your bath from ordinary to extraordinary. Lush’s Butterball Our all-time, best selling bath bomb is easily taken as straight forward and simple. Au contraire! This vanilla, cocoa butter bomb is a powerful skin moisturizing agent of the fiercest variety. 20 minutes in the bath is all it takes. This is just one comparison but several other items are quite similar. I’m not entirely sure how comfortable I am with all the knock offs here but they are a cheap alternatives to Lush that’s for sure! Bombs run from $3.45-3.95 or less in comparison to a Lush Bomb which runs from $5.45-$8 and upwards. Shampoo Bars are $6.99 ($24.99 for 4 Shampoo Bars) in comparison to Lush Solid Shampoos at $8.95-$14.50. The fun news about this shop is they do carry several items that you won’t find at Lush such as Bath Salts, various kids items, and a few other interesting tidbits! With my soap lot I also happened to purchase something called Dr. Spot which promises to remove oil, dirt, and many other happy stain mistakes! This is basically a bar of soap that you rub on stains and it’s supposed to remove all of the mentioned stains and MORE! Wahoooo the Muse loves the idea of a spot remover that erases stains! Overall, Basin has some very cute products with some very, very nice prices! Do check it out and let me know what you think! You may also enjoy...

"['Lush North Pole Soap Review By Isabella Muse on October 18, 2012 12 Comments in Bath & Body , Holiday Collections 2012 , Lush , Shower & Bath , Soap , Winter Collections 2012 One variation is never enough for beauty junkies that’s why Lush North Pole Soap comes in two fragrances! Lush created their new Lush North Pole Soap for Holiday 2012 in two different colors with two different fragrances so you get a little variety with your Christmas Shower Cheer. I picked up the white variation for myself recently from Lush UK and I’m ever so happy I did because it quite reminds me of Lush’s long gone Candy Cane Soap I loved so much. The pink is all about chocolate and mint. Sounded like a mint Tootsie Roll to me! Since I don’t like the smell of chocolate I decided I’d try out the white version. Although wholly white it does feature small bits of pink in the center for a festive candy-cane like appearance. Every see those non traditional pink and white candy canes? This is what this reminds me of. It quite smells a lot like Candy Cane Soap to me. Not super minty in the least, not candy cane-ish or peppermint either…it’s sort of a subtle mint with a bit of a twang to it. Lush says it’s woodsy and minty but I seriously don’t get the wood note at all and I can’t really describe with the back note is that’s paired up with the mint. It’s kinda sorta minty candy but the “twang” I’m talking about kinda morphs the scent. It’s unique…that’s for sure! If you loved Candy Cane Soap and are terribly sad it hasn’t rejoined the Lush Christmas world this year I’d happy recommend selecting a slice of North Pole White instead as you’ll be quite happy how similiar it smells. Likey! I won’t Muse Approve it because this one might not be everyone’s cuppa. I will however, recommend sniffing it. You might be get as addicted as I did when I sniffed it the first time.

B Never Too Busy To Be Beautiful Perfumes By Isabella Muse on November 21, 2007 12 Comments in B Never , Fragrance , Recommendations I’ve been wanting to do a post about B for a very long time but I just never had the time to take the photos of my rather large stash of B! I’ve decided that it’s long overdo and I’m bringing you a tale of B today! I’ll be doing the post in two separate parts. Part 1 will consist of B’s perfume line and Part 2 will consist of B’s cosmetic line! I was going to do a Part 3 discussing B’s Bath and Body lineup but I think it might be overkill so I’ll only cover that briefly (plus if I had to haul out my entire collection of B Bath and Body goodies I’d be here for the next year of my life). If you’ve no idea what I am talking about allow me to explain a little. B Never Too Busy To Be Beautiful is Lush Cosmetic’s younger, groovier little sister (it’s also alot more expensive and posh than Lush is). B is not available in the US or any other country other then jolly old England so sadly it’s either order online and have it airmailed to you or hop the nearest plane to London to grab yourself some! I’ve been collecting B products for about 4 years or so now. I visited B for the first time about 3-4 years old in London with one of my best mates and from that day on I was forever a fan and lover! The store is something to behold and if you happen to live in London or are visiting do drop by 39 Carnaby Street for the full effect! It’s gorgeous and you’ll leave the store about $1000 dollars poorer while wiping the drool off your mouth and trying to snap yourself back into reality. I wish I had photos of my visit but sadly I do not! I’ve googled and you can locate images for yourself by clicking here . If you’re expecting something similar to Lush you’ll be shocked to learn this is NOTHING like Lush. It’s completely different. B consists of vegan friendly cosmetics, perfume, bath and body items. It’s mostly popular for it’s bejeweled cosmetics but it also has quite a cult following when it comes to it’s very different perfume line! Scents have come and gone in the B line and at the moment there are eight scents as the main line up (seven of which I have tried and six of each I own!). Nine if you consider the Body Spray, Dirty, part of the line up! Perfumes you’ll find at B are a unique, expensive experience that are well worth the price of omission in my personal opinion. If you have a taste for the posh and gorgeous these will appeal to you. Be warned they take some getting used. First sniff will almost always have you pulling back in dismay but slowly B perfumes grow on you and you become deeper and deeper in lust and love with them as time passes! The thing I adore about B perfume is how exotic and unique they are. It’s something you can wear and not worry about smelling like the rest of the population which means you’ll truly have your very own personal scent as B is not exactly easy to get around these parts! Prices on B perfume range from $90 and upwards (cheaper for smaller bottles or sprays!). These are not cheap in anyway, shape or form but they are well worth the disgusting price tag in my humble opinion! Sadly, the Muse is unable to explain the perfumes because they are such a unusual blend of notes but I’ll do the best I can! One of my favorite perfumes from B is entitled Love. The main notes in the blend are jasmine, rose, and ylang ylang. These combine to create a strangely citrus floral blend on me. Love The only true way to describe the scent of Love and other B perfume is to sum it up as Old Hollywood . B perfumes remind me of vintage, retro, black and white Hollywood. Fay Wray , Joan Crawford, Vivian Leigh, Etc… B perfumes all come in vintage victorian style bottles with a tasseled pump so it brings you way back into a gorgeous, glamorous era! My second favorite scent would be Keep It Fluffy which is slightly on the sweet side but it too falls into the floral combination of rose, ylang ylang, and vanilla! It’s a very deep blend so don’t expect something light (don’t expect light from any B perfume). Keep It Fluffy My third favorite is Cocktail which is indeed a cocktail of different notes including cassia, sandalwood, jasmine, ylang ylang and other interesting bits! Cocktail My fourth favorite would be Two Hearts Beating As One which is a blend of jasmine, rose, and musk. It’s a very sophisticated floral combination that’s positively gorgeous! Two Hearts My fifth favorite would be A Thousand Kisses Deep which is a blend of vanilla, asian spices, and musk (and a few other things). It’s quite an interesting blend and like all B perfumes glamorous and gorgeous! A Thousand Kisses Deep My sixth and least favorite perfume is B Scent which contains notes of sandalwood and jasmine over a base I can’t quite pinpoint. It’s difficult to describe B Scent but it’s not really a favorite of mine! Although, I like it well enough it’s not the first bottle I reach for! B Scent Ladyboy and Breath of God are two other scents offered by B. I haven’t yet tried Breath of God and I can tell already I’ll hate it as it contains patchouli. Breath of God is pretty new and takes the place of another fragrance that used to be offered called Om which strangely enough contains a majority of the same notes as this new scent thus it’s just a rename I guess! Ladyboy is a scent I had purchased a while ago and absolutely hated. It was actually something I thought I’d love due to it’s notes but it’s terrible. It’s a violet banana blend that just doesn’t work at all and makes me gag and cringe (sorry B)! B perfumes are sophisticated blends that are very “evening” wearable. They aren’t something you can spritz on for a light splash of scent. They are more of a “out on the town” scent that are very strong and lingering. They take some getting used to but in the long run they are downright delightful (and addicting) once you’ve gotten a taste for them! B extends most of these scents into Bath and Body goodies as well such as Bath Bombs, Bubble Bars, Lotions and other bits and bobs! Keep It Fluffy Body Powder Love and B Scent Body Sprays If your tastes run to the unique, unusual, rare, and posh B Never is something you’ll want to try! My Collection of B Perfumes B Never perfumes (and everything B offers) is most definately Muse approved! Questions? Comments?

Ulta’s Color on the Go Palette $19.99 at Ulta.com I really want someone to prove me wrong about these palettes because they sure do look good but that much product in one place for $19.99 makes a Muse skeptical! Ulta’s Holiday Blockbuster Palette By Isabella Muse on November 26, 2007 8 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Beauty on a Budget I guess Ulta’s doing it’s own little version of the Holiday Blockbuster Palette and it’s only $24.99!

Ulta’s Holiday Blockbuster Palette Supposedly it’s worth $195 but personally I’d take a gamble that it’s a lot of cheap makeup with no pigment!

To be honest I can’t recall it being on shelves for a long time and suddenly everywhere I look a new display is popping up for it! Count me curious because they released a Shimmering Blush for $5.99! Now your Muse is not normally one for drugstore brands outside of Asia but these do seem interesting! I know the folk on MUA are going ape crazy over them because everywhere I look I see pictures of entire hauls of these blushes! That must mean they are good right?

Go Green with Lush By Isabella Muse on November 26, 2007 Leave a Comment in Lush Lush likes us to be friendly to the environment, animals, and just generally wants us to be a good “green” human being! In honor of their vegan roots Lush UK had released a few new green items that have now made their way across the pond and are available for purchase from Lush NA! Go Green Body Spray This is the first body spray Lush has introduced and it sounds interesting if you’re a lover of greeny, herbally scents! Go Green body spray is a refreshing blend of grapefruit, bergamot and neroli with calming smoky vetivert and herbal wafts of fennel, thyme and cedar wood.

Squeaky Green How about a bit of green for your hair? Squeaky Green is Lush’s newest solid Shampoo Bar and carries the same scent as Go Green Body Spray! How’s that for layering it on!

Lush is throwing an “online” Christmas Party and you’re invited since you know me (I’m making myself very important here aren’t I?). Lush NA had a Christmas Party last year too so I guess this qualifies as a annual event now! The good news is they’ll be a live chat with the mail order team, discounts, specials, freebies, gifts, giveaways, and possibly a special product made for those who attend! The bad news is Lush NA parties are not nearly as good as parties thrown at Lush UK but hey at least we get some deals right?! Last year at the party an online Exclusive Shower Gel was made which was entitled Honeywood! The shower gel smelled of Honey I Washed the Kids soap and was yummie as hell! Now this was previously introduced in Germany and later traveled to Hollywood when Lush Universal Studios had opened and finally it ended up in everyone’s stocking last year when it was re-released at the Lush Christmas Party! My Beloved Lush Limited Edition Honeywood Shower Gel You may wonder why I’m telling you all this and that would be simply to warn you that during this party you may want to hide your credit card! I found myself ordering a mass amount of shower gel last year! Aura Suavis Shower Gel was released as a limited edition during a Lush UK party this past summer and Comforter Shower Gel was released in Germany a few months ago! I’m mentioning these two amazing shower gels because it’s possible, if we get lucky, Lush NA will release their version of these great gels during the party! Or maybe if you’re lucky, Snowcake Shower Gel ! One can never tell what might pop up so be prepared for some goodies!

"['B Never Too Busy To Be Beautiful Perfumes By Isabella Muse on November 21, 2007 12 Comments in B Never , Fragrance , Recommendations I’ve been wanting to do a post about B for a very long time but I just never had the time to take the photos of my rather large stash of B! I’ve decided that it’s long overdo and I’m bringing you a tale of B today! I’ll be doing the post in two separate parts. Part 1 will consist of B’s perfume line and Part 2 will consist of B’s cosmetic line! I was going to do a Part 3 discussing B’s Bath and Body lineup but I think it might be overkill so I’ll only cover that briefly (plus if I had to haul out my entire collection of B Bath and Body goodies I’d be here for the next year of my life). If you’ve no idea what I am talking about allow me to explain a little. B Never Too Busy To Be Beautiful is Lush Cosmetic’s younger, groovier little sister (it’s also alot more expensive and posh than Lush is). B is not available in the US or any other country other then jolly old England so sadly it’s either order online and have it airmailed to you or hop the nearest plane to London to grab yourself some! I’ve been collecting B products for about 4 years or so now. I visited B for the first time about 3-4 years old in London with one of my best mates and from that day on I was forever a fan and lover! The store is something to behold and if you happen to live in London or are visiting do drop by 39 Carnaby Street for the full effect! It’s gorgeous and you’ll leave the store about $1000 dollars poorer while wiping the drool off your mouth and trying to snap yourself back into reality. I wish I had photos of my visit but sadly I do not! I’ve googled and you can locate images for yourself by clicking here . If you’re expecting something similar to Lush you’ll be shocked to learn this is NOTHING like Lush. It’s completely different. B consists of vegan friendly cosmetics, perfume, bath and body items. It’s mostly popular for it’s bejeweled cosmetics but it also has quite a cult following when it comes to it’s very different perfume line! Scents have come and gone in the B line and at the moment there are eight scents as the main line up (seven of which I have tried and six of each I own!). Nine if you consider the Body Spray, Dirty, part of the line up! Perfumes you’ll find at B are a unique, expensive experience that are well worth the price of omission in my personal opinion. If you have a taste for the posh and gorgeous these will appeal to you. Be warned they take some getting used. First sniff will almost always have you pulling back in dismay but slowly B perfumes grow on you and you become deeper and deeper in lust and love with them as time passes! The thing I adore about B perfume is how exotic and unique they are. It’s something you can wear and not worry about smelling like the rest of the population which means you’ll truly have your very own personal scent as B is not exactly easy to get around these parts! Prices on B perfume range from $90 and upwards (cheaper for smaller bottles or sprays!). These are not cheap in anyway, shape or form but they are well worth the disgusting price tag in my humble opinion! Sadly, the Muse is unable to explain the perfumes because they are such a unusual blend of notes but I’ll do the best I can! One of my favorite perfumes from B is entitled Love. The main notes in the blend are jasmine, rose, and ylang ylang. These combine to create a strangely citrus floral blend on me. Love The only true way to describe the scent of Love and other B perfume is to sum it up as Old Hollywood . B perfumes remind me of vintage, retro, black and white Hollywood. Fay Wray , Joan Crawford, Vivian Leigh, Etc… B perfumes all come in vintage victorian style bottles with a tasseled pump so it brings you way back into a gorgeous, glamorous era! My second favorite scent would be Keep It Fluffy which is slightly on the sweet side but it too falls into the floral combination of rose, ylang ylang, and vanilla! It’s a very deep blend so don’t expect something light (don’t expect light from any B perfume). Keep It Fluffy My third favorite is Cocktail which is indeed a cocktail of different notes including cassia, sandalwood, jasmine, ylang ylang and other interesting bits! Cocktail My fourth favorite would be Two Hearts Beating As One which is a blend of jasmine, rose, and musk. It’s a very sophisticated floral combination that’s positively gorgeous! Two Hearts My fifth favorite would be A Thousand Kisses Deep which is a blend of vanilla, asian spices, and musk (and a few other things). It’s quite an interesting blend and like all B perfumes glamorous and gorgeous! A Thousand Kisses Deep My sixth and least favorite perfume is B Scent which contains notes of sandalwood and jasmine over a base I can’t quite pinpoint. It’s difficult to describe B Scent but it’s not really a favorite of mine! Although, I like it well enough it’s not the first bottle I reach for! B Scent Ladyboy and Breath of God are two other scents offered by B. I haven’t yet tried Breath of God and I can tell already I’ll hate it as it contains patchouli. Breath of God is pretty new and takes the place of another fragrance that used to be offered called Om which strangely enough contains a majority of the same notes as this new scent thus it’s just a rename I guess! Ladyboy is a scent I had purchased a while ago and absolutely hated. It was actually something I thought I’d love due to it’s notes but it’s terrible. It’s a violet banana blend that just doesn’t work at all and makes me gag and cringe (sorry B)! B perfumes are sophisticated blends that are very “evening” wearable. They aren’t something you can spritz on for a light splash of scent. They are more of a “out on the town” scent that are very strong and lingering. They take some getting used to but in the long run they are downright delightful (and addicting) once you’ve gotten a taste for them! B extends most of these scents into Bath and Body goodies as well such as Bath Bombs, Bubble Bars, Lotions and other bits and bobs! Keep It Fluffy Body Powder Love and B Scent Body Sprays If your tastes run to the unique, unusual, rare, and posh B Never is something you’ll want to try! My Collection of B Perfumes B Never perfumes (and everything B offers) is most definately Muse approved! Questions? Comments? Tell the Muse! You may also enjoy...

"['Philosophy on QVC By Isabella Muse on November 29, 2007 Leave a Comment in Beauty Babblings , Philosophy , Steals and Deals It may sound unappealing but I rock the home shopping boat every year for Christmas! Many people think that shopping from QVC will nab you cheap gifts that are not worth the effort or the money of ordering but that’s not the case! You can nab some great gifts that are inexpensive and quite posh! They also offer great flexible payment options to spread your payments into small monthly payments rather then paying the entire amount right away! Many cosmetic options also have some products that are exclusive to QVC so these are items you can’t purchase from anywhere else! I’ve gathered together a few Philosophy items that are really great deals in my opinion and maybe they’ll simplify your Christmas gift list! Philosophy Lemonade 5-Piece Deluxe Set Available at QVC Item Number A18856 $80USD Includes all of the following items: 16-fl oz old fashioned lemonade shampoo, shower gel, and bubble bath 8-oz lemonade body butter 23-oz old fashioned lemonade salt scrub 2-oz lemonade hand cream 0.5 oz lemon-flavored lip shine Purchased separately this entire lot would run you $91USD Lemonade isn’t my favorite philosophy Shower Gel but this lot of items will save you $11 if you purchased them separately so not a bad deal! Philosophy Flavored Lip Collection Available from QVC Item Number A72108 $29.98 Includes all of the following: lip gloss in vanilla birthday cake lip gloss in powdered sugar cookie lip gloss in raspberry sorbet lip gloss in melon daiquiri Purchased separately each lip shine is $10 which totals $40 for four! You’ll save $10 by getting this set! Philosophy Amazing Grace Head to Toe 6 Piece Layering Kit Available from QVC Item Number A4518 Includes all of the following items: 8-oz amazing grace shampoo, bath, and shower gel 8-oz amazing grace hair conditioner 8-oz amazing grace firming body emulsion 1-oz amazing grace hand cream 2-oz amazing grace spray fragrance 0.27 oz amazing grace perfume oil 2-oz bonus purity made simple facial cleanser 0.4 oz bonus hope in a jar moisturizer Some of the items in set set aren’t valued but if you add together the shampoo, conditioner, body emulsion, hand cream, spray perfume, and oil it comes to $87 or more! Happy Shopping! Specktra Blogging By Isabella Muse on November 28, 2007 8 Comments in Babblings Your Muse is always a busy bee and she presents to you two new Specktra Blog posts! One from this week and one from last week! Enjoy! Majolica Majorca’s Lash Expander Review And The Perfect Blush If you use MJ Mascara do let me know what you think of it! Cheers! Stila Look Book Palette Review By Isabella Muse on November 28, 2007 9 Comments in Stila A few months ago when I purchased my lot of Novel Twist from MAC I decided to wander into Sephora where I came across two Stila palettes that I fell in love with and purchased! It had been a while since I had seen the Stila girls on any packaging so upon seeing it pretty much sold me without even peeking inside either palette to see the colors (Sometimes packaging is all it takes for a general cosmetic junkie to get excited!). The Look Books are a $40 package which include everything you need to create the perfect face. You get three shadows, one blush, and a Stila IT Gloss. Not a bad deal in my opinion. After getting these home I wandered onto Sephora’s website and came across two MORE Look Books! So altogether four were released! After that I quickly e-mailed my fellow Stila addict Iris and explained that these were available did she want them to which she replied that Japan had already gotten them! Oh well so much for sharing the love with my good bud (damn US we’re always behind in everything!). A few months pasted and my obsession with obtaining the other two books was pushed towards the back burner while I pursued the Holiday Collections I was so desperately wanting! When Sephora’s Friend and Family Discount rolled around I remembered that my little Wish List had contained the other two books I hadn’t previously gotten so they quickly ended up in my cart! Hey, 20% off sweetened the deal so I most definably wanted these while the saving was good (although they’ll be plenty of time in the summer to kick myself in the arse for paying the price I did when they’ll probably be available at the Stila Warehouse sale for like $5 each! *groan*)! This is a rather long story isn’t it? To the goods! BEHOLD!!!!!!!!!! Stila Look Books So as I was saying these are a total value. You’re getting full size shadows, blush, and a full size gloss (no minis here)! Stila IT Glosses What more could a girl want (lots I know)? There isn’t any creativity behind the names of these little palettes so they just basically range as Stila Look Book 1-4! Stila Look Book 1 features a lovely brunette on the cover and inside we have some yummie delightful shades to work with! This palette comes with rose blush, heather, grace, and espresso eyeshadow and an IT Gloss in Smashing. Rose is your standard dusty rose color that will be flattering on most skin shades. Grace shadow is a lovely taupe beige color while Espresso contrasts this shade perfect and is a deeper brown! Mostly I think they are wanting you to use Espresso as a liner shade but I think you can safely get away with using it as a contrasting shadow by offsetting it with Grace. Grace is a shimmering shade while Espresso is a matte. Heather is a soft beige pink color that’ll be perfect for using as a wash of color all over the eye prepping it for the darker shades in the palette. And finally the gloss with this is Smashing which is a bright shimmering pink and seems quite out of place with the colors of the palette but hey the Muse never says no to pink gloss! Look Book 2 comes with lame, oasis, and coin eyeshadow, tint blush, and enchanting IT Gloss. The Tint blush is nothing to write home about and it sadly looks like it may be lacking pigment (I haven’t tried it yet) but the shadows are yummie so that more than makes up for the blush! Lame shadow is a shimmering gold, Oasis is a shimmering pink, and Coin is a soft chocolate brown which is matte for the most part but does have tiny flecks of gold. Coin and Gold go well together but Oasis you may find a little difficult working into the look but with a little creativity you’re sure to create a great look with the colors! Enchanting gloss, out of all the palettes, is the one that I like the least. It’s pretty enough but it contains no shimmer the finish is more of a pearl which isn’t a favorite of mine. The color is a cross between a pink and a peach! Look Book 3 is another disappointment in the blush department. The blush included with this palette is Fade and it’s a bronze color and we all know how I feel about bronze! The only redeeming color in the entire palette is Shell shadow which is a shimmering dusty pink color. The other two shadows included are Puck and Dahlia. Puck is a gray brown color that isn’t all that exciting. Dahlia is a navy blue matte color which again does nothing to make me jump around! Sadly the entire palette is a mix up color combination if every I did see one and it’s going to take some hard work to come up with a good look using it. The redeeming factor would be the IT Gloss included in Sweet which is a rosy brown shimmer that’s very pretty! And finally Look Book 4 which has some very gorgeous colors and could be my favorite of the lot! This contains a blush called Heat which is a dusty rose color that’s very pretty and natural on! It also includes eyeshadows in icon, twig, and nude. Icon is a pretty peachy, brown, pink shimmer while Heat offsets this color and is a deep reddish brown shimmer and finally Icon which is a shimmering nude. All the colors in this palette just go great together plus none are matte which is a plus for me! The gloss is an odd choice for this look as it’s a peach shimmer but it’s beautiful and I’m positive I’ll find a look to use it with! The color of the gloss is called Inviting! Over all these have some great value for your buck as you’re getting 5 full size products plus cute packaging! If you’re a serious collector of Stila you’re going to want these badly! If you’re a casual shopper you may want to buy at least get one (might I suggest #4)! It’s alot of product for the $40 and a nice deal! Of course if you happen to live in California the Muse highly recommends waiting for the blessed Stila Warehouse Sale! These palettes are Muse Approved for purchase!

Here’s something that was inside! LOOK! Bourjois Paris Ombre A Paupieres in Jaune Pepite 21, Orange Pepite 23, and Ocre Pepite 24 GASP! How gorgeous are these!? They are so much more vibrant than the colors we have here in the US! We have NONE of these colors available to us here and I’m just loving every single one! Shhh don’t tell anyone I even tried the lighter and dark oranges for a blush (instead of a shadow) and they look great! My eyes literally popped with the color when I tried these and they’ll be wonderful in the Summer! As much as I love Bourjois Paris their shadows are sometimes light but these are mega pigmented!

Bourjois has released a new eye shadow in several countries outside the US called Ombre Stretch. Unlike it’s traditional baked eye shadows this appears to be a shimmering shadow in a more traditional compact size! Very cute in my humble opinion!

"['Bourjois Paris Smoked Eyes Palette By Isabella Muse on August 12, 2009 4 Comments in Bourjois Paris , Fall Collections 2009 It took the Muse a fair while before she perfected the art of a smoky eye. I’m using the term art loosely as I’m no expert at creating a good smoky eye look. One thing I have discovered is that “colored” smoky eyes are the most flattering of all. One of my favorite smoky looks is created using various shades of greens, this makes my big, buggy eyes fairly pop. Some of my best colored smoky eyes were created using KATE Glamtrick Palettes . These palettes truly make it easy and simple to create a killer smoky eye look with graduating colors that are a snap to blend and use. Speaking of colored smoky eyes and easy application Bourjois Paris has a brand new line of Smoky Eye Palettes made up of three beautiful shades for creating dramatic, colorful smoky looks. Likey! Check ’em after the jump! First off allow me to say I haven’t been this excited about cosmetics in a very long time. Being exposed to makeup daily sometimes takes the joy out of the haul. When I first laid my eyes on the new Bourjois Paris Smoked Eyes Pallete my heart did so begin to pound in that happy, joyful way when new makeup presents itself to me. These palettes are truly exciting for me. These new palettes are available right now in Asia and I’m sure will be launched Euro wise shortly. Sadly, the Bourjois Paris USA site no longer loads which leads me to believe they may finally being pulling out of our country but that’s pure speculation on my part as the line is still sold in Ulta. The palettes look like they are made up of three baked shadows in graduating colors for creating an intense dramatic colored smoky look. I can’t begin to tell you how much I am loving the looks of these. They are available in 8 shades and are 2,100 yen each. The standard black and gray is available of course but they also have a rosy smoky look, a teal smoky look, green, brown, and many more combinations. Without further commentary from me have a peek at the palettes for yourself below! I haven’t wanted to haul an entire collection in a long time but I must say each color absolutely screams at me. I can so see myself getting six or all eight of these. The simplicity and ease of use (three shades only) make it a winner for me plus they look richly pigmented. If they apply and work as well as they look in the palette count this Muse a happy girl. As soon as I track them down I’ll be reviewing. Want! What do you think? Are you a traditional black and gray smoky girl? Or do you love a colored smoky look? Tell the Muse! You may also enjoy...

"['B Never Too Busy To Be Beautiful Inhale Perfume By Isabella Muse on December 3, 2007 Leave a Comment in B Never , Fragrance , Lush You may remember my previous post about B perfumes if not you can click here and have a look and a read! I just noticed (I must be out of the loop) that B’s site has been updated with their latest scents Inhale and Exhale. B Never Too Busy To Be Beautiful Inhale Body Spray Exhale is the men’s version of the scent while Inhale is the women’s version. I’m hearing rave reviews about Inhale so I’ve ordered the Body Spray for myself to try it out (I never met a B scent that I didn’t love…well..maybe one or two…). I’m pretty excited about this scent as I’ve heard it carries a nice underlay of fresh melon and I adore fruity scents so I’m curious what sort of blend this is! Inhale is only available in Body Spray at the moment but I’m sure it’ll extend to Eau de Parfum at a later date but I can assure you, if you’re interested in this, that B’s Body Spray’s are very potent, have excellent throw, and linger a very long time with a spray or two and the best part is the bottles are quite large for the price! Inhale is available for ?18.00 from B’s website now (They ship worldwide).

The Last Day of Autumn FOTD By Isabella Muse on November 30, 2007 6 Comments in Face of the Day Your Muse just got in from the dinner and a movie and decided to make it a rather early night! New York in the winter is NOT a fun place to be! It’s cold and windy and bloody brutal weather for a Muse to be out in! So she’s home now, comfy in her bed, blogging to you gorgeous ladies! Today is sadly the last day of Autumn and it’s all down hill from here on out! The snow will be here soon! In celebration of that I did a bit of a Fall-ish look! Hope you love it!

Too Faced Liquif-Eye Review By Isabella Muse on November 30, 2007 19 Comments in Too Faced I’ve been using Too Faced Liquif-Eye for ages and I’m always on the fence about whether it’s a staple product for me or just another flash in the pan that’s interesting but not really worth it’s price tag! I use this quite alot to be honest and I really love it but the price tag may turn some off! At $17.50 you get a small bottle of liquid liner and an applicator. What’s so special about that? The liner is actually a clear formula that you can use to turn any eyeshadow in your collection into an eyeliner. It’s easy enough to use. Just swipe the applicator onto your favorite eyeshadow and line your eyes! Presto! A million eyeliners at your fingertips thanks to one little bottle of potion! Nifty right? I guess you might be thinking that you could do the exact same thing with water and I have tried but I find this actually makes my eyeshadow turned eyeliner waterproof, smudge proof, and long wearing! After each use I normally wipe this down with a damp tissue and the product comes off easy enough for my next use so I’m not lining my eyes with yesterday’s color so to speak! The applicator is nice and hard so it makes lining my eyes easy! It’s not a soft bristle brush it’s almost like the point of a fine pencil so lining is easy and smooth without a bunch of drama of bristles screwing up the look you are trying to achieve! Dipping this in Urban Decay Oil Slick Eyeshadow and doing a cat eye with this is a dream come true! It comes out flawlessly and beautiful! I honestly can say you might be able to find a cheaper alternative but I really like the applicator, the formula, and the general idea of how well this works! It’s in my traincase! Use it? Love it? Tell me! Too Faced Liquif-Eye']",32381278be7e26a900a607c49c23870a12bda80b,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4223,

"['Lush Party NA Did you attend? By Isabella Muse on December 7, 2007 2 Comments in Lush So did anyone go to the Lush NA online chat party last night (No idea what I’m talking about? Click here for details! )? Sadly, I was unable to attend as I got home really, really, really late after a longggggggggggggggggg day at broker meetings! Snore, Yawn, Boring! I wish I could say that I had even a second to log in and partake but sadly it was a no go for me! I did wander over to the website and it appears nothing of great interested was offered aside from Snowcake Solid Perfume. Other then that nothing really, super special or limited got made! Did you attend? Did you order? Tell the Muse! If you missed out like me here’s a break down of what was offered (and appears to still be available for purchase): Ol’ Blue Skies Shower Gel $15.95USD Ol’ Blue Skies Shower Gel is back (If you’re new to Lush this was a shower gel that was introduced last year for Christmas last year and when the new Christmas goodies were released for this year’s Holiday Season, Ol’ Blue Skies, was not part of the line up! So…here it is if you want it but I personally suggest steering clear unless you adore deep earthy scents!)! I’m not excited. It has patchouli in it which means it smells like just turned dirt. I’ll skip. Snowcake Solid Perfume $11.95 (or FREE! Use Code SCENTME to get it Free if you spend $65 or more on your Lush order) Snowcake Solid Perfume wahooo! The perfume solids were introduced way before the Holiday goodies this year so when the Holiday releases popped up the only solid that was “holiday” themed was Champagne Snow Showers! Much to my dismay and fans everywhere we wondered what could have happened to the idea of having a Snowcake Solid Perfume! Well…here it be ladies! I was faced with the dilemma of ordering from Lush from the US this morning as Lush UK does not carry Snowcake Solid Perfume! It was released special for the party! Ol’ Blue Eyes Pack $36.95USD If you adore smelling dirt with a bit of oranges thrown in this would be a great pack for you! You’ll get Ol’ Blue Skies Shower Gel, Blue Skies and Fluffy Clouds Bubble Bar, Karma Bubble Bar, and Karma Soap! Ooooo all the Muse’s favorites! NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love Snowcake Pack $34.95USD I don’t have to remind you how much I love Snowcake we’ve already been through it enough already right? In honor of the chat party a lovely pack was made up which consists of all good things Snowcake scented! You’ll get Snowcake Solid Perfume, Lush Pud Bath Bomb, Smitten Handcream, and a chunk of Snowcake Soap! Sweet! Sadly, nothing at all to get too hyped over! You may also enjoy...

"['Lush Ultrabland Facial Cleanser Is Anything But Bland By Isabella Muse on June 9, 2016 17 Comments in Cleanser , Lush , Muse Approved , Skincare Purchased Lush Ultrabland Facial Cleanser ($29.95) is one of those cleansers that might remind you of your grandmother’s cold cream days. I’ve been using Ultrabland on and off for over ten years now. I used to be a major Lush Baby Face fan girl until it was discontinued. Ultrabland is the same idea just in a different format but it never quite caught on with me until I realized how good it was for my drier skin. I actually always keep it stashed around and I use it on and off to remove my makeup. It’s one of those cleansers that’s great if you embrace the Korean double cleansing method. It’s also fabulous for drier skin types. Here’s a look! Lush Ultrabland is a super thick, emollient balm not to be confused with cleansing balm as this is a vastly different formula. This goes the cold cream route more than the cleansing balm route. Although balmy in texture it actually needs to be wiped off and doesn’t emulsify or break down with water. Lush formulated this with some great ingredients like honey and beeswax as well as rosewater. It does have a slight citrus-y fragrance that’s wasn’t overwhelming to my nose. To use it, simple take a small amount and warm it up between your fingers. Now, you’ll simply massage on your dry face and eyes. I typically give myself a nice, gentle massage with it. Work it in good! It’ll melt down slightly from the creamy balminess and almost become oily. As I’m doing this I plop a washcloth into my sink and run hot water over it. I know, I know, I did say you might be washing your face wrong if you used hot water but I find hot water is best when using Ultrabland. Take the warm washcloth, ring it out, and wipe your face. Typically Ultrabland leaves a very, very hydrating layer on skin well after removing it. If this makes you uncomfortable you can rinse with water and wipe your face again with the washcloth. You can also use a toner! Or if you double cleanse, obviously following up with a foaming cleanser will remove the excess Ultrabland. Personally, I don’t mind because it feels very hydrating to me. Dare I say it almost reminds me of the feeling I get when I apply my Charlotte Tilbury Magic Night Rescue Cream ! It feels quite lovely on my drier skin and unlike a majority of cleansers I never feel dry or tight after using it! But I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it for those with larger pores, acne prone skin, or oily skin. You must be wondering how it does with makeup removal at this point right? It does a great job! It breaks down eye makeup wonderfully and leaves drier eyes very well hydrated. Likewise, for facial makeup! It removes everything fairly easily. It takes a little time getting used to not using a bunch of water when washing my face but this stuff is fabulous when you’re skin is extra dry and flaky as it leaves skin super soft and smooth. Ultrabland may seem like a bland, cold cream style cleanser but I promise it’s quite wonderful! Dry skin lovers absolutely need to give it a try! Available now at Lush locations or at lush.com.

"['Lush NA Chat Party By Isabella Muse on December 5, 2007 6 Comments in Lush Tis time to party once again at Lush! Join our online festivities on Thursday, December 6th, from 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm (PST). Anyone can participate and there’s no bouncer at the door! I blogged about this earlier and you can see my original post here as it has some valuable info! Click here for that post! I have no idea what’s being offered this year in the way of Limited Edition Products, Specials, Etc…but I can say last year’s party was nice as we ended up being able to purchase Honeywood Shower Gel which was a limited edition product that smelled of Honey I Washed the Kids. Moral of the story is it’ll be nice to intend and see what sort of goodies Lush has in store for it. Lush NA Parties are in no way as wonderful as Lush UK Parties but it’s worth a wander in to see what nice products or specials are going on during the Party! Sadly, I’m unable to attain as I’m at a broker meeting most of the day Thursday but I’m hopeful I’ll make it home in time to enjoy some of the LE products if any are offered! I have a sneaking suspicion that Snowcake Shower Gel will be offered! So if you missed the Lush UK Party maybe you can nab it at the Lush NA Party!

"[""QVC Exclusive: Smashbox Halo Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder with Brush By Isabella Muse on December 4, 2007 2 Comments in Smashbox QVC has an exclusive Halo Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder bundled with a Brush for $59.94 the only problem is I don’t know what the hell that means but damn it sure sounds important! I’m sorta scratching my head wondering what Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder does! I’m also somehow oohhh’ing and ahhhhh’ing about the importance of owning Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder! It’s Hydrating and a Powder that must mean we all need it right? In all seriousness the name sort of triggered me into reading up on it and you’re going to love this……it’s paraben free! That’s one more reason to want it! It’s basically a hydrating blend of vitamins and antioxidants to provide a brighter look to your skin. I guess you can call it Smashbox’s dupe of Bare Escentuals Rare Minerals. I don’t normally like mineral foundations but the general idea of a foundation/finishing powder that’s paraben free makes me curious enough to try it! Plus it’s not too bad a deal since it’s bundled with a high quality Smashbox brush! Smashbox Halo Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder is exclusive to QVC at the moment and can be purchased using Item Number A75395. Alexander McQueen for MAC First Impressions By Isabella Muse on December 4, 2007 11 Comments in First Impressions , MAC Talk about late right? But I guess what they say is true better late then never! I’m sorry for my rather delayed McQueen impression but other items took president and I never got around to reviewing McQueen! But have no fear! I’m here now! So…..McQueen………….sadly I have to say it’s nothing to get too excited about! Aside from New Vegas a majority of the collection didn’t excite me! The glosses and lipsticks were a big no for me as most of the colors are nude and I just can’t pull off the mod look of nude lipstick! Sorry MAC! The paint pots are virtually the same colors as the shadows so I skipped those as well sadly! I’m not a big fan of the paint pots anywhere so passing these by wasn’t too big a chore! The eyeliners were gorgeous but I have just a bit too many liners at the moment so again I passed on those! So what did I get? I got the eyeshadows but I’m not particularly wow’ed by them! The colors are brilliant and quite gorgeous but they are very matte and I’m not a huge fan of matte! I did purchase these because I had in mind that the shadows would make a good base for a pigment color so that’s one use for them! Can you skip these? Yes I believe you can. A majority of the collection is still in stores (New Vegas is sold out at most counters and freestanding stores) so you can definately wander over and decide if these are for you but personally aside from the great packaging (which sells these) the shadows aren’t something you absolutely need unless you’re a big lover of mattes or a big collector of MAC. New Vegas is most definately the gem in this collection as I had previously discussed ! Now you’re going to get a few people and MA’s telling you that New Vegas is similar to all sorts of MSF. Shimpagne, Global Glow, Etc… But that’s just no the case at all. New Vegas is an utterly and completely unique color for me. It’s a very light gold and quite beautiful. How it’ll look on my skin remains to be determined as I haven’t yet tried it but it’s quite a gorgeous shimmering gold affair that I’m loving. Out of all the golds that have been released this is probably the truest light golden color of them all. Most are bronze or tannish with hints of gold but this is a true gold color that I’m just loving so if you can still locate one do drop it in your cart for a purchase! Overall, as I said, the collection isn’t all that fantastic! I personally did without a majority of it (a first for me as I’m MAC mad). Did you get any of the collection? Love it? Hate it? Tell me! Shop PBS By Isabella Muse on December 4, 2007 Leave a Comment in Philosophy , Pimpin' I’m not affiliated with or endorsing PBS but it’s a project that’s very near and dear to my heart and a little pimpin’ never hurt anyone hehe! I can remember as far back as when I was about 7 or 8 year’s old and seeing little old ladies carrying around PBS tote bags rushing for the bus! Funny as back then it was more along the lines of ewww who’d carry around a PBS tote! Now I guess I’m that little old lady because I carry mine around like it’s Prada! In all seriousness two projects that are very important to me are Animal Rescue and PBS so if by some slim chance your interested in supporting PBS you might want to wander over to their Shop PBS site and order yourself a Philosophy Tree House Hand Care Kit . The kit includes an Philosophy Apple Hand Wash and an Apple Hand Lotion. It’s $25 for the kit and you might be wondering what’s so special about this collection. The special part is your $25, 100% of it, goes to support PBS! So why not give a gift that gives? I purchased 4 of these as stocking stuffers and it pleases me that my total cost is being donated to PBS! Cheers to Philosophy for being so amazingly generous and supportive of PBS! The Gift of Perfume Oil By Isabella Muse on December 4, 2007 Leave a Comment in Fragrance You must know by now that unique gifts are always in Fashion with the Muse! I adore unique gifts and what better a gift to give then a unique perfume oil that your friends and family can call their very own! Why perfume oil? Perfume oils are normally a blend of 50% (or sometimes more) of fragrance oil to base which means they are potent, long wearing, strong, and have wonderful throw! Now your Muse has gathered together some lovely places to purchase oils from! Places I’ve tried and found true and places that have offered to gift you with a coupon code for trying them out! Sweet right? Your Muse does her best to get you good deals ? One of the first places you can score some amazing oils would be from Woobie. Woobie offers an array of Bath and Body wonders and delights but the Muse adores the perfume blends that are available! Woobie has a main catalog of scents available and special Holiday editions that change with the season! You can purchase oils at Woobie as follows: 10ML Bottles $6 5ML Bottles $3.50 Sample 5 Pack Vials for $6 Sample 10 Pack Vials for $10 I can’t begin to tell you the deal you’re getting on these!

Currently Woobie has three catagories to choose from for the Holiday Season which are Dysfunctional Holiday Oils, Holiday 2007 Blends, and the 12 Days of Christmas! I have some Dysfunctional Oils from last year and I can honestly say the names not only make me laugh but I smell amazing using these! Here is just a few of the scents available from the Dysfunctional Category: Elf Farts – The scent of short, flatulent toy builders. Apples, candied yams, marshmallows, sweet cream butter, brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and of course, fresh cloves Socks & Underwear – The dreaded holiday gift in my family. The ONE thing we asked NOT to get each holiday, and usually got it anyway. (Thanks Mom. You have scared me for life) A soft, clean scent. Slightly fruity (for those Fruit of the Loom holiday curses) Blitzed – What are the holidays without a few overly indulged relatives? This is the time of year when the best kept secrets and past mistakes are brought out into the open to argue and fude over. This blend has a touch of this, a touch of that and every bit of it is alcohol based. Lump O’Coal – Let’s face it, it is so much easier to be naughty all year. More fun, too. A naughty blend of fresh patchouli, herbal sandalwood, and hints of strawberries, raspberries, and a touch of mint and vanilla. Holiday Coma – It is always an interesting thing around our family. Presents are opened, dishes done, and everyone lays about the den with the game on the big screen. I always thought it looked like a geriatric ward. All the hustle and bustle is finally at an end as the day calmly comes to a close.Chocolate and peppermints. The lovely owner, Penny, has issued a coupon out for readers of Musings of a Muse! You can get 10% off your order by using coupon code MUSINGS.

Lush’s King of Mods and Goth Juice Hair Gel By Isabella Muse on December 3, 2007 25 Comments in Haircare , Lush Back in the Summer you might remember me babbling in excitement when Lush introduced it’s Hair Gel line. This is a first for Lush as they normally lean towards other haircare items but never styling agents! If you happen to be British or an Anglophile then you’ll be familiar with The King of Mods and Goth Juice. Goth Juice The King of Mods You might wonder who this King of Mods is. Well, it’s now a Hair Gel from Lush but it’s also a reference to the one and only Vince Noir aka Noel Fielding from The Mighty Boosh as for Goth Juice that’s a whole other story! Goth Juice, according to Vince, just happens to be the strongest hair spray known to man which is made out of the tears of Robert Smith (if you don’t know who Robert Smith is we can’t be friends anymore! Serious.). In this case Lush made Goth Juice a hair gel and not a hairspray. So after that rather long story (You’re lucky it isn’t longer as I can discuss the Mighty Boosh all day long) I want to give the King of Mods and Goth Juice a big go ahead for purchase! I wandered into Lush this weekend and I sniffed both King of Mods and Goth Juice and promptly fell in love. Sadly, I didn’t get a sec to snatch some up for my very self as I was in a bit of a rush and the Christmas crowd was vast and Herald Square Lush happens to be the size of a closet in an old Victorian house so put together a small store and a crowd and you have an unhappy Muse that’s clamoring to get out as quickly as possible! But fear not I ordered both Goth Juice and the King of Mods from Lush UK last night and I’ll do a much better review upon using both but at the moment I can give you the low down on the scent! I fear the name sold me on both as I’m a big Noel Fielding fan (and old enough to actually get the references in The Mighty Boosh) but upon actually getting a chance to sniff these I’m quite more in love than before! King of Mods reminds me of Ocean Salt a bit. It’s a crisp, citrus scent with lime and grapefruit! It’s quite lovely and fresh smelling! As for Goth Juice, yes the name was a big seller for me, but the entire idea of a herbal, earthy hair gel wasn’t too appealing but I’m happy to say that Goth Juice is a big YAY for me! It’s purple (Seriously! What color did you expect Robert Smith’s tears to be!??!) and smells alot like Jungle to me. If you use Jungle you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s a bit more earthy than Jungle but it’s a very nice herbal, earthy green scent that really is quite pleasing to the nose (I’m surprised I like it since I’m more of a fruity/sweet lover! It may just be the name that’s blinding me!). Overall, both are really gorgeous and I’m eager to see how well they work! King of Mods and Goth Juice are available for purchase from Lush for $15.95 and $14.95 and UK side for ?6.95 per pot! King of Mods, Goth Juice, The Mighty Boosh, Noel Fielding, and Robert Smith are all VERY Muse Approved (I just happened to pop in a Mighty Boosh DVD here at work as I typed this to get into the spirit of the post!)""]",b1d0fc368932a9650e40319368b671edecab14f5,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4221,
"['Cyber Colors Jewel Amour Eyeshadows By Isabella Muse on December 3, 2007 2 Comments in Asian Brands , Cyber Colors , Holiday Collections 2007 , Korean Brands Cyber Color is a Korean brand that’s pretty much available all over Asia such as Singapore, Japan, Etc… It’s a pretty inexpensive brand of cosmetic and I have some of their shadows and can say they are pretty pigmented for the price! Sasa just got in some of the new Holiday Collection Eyeshadows which are entitled Jewel Amour. I must say I am pretty tempted by these and they look yummie! Cyber Color Jewel Amour Eyeshadows Available from Sasa.com Some colors that are tempting me: Amethyst Aquamarine Peridot Citrine These are a whopping $11.30 which is quite expensive as they are about 75% cheaper if you purchase them in store but I have a funny feeling after the holidays they’ll be marked down! So as tempting as they are do wait on these if you’re wanting them as they’ll be on clearance sooner or later! Although, the colors are making me want them right now rather badly! Amazon Steals and Deals By Isabella Muse on December 3, 2007 Leave a Comment in Steals and Deals Almost every year about 30% or more of my Holiday Shopping gets done at Amazon.com I mean who doesn’t shop at Amazon right? They literally have everything and the kitchen sink! The main reason I shop at Amazon is to earn back money! Who doesn’t love to shop PLUS earn back cash! Here’s a list I’ve compiled of places to shop on Amazon that’ll earn you cash back! L’Occitane From November 6, 2007 through December 18, 2007, every purchase of $50 or more of products offered by L’Occitane will earn you a gift certificate for $15 off a future Amazon.com purchase.

"['Matching Pink FOTD By Isabella Muse on December 5, 2007 17 Comments in Face of the Day I was feeling like a really subtle pink look this morning! Here’s what I came up with (those of you who commented on my “tacky” matching you’re going to LOVE this as I’m just a matching demon today! They may have to call in the fuzz with all the pink and matching going on in this look!): What I Used: Eyes Vincent Longo Wet Diamond Eyeshadow in Sparkling White Urban Decay Eyeshadow in Kiss Urban Decay Eyeshadow in SWF RMK Eyeshadow Metallic Eyeshadow in 11 Urban Decay Heavy Metal Eyeliner in Groupie Beaute de Kose Volumizing Mascara Face Clio Blush in Pink 2 Lips Urban Decay Lip Envy Envious Smashbox Lipgloss in Radiant Extra Bonus of me rocking my pink Converses (Don’t mind by baggy slacks! I was reliving my youth today and baggy punk pants was the way to go!) Do you love it? Why is it whenever I wear a pair of Converse my feet look like boats? Serious my entire foot looks like a caddy! I wear a size 7-8 (5-6 UK) depending on the shoe and these just happen to be a size 7 (6 UK) yet my feet look about the size of a small country! Serious I can use these things as weapons and hurt someone really bad if I’m not careful! What’s that old saying? Wear the boxes, throw away the shoes? I even own a custom pair that’s a size 6 1/2 (4 UK) and STILL the bloody things make my feet look like a monster! Now I know how Paris Hilton feels! I can’t begin to tell you how many pairs line my closet yet I can’t help but feel like the Jolly Green Giant every time I wear a pair! They don’t make David’s foot look monstrous! I don’t get it! Note to Self: Become Lean, Lanky, and Sexy to work a Converse Sneaker! Converse if you’re listening make hightop sneakers more flattering for chicks with small feet! Thanks! Love you! MY GOD! ATTACK OF THE KILLER SIZE 7’s!!!!!!!!!!!!! NARS Travel Brush Set By Isabella Muse on December 5, 2007 5 Comments in Nars I love you NARS. Truly I do! Your blushes, your glosses, your gorgeous shadows…! But….this……..is not happening: Pretty right? Price is not so pretty! $170 for a mini travel size brush set is beyond my budget! I wonder if this is a misprint? If you’re insane, unstable, or just obsessed with NARS you can purchase this NARS Travel Brush Set from Nordies for $170 (brushes that may or may not be dipped in solid gold). Lush NA Chat Party By Isabella Muse on December 5, 2007 6 Comments in Lush Tis time to party once again at Lush! Join our online festivities on Thursday, December 6th, from 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm (PST). Anyone can participate and there’s no bouncer at the door! I blogged about this earlier and you can see my original post here as it has some valuable info! Click here for that post! I have no idea what’s being offered this year in the way of Limited Edition Products, Specials, Etc…but I can say last year’s party was nice as we ended up being able to purchase Honeywood Shower Gel which was a limited edition product that smelled of Honey I Washed the Kids. Moral of the story is it’ll be nice to intend and see what sort of goodies Lush has in store for it. Lush NA Parties are in no way as wonderful as Lush UK Parties but it’s worth a wander in to see what nice products or specials are going on during the Party! Sadly, I’m unable to attain as I’m at a broker meeting most of the day Thursday but I’m hopeful I’ll make it home in time to enjoy some of the LE products if any are offered! I have a sneaking suspicion that Snowcake Shower Gel will be offered! So if you missed the Lush UK Party maybe you can nab it at the Lush NA Party! Click here for the exact details, times, and more about this the party! Jill Stuart Christmas Coffret 2007 First Impressions By Isabella Muse on December 5, 2007 5 Comments in First Impressions , Holiday Collections 2007 , Japanese Brands , Jill Stuart I got my Jill Stuart Christmas Coffret a few days ago. I had promised myself I wouldn’t bother with it but I must say I am happy I went ahead and purchased it because it’s quite gorgeous! My favorite item out of the gift set is the very cute satin pouch it came with! It’s really roomy and just gorgeous for storing little treasures in! I love this! The coffret isn’t anything to write home about to be honest. It did include some great items but it’s nothing you absolutely need so if you missed out buying this rest assured you’ll be fine and won’t die of lemming. I promise. The set also included Shimmer Tint Face Gloss which is scented with a beautiful rose. The gloss comes in a mirrored compact that slides easily opened and closed. Very nice item but pointless a bit as it’s a balm and I don’t particularly care for using balms on my face. Jill Stuart Shimmer Tint Face Gloss The lipgloss included is a gorgeous shimmering red color which is quite nice. Packaging wise it’s very beautiful with the standard jewel look of all Jill Stuart glosses. As I said the color is gorgeous but I’m slightly worried about the applicator. It comes with a sponge applicator but it doesn’t appear to pick up much product upon first look! This remains to be seen as I have to smooth some on my lips before judging fully! Jill Stuart Lipgloss in Rose Gleam You’ll also get a cuticle oil which also comes in the gorgeous Jill Stuart packaging with the gem encrusted topper! This is something the Muse can really use as her cuticles are in terrible shape in the winter! Jill Stuart Cuticle Oil Another favorite of mine is the scented choker! It’s quite a nice choker and they give you plenty of ribbon with it so you can tie in snugly around your neck with a bit hanging down for a nice effect! It’s quite a pretty piece! And finally last but never least would be the Brilliance Eyes Palette in the special Christmas packaging! This is a lace palette with ribbon and quite lovely! If you’re a collector of the Brilliance palettes this will be something you’ll definately appreciate! I somehow fail to get excited about these palettes as the colors tend to leans towards the same thing over and over. The only colors in this palette that really shout at me and are “new’ish” would be the pinky rose color and the bright yellow. The other two shades are similar to what I already have in previous Jill Stuart palettes. This is not to say that the palette isn’t lovely because it truly is but I do wish that they’d release some newer shades! Jill Stuart Brilliance Eyes Palette Christmas Edition Overall, a beautiful Coffret from Jill Stuart this year but I’d say you can safely skip it unless you’re a die hard collector and fan! It’s beautiful yes but nothing to get too hyped over! Urban Decay Limited Edition Shattered Collection By Isabella Muse on December 5, 2007 6 Comments in Urban Decay I think Urban Decay is half-baked. First of all I can’t begin to tell you what a big Urban Decay fan I am! I love, love, love the brand! But today I’m just feeling confused. They sent me an E-mail this afternoon trying to get me all hyped about their new Limited Edition Shattered Collection! MY GOD Only 50 are being made!!!!!!!!!!!!! Um… So? What’s the point? It contains nothing that’s LE. Urban Decay’s Limited Edition Shattered Collection (Only 50 are being made! My god get yours NOW before it’s too late!) The collection includes a mini primer potion, Shattered Eyeshadow, Glitter Eyeliner in Air Guitar, and a mini 24/7 eyeliner pencil! The price is nice sure but I’m wondering why only 50 are being made and why it’s so highly limited edition? When you think about it you’re not really getting that big a deal. Glitter liners are $18 each anyway and so are UD Shadows. So what they threw in a mini eye pencil and a small primer potion! Hell, if you want you can pick up Shattered and Air Guitar any day of the week! I’m so confused. Almost as confused as I was when Sephora decided to throw me that curve ball with the Colorful Story Palette! Didn’t hear about that? Click here for the details! I’m clueless as bloody hell so Jeers to you Urban Decay! You’re obviously smoking from the same pipe as Sephora! What the hell?']",a02a756a87e490ed860cbc5d8d839d9085806e7d,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4219,
"[""Lush UK Party Order featurning Snowcake Shower Gel By Isabella Muse on December 5, 2007 8 Comments in Hauls , Lush YAY! Today I got home after a really, really, really, did I mention really? stressful day at work and my Lush UK had arrived! I did a little dance in my hallway and proceeded to lug my big box upstairs to my washroom to rip into it! Thankfully everything arrived safe and sound as the postal people like to play football with airmail! If you have no idea what I’m so excited about it you can read my previous post by clicking here for the details and history behind this order! If you ordered during the UK party your order should be with you this week (Unless you have Retro items in your order! If you do your order may take a tad bit longer!)! I’m vaguely surprised it took this long as normally UK Party orders are pretty quick but I think they got overwhelmed with Lush Retro orders thus the wait time! Anyway it’s here now and that’s the important part! I ended up ordering 7 Bottles of Snowcake Shower Gel and a Retro Hatbox for myself! Yes, you read it correctly. FOR MYSELF! No way on God’s green Earth am I sharing this shower gel with anyone! It’s far to fabulous and can only grace my shower stall (the rest will be carefully locked in the beauty vault). Lots of Snowcake Shower Gel to keep a Muse smelling yummie! What’s so fab about Snowcake Shower Gel? Go read my ode to Snowcake and you’ll understand the importance of it ( Click here for that story ). Snowcake Shower Gel is exactly the same scent as the soap (and Smitten hand cream)! It’s gorgeous! I sampled some by washing my hands with it and it’s super thick, creamy, and smelling of marzipan, almonds, and all good things Lush! I may tip the bottle and pour some into my mouth! When my 7 bottles are gone I’ll mourn it’s lost in a major way! Yummie Snowcake Shower Gel I also got myself a Retro Hatbox which was offered during the party! I can’t begin to say how freaking chuffed I am with the Retro Hatbox. For one thing it was cheap as day old chips and for the other it’s filled with long gone Lush that I truly miss and I’m happy to see back for a rerun! I’ll be savoring all these goodies while they last! I was going to order two of these but at the last minute I decided one would have to do but I regret that now! Oh well! My GIANT Retro Hatbox waiting for me to open it! Pretty! Ribbons off! Time to dive in! YAY! Time to dig in! If you’re old hat to Lush you’ll recognize some of the goodies that make a return in this Hatbox! Content Menu of the Retro Hatbox Soooooooooo the hatbox had a Snowcake Shower Gel in it…la da da da da…yup that brings my count up to eight hehe! It also contained one each of the following items: Noriko Soap Oh how long it’s been since I seen your delightful self make an appearance! Christmas’s have come and gone since Noriko’s return! A delightful Christmas soap! Silent White Bath Bomb Another blast from the past but this has been cropping up during other parties so I haven’t been in too much withdrawal for it! Jack Froth Bath Bomb Sigh….I miss you Jack! Jack hasn’t been around for Christmas in ages! Brand Butter Bath Bomb Another wonderfully warm bomb that has failed to make an appearance in years! I’m so happy to have it back! Ghost Writer Bath Bomb This little guy I don’t recall but I’m happy to have him and try it! And finally a favorite of mine Hot Toddy Bubble Bar Slice which hasn’t been around for quite a while as well and I can’t begin to say how happy it’ll be making a guest starring appearance in my bath tub soon! The hatbox cost about $60USD or so and was an absolute STEAL! If you nabbed one during the party fantastic! If not you really missed out on something special! All of the items are packed in a gorgeous reusable hatbox (I use mine to store tarts, bath products, etc…)! Contents of my Hatbox! [email protected] @K Snowcake Shower Gel! The hatbox was filled with Lush’s new packaging….POPCORN! Lush is always environmentally friendly so popcorn is there way of “going naked”! It keeps all your goodies safe and sound plus you can dump it out and feed it to the birds after! No waste! Yay Lush for being so sensitive to Mother Earth! Click here to check out one of the Muse’s favorite blog’s for more information about packaging (you can also check out Mandy crushing mighty hard on Mark! No comment!)! POPCORN! The Muse highly suggest NOT eating the popcorn! It’s infused with Lush smell thus making it soapy popcorn! But she does recommend taking it to your local park, outside your yard, or to a duck pond and feeding it to some birds! The fine people at Lush UK were kind enough to pack a Lush Times in with my order! Oooo Lush Times! (So much better than Lush Times NA) Pretty Christmas Lush! Ooooo Lush Christmas Pressies! My little eye spies some B at the top! Much to my utter delight (This couldn’t come at a better time considering yesterday’s Goth Juice and King of Mods post was so popular with the masses! Click here for details! ) there was an article and picture of Noel Fielding! The article reads as follows: Give Yourself a Mighty Boosh One story about programme’s name is that someone from Birmingham accent saw Michael Fielding (Naboo, Noel’s brother) and remarked about his hair that he had a mighty bush (pronouced boosh, obviously). We’re not so sure. Anyway, it seemed like an irresistible twist of fate; our hair styling products should naturally be named after a programme named after a hair style. Then the Boosh team heard what Lush had done and made Mark Constantine an honorary member of the Boosh Fan Club, the Mod Wolves. (Auntie P had to pay, which seemed like yet one of the many injustices that the cruel world chooses to mete out sometimes. But meh, who cares?) That’s how come Adelle from the press office was an extra on set for series three. The Japanese Lush team love it to bits! Vist the world of Boosh at www.themightboosh.com and watch clips on www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/mightyboosh/ (If you’re not getting the bit about Birmingham accents….the Muse recommends Google or youTube!) LOOK! It’s Noel in the latest Lush Times! Tame your Mighty Boosh with Lush’s New Hair Gels! I won’t ruin too much of the surprise but if you ordered from the UK Party you’ll also receive a happy accident bubble bar from the Lush UK Mailorder Team! I won’t reveal the scent but it is a happy little accident to have a delightful free gift from Mailorder! Thanks guys for always making UK ordering so special! A Happy Accident Bubble Bar! What it smells like? I won’t reveal! A mystery to be solved when you get yours! Thanks to Hilary for arranging a great party! Thanks to Lynsey for getting my items to me safe and sound! And big hugs to everyone at Lush UK! Love you guys! Guest FOTD: Brilliant Sorceress By Isabella Muse on December 4, 2007 5 Comments in Guest Face of the Day Looks The Muse happens to be good mates with the RocketQueen and she was kind enough to send over a superb FOTD that I am absolutely gagging over! It’s gorgeous! Of course, the Rocketqueen is the beautiful one not the makeup but I must say she did an outstanding job duplicating the Brilliant Sorceress look from this year’s Sephora Holiday Catalog! So without further babbling from me I present the Rocketqueen in all her glory: Is this girl beautiful (inside and out might I add) or what? The Rocketqueen mistakenly told the Muse that it would be a great honor if I posted her FOTD on my site. The fact of the matter is the Rocketqueen is honoring the Muse by allowing her to share this lovely FOTD with all of you! Thanks for the great FOTD Linn! The Muse loves you! See more FOTD’s, Product Reviews, and much more at the Rocketqueen’s blog! Visit her by clicking here. JPMon Ordering Tutorial By Isabella Muse on December 4, 2007 30 Comments in Japanese Brands , Reader's Request , Tutorials I’ve been remiss and I promised a JPMon Tutorial ages ago! Sometimes life has way of catching up on me and I don’t always have time to complete what I say I will! Apologies guys ? So here’s the JPMon Tutorial as requested by a lovely girl by the name of Taryn and quite a few other people that have commented, e-mailed, and asked after it! If you’re not familiar with JPMon it’s an online shop that carries many fine Japanese and Asian cosmetics, skincare, and other bits and bobs! This tutorial is making the assumption you already have an account with JPMon so it’s basically a tutorial to do the actual ordering! All items on JPMon are priced in the Taiwan New Dollar so please when converting don’t do so in Yen, SGD, or HKD. If you use any of these currencies you’re going to get the wrong conversion amount please convert from TND to your chosen currency be it USD, Sterling, Euro, Etc… Shipping is fairly good at JPMon and the most I’ve every paid was about $40USD for a rather large package of items. Your total cost is displayed prior to clicking submit so convert prior to submitting so you can break down your shipping costs and see if it’s worth the hassle of ordering. Items are shipped via EMS which means they arrive SUPER fast! If you’ve had my beloved friend Iris do CP’s for you you’ll know how quickly EMS arrives. I’d say within 3 days you’ll have your goods if you’re within the US! I’m unsure about Europe, Asia, or elsewhere in the world! You’ll also notice that what you spend at JPMon is almost what you’d spend on a CP from the gorgeous Iris plus shipping so it works out almost as if you’re making a trip to a Japanese Drugstore yourself! JPMon employees do speak English so if you have concerns or questions about your order you can contact them at this address [email protected] I strongly and highly recommend shooting them over a polite e-mail enquiring about your order after placing it. I normally write a short note saying ‘Hello I just placed an order and I don’t read Chinese could you please check over my order and be sure you have my shipping address and everything else you need to process!” I also include my order number with this E-mail so they’ll have no problem looking it up! Normally within seconds of placing an order you’ll receive a order confirmation which contains your order number use it to contact them! I’ve ordered from JPMon many times without any problems but it’s always good to cover all your bases and make sure things are running smooth. As I said earlier the following tutorial makes the big assumption you already have an account with JPMon! I normally wing my orders with JPMon. I don’t read or speak Chinese so the very first time I ordered I was unable to get in contact with any friends and I was impatient so I winged my order and have used the very same system when ordering since! I did have a bit of a problem with one part which was quickly redeemed by asking a lovely girl on Cozy! So here’s my winged version of ordering (I promise it’ll work for you too and you’ll soon have your Japanese Cosmetic fix safely arriving at your doorstep!): The images can be enlarged by clicking on them! Here we are www.jpmon.com ready to shop till we drop! Step 1 Ok as an example I just added all of the MJ Collection to my cart! Obviously it’s easy enough to add items to the cart! It has a little symbol of a cart! Click it and boom it’s in your bag! You’ll notice a little pop up window each time you add something to your cart don’t worry all it says is that you added so and so product to your cart! Below I am pointing out where the contents of your cart can be located! Just click that little pink box and it’ll show you your items that you are ready to purchase! Step 2 If you scroll down a bit from your order details you’ll see three boxes with pull down menus! Guess what!? I have no idea what the first one says! I’ve completely forgot but I do know you have to select the MIDDLE option! That much I remember hehehe! So select the middle option and move on to the next set of drop down menus! Step 3 Ok so here we are on the next drop down menu and this basically gives you shipping options! The only option you can choose is EMS so drop down the menu and select EMS for your shipping! Step 4 Next drop down menu is where you are located! I happen to live in the US (although I’d rather be in the UK) so I choose USA as my location! So far so good! Piece of cake right? A monkey can do it! Step 5 Scroll down a little and you’ll see a cute little item being advertised! What’s this?!?! It’s your free gift! JPmon gives away little kawaii items with all orders and they normally advertise what’s free when you’re processing your order! In this case it looks like some sort of My Melody Keychain or Cell Phone Strap! See the button below the free gift? Click it! Step 6 Ok now we start winging things and making it up as we go along! Are you excited? I’m excited! The first box is asking you to enter your name! My name happens to be Jane Doe for this order! Next box is asking for your phone number, I dunno what the next box is asking for but it’s obviously not mandatory as it’s white and not yellow like the rest so skip it! Box below that needs your e-mail addy so type it in and away you go! Zip Code is next, now your street number and address and after that your City and State, and finally USA should already be filled out for your country! New set of boxes below that is pretty much the same deal! Here’s what you want in those boxes: First and Last Name Phone Number Zip Code Street Number and Name State and City Country And finally the last box which makes absolutely no sense to me but they basically want your bank info! This is basically where I wing it! I normally put Visa in the first box (If I’m paying with Visa), in the second box I put the issuing bank. If you have no idea what the issuing bank of your card is just fib it and say Bank of America or something else, and finally it’s asking for the phone number associated with the card. Make one up or use the one on the back of your card! Step 7 As you can see I put in a small note asking them to contact me should they need further information! This normally works a treat however I strongly suggest NOT doing this as sometimes it gives an error. So leave the comment field empty and e-mail them later as I explained earlier in the post! Again, LEAVE the comment field EMPTY as it causes errors sometimes so just click that sweet little red button and you’re almost done now! Step 8 A new box will pop up asking you to enter your Credit Card details so this is easy enough! Enter your card number Enter your expiration date and finally enter your security code located on the back of the card Step 9 Now with your credit card entered click on the green button on the left hand side and we are almost done now! Step 10 Your screen may blank a sec and you’ll see a transaction is processing image! Don’t touch anything while this is happening! Let it do what it’s doing! Give it some air, remove your hand from the mouse, don’t move or speak or breath! Just kidding you can breath but don’t move ok? Step 11 DONE! You should be taken back to the original JPMon website! This is when I normally check to be sure my order is safe! Click above your shopping card and it’ll take you to your “order history”. You should see your order there! And last by not least check your email there should be your confirmation waiting for you! Presto! You’re done! Wait 3 days (or a bit more since the Holiday may have slowed up mail) and you should have some lovely goodies in your box! That’s it kids! Cheers and hope this helps!

Will do so shortly! Keep Your Skincare On Ice By Isabella Muse on December 4, 2007 2 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Skincare I admit that I own a mini fridge that I store my skincare items in. A majority of my skincare items are Lush which means they are quite fresh and have an expiration date of a year or six months. I find refrigerating them keeps them fresher and long lasting (either that or I’m anal about what I put on my face). You can read about my skincare regime by clicking here . About two years ago I purchased a mini fridge from Think Geek for a small chunk of change (I only keep skincare and cosmetics in it NOT food and drinks) however for $225 you can get a mini cooler that’s made exclusively for your skincare! Check this out: I’m geeky enough to think this is awesome! Check out what it promises to do: Prevents bacteria from forming Lets products function as they were intended Products in cooler become ionized Prevents dust and debris from adhering to the products Keeps Perfumes, Skin Care and Makeup Fresh You can get the same features from any fridge really but the general idea of having such a compact unit to fit on my vanity counter is awesome as the fridge I currently have is quite a bit bigger (and ugly) and I have it stashed in my washroom closet. $225 is a ridiculous amount to pay but the idea is great!

Sasa just got in some of the new Holiday Collection Eyeshadows which are entitled Jewel Amour. I must say I am pretty tempted by these and they look yummie! Cyber Color Jewel Amour Eyeshadows Available from Sasa.com Some colors that are tempting me: Amethyst Aquamarine Peridot Citrine These are a whopping $11.30 which is quite expensive as they are about 75% cheaper if you purchase them in store but I have a funny feeling after the holidays they’ll be marked down! So as tempting as they are do wait on these if you’re wanting them as they’ll be on clearance sooner or later! Although, the colors are making me want them right now rather badly!

"['Lush’s King of Mods and Goth Juice Hair Gel By Isabella Muse on December 3, 2007 25 Comments in Haircare , Lush Back in the Summer you might remember me babbling in excitement when Lush introduced it’s Hair Gel line. This is a first for Lush as they normally lean towards other haircare items but never styling agents! If you happen to be British or an Anglophile then you’ll be familiar with The King of Mods and Goth Juice. Goth Juice The King of Mods You might wonder who this King of Mods is. Well, it’s now a Hair Gel from Lush but it’s also a reference to the one and only Vince Noir aka Noel Fielding from The Mighty Boosh as for Goth Juice that’s a whole other story! Goth Juice, according to Vince, just happens to be the strongest hair spray known to man which is made out of the tears of Robert Smith (if you don’t know who Robert Smith is we can’t be friends anymore! Serious.). In this case Lush made Goth Juice a hair gel and not a hairspray. So after that rather long story (You’re lucky it isn’t longer as I can discuss the Mighty Boosh all day long) I want to give the King of Mods and Goth Juice a big go ahead for purchase! I wandered into Lush this weekend and I sniffed both King of Mods and Goth Juice and promptly fell in love. Sadly, I didn’t get a sec to snatch some up for my very self as I was in a bit of a rush and the Christmas crowd was vast and Herald Square Lush happens to be the size of a closet in an old Victorian house so put together a small store and a crowd and you have an unhappy Muse that’s clamoring to get out as quickly as possible! But fear not I ordered both Goth Juice and the King of Mods from Lush UK last night and I’ll do a much better review upon using both but at the moment I can give you the low down on the scent! I fear the name sold me on both as I’m a big Noel Fielding fan (and old enough to actually get the references in The Mighty Boosh) but upon actually getting a chance to sniff these I’m quite more in love than before! King of Mods reminds me of Ocean Salt a bit. It’s a crisp, citrus scent with lime and grapefruit! It’s quite lovely and fresh smelling! As for Goth Juice, yes the name was a big seller for me, but the entire idea of a herbal, earthy hair gel wasn’t too appealing but I’m happy to say that Goth Juice is a big YAY for me! It’s purple (Seriously! What color did you expect Robert Smith’s tears to be!??!) and smells alot like Jungle to me. If you use Jungle you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s a bit more earthy than Jungle but it’s a very nice herbal, earthy green scent that really is quite pleasing to the nose (I’m surprised I like it since I’m more of a fruity/sweet lover! It may just be the name that’s blinding me!). Overall, both are really gorgeous and I’m eager to see how well they work! King of Mods and Goth Juice are available for purchase from Lush for $15.95 and $14.95 and UK side for ?6.95 per pot! King of Mods, Goth Juice, The Mighty Boosh, Noel Fielding, and Robert Smith are all VERY Muse Approved (I just happened to pop in a Mighty Boosh DVD here at work as I typed this to get into the spirit of the post!)

"['The Gift of Perfume Oil By Isabella Muse on December 4, 2007 Leave a Comment in Fragrance You must know by now that unique gifts are always in Fashion with the Muse! I adore unique gifts and what better a gift to give then a unique perfume oil that your friends and family can call their very own! Why perfume oil? Perfume oils are normally a blend of 50% (or sometimes more) of fragrance oil to base which means they are potent, long wearing, strong, and have wonderful throw! Now your Muse has gathered together some lovely places to purchase oils from! Places I’ve tried and found true and places that have offered to gift you with a coupon code for trying them out! Sweet right? Your Muse does her best to get you good deals ? One of the first places you can score some amazing oils would be from Woobie. Woobie offers an array of Bath and Body wonders and delights but the Muse adores the perfume blends that are available! Woobie has a main catalog of scents available and special Holiday editions that change with the season! You can purchase oils at Woobie as follows: 10ML Bottles $6 5ML Bottles $3.50 Sample 5 Pack Vials for $6 Sample 10 Pack Vials for $10 I can’t begin to tell you the deal you’re getting on these!

Here is just a few of the scents available from the Dysfunctional Category: Elf Farts – The scent of short, flatulent toy builders. Apples, candied yams, marshmallows, sweet cream butter, brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and of course, fresh cloves Socks & Underwear – The dreaded holiday gift in my family. The ONE thing we asked NOT to get each holiday, and usually got it anyway. (Thanks Mom. You have scared me for life) A soft, clean scent. Slightly fruity (for those Fruit of the Loom holiday curses) Blitzed – What are the holidays without a few overly indulged relatives? This is the time of year when the best kept secrets and past mistakes are brought out into the open to argue and fude over. This blend has a touch of this, a touch of that and every bit of it is alcohol based. Lump O’Coal – Let’s face it, it is so much easier to be naughty all year. More fun, too. A naughty blend of fresh patchouli, herbal sandalwood, and hints of strawberries, raspberries, and a touch of mint and vanilla. Holiday Coma – It is always an interesting thing around our family. Presents are opened, dishes done, and everyone lays about the den with the game on the big screen. I always thought it looked like a geriatric ward. All the hustle and bustle is finally at an end as the day calmly comes to a close.Chocolate and peppermints. The lovely owner, Penny, has issued a coupon out for readers of Musings of a Muse!

"[""Shop PBS By Isabella Muse on December 4, 2007 Leave a Comment in Philosophy , Pimpin' I’m not affiliated with or endorsing PBS but it’s a project that’s very near and dear to my heart and a little pimpin’ never hurt anyone hehe! I can remember as far back as when I was about 7 or 8 year’s old and seeing little old ladies carrying around PBS tote bags rushing for the bus! Funny as back then it was more along the lines of ewww who’d carry around a PBS tote! Now I guess I’m that little old lady because I carry mine around like it’s Prada! In all seriousness two projects that are very important to me are Animal Rescue and PBS so if by some slim chance your interested in supporting PBS you might want to wander over to their Shop PBS site and order yourself a Philosophy Tree House Hand Care Kit . The kit includes an Philosophy Apple Hand Wash and an Apple Hand Lotion. It’s $25 for the kit and you might be wondering what’s so special about this collection. The special part is your $25, 100% of it, goes to support PBS! So why not give a gift that gives? I purchased 4 of these as stocking stuffers and it pleases me that my total cost is being donated to PBS! Cheers to Philosophy for being so amazingly generous and supportive of PBS!

I’m sorta scratching my head wondering what Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder does! I’m also somehow oohhh’ing and ahhhhh’ing about the importance of owning Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder! It’s Hydrating and a Powder that must mean we all need it right? In all seriousness the name sort of triggered me into reading up on it and you’re going to love this……it’s paraben free! That’s one more reason to want it! It’s basically a hydrating blend of vitamins and antioxidants to provide a brighter look to your skin. I guess you can call it Smashbox’s dupe of Bare Escentuals Rare Minerals. I don’t normally like mineral foundations but the general idea of a foundation/finishing powder that’s paraben free makes me curious enough to try it! Plus it’s not too bad a deal since it’s bundled with a high quality Smashbox brush!

Happy Shopping! Beauty on a Budget: mark Glossblossom Ripening Lip Tint By Isabella Muse on December 10, 2007 2 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Mark Here’s an inexpensive gloss I actually LOVE! It’s so difficult to find a cheap gloss that’s actually good but mark Glossblossom wins both the inexpensive and great award! The gloss itself is actually clear and it basically makes the same promise as Smashbox’s O-Glow in that it’ll transform into your perfect pink upon application! I personally don’t find it very pigmented and on my lips it mostly looks clear not pink however don’t let that change your mind it’s actually quite good! You might remember when I did my review on Bourjois Paris Eau de Gloss if not click here and read! The reason I’m bringing up Eau de Gloss is because Glossblossom is similar in texture. The base of the gloss is quite like water and it’s super slick and super glossy minus the tacky, stickiness of other glosses I’ve tried. It basically feels like I’m spreading water on my lips, it’s very moisturizing! When I have this on I feel like I have nothing on which for me is a plus as I hate my lips to feel all gross and sticky and most glosses always make me feel that way! I love this over lipstick, lipstains, or to wear by itself. It’s quite long wearing too! I know some people had mentioned they had experienced problems with Eau de Gloss in that it slid off and wasn’t as long wearing as it promised however I find Glossblossom lasts a good 4-5 hours (minus drinking of course) before it’s gone completely! It also has a very subtle, delightful little fruit flavor to it (nothing overpowering! Just a little hint of fruit). This is a total favorite item of mine and I have these little tubes stuffed in my desk draw and purse for touch ups! Plus it’s cheap as day old chips at $6 (but you can get it cheaper! I get mine off of E-bay for $3.50-$3.99). Glossblossom is Muse approved for purchase! Shu Uemura Gloss Lacquer Gift Set By Isabella Muse on December 7, 2007 7 Comments in Shu Uemura Shu Uemura has gifted us with a trio of Gloss Lacquer’s for $69! Behold, the Shu Uemura Gloss Lacquer Gift Set: You’ll get three Gloss Lacquer’s and a makeup pouch! The Muse likey alot! Read the Muse’s review on Shu’s Gloss Lacquer’s by clicking here ! Lush Party NA Did you attend? By Isabella Muse on December 7, 2007 2 Comments in Lush So did anyone go to the Lush NA online chat party last night (No idea what I’m talking about? Click here for details! )? Sadly, I was unable to attend as I got home really, really, really late after a longggggggggggggggggg day at broker meetings! Snore, Yawn, Boring! I wish I could say that I had even a second to log in and partake but sadly it was a no go for me! I did wander over to the website and it appears nothing of great interested was offered aside from Snowcake Solid Perfume. Other then that nothing really, super special or limited got made! Did you attend? Did you order? Tell the Muse! If you missed out like me here’s a break down of what was offered (and appears to still be available for purchase): Ol’ Blue Skies Shower Gel $15.95USD Ol’ Blue Skies Shower Gel is back (If you’re new to Lush this was a shower gel that was introduced last year for Christmas last year and when the new Christmas goodies were released for this year’s Holiday Season, Ol’ Blue Skies, was not part of the line up! So…here it is if you want it but I personally suggest steering clear unless you adore deep earthy scents!)! I’m not excited. It has patchouli in it which means it smells like just turned dirt. I’ll skip. Snowcake Solid Perfume $11.95 (or FREE! Use Code SCENTME to get it Free if you spend $65 or more on your Lush order) Snowcake Solid Perfume wahooo! The perfume solids were introduced way before the Holiday goodies this year so when the Holiday releases popped up the only solid that was “holiday” themed was Champagne Snow Showers! Much to my dismay and fans everywhere we wondered what could have happened to the idea of having a Snowcake Solid Perfume! Well…here it be ladies! I was faced with the dilemma of ordering from Lush from the US this morning as Lush UK does not carry Snowcake Solid Perfume! It was released special for the party! Ol’ Blue Eyes Pack $36.95USD If you adore smelling dirt with a bit of oranges thrown in this would be a great pack for you! You’ll get Ol’ Blue Skies Shower Gel, Blue Skies and Fluffy Clouds Bubble Bar, Karma Bubble Bar, and Karma Soap! Ooooo all the Muse’s favorites! NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love Snowcake Pack $34.95USD I don’t have to remind you how much I love Snowcake we’ve already been through it enough already right? In honor of the chat party a lovely pack was made up which consists of all good things Snowcake scented! You’ll get Snowcake Solid Perfume, Lush Pud Bath Bomb, Smitten Handcream, and a chunk of Snowcake Soap! Sweet! Sadly, nothing at all to get too hyped over!']",234c963f25aeecb5f442d715cb6985cc4bdc12cf,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4217,

"['Smashbox Photo Finish Hydrating Foundation Review By Isabella Muse on September 9, 2011 10 Comments in Facial Primer , Fall Collections 2011 , Smashbox , Swatches I wanna say that Smashbox is one of the first primers I ever really took note of on the makeup market, it’s also probably one of my first remembered primer experiences. And it also turned me off to primers for a really long time. Personally I’m kinda sorta amazed how many people love it as I’ve only ever experience itchy joy from it after application plus it’s always had a knack for pilling…just an overall awful product in my opinion. And I know I’m not alone here as many of you have felt the same way and all I can say is it’s about damn time that Smashbox created a hydrating primer! Jump! A hydrating foundation primer. This is amazing stuff particularly if you have dry skin. Dry skin has a petulance for aging very quickly which is why you want to keep it as hydrated as possible plus makeup in general looks cleaner, fresher, and more beautiful with proper hydration. I, sadly, have super dry skin and need as much help as I can get in the moisturizer department. I don’t have larger pores so I really don’t need a silicone based primer and I tend to favor more hydrating ones thus Smashbox Photo Finishing Hydrating Primer was the ticket for me. Although I already own hundreds of hydrating primers I felt like it was a mission to check this one out after knowing, trying, and understanding the drama that comes along with the regular Photo Finish Primer. This comes in a 1 oz squeeze tube and is a crystal clear sky blue shade but applies clear. I’m happy Smashbox is tubin’ it lately as the pump packaging just isn’t my deal and I find a squeeze tube easier and alot less hassle (excuse my swatches as my arm is a bit pink…ha was swatching blush prior to doing this review and my arm is still looking all kinds of strange). The formula is exactly what you’d expect from a hydrating primer. It’s cool, refreshing, and incredibly lightweight. It’s not SUPER moisturizing but it’s not supposed to be. It offers a lightweight way to quench dry skin with an oil-free formula. They dub it as a great way to fill fine lines and pores….I wouldn’t personally go so far as to say that a texture like this will fill pores but it’s likely you probably don’t have larger pores if you have dry skin. The key feature of the product is the fact it seals moisture in. I find it leaves my skin pleasantly hydrated and ever so slightly dewy throughout the day. This is important to me as the drier the skin my gets, the duller it becomes so having a primer that keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day is definitely a good thing. There are a few quirks… I do not like the near $42 price tag. Regular Photo Finish Primers are $38 why the price up on the hydrating version? For 1 oz, near $50 is a little bit too much to pay however, for some odd reason, $38 sounds a bit more reasonable. It doesn’t actually keep my foundation long wearing but it does keep my foundation fresher which is just as important as wear time. Anyone seeking a hydrating primer versus a silicone. Those with smaller pores. Those seeking a primer to keep their drier skin moist. Those with dull skin in need of a primer to keep their skin hydrated to ease a lackluster complexion. Those wanting a primer to keep their foundation long wearing. Those wanting a primer to mask larger pores or fine lines. Those who aren’t willing to go for $42 for a mere 1 oz primer. Smashbox Photo Finish Hydrating Primer has one major quirk, the price tag…but outside of that it proves a very good primer. It won’t make your foundation last all day and it won’t blur finer lines or pores but it will keep dry skin pleasantly hydrated through the day and keep foundation fresh looking and flawless. I thought it was an ickle costly but I have to say, that this one, needs a Muse Approval particularly for the dry skin chicas out there. I’m liking it and I see myself indulging again when this one runs out! Available now from Smashbox.com and Sephora.com Have you tried it? Love it? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"['Guest Review: Smashbox Halo Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder By Isabella Muse on February 20, 2008 14 Comments in Guest Review , Smashbox Ok special treat for you guys today! I have a guest reviewer for the new Smashbox Halo Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder! You may recall I blogged about this a few weeks ago if you missed it have a click over here to view my original post! I didn’t pick this up for myself but I was seriously curious which is why I’m happy that Adina had commented and said she got it! We arranged to have her review it since she purchased it and I’m happy to say I’m currently lemming this thanks to Adina fab review and FOTD using it! It really have a nice flawless appearance to her skin! I think it’d make a great finishing powder or for more fuller coverage if you desire! Adina’s skin type is normal with some oily bits in the T-Zone Area and of course like me dryer in the winter months! Without further babble from me here’s Adina’s review on the Smashbox Halo Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder! Hello out there blog-reading beauties. Adina (a.k.a Krasevayadancer) here doing a guest post review on the Smashbox Halo Hydrating Perfecting Face Powder with Brush which is currently only being offered on QVC. I know I have been tempted to purchase this ever since I happened to catch glimpses of the product on QVC. The lemming became too strong for me to handle and I gave in to those little voices telling me to make the purchase about 1 week ago.I picked up this little baby in the light color option (while I am pale, i am luckily not ghostly enough for the porcelain option) What it claims to do: A face-perfecting powder and brush duo. The powder contains a hydrating blend of vitamins and antioxidants. The built in shaver allows for the convenience of a pressed powder with the radiant finish of a loose one. The super-sized brush deposits perfect amount of powder every time. The revolutionary anti-aging powder formula provides a brighter look to your skin and contains Gogi berry, a powerful antioxidant. The formula is also infused with encapsulated water to refresh the skin on contact and provide a hydrated look that won’t accentuate lines and wrinkles. -From the QVC website Packaging and Application- General Comments The packaging is wonderfully sturdy and holds well in the hand. The inside lid contains a mirror which makes it quite handy as well. I love love love how this product comes as a pressed powder that you “shave” into loose powder by twisting the compact. This minimizes the mess you get with loose powders. You get the wonderfully sheer glowy effects of loose powder without the mess you get when you use loose powder- count me a fan! How it wears and general thoughts on the product. Does this baby do all that it claims to do- reduce wrinkles, hydrate, and give me a flawless glow. My answer is a resounding YES! My face looks refreshed with a light dewy glow. Coverage is enough for me to get away with a couple of swipes and I am done. Adina looking flawless with the powder on! Is it worth the nearly $60 price tag- I would say so. For that price you get a wonderfully soft full coverage face brush and a great powder for all of you ladies who just need some light coverage and a wonderfully flawless face! Hope you enjoyed my review. Let me know who else is using and loving this! Honestly I want this for the brush alone hehe! That’s some seriously chunky brush it comes with! The Muse likey! Thanks for the review Adina and for creating the warm, squishy glow of lemminginess! Show Adina some comment love! Want it? Love it? Tried it? Tell Adina (and the Muse)! You may also enjoy...

"['Spring 2013 Brings Us Smashbox Halo Long Wear Blush By Isabella Muse on October 3, 2012 9 Comments in Smashbox , Spring Collections 2013 QVC, every always the first to get the latest and greatest in makeup. Right now they have the new Smashbox Halo Long Wear Blush available for sale. My bet is you won’t technically see this product until Smashbox launches their Spring 2013 Collection but already QVC has it up and available for purchase. This is one of many reasons I love the Q! Take a look! This is a long-wearing, luminous loose blush in the vein of Smashbox’s popular Halo Powder. It comes in a grater compact so you can freshly ground the blush into a fine powder for each use. QVC also includes a full size brush with purchase, chances are you won’t get the brush when it launches officially. Shades: Warm Glow Peach Dream In Bloom Blissful I must say the colors look REALLY bold but you can’t always go on promo images alone. I might pick one or two shades up. They are available as a pre-order (believe they ship in November) at QVC.com Thoughts? Think you’ll indulge? They remind me of NYX’s HD Blush . Same concept hopefully better packaging!

"[""Majolica Majorca Holiday 2007 Collection By Isabella Muse on December 11, 2007 18 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , Japanese Brands , Majolica Majorca I’m so utterly guilty of calling MJ Majorca Majolica sometimes! I utterly reverse the name! If you see me do that call me out on it as I’m bloody confused most days of my life! Anyway! I got my MJ haul a while ago and haven’t had a sec to blog about it. My most beautiful friend Iris has already gotten her haul from Japan and reviewed it. If you missed out click here to visit with Iris and read her impressions and review on the new Holiday set! For me this is a must have set. It’s inexpensive plus it’s cute as a button so go you, now, get it! First in the line up are the Limited Edition Majolook Eyeshadow Palettes in SV801 and PK122. Both are quite gorgeous! SV801 and PK122 SV801 contains a shimmering white, a shimmering light silver, a darker silver, and an eyeliner. These are of medium pigmentation so really you can create a beautiful natural look with the palette but nothing too dramatic! PK122 contains a shimmering cream white, a shimmering light pink, a shimmering darker pink, and an eyeliner. These colors are also of medium pigment and can create a very nice frosty winter look! Both palettes are very pretty and I’m excited to try them out for a look! Up next the MJ Snow Carat Powder which is very pretty! It’s a beautiful white sparkling powder that’s inexpensive and perfect for giving you a touch of sparkle on your cheeks and eyes! However, I’m not too thrilled that this has a rather large opening for distribution. It would be easier if it had a siffer style with tiny holes instead of a big large hole which will cause a ton of waste for me. I like to slowly build up sparkle not have a ton dumped on the puff! But overall it’s really cute and sweet! This quite reminds me of the Kesho Wakusei highlighter powder I got a few months ago! Click here to view the powder and compare! Snow Carat Powder And finally last but never least as this is my favorite item would be the MJ Lash Freeze. I was going to get two of these but decided one was plenty but now I’m wondering if I should have grabbed some more. This is a sparkling silver glitter base for your lashes. Apply your mascara as you normally would and add Lash Freeze on top to make your lashes sparkle and shimmer with little bits of Silver! Lash Freeze I really love Japanese overcoats and this is soon making an appearance on my favorite list as I love the easy comb applicator and the effect is brilliant! Quite an inexpensive version of Givenchy’s Lash Sparkles ! Overall, in my humblest opinion this is most definately a must have collection! It’s cheap, pigmented, and sweet! If you’re a grand collector of Japanese cosmetics you’re going to want all of this rather badly! Got it already? Want it? Tell the Muse! NARS Dolce Vita Set By Isabella Muse on December 11, 2007 5 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , Nars , Winter Collections 2007 I did a CP order for a mate when the Friends and Family Event was taking place at Sephora and of course I couldn’t just go in and buy her stuff I had to dig around for me so I ended up nabbing the NARS Dolce Vita Set. It’s quite a nice set! I’m in love with the blush and highlighter included with the set and I’m slowly liking the gloss as it’s a bit too natural looking for me! Overall, it’s a fab set at a nice value $40 ($32 for me as I got 20% off) so if you’re looking for a nice posh gift for a friend this would be something she’d love! Bourjois Paris Ombre A Paupieres UK Colors By Isabella Muse on December 11, 2007 2 Comments in Bourjois Paris Yesterday I was telling you about an obscenely large package my mate Shaz sent me ! Here’s something that was inside! LOOK! Bourjois Paris Ombre A Paupieres in Jaune Pepite 21, Orange Pepite 23, and Ocre Pepite 24 GASP! How gorgeous are these!? They are so much more vibrant than the colors we have here in the US! We have NONE of these colors available to us here and I’m just loving every single one! Shhh don’t tell anyone I even tried the lighter and dark oranges for a blush (instead of a shadow) and they look great! My eyes literally popped with the color when I tried these and they’ll be wonderful in the Summer! As much as I love Bourjois Paris their shadows are sometimes light but these are mega pigmented! I’m so properly chuffed I may just squeal in excitement!

L’occitane en Provence Verbena Collection Review By Isabella Muse on December 12, 2007 2 Comments in L'occitane en Provence , Shower & Bath One brand that probably doesn’t get nearly enough love from the Muse on her blog would be L’occitane. Weirdly enough I don’t think I’ve ever done a single blog about this amazing brand! I’m a big lover of L’occitane and it justly deserves it’s own special entry! Sadly, it’s not all about L’occitane as this blog was inspired by Lush’s new hair gel King of Mods. I just wrote a rather delightful review about King of Mods (You can read my review of King of Mods by clicking here ) and was hinting at some products that would go well with it and I can think of nothing else that would be go fantastically with it then none other then L’occitane’s Lemon Verbena collection! I have the biggest love affair with lemons. I love the wicked combination of the scent of lemons. It’s a tart sweetness that’s the perfect contradiction. It’s fruity and it’s slightly sweet but it has a wicked tartness that’s eye opening! And what better way to wake up in the morning than with some yummie Lemon scented products?! Nothing captures the essense of lemons like L’occitane’s Lemon Verbena collection! Four of my absolutely must have Verbena items are the Shea Butter Extra Gentle Soap, The Verbena Shampoo and Conditioner, and the Verbena Shower Gel! If you happen to pick up a jar of King of Mods I can tell you that washing your hair with L’occitane’s Verbea Shampoo and Conditioner and finishing with King of Mods will leave your hair delightfully scented in a beautiful array of fresh smelling citrus that will last all day long! Sadly, L’occitane’s products are not cheap by any means but they are well worth the price tag in my humblest opinion! The Shea Extra Gentle Soap is delicately scented with Verbena and is extra moisturizing. The only quirk I have with L’occitane’s soaps are they are so monstrously big and over sized! These are 8.8oz which is about triple the size of your normal soap. It’s good because it’s a large chunk of soap for $10 bucks but it’s quite bulky to use when in the shower! It most definately gets my seal of approval for the smell and skin benefits but the size is definately something that turns me off! Lucky You! I just started a new bar this morning! Here’s a chunk all yummie and awaiting my use! Verbena Shower Gel is probably one of my favorite in the line! It’s a bit pricy at $20 for 8.4oz but I must say it’s one of my guilty pleasures that I just adore. Nothing gets me awake in the morning like a burst of yummy tart lemons and this shower gel most definately tantalizes with the smell of lemons! It suds very nicely and the smell actually does linger sometime on the skin which is always a plus! It doesn’t dry my skin out which I do have a problem with when using shower gels so it gets an A+ for that! Last but not least would be the perfect companion to King of Mods so as promised I bring you Verbena Shampoo and Conditioner which are equally as gorgeous and lemony smelling as the soap and shower gel! Perfect for layering all together to create a beautiful fresh scent! Both are very light so you don’t have to worry about build up! A few items I use and haven’t mentioned would be the Verbena Eau de Toilette and Verbena Lotion. The lotion is lovely and very moisturizing and it layers well after using the Shower Gel! As for the Eau de Toilette it’s sadly something that fails to linger. The throw is a bit weak and you really have to spray yourself down for it to have any lasting quality. It’s quite disappointing as the fresh smell of lemons is beautiful in this spray but it just doesn’t last long enough to justify it’s cost. I wish they’d consider doing a strong Eau de Parfum! Overall, the collection is beautiful and is very Muse approved and of course perfect for layering with the new love of my life King of Mods however I must say that if L’occitane can capture the essence and freshness as well as Lush they’d most definately have me throwing a ton more money at them but until that day I definately approve of the Verbena Collection they do have available!""]",6d48964fe6559fa7c6ae1c3ebb9133015d56c18f,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4213,
"['Lush’s King of Mods Hair Gel Review By Isabella Muse on December 12, 2007 1 Comment in Haircare , Lush Remember all my hoopla about King of Mods and Goth Juice? No? Click here to read up ! My original blog post about King of Mods and Goth Juice was quite popular and many of you had bits to say so today I bring you a blog of review! I got my package from Lush UK last week and inside was my new favorite product King of Mods! Lush introduced it’s hair gels in the Summer I believe or maybe it was the Spring but either way for some reason or another I never really got around to buying or trying any! I’m happy to say that King of Mods is fantastic! What’s so fab about King of Mods? For one thing the smell is amazing! It’s this uber bright cocktail of lemon, lime and grapefruit (real deal here!). It’s tart and fresh and just beautiful! Words can’t really describe how yummy this smells and when it’s in your hair the scent just lasts and lasts all day long! If you happen to be a long time Lush user you’ll remember a lovely little product by the name of Back for Breakfast which is sadly gone. King of Mods smells almost identical to Back for Breakfast! I’m actually currently, with much sadness, using my last bottle of Back for Breakfast and the scent of both King of Mods and it in my hair is just too gorgeous! King of Mods also quite reminds me of the smell of Ocean Salt but the lime is a bit more prominent in Ocean Salt while in King of Mods the lime takes a back seat to the tart sweetness of the lemon! A little goes a long way. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. A tiny drop rubbed between the palms of your hairs and smoothed into wet hair is plenty to get you through the day! I personally wouldn’t attempt this on dry hair but from what I’ve read people have had great results using it like that. Lush promotes this as a soft hold hair gel but I get more of a strong hold from it. It eases the frizz that my heavy, wavy hair is quite known for and also makes my hair feel quite soft and of course nicely scented! The scent just lingers and lingers and lingers and believe you me I’ve had many compliments about how fresh smelling my hair is! This is a very light gel contrary to it’s texture. The texture is a bit sticky and dense and it takes some work smoothing it between your hands for application but when it’s in your hair it’s very light so you won’t end up feeling like a helmet head or having a greased up look. I use it on my wet hair and I’m not one for blowing dry so when my hair finally dries it feels very fluffy while easing my frizzes! As you already know my uniform is placing my hair in a bun and smoothing my hair back with a headband. My hair is wavy and full of curl and placing it back keeps it away from my face while I’m working. By the end of the day my emaculate hair ends up spiraling out of it’s bun and I have a case of the frizz on the halo of my head! Lucky enough I now have King of Mods which pretty much holds it all together. The price tag on King of Mods could make you wince. Stateside a small jar costs $15.95 but I’m here to tell you it’s cash well spent. This jar will last you ages because as I said before a tiny drop is all you need. I figure I could get at least 6 months or more from this jar so at $15.95 that’s not too bad a deal! If you’re yearning for some Back for Breakfast now and you’re wondering what would go well with the fresh smell of King of Mods have no fear your Muse has several products that’ll go perfectly with the amazing scent of King of Mods that she’ll bring to you in her next blog post! I can’t say enough good things about this cute little pot of gel especially can’t stop raving about it’s gorgeous smell. King of Mods is most definately Muse Approved for purchase! Got it? Love it? Tell me! Bath and Body Works Sassy Strawberry Three in One Shower Gel Review By Isabella Muse on December 12, 2007 6 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Holiday Collections 2007 , Shower & Bath I was doing some Christmas shopping last night so I happened to drop into Bath and Body Works of course! I promised myself this year I would NOT get sucked into the evil lure of Bath and Body Works simply because I was feeling quite cheap! Yes, I said cheap. I know cheap and the Muse are something that don’t go well together but indeed I was being cheap and if you may I was also being…frugal! Indeed. Tis true. So why was I being cheap and frugal? Bath and Body Works has the biggest array of awesome Holiday gifts and they are all so pretty and sweet and I want everything (for myself) however the evil lure of all these goodies did not even phase me! I didn’t even blink a little eyelash upon viewing all those wonderful, bright packages and colorful shower gels! Are you screaming blasphemy yet?! When it comes to gift giving for friends and family I truly have no problem shelling out cash however I would not be tempted by all this wonderful bath candy last night simply because the past few years I’ve given into the temptation to buy tons and tons of Bath and Body Works all to have it be given away practically for FREE on Boxing Day and the entire week after Christmas! I’m talking major deals! $6, $5, $4, even a $1! Items are normally price tagged at $12 and upwards! being reduced to $4 and $3 totally makes me fall on the floor and convulse in anger that I paid the original price tag for these things! MY GOD It’s a CRIME! So what did I do last night? I boycotted Bath and Body Works and told myself I’d not spend a dime for anyone in that shop simply to avoid the drama of tears and anger (ok maybe not tears but I love the drama don’t you?) later when it was all reduced and placed on clearance. A few items that most definately tempted me to spend, spend, spend was of course all the new Temptation 3 in 1’s! I adore Twisted Peppermint and really wanted to stock up but I was being a smart shopper (pat, pat on the back for this Muse) knowing that these $12 bottles would be $6-$4 after the Holiday was over! However, the force and lure of Bath and Body Works is strong and I did spot a sign that simply red 50% off in big red letters. I could feel my heart pounding out of my chest at this point so I slowly went over to investigate (my best mate Jen was with me at time and she can vouch that I was literally tiptoeing over to see what the sign was all about! She calls me the “passionate shopper” and says I should have my own show amply named that)! And to my utter delight it was Sassy Strawberry that was on sale! That meant it was $6! I was nabbing a real steal here! I had to have it immediately at this price! So I snatched up two bottles (one for me and one for my sister who loves the Temptation line as well)! I made sure to be quick because there was about 5000 bottles there and god knows at any second a big crowd might wander in and grab them all before I got my chance to get a bottle for my very self (drama kids drama). Bath and Body Works Sassy Strawberry Three in One Shower Gel on Sale for $6 I mistakenly didn’t bother smelling Sassy Strawberry before purchasing it. I have this system where I avoid smelling things because I know I’ll want them. So when I stopped into the shop last night I encouraged myself NOT to smell any of the Temptations because I’d definately want them as soon as my nose tickled with the aroma of Mint Chocolate, Peppermint, and Gumdrops! When I seen Sassy Strawberry on sale I just assumed that Strawberry and Mint would be a lovely marriage so I didn’t smell it prior to buying. Big. Mistake. You know cheap shampoo? Suave Strawberry Shampoo, V05 Strawberry Shampoo, and hell if you’re as old as me dare I say White Rain Strawberry Shampoo. That’s what this smells like. Really, really cheap shampoo. Wow. So disappointed. I can’t believe it. To be honest when I originally read about this on the site I literally we’ed myself in excitement at the thought of Strawberries mixed with delightful mint! I thought for sure this would take over my love affair with Twisted Peppermint and make it onto my “must have at all costs” list! However, I don’t get any mint I simply get a very plastic, fake Strawberry smell. I’ve never met a bottle of Temptation 3 in 1 that I didn’t love but this would make it on my “do not want”, “do not love” list. Sorry Bath and Body you missed the boat on this one. Who in the world thought this was a good idea? I’m just wondering where the mint went?!?!?! I convinced myself that my batch must have went off so I opened my sister’s bottle to smell and again just a strange plastic strawberry smell. I’m so disappointed I may just spit or cry (or neither but it sure sounded good!). I’m really somewhat shocked as I’ve truly had great experiences with the line up until this catastrophe! I’ve even went so far as to say the line was better than Philosophy. The Muse says avoid the Sassy Strawberry and spend your hard earned $6 bucks on something else! I’m going to go meditate to make myself stronger against the lure of Bath and Body Works! Don’t give in people! It’ll be on sale before you know it! Be strong! Have this? Hate it too? Loved it? Tell me! Your Muse is curious what you thought about Sassy Strawberry! Some News On the Philosophy Front By Isabella Muse on December 12, 2007 4 Comments in Philosophy , Steals and Deals Sephora.com is sold out of a majority of the Philosophy goodies they previously had however I can report that a majority of Manhattan’s Sephora stores have many of the products on sale and available for purchase! As per my discussion ( click here and here for details) before Philosophy has completely revamped the line and the bottles are no longer 16oz in size nor $16 in price they are now officially jumbo sized 24oz at a price tag of $20 per a bottle (The Muse approves! Good Deal!). I love the larger size and the lovely price tag but I have to say the new bottles are a bit clumsy for your shower. These aren’t going to fit in any caddy or shelf you might have in your stall so that might be a problem for storage. Also when you’re all wet and soapy in the shower I’m picturing many people dropping these as they are heavy and with your hands wet the potential for drama is huge! The shelves at Sephora were lined with the new bottles. I can’t do a comparison now but I have a little something, something that I’ll show you soon! It’s a steal, a deal, and it comes in the new jumbo packaging! I’ve ordered it and am eagerly awaiting it’s arrival and will of course post my review soon! I’ve seen Philosophy on sale at the following Sephora stores: Sephora SOHO Sephora on West 34th Sephora at the Westchester Mall Sephora 42nd & Madison And what’s left online can be found by clicking here (maybe they’ll restock)! I haven’t checked Nordies. I actually went in last night but completely forgot to drop by the Philosophy counter! But maybe they are reducing the prices at Nordies as well! Shu’s ""Simple"" Gift Sets By Isabella Muse on December 12, 2007 2 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , Shu Uemura The lovely Mr Uemura has granted us three Holiday Wishes with some lovely gift sets in Simple Sophistication, Simple Glamour, and Simple Drama! Ok..so…hate to say it….total snore for me. These aren’t exactly something I need or want. Colors are really washed out and the price is a little tiny bit scary (wouldn’t be that scary if the colors were a bit more vibrant). I guess if you love really natural looks this is a great palette for you. As for me, I’m skipping ’em. I see only four brushes pictured but I think you’re getting six total brushes (ok so this is starting to sound like it’s worth the price tag now!) plus you’ll get a compact holding two shadows and one blush and finally a pouch to hold it all in. I might have to take back my earlier comment about it being a bit too pricey maybe this isn’t so bad after all! But colors oh god the colors….can’t we get something with a bit more sparkle and something more festive for the season!? I heart you Mr Uemura but I’m not so keen on washed out browns, grays, and blacks! Simple Sophistication Simple Glamour (Hmmm the green looks nice!) Simple Drama Want ’em? Love ’em?

"['NARS Dolce Vita Set By Isabella Muse on December 11, 2007 5 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , Nars , Winter Collections 2007 I did a CP order for a mate when the Friends and Family Event was taking place at Sephora and of course I couldn’t just go in and buy her stuff I had to dig around for me so I ended up nabbing the NARS Dolce Vita Set. It’s quite a nice set! I’m in love with the blush and highlighter included with the set and I’m slowly liking the gloss as it’s a bit too natural looking for me! Overall, it’s a fab set at a nice value $40 ($32 for me as I got 20% off) so if you’re looking for a nice posh gift for a friend this would be something she’d love! You may also enjoy...

"[""Latest Obsession: Carol’s Daughter Jamaican Punch By Isabella Muse on December 17, 2007 10 Comments in Carol's Daughter , Fragrance , Latest Obsession Meet my latest obsession: I was wandering around the Sephora at Herald’s Square on Sunday trying to find some Stocking Stuffers for my sister and came across the Carol’s Daughter display. I’ve passed this display up more times than I can count on two hands but for some reason or another that day a bottle of “Almond Cookie” caught my eye! Now the first thing to enter my mind when I seen Almond Cookie was Lush’s Snowcake ! I was thinking a bit of cherry with maybe a hint of marzipan icing. Mmm…dead wrong. Carol’s Daughter Almond Cookie Eau de Toilette smells heinous to say the least. I don’t get much of a “bakery scent” to this but just musk and musk and more musk! It’s quite strong and very overpowering. I guess the sandalwood overpowers the sweetness of the cookie and vanilla I’m not entirely sure but I gagged when I took a sniff! Which leads me to say that I almost walked away but another item caught my eye and I decided to tortue myself a bit more with Carol’s Daughter. I very cautiously opened a bottle of Jamaican Punch, took a sniff, and soon after fell deeply in love. Mmmm now this is perfection. It’s quite fruity with a faint underlay of sandalwood and bayberry. It has all sorts of yummie fruits like peach, banana, orange, apple, and raspberry! It’s tropical yet sweet and fruity and did I mention it lingers like crazy! My body chemistry doesn’t work well with Eau de Toilette and normally my skin just sucks it up and the linger, throw, and scent don’t last at all. Basically within 30 minutes or less you can barely tell that I squirted myself! However, two quick squirts with Jamaican Punch had me smelling yummie from 2 in the afternoon all the way to 11:45 that evening when I hopped into the shower! This has amazing throw and lingering power and well worth the $25 I shelled out for the 2 oz bottle! I’m now utterly obsessed with this gorgeous scent! I nabbed the shower gel and the Eau de Toilette and I’m lemming everything else in the line! I highly recommend going into Sephora to sniff it for yourself! Mmmm tropics in the winter! Pure perfection! Bourjois Paris Liner Clubbing By Isabella Muse on December 17, 2007 4 Comments in Bourjois Paris 8 Hours of continuous wear liner without smudging, bleeding, or running? Hmm the Muse likey it very much! Only problem is I’m not so handy with liquid liners! $16 and available now at Sephora in an array of colors should you want some! Bourjois Paris Liner Clubbing More Bubbly For Your Buck! By Isabella Muse on December 17, 2007 4 Comments in Philosophy , Shower & Bath , Steals and Deals Want a steal and a deal? Head over to QVC and enter Item Number A74743 to nab yourself a trio of Philosophy Shower Gels that includes Bubbly!

All Three for $35 bucks plus they’ll get it to you before Christmas if you order by the 19th! I feel spoiled already! Sephora’s Philosophy Bubbly 3 in 1 Shower Gel Version By Isabella Muse on December 17, 2007 Leave a Comment in Philosophy , Sephora , Shower & Bath Remember my post about Philosophy Bubbly? It wasn’t so longer ago but if you’re feeling forgettable on a Monday morning (and who can blame you in this cold) click here for a refresher! Well Sephora’s jumped on the bandwagon and they got a new box, the same price tag, and slapped a new name on the packaging and called it their very own and only available from them too mind you (but we already know it’s available at QVC too). Sephora’s “version” of Bubbly comes in a box that reads “Congratulations” and is the same whopping 24oz size and the cost is pretty much the same too at $20! It’s a perfect gift really so no matter if you buy it from Sephora or QVC it all smells the same and does the same thing! Go on..indulge…you know you want too! CLICK!

"['NARS Night Series Palette By Isabella Muse on November 9, 2007 4 Comments in Holiday Collections 2007 , Nars , Winter Collections 2007 I was at Sephora last night returning something and I was just wandering around trying to finalize my list of wants when I came across the NARS Night Series Palette! NARS Night Series Palette as seen on Sephora Wow. Just…. Wow. I have quite a bit of product from NARS but when I had seen this palette online I wasn’t tempted at all. It seemed matte, plain, somewhat boring. But boy was I ever wrong! The palette is gorgeous and I highly suggest nabbing this little guy! You get six ultra shimmering shades of eyeshadow and I’m absolutely loving the perfect white sparkle color in this palette called Night Snow. Night Snow is supposedly a best seller from NARS and how I never noticed it prior to this shocks me! Also included in this palette is a personal favorite of mine Night Star! This is such a gorgeous gold shimmer! So yummie! On top of those two brilliant colors you’ll also get Night Fever (Black with Red Glitter), Night Clubbing (Black with Gold Glitter), Night Rider (Plum with Silver Glitter), and Night Fairy (Voilet with Gold Glitter). NARS single shadows are $21 USD each so you’ll get 6 in this palette for $55 USD and with your discount you’ll get it for $44 USD which brings the price down to about $7 bucks and change per a shadow which in my opinion isn’t too bad a deal! If you’re looking for a shimmering palette that’ll make your eyes pop for the Holiday Season this would be perfect! I’m loving this and can’t WAIT to get mine! I finally did my Friends and Family order yesterday and this, my dears, was in the lot of items I purchased! It’s most definately Muse approved! And I can’t WAIT to share pictures, a review, and FOTD using this little palette! The Muse is excited! You may also enjoy...

"[""Bath and Body Works Temptation Sale By Isabella Muse on December 19, 2007 4 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Shower & Bath , Steals and Deals Well me loves it’s that time of the year! I’m wandering around Bath and Body Works and the Semi Annual is creeping slowly up on us! The Temptation line, as predicted by yours truly, has made it’s way onto the sale list! So go yee and stock up on Twisted Peppermint for a mere $6 for a 12oz bottle!

By Isabella Muse on December 19, 2007 Leave a Comment in Babbling Bits , Friends I was just discussing Row a few blog entries back and her rather sweet cousin who gifted us with an absolute fabulous video tutorial on cosmetic application (Lord knows how we got along without it!)! Row has her own little beauty blog that I adore and I’m catching up on reading her fab blog today (I’m supposed to be working but reading beauty blogs is far more entertaining for me). Anyway. Moral of the story is at this point we should all be properly jealous of Row as she has a boyfriend who depots for her. I personally don’t depot my shadows but the general idea of having a boyfriend to do it for me makes me 1. laugh and 2. say awwwwww true love!

Victoria’s Secret Very Sexy Brilliant Lip Shine Lipgloss Review By Isabella Muse on December 19, 2007 6 Comments in Victoria's Secret Meet Victoria’s Secret’s imitation of Yves Saint Laurent ‘Touch? Brillance’ Sparkling Touch Lipgloss: From Top to Bottom: Possession, Randy, and Torrid These shiny little glosses cost a nice cheap $12 however you might want to save your pennies and spend the $29 on the YSL version as they aren’t that great sadly. Contrary to my rave reviews about Victoria’s Secret Cosmetics line lately I must give these guys a poor review. Let me share some of the cons with you. The packaging on these is great. They come in the standard click pen style. Click for color and apply. The price tag is pretty sweet at $12 per pen and it’s quite a large amount of product in the pen from what I can see. However, the cons stop with the actual formula of the gloss. The gloss is sparkling and comes in an array of gorgeous shades but the texture is tacky, sticky, and difficult to apply. It’s not so much about tacky and sticky as I wear lipglass and god knows lipglass is the height of stick and tack. This is much more on the waxy side. Weird right? But it’s true. It feels like I’m smearing a melted crayon on my lips when applying. When finally have this arranged on my lips correct, which is a task to say the least, the actual gloss doesn’t last that long at all. It slips and slides right off my lips within 10 minutes. So chalk up the staying power as zero. Don’t try layering this with lipstick either otherwise you’re liable to look like a clown. For some reason the texture, the formula or all of the above just smears in a way that you’ll end up looking like Bozo the Clown in a matter of seconds during application. So…sadly…these get the Muse’s thumb down rating. Vicky has been doing so well in the beauty department lately and I’ve raved (See my raves here , here , and here ) a ton but this time I must rant and say that these are an utter waste of $12! Save your pennies and grab a YSL gloss instead! Latest Obsession: MAC Beauty Powder in Soft Flame By Isabella Muse on December 19, 2007 Leave a Comment in Latest Obsession , MAC , Recommendations Here’s a new obsession: Meet MAC Beauty Powder in Soft Flame and I’m here to say it’s gorgeous! I have two Beauty Powders already in Micro Pink and Natural Flare but I must say that Soft Flame blows both out of the water! If you missed out on MAC’s Flashtronic Collection there happened to be a gorgeous little Mineralized Skinfinish in that color story that was entitled Northern Light and Soft Flame quite reminds me of it! If you haven’t partaken of the Of Beauty Collection I’d say definately at the very least pick up Soft Flame. Soft Flame is vibrant enough to use as a blush which can’t be said of the other colors in these powders. It’s a shimmering reddish copper with touches of gold that are beautiful on the skin. This can be used under your blush or over it but I prefer just using it on it’s own for a really perfect shimmer of color! If you’re a medium to dark skintone this will really light your skin up! I’d say avoid it if your skin is a bit lighter as you may get a bit of a muddy look with it. I’ve already done a review on MAC’s Beauty Powder so I’m not actually reviewing the powder here just the color so if you’d like the read a review about the powders click here . I’m absolutely loving Soft Flame and I can’t believe I almost missed out on ordering this but when I fell in love with the 183 I ended up seeing this and promptly falling in love! Get this before it’s gone it’s definately a keeper! Start ’em Young I Say! By Isabella Muse on December 19, 2007 3 Comments in Friends , MuseTV One of the Muse’s readers and mates, Rows, has a fantastic youTube video on her blog. Go visit Row by clicking here . This is Row’s 7 year old cousin giving us a make-up tutorial. I wonder where her influence (and obsession) with cosmetics comes from hmmmmm! How much are you loving the way she says “blusher” all proper and ladylike! I haven’t laughed so hard in a long time! This little poppet is positively adorable and I’m positive I learned a tip or two about application! I wonder where she pops off to when she’s on the floor? Studying her notes mayhaps? Let’s give her 10 years or less and I’m positive she’ll have her own blog! Note: She didn’t say “Ummmmm” once I could definately learn something from her! Mind you she’s putting the eyeliner on correctly and you’re probably the one doing it wrong! ?""]",8977e126efd39c970f110287d43d71a1df500d94,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4209,

"['Lush Solid Perfume Review By Isabella Muse on December 19, 2007 4 Comments in Fragrance , Lush I got my order from the Lush NA Party yesterday! Click here to read details about the party! The temptation of Snowcake solid perfume was strong so I did in fact order it and some other goodies. I normally avoid ordering from Lush NA like the plague but I couldn’t resist Snowcake! I stupidly ordered this solid perfume without first trying the lot I had already purchased from Lush UK that I got about a month ago. I finally got around to testing these out and I have to say they aren’t as great as I had hoped. Lush Perfumes have fantastic throw, linger, and staying power however Lush solid perfumes do not. I used Potion so far and Fever and both are very strong smelling but they don’t do much when they are on my skin. I think these are great if you happen to already own some of the perfumes in liquid form. That way you can use these as touch ups through out the day however to use these as your perfume is a bit difficult as someone has to literally stick their nose in your neck to actually get a whiff some of what you are wearing. If you’re purchasing these from Lush NA they come in a far better tin than the Lush UK solids. Lush UK has little screw tops that I find very annoying to unscrew. If you by chance you drop the tin or get a dent in the container it’ll basically leave you struggling to unscrew the top. Lush NA tops just pop off and on and make life much easier however they do leave a bit of a mess sometimes as when you’re popping on and off it sometimes gets a bit of the solid on the lid which causes the tin to have a waxy feel. Speaking of waxy. That’s basically the texture of these. They are a waxy balm that’s difficult to spread around so it’s best to warm it between your fingertips prior to applying. I can’t give these a complete bad review because these actually work for one of my best mates. It seems they really like his body chemistry because when he used one it was pretty strong but when I used one it basically got soaked up into my skin and I really had to try and even get a tiny sniff of the scent I was wearing. I love these for touch-ups when I’m using my Lush perfumes but to use on their own it’s a no go for me! I got a 7 of the 9 scents offered and I find the strongest smelling of the lot are Fever, Potion, and Honey I Washed the Kids. Champagne Snow Showers, Snowcake, Silky Underwear, and American Cream are the lightest with the least throw! I will say you have to layer these on quite a bit. Take some and place it behind your ears, between your breasts, on your neck, behind your knees, and on all your pulse points. So yes with a little hard work you can have yourself smelling sweet somewhat plus if you happen to heat up during the day you’ll definately see more of a throw from these! However, I still can’t give them a raving review because I just don’t think the throw is good enough to get that excited about, believe you me it’s difficult not to run around and recommend Lush as I adore and love all things Lush but these failed me somehow. Anyway! The moral of the story is at $11.95 a tin I’d say skip ’em and buy something else! Or if your body chemistry just happens to accept and like them…lucky you…grab tons! But test, test, test, test in store and don’t be a silly sausage like the Muse and just buy without first testing! Got ’em? Love ’em? Tell me! Not liking these? Tell me! Cracking Apart my Super-Sized Lush Pud By Isabella Muse on December 19, 2007 1 Comment in Lush , Shower & Bath I thought I’d treat you to images of my Super-Sized Lush Pud’s demise! As tempting as it was to throw this entire thing into my tub I did my best to refrain and crack it up so I might enjoy the sweet scent of Snowcake over the course of a few baths instead of just one (plus I don’t think I have the nerve to throw in $27 worth of Bath Bomb and soak without feeling guilt)! My Innocent Super-Sized Lush Pud Bath Bomb (It doesn’t realize what’s coming! *evil laugh*) Awwww naked! A brief tap from the upper part and the bottom begins cracking….Ouch! (I almost feel guilty) A harder tape and it begins to crack! Time for my bath! ? Fun fun! I should get at least 6 (more if I’m frugal with the pieces) or more nice long soaks with the bomb pieces! Grab one of these while they are still around at your local Lush (they are sadly sold out online)! You’ll also receive some Snowcake and Bob soap (Ewww I hate Bob) inside and a coupon for 15% off your next order online or in store (all Lush wrapped gifts include a coupon)! The Panel is Open for Discussion By Isabella Muse on December 18, 2007 18 Comments in Question and Answer I thought I’d do a quickie post while I wait for my train and open the panel for discussion! So…………………………….! I get tons of e-mails daily asking me all sorts of questions and the like! Here’s an open panel for you to question or comment! Any dying questions you want answered by the Muse or about the Muse? Want to know my favorite collection? Want to tell me yours? Want to know what’s in my makeup bag right now? Want to share with me what’s in yours? Want to know something personal about me? Ask away! MAC Metal X Impressions By Isabella Muse on December 18, 2007 19 Comments in MAC As I was saying in an earlier post the evil lure of the MAC counter got to me and I made a quick pit stop while at Macy’s to browse around and see what was about. Even though I’m a self proclaimed hater of cream eyeshadows the Metal X collection most definately caught my eye! You may remember that I compared many of the glitter liners in this collection to past collections. You can click here for the original post about that. I’m here to say that the glitter liners are not at all awe aspiring and if you have liners from past collections you’re covered. If you’ve never purchased glitter liners from MAC your Muse mostly definately gives them a big “go buy” of approval however if you have them from other color stories these are reruns or at least I felt they were! Again, click here for the comparisons! Now the shadows are most definately gorgeous. I was in lust with all of them! I swatched every one on my hand and was absolutely giddy with excitement at the gorgeous colors! However, I didn’t buy nary a one. I’ve heard absolute poor reviews about the shadows and how crummy the staying power is and I must say that I could be agreement without even testing these on my eyes. The shadows are super emollient so all the tales of slipping, sliding, and smudging off the eyes may very well be true with a shadow that’s so oily in texture. The formula is quite interesting on these and I can see where all the woe stems from as obviously the problem is the texture. Do I still want them? Hell yes! The colors are too pretty not to want them even for a cream hater like myself. However, I may just stick to swapping for one before splurging hard on the entire lot. These need to be further tested on my eye area before I can make any rash decisions about them but from what I have seen so far the texture definately screams drama! Have them? Tell me what your thoughts are! Curious minds! Recommendation: MAC’s 183 By Isabella Muse on December 18, 2007 Leave a Comment in MAC , Recommendations I’m sure you have noticed that as of late I haven’t been my normal MAC self. I’m normally one for running to the counter to pick up the latest collection (in it’s entirety like the crazy cosmetic demon I am) as soon as it hits the shelf! However, the last few collections, as tempting as they are, have not made their way into my cart. I promised myself that I’d not buy anything from the last few collections while I was busy with Christmas shopping for others. This normally doesn’t prevent me from throwing caution to the wind and just buying it anyway but I’ll be honest MAC has overwhelmed me lately. Collection upon collection upon collection is difficult to keep up with (and expensive as bloody hell)! Up to now I haven’t purchased The Stylistics, Metal X, and Finery Collections. It’s not for not wanting them because I honestly want something from each of them however I really can’t justify the cost during the Holidays at the moment so I skipped (this isn’t to say after the Holidays I won’t be nabbing some goodies)! Anyway…I did indeed throw caution to the wind this weekend and casually strolled around the MAC counter at Macy’s on 34th. You see I had convinced myself that the crowds were so very big that I’d never find anyone to actually help me so I could look but no way was I waiting for a MA to help me and on top of that, wait on the huge line that was reaching all the way across the floor to the Clinique counter. Sadly, my plan didn’t work as well as I wanted and one of my regular MAC MA’s was there to “save the day” and help me make two purchases, one of which I’ll be discussing with you in this post. A few months ago (I think it’s months. It feels like months!) I had purchased two Beauty Powders from MAC Pro in Manhattan and had them ship them over (I was feeling particularly lazy and decided I didn’t want to walk over and do the purchasing myself! It also saved me from purchasing all six colors as I wasn’t there to actually try them!). You can click here to read my review on the powders I did get. Anyway, soon after MAC counters got the Beauty Powders and I soon forgot about the collection and was not tempted at all to purchase the other powders in the color story and other items were higher up on my wish list. Until Saturday. On display with the Beauty Powders was the 183 and I fell deeply and completely in lust with this fantastic little brush (I also feel deeply in lust with another Beauty Powder in this collection which I’ll tell you about in another post). When I seen the brush it didn’t look too familiar and it turns out that’s because it’s only available with this collection and will be gone shortly so I highly suggest and recommend nabbing this $40 brush! I actually didn’t know this at the time and was furiously googling the MAC website on my blackberry trying to find out (as most times when you ask an MA they aren’t always 100% positive). This brush totally makes buffing the beauty powders into your skin a snap! If you’re a mineral foundation user this will be a dream for application. I’ve been using this since I got it on Saturday for my Beauty Powders, for setting powder application on my face, for general blush application, and just for smoothing on whisper set powder under my eyes and it works an absolute treat! 183 is my absolute newest love! The bristles are soft on this with no shedding at all (did you expect anything less from a MAC brush?). The handle is small enough to grasp between your fingers for a nice hold while buffing and it’s just a perfect wonderful brush overall! I wouldn’t call this a kabuki but maybe more of a glorified version of one. The bristles are more flat and not rounded as compared to a kabuki so it’s quite different! This is really a keeper for me and well worth it’s $40 price tag! Grab one before it disappears! The Muse highly recommends the 183! Have it? Love it? Tell me! Want it? Need it? Tell me!']",e17276e9a5a7fbc035657e60b9799c1653577581,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4210,

"['Prescriptives Magic Eye Shadow Effects By Isabella Muse on December 21, 2007 2 Comments in Prescriptives I spied with my little eye some fantastic shadows from Prescriptives last night! Behold! Magic Eye Shadow Effects Eyeshadow in Gold and Silver Prescriptives is probably a brand I should pay more attention to but sadly I don’t. I happened across these and wanted them rather badly. Although I was somehow being frugal when I seen the $25 price tag! Maybe after the Holidays! I will say these are a very beautiful fine shimmer eyeshadow that’s a sure hit with the Muse as I love shimmery shades! I have no idea if these are a Holiday item or if they have been around a while because as I said I’m not on the Prescriptives bandwagon but these look to be a definite keeper! They will be mine *insert evil laugh here* but for now they can be placed on the back burner while I finish up my Christmas shopping for others as sometimes I have to remember Christmas isn’t always about “what the Muse wants”! Nessasary Makeup Dupe FOTD By Isabella Muse on December 21, 2007 3 Comments in Face of the Day I was wandering around Vanessa from Nessasary Makeup blog’s last week and I came across an FOTD she did using Urban Decay’s Underground and Shag. For the longest time I had these I never could come up with a good combo for them and her FOTD just inspired me to use both together and it came out kinda ok! My combanation is heaps different from hers but the cocktail of the two colors is a marriage most lovely! Thanks to Vanessa at Nessasary Makeup for the inspiration! You can visit with Vanessa by clicking here and you can see her version of this FOTD by clicking here but be warned her blog is utterly addicting and you’ll find yourself jotting down colors to use in looks later on as her combos are brill!

I purchased two bottles of Twisted Peppermint Shimmer Body Splash last night contrary to my original post where I was saying how much I hate body splashes that shimmer. I guess I’m contradicting myself as we’ve all established how much in love and lust I am with sparkle, shimmer, and glitter of any kind. However, shimmer in my Body Splashes, Lotions, or any other Bath and Body item should be against the law! I hate it for some reason! I just detest shimmer in these products with a passion! Especially Body Splash! Why for the love of God and all things good would you want the put shimmer into a Body Spray!? Sigh! Rant, Rant, Stamping Feet, Rant! Ok now that I’m done raving like a loon I will say that these were on sale so I guess it makes up for the shimmer part. These were $4 Each and believe me I couldn’t resist the sweet, vanilla and peppermint scent so the overwhelming need to purchase came upon me and I left swinging a bag of body spray! Shoot me now for giving in! In all seriousness these smell so yummie but I’m still wishing away the evil shimmer part! The bottom of each has fake little peppermint candies! Cutes! I went into Bath and Body Works with the soul plan to purchase a pair of Lambie Slippers because a reader who shall remain nameless for her sin created a lemming in me for these! Sadly, they were sold out! My god the horror! Thus Twisted Peppermint Shimmer Body Splash took the place of my hardcore lemming for Lambie Slippers just barely mind you! I’m currently searching E-bay for a pair but they are $39 and upwards and I haven’t yet reached the level insanity where I am even half considering purchasing a pair of slippers, shaped like lambs for $39. If I do reach that level you’ll be the first to know dear readers. I did purchase a pair of the Sweetest Softest Slippers for $9 but they aren’t Lamb-y like. Dear oh dear what’s a girl to do? Anyway. The moral of the story is Twisted Peppermint Body Spray is a go with the Muse! Grab it while the grabbing is good because it’ll sell out quick at this price (it’s already gone online!)!

MAC Originals Color Story By Isabella Muse on December 20, 2007 4 Comments in MAC , Winter Collections 2007 I’ve been reading so much about the Originals Collection that I’m an absolute walking encyclopedia about it by now! I know the colors, I know what collections they had previously been in, I’ve seen swatches, etc…etc…etc…. This has popped up on everyone (and their mum’s) blog this week! It’s MAC excitement and cosmetic whores (excuse you but I proudly call myself Cosmetic Whore thanks very much!) and junkies far and wide are absolutely rolling around breathlessly in joy that Parrot is back! How long has it been since Parrot’s been gone? 2-3 years or more? You can read my Ode to Parrot by clicking over here . Now I’m not immune to the lure of Parrot by any means and I love her just as much as you or anyone else does but I have two pots that are carefully stashed away and guarded by rabid pitbulls in my beauty vault already so I’m thinking to myself do I really need another pot of Parrot and I’m listening to the voices in my head that are screaming HELL YES (I’ve been told it’s ok if the voices speak in my head it’s just if I answer them that I have to worry!). So…I guess that means I’ll be skipping my way over to the MAC counter to purchase another pot because obviously two pots aren’t enough and god knows I’ll live to be at least 70 or more hopefully and I KNOW I’ll want a vibrant shade of aqua blue in my train case when I’m 60 and freaking hip beyond any means! And two pots won’t get me through this lifetime never mind the next one so best get a 3rd pot as a backup JUST IN CASE. Plus who the bloody hell knows it might just turn into a solid gold piece later on in life when I need to sell it to fund my future child’s college tuition. Anyway…. It’s not exactly smart to face the Holiday crowds just to nab a pot of Parrot even though we know it’s well worth it. I’m strapping on my bullet proof vest to make my way into Nordie’s to fight my way to the MAC counter and glance at the array of the Originals Collection! So… This color story has me saying…. Yawn. I’m a little bit shocked that nothing aside from Parrot is crying at me to buy it! I’m somewhat disappointed in everything. Someone slap me it can’t be that I’m not fawning over MAC what’s wrong with me? Where’s my MAC spirit?! I’m MAC’s biggest cheerleader what’s going on!? I guess some of the colors are just boring for me. I like more bold shadows and these aren’t doing so much for me! Plus the piggies I already have and the reflects glitter aren’t something I am entirely keen on. You’ve read it everywhere by now but here’s the low down on what’s out this week: Parrot Ochre Style A Little Folie Daisychain Memorabilia Clue Alum Charred Frisco Pigment Kitschmas Violet Melon Golden olive Steel blue Reflect Glitter Blackened Red Very Pink Transparent Teal Antique Gold Lipstick Sandy B. Rozz Revival Chintz on Hintz Russian Red Twig Twig Supersequin Nouveau-Frou Retrofluid Back to Del Rio Utter Pervette Lipgloss C-Thru Full on Lust Avarice Real Desire Nico Now Eye Pencil Ebony Coffee Indigo Let’s pick this apart a little and see what the Muse is contemplating. I’m sad that the eyeshadows aren’t all that and a bag of chips. They brought these back because everyone really, really, really, wanted them right? Normally the first thing that catches my eye when a new color story is released would be the shadows but aside from Parrot nothing is yelling at me! Maybe Daisychain? Ok glosses. I see two that look interesting here those would be Avarice and Real Desire. Lipsticks I really have to see in person to decide. Pigments have ’em all already. Glitters mmm maybe yes maybe no. Eyeliner and Mascara? Skip. Wow I’m saving money left and right here kids! Maybe when I see this in person I’ll have a hard time saying no to it all but at the moment it’s not what I expected at all! I expected more wow! Oh well! Money saved for another day and another MAC Collection! Want any of it?

Want It? Ahhhh Youth By Isabella Muse on December 20, 2007 12 Comments in Pieces of Life My mum convinced me that I’d be doing a “good deed” if I dressed as a little elf last night. Yes. Tis true. I dressed as an elf. God. The things I won’t do for my mum. Anyway. She had this senior get together thingy (she hates when I call her senior but damn if I don’t get joy from it) and she dresses as Santa every year and every year she somehow convinces me that playing an elf to her Santa is an absolutely AWESOME idea (I just think I feel guilt because my dad and sister have already said absolutely NO WAY! Thus that leaves me!). Anyway. I went to my parents house late yesterday afternoon to pick up “Miss Santa Claus” and wandered around as she got her bits together. And let me tell you my mum is big on pictures. She has pictures of everything we’ve done as a child. I’m talking first spit, first poo, first snot, etc……if my sister and me did it, it’s liable she has a picture of it somewhere (where as my dad is the utter opposite! He carries around a keyring with the three of us in a photo. He claims it’s to remind him how he went crazy!) I’ve never seen such a mother so proud of her daughter’s first snot like my mum! She’s the type to whip out some embarrassing photo at random moments and coe at how awesomely gorgeous my sister and I are (did I mention she’s blind? I’m kidding! I’m kidding!). My mum is the type to tell me, “Pick me up at 1 on the dot and don’t be late”. Meanwhile I have to wait 15 hours while she gets her rubbish together before we can actually leave her house and get to our destination. So yesterday I was waiting for her and she yells from upstairs to gather the cookies and such on the dining room table and I wandered in to gather them up and I was faced with the doom of staring at the life size image of my graduation picture on the dining room wall. Pray tell. Who does this to their children? So here are twin life size photos. One of me, one of my sister Jo on the dining room wall. God. The horror. The sad news is I have to face this every time I have dinner at my parents house. The really bad news is company has to as well (those poor, poor people). The good news is yesterday I realize that in 13 years since I graduated High School I haven’t changed one bit! I’m seriously considering bottling some of my youth and selling it on E-bay! No but seriously I must be doing something right in my skincare routine because nary a wrinkle mars my face, an age spot, a single gray hair, or any other signs of aging have occurred as of yet! Maybe I should be quiet before I jinx myself and knock wood! I turned 30 this year and I can still get away with saying I’m 17….. Hmmm…..Maybe when I’m 60 I can tell people I’m 30. I chalk it up to expensive cosmetics, skincare, and good genes as my mum looks damn good for her age too (this from a lady who washes her face with Ivory soap and walks out of the house without foundation, blush, or lipstick for the past 150 years of her life). An unflattering picture of the Muse and her mum Well…anyway to embarrass myself further I give you my High School grad photo from almost 13 years ago (granted I can’t get away with the Peaches and Cream face look anymore! Now I have to layer on foundation and blush to even resemble this image)! Behold Greatness (I kid, I kid): I believe back then there was no such thing as tweezers or something (Have to have some excuse for my awful untamed brows)! Ah youth! Count your blessing at how lucky you are I’ve shared such an embarrassing photo with you! But it’s a darn fun post isn’t it and a good excuse to pimp Lush!

Guerlain Forever Gold FOTD with Review By Isabella Muse on December 20, 2007 15 Comments in Face of the Day , Guerlain I cautiously cracked open one of my bottles of Forever Gold this morning (I know I’m such a daredevil rebel aren’t I?)! You wanna be just like me when you grow up don’t you!? Who’d have thought I’d actually try to use this stuff! It is the Holy Grail after all and when I purchased two bottles I was thinking that I’d take them out of my beauty vault on special occasions, stroke them lovingly, tell them how pretty they are, make empty promises to them about possibly using them in the near future and then tuck them safely back into my vault. But today…. Surprise Surprise! I used a bottle. My god it felt absolutely decadent spraying my face and bosom with $78 Gold Shimmer! I take it this is how Paris Hilton feels (I picture her bathing in liquid gold for some reason or another as she just looks the type ya know?). As I sat there trying to very gently depress the pump I suddenly got overwhelmingly daring and instead of just doing one tiny squirt I was doing about 4 or 5! It was madness I tell you! Absolute bloody madness! This is Guerlain Forever Gold for god’s sake what was I thinking!? I was being awful brave this morning! Well….I dunno what possessed me but damn I sure felt like 2 million bucks afterwards! This stuff is magical (or crack I haven’t decided which yet). Seriously it is. As well it should be for the insane price tag! If I wanna be fair to myself I will say I expected crummy results when spraying this on my face. I didn’t think it would spray evenly and I thought I’d have one half of my face dusted in gold and the other half looking strangely vacant. But, Guerlain somehow worked it’s magic and one quick squirt of this distributes an even and beautiful layer of pure gold shimmer right across my entire face! I just went nuts and did a few pumps on my face and my neck and my chest and…well you get the idea (I was tempted to just hose my entire body down with this stuff but I fought the good fight and I decided against using an entire bottle for that purpose! But don’t think I wasn’t tempted to do just that because I surely was!). In all seriousness this stuff rocks in the way of application! It’s such a snap to use! Squeeze once for an ultra sheer layer of shimmer on your face, shoulders, anywhere you want a bit of gold! And as I said earlier it distributes quite easily as long as you hold it a nice distance away from your face or where ever it is you’re applying! The shimmer is a very fine milled powder and it’s not clumpy or gritty. It just simply is. Once you apply it’s as if your skin is shining with gold from within. It doesn’t lay on the skin in a way you can see where it begins so to speak. It becomes one with your look! I refuse to give this a bad review but I do need to mention that it appears that it sort of blew off or just came off in the process of the day! I’m chalking it up to bitter cold windy New York weather and it’s no fault of the product! 12 Hours in and it seems to somewhat diminished from my face but hey what powder, shimmer or shadow do you know that lasts 12 hours straight anyway!? Have I mentioned how in lust I am with this stuff? I think I’m going to make room for it in my bed and snuggle next to it tonight! This is seriously well worth the cash I shelled out for it. Well done Guerlain a very happy fan girl here! If you haven’t picked this up yet I have bad news as I believe it’s virtually sold out everywhere but do try to locate a bottle of your very own from your local Sephora, Saks, or maybe E-bay or MUA.

How much are you loving the way she says “blusher” all proper and ladylike! I haven’t laughed so hard in a long time! This little poppet is positively adorable and I’m positive I learned a tip or two about application! I wonder where she pops off to when she’s on the floor? Studying her notes mayhaps?

"['Recommendation: MAC’s 183 By Isabella Muse on December 18, 2007 Leave a Comment in MAC , Recommendations I’m sure you have noticed that as of late I haven’t been my normal MAC self. I’m normally one for running to the counter to pick up the latest collection (in it’s entirety like the crazy cosmetic demon I am) as soon as it hits the shelf! However, the last few collections, as tempting as they are, have not made their way into my cart. I promised myself that I’d not buy anything from the last few collections while I was busy with Christmas shopping for others. This normally doesn’t prevent me from throwing caution to the wind and just buying it anyway but I’ll be honest MAC has overwhelmed me lately. Collection upon collection upon collection is difficult to keep up with (and expensive as bloody hell)! Up to now I haven’t purchased The Stylistics, Metal X, and Finery Collections. It’s not for not wanting them because I honestly want something from each of them however I really can’t justify the cost during the Holidays at the moment so I skipped (this isn’t to say after the Holidays I won’t be nabbing some goodies)! Anyway…I did indeed throw caution to the wind this weekend and casually strolled around the MAC counter at Macy’s on 34th. You see I had convinced myself that the crowds were so very big that I’d never find anyone to actually help me so I could look but no way was I waiting for a MA to help me and on top of that, wait on the huge line that was reaching all the way across the floor to the Clinique counter. Sadly, my plan didn’t work as well as I wanted and one of my regular MAC MA’s was there to “save the day” and help me make two purchases, one of which I’ll be discussing with you in this post. A few months ago (I think it’s months. It feels like months!) I had purchased two Beauty Powders from MAC Pro in Manhattan and had them ship them over (I was feeling particularly lazy and decided I didn’t want to walk over and do the purchasing myself! It also saved me from purchasing all six colors as I wasn’t there to actually try them!). You can click here to read my review on the powders I did get. Anyway, soon after MAC counters got the Beauty Powders and I soon forgot about the collection and was not tempted at all to purchase the other powders in the color story and other items were higher up on my wish list. Until Saturday. On display with the Beauty Powders was the 183 and I fell deeply and completely in lust with this fantastic little brush (I also feel deeply in lust with another Beauty Powder in this collection which I’ll tell you about in another post). When I seen the brush it didn’t look too familiar and it turns out that’s because it’s only available with this collection and will be gone shortly so I highly suggest and recommend nabbing this $40 brush! I actually didn’t know this at the time and was furiously googling the MAC website on my blackberry trying to find out (as most times when you ask an MA they aren’t always 100% positive). This brush totally makes buffing the beauty powders into your skin a snap! If you’re a mineral foundation user this will be a dream for application. I’ve been using this since I got it on Saturday for my Beauty Powders, for setting powder application on my face, for general blush application, and just for smoothing on whisper set powder under my eyes and it works an absolute treat! 183 is my absolute newest love! The bristles are soft on this with no shedding at all (did you expect anything less from a MAC brush?). The handle is small enough to grasp between your fingers for a nice hold while buffing and it’s just a perfect wonderful brush overall! I wouldn’t call this a kabuki but maybe more of a glorified version of one. The bristles are more flat and not rounded as compared to a kabuki so it’s quite different! This is really a keeper for me and well worth it’s $40 price tag! Grab one before it disappears! The Muse highly recommends the 183! Have it? Love it? Tell me! Want it? Need it? Tell me!

"['MAC Metal X Impressions By Isabella Muse on December 18, 2007 19 Comments in MAC As I was saying in an earlier post the evil lure of the MAC counter got to me and I made a quick pit stop while at Macy’s to browse around and see what was about. Even though I’m a self proclaimed hater of cream eyeshadows the Metal X collection most definately caught my eye! You may remember that I compared many of the glitter liners in this collection to past collections. You can click here for the original post about that. I’m here to say that the glitter liners are not at all awe aspiring and if you have liners from past collections you’re covered. If you’ve never purchased glitter liners from MAC your Muse mostly definately gives them a big “go buy” of approval however if you have them from other color stories these are reruns or at least I felt they were! Again, click here for the comparisons! Now the shadows are most definately gorgeous. I was in lust with all of them! I swatched every one on my hand and was absolutely giddy with excitement at the gorgeous colors! However, I didn’t buy nary a one. I’ve heard absolute poor reviews about the shadows and how crummy the staying power is and I must say that I could be agreement without even testing these on my eyes. The shadows are super emollient so all the tales of slipping, sliding, and smudging off the eyes may very well be true with a shadow that’s so oily in texture. The formula is quite interesting on these and I can see where all the woe stems from as obviously the problem is the texture. Do I still want them? Hell yes! The colors are too pretty not to want them even for a cream hater like myself. However, I may just stick to swapping for one before splurging hard on the entire lot. These need to be further tested on my eye area before I can make any rash decisions about them but from what I have seen so far the texture definately screams drama! Have them?

"['Cracking Apart my Super-Sized Lush Pud By Isabella Muse on December 19, 2007 1 Comment in Lush , Shower & Bath I thought I’d treat you to images of my Super-Sized Lush Pud’s demise! As tempting as it was to throw this entire thing into my tub I did my best to refrain and crack it up so I might enjoy the sweet scent of Snowcake over the course of a few baths instead of just one (plus I don’t think I have the nerve to throw in $27 worth of Bath Bomb and soak without feeling guilt)! My Innocent Super-Sized Lush Pud Bath Bomb (It doesn’t realize what’s coming! *evil laugh*) Awwww naked! A brief tap from the upper part and the bottom begins cracking….Ouch!

So sorry about the delay in my reply but Blogger is a pain in the butt when it comes to comments and it’s difficult to locate comments when they are posted on older posts! So I have to go in post the comment, locate it by searching, and finally reply ? If I’m a little slow going that’d be why!

The Muse wants a army of little girl’s just like her to take over the cosmetic world! Take a look: How about those blending skills folks!? And the lipliner! Sheer perfection! Someone needs to remind Megan she’s gorgeous without the cosmetics ? Click here to visit Megan and her cousin Rows at Mostly Make Up (Mind you Megs is the genius behind the entire blog!

No children were harmed in the making of this video and I promise Rows spoils her rotten and takes very good care of her from what I’ve seen ?

"['Lush Northern Lights Bath Bomb Review By Isabella Muse on October 7, 2014 2 Comments in Bath & Body , Fall Collections 2014 , Lush , Shower & Bath , This is Halloween PR Sample Who wants candy? It’s Halloween we all WANT candy! The Lush Northern Lights Bath Bomb actually contains popping candy to give it a fizz and a pop in your bath tube! This spectacular bath bomb puts on quite a show in the tub and for that reason alone you might just want it! The Lush Northern Lights Bath Bomb is one of several new Lush Halloween 2014 products that have launched recently and will be around for a limited time. This isn’t the first time that Lush has put popping candy in their bath bombs and probably won’t be the least. What is unique about this bath bomb though isn’t the candy aspect but it’s shape! This one is a long circular tube which hasn’t been done in bath bomb format before! Sure you probably own a Lush Fun Bar or two which has the same unique shape but never has Lush done the shape in a bath bomb. It kinda feels like you get more bang for your buck with this size! As you can see above it dissolves into a gorgeous display of sparkling, popping purple, blue, and green shades. It sizzles happily away after you toss it in your bath and crackles happy for a few seconds before dissolving completely and dying your bath water a gorgeous shade of purple. It has a soft soothing scent of jasmine mixed with ylang ylang which lasts well after your bath has ended so your skin will be delicately scented for a few hours after you’ve dried off! Bath bombs are such a quick experience but I love how Lush Northern Lights crackles happily away for several extra minutes compared to your regular bath bomb from Lush. Sometimes you run across one or two bombs from Lush that don’t melt down as quickly and Northern Lights happens to be one. This is a great bathing experience for those that want a relaxing, soothing scented bath! It deserves a back up or two or three! Get it now before it disappears. It’s available at Lush stores or online at www.lush.com. Tried it? Share your thoughts! You may also enjoy...

"['Lush: A BIG Bathing Experience XXL Bath Bombs By Isabella Muse on April 9, 2009 2 Comments in Lush , Shower & Bath Lush has super sized three of it’s popular bath bombs and taken them from 6.3oz to a whooping 28oz! W00t! I’ve blogged super size Lush before when I gave you a peep at my Lush Pud from Christmas ’07 . The concept is the same as the Pud but the bombs aren’t technically “filled” with goodies which makes them cheaper in price and also leaves me wondering are they solid or hallow? I’d say hallow inside as that sure would be a HEAVY bath bomb! No matter what way you splice it you can’t deny these are a fab addition to the Lush line up and the price is quite friendly too as you can get quite a few baths out of one bomb or of course you can just shuck the entire thing in your tub if you’re feeling the need to spoil yourself rotten. Each bomb is $15.95 USD each and available now from Lush NA and Lush UK. They are available in Big Blue, Avobath, and Sex Bomb scents! Likey! Want! You may also enjoy...

"['New Year’s Resolutions By Isabella Muse on January 2, 2008 42 Comments in Babbling Bits , Pieces of Life I’ve gone and decided to make a few Resolutions for myself this year that I so know I’ll break but it’s fun making them anyway and looking back next year to see if I actually keep any of ’em! What are some of yours? Mine are (in no particular order): Drink more water! I’m a big fan of tea and it’s my main drink of choice (I was British in my previous life. Serious!). This year I’ve decided that I’ll add more then 64oz (8 glasses) of water into my diet. It does wonders for my skin so that’s totally an added bonus! I’ll stop stockpiling K-Dramas and start watching them! I have a wicked, weird habit of purchasing the newest K-Dramas on DVD as soon as they launch on YesAsia. I literally stockpile K-Drama like it’s the end of the world and these dramas will somehow aid me during the demise of the planet. I’ve found that I’m way too busy to get through an entire set and my collection is becoming so vast that it’s taking over my DVD shelf. So this year I’ve decided that I won’t so much as glance at any K-Drama boxsets without first watching what I already have! Bloody hell I have ones that were released in ’03! How’s that for ridiculous (I also happen to do this with Bollywood, Anime and Japanese horror films! But thankfully it’s not as bad as my obsession with Korean soaps or maybe it is hmmmmm!!). Holy cow I think I have Hotelier for 3 years now and only watched the first episode! SHEESH! I will only buy parts of a collection rather then entire collections! Again, my obsessive nature gets the best of me and I find that I do the age old, collect them all, pokemon type deal with cosmetic collections! I’ve decided this year I will only buy what I need rather then entire lots of items at once! I’m ridiculously addicted to cosmetics and I’m hoping to think with my head this year and not be so compulsive with my purchases! I will use my limited edition products without feeling guilty! Limited Edition cosmetics bring out the parental side of my nature. I take extra special care of items if I don’t think I’ll be able to get them again and most times I find myself not even using them which is completely and utterly shameful! I collect Chanel palettes and have some over 8 years old untouched, brand new, in the box. That’s fabulously awful and this year I’ve decided I will start breaking into my beauty vault without feeling like I’m breaking the law! I’ve already started on this resolution when I cracked open one of my bottles of Guerlain Forever Gold and went right ahead and used it! Click here for details! I will use that eyeshadow palette this year! I will use those meteorites this year! I will! I will! Maybe! Kinda….Sorta….. I’ll organize my e-mail better and reply faster! I’m terrible with e-mail! I’m unorganized and leave people awaiting replies for ages on end! It’s so utterly rude of me but in my defense I will say that I’m uber busy with life, the universe, and everything so sometimes it’s really difficult to get replies out! I have so many people I want to talk to at once and sometimes I’m just too disorganized to get replies out quickly!!!!!! This year I vow I’ll take better care of my inbox and stop avoiding the mess and start cleaning it up! It’s rather weird that I’m so unorganized when it comes to e-mail as I’m quite an organized person (hell I have my CD’s in alphabetical order and my DVD’s seperated into genres!) but it’s just one of those things I guess! I’ll stop giving millions of dollars to Steve Jobs (Right after MacWorld Expo 2008) This will never happen but I thought I’d add it in anyway. I’m gonna stop biting your Apple Steve! It’s too bloody expensive to be a Mac lover! I will not buy designer shoes and purses that cost more than my future child’s (if I have any that is) education! I promise to get right on this Resolution bandwagon as soon as I have these Jimmy Choo half boots in my possession! Honest! I swear! It’s easy enough to give up LV when J-Lo is doing scary ads for them (That disgruntled pissed off look on her face is from paying $1999999999.00 for that bag she’s holding! How do I know? I wear the same expression when leaving the store with similar bags in tow…well….maybe not…..but the blissful utopia soon ends when the credit card statement comes in the mail! J-Lo must have just gotten her statement! See how she’s ready to fling the bag at someone! “Marc Anthony get over here I need to whip your arse with this bag so I feel better about the cash I dropped on it!”) I love shoes and I love purses and paying obscene amounts of money for them really is sick. E-Luxury sent me a Christmas card this year that must mean I’m either a good customer or I went way overboard! I need to utilize Bag, Borrow, and Steal more often! Click! I’ll adapt my musical tastes to the general population! My taste in music runs from the extreme to the weird. It includes everything from Classical to J-Rock to Heavy Metal and Vintage Rock to Acid (especially Dutch Trance please thanks so much) and most definately Euro Trash oh and don’t forget Show Tunes (Can you say John Barrowman? Hey before Who and Torchwood the man had a singing career (and still does except for his tiny little mistake with his latest CD but no worries he’ll bounce back!)! I rarely venture outside of listening to any of the newer songs that can be found on regular radio stations. About 50% of my CD collection consists of Japanese Rock (I have a rather die hard crush on Gackt. I can’t help myself bish?nen really do it for me!) So basically my main problem is if you stick what’s her name..oh ya…Carrie Underwood or some other “pop” favorite flavor of the month under my nose I’ll probably sneer and turn away! So my Resolution is to accept the flavor of the month and know more about it so when someone casually mentions Carrie Underwood or that Montana girl or those three brothers what are their names? Jonie Brothers? Well if someone casually mentions these people or their songs in a conversation I can be somewhat versed on who they are instead of giving a blank stare and later replying with “Who?” Honestly, I feel rather retarded when someone mentions a popular song and I haven’t a clue about it! Another reason I’m bringing this up is because my sister Tivo’ed Dick Clark’s Rockin’ Eve, don’t ask me why she does this it seems rather pointless to watch this crap after the fact but she does and hey who am I to judge. Anyway she recorded it and about half the musical guests were not even remotely familiar to me. For instance, at one point on Tuesday morning I walked in and that annoying Ryan Seacrest was interviewing the Montana chick and I looked at my sister and said “Who’s that?” (and no it wasn’t because I had an extremely lately night! I generally didn’t know who the girl was!). I later realized that I should KNOW about this girl as people are literally lying to get tickets to her concert and paying huge sums of cash to attend (Thanks to Google I know all there is to know about her now!)! It’s like I’m completely out of touch with the American musical population (and I live in America! There in lays part of the problem! I should know this stuff right?!?!?!)! This year I shall educate myself on popular music! Go from this: To This: I’ll work harder on my relationship! Ahh Edie and Michael! I can’t think of a better picture for this resolution! Long distance relationships suck. My boyfriend lives in England (I honestly don’t think I could ever settle for a man that wasn’t English) and I live in New York (not always hopefully) and over the course of several months I feel like our relationship has hit rock bottom. I’d love to be able to pick myself up, dust myself off, and try harder to make things work better. Stop being sensitive, stop with stupid fights, be more understanding, etc…..I think we generally drive each other nuts lately (or maybe I’m driving him nuts!) and we somehow forgot how to do the thing we do best together, have a laugh. And make fun of Americans! I’m kidding, I’m kidding! I’m a yank myself why would I ever do a thing like that?! I meant to say he’ll make fun of the Americans and I’ll laugh when none are around! See? I’m patriotic and respectful to my country! In all seriousness when you’re fighting so very much with the person you love so much it’s literally kills you a little bit inside with each harsh word and causes for many a sleepless night. I wish we could just laugh again! I’ll take better care of my undereye area! You read my blog so you know how obsessive I’ve been about my undereyes lately and wrinkles! 30 came in October and since then it seems my undereyes decided to say “ok it’s time for us to begin puffing up, wrinkling, and generally behaving badly”! So I’ve decided I’ll take better care of my undereye area (10 years too late but hey maybe I can reverse the damage!)! I’ve been using eye cream since I was like 18 but it appears it hasn’t done much to help with the tiny lines I see forming! I think it has to do with me and my roughness when quickly applying my concealer! This year I’m not going to smooth on I’m going to pat on gently. Wish me luck as the urge to smooth is hard upon me most mornings! For treating my eyes overnight! For treating my eyes throughout the day! Be gone puffiness! I will absolutely NOT keep ever issue of Heavy Metal, Vogue, and Doctor Who Annual! I plan to stick to my guns this year on this. I’m a bit of a geek (I use the term “bit of” very loosely as I wouldn’t want to admit being a full blown geek to my readers when I’ve tricked you all into believing how very posh, suave, and generally awesome I am. I’m exaggerating a little aren’t I?) so that’s where Heavy Metal and Doctor Who Annual come into play. I have issues of Heavy Metal dated back to the late 80’s sometimes I wonder if there might be a teenage boy hidden in my body or something (lord knows I hope NOT!). I do the same with Vogue, I think it stems from my hidden hope that one day I’ll meet Tom Ford and we’ll sit down, have a cuppa and pour over my backdated copies of Vogue together (and maybe he’ll realize he doesn’t want Ivan anymore and would rather play house with me! What?! A girl can dream can’t she?!)! I’m a sad little human being when it comes to Fantasy Art and Vogue. At least Doctor Who Annual can be controlled some (especially since it bloody sucks as of late) but Vogue and Heavy Metal is a bit (again I use that “bit of” terminology very loosely!) out of control at the moment. It’s really a rather sad little habit of mine and it needs to stop. I’m obviously a packrat as you can see. I’ve challenged myself to dig in and E-bay off some of my older issues of Heavy Metal without crying over them when I do it and thrash some of my issues of Vogue. My eyes are watering as I type this…. SOLD! For One Trillion dollars on E-bay (well maybe not this particular issue but I can definately find a 1977 issue that’ll nab me a $100! WAIT! I know! I can be like this guy and sell it all in a LOT! Click! ) Trash awaits me love! You might have to pry this issue from my cold dead hands because chances are I won’t let it go while blood is still pumping through these veins! Organize CP’s better! I’m always happy to arrange a CP for lovely people but the problem is that I’m too busy to get items shipped out in a timely fashion! So I’m sitting ontop of things for ages on end while these poor, poor people await their items! I’ve resolved myself to do better with shipping CP’s out in a timely fashion! I aim to be timely and more organized with CP’s in 2008! Wish me luck! And finally last but never least…..be the best person I can be! I’ve got this covered already I think as I’m not such a bad sort ? I’m generous, I’m very kind, I’m sweet, I have flawless good manners (Told you I was British in another life didn’t I?), I’m giving, I’m honest to a flaw….I’m the super hero type disguised in the short, round, and average suit. Well maybe not super hero……. Hopefully I didn’t bore you too much with my Resolutions! I firgure if I have them down in written format somewhere I’ll be more inclined to keep them! Plus I have all of you to keep me on the straight and narrow path! So….what are your Resolutions this year? Any pack rats like me? Tell your Muse! Happy New Year! By Isabella Muse on December 30, 2007 6 Comments in Babbling Bits Just last week I was wishing each of you a Happy Christmas and now I’ve gone and blinked and a New Year is on us already! I’m hoping this year will be a great one full of health, happiness, and love! I practice the art of nengaj? for New Year. Nengaj? is the Japanese tradition of sending out cards to family members and friends wishing them health and happiness for the New Year. I’m not a crafty person by any means but each year a few days before New Year’s I take to making my own cards to wish all my friends and family a very Happy New Year! I think it’s a great tradition and I’ve been doing it for as long as I can remember since being introduced to it by one of my best friends who lives in Japan. Of course you can just send a card you purchased but I do love making my way to different shops in China Town to locate pretty stationary, stickers, and bits to make the cards with! It’s quite fun! This isn’t something that’s normally done here in the States. New Year’s greetings are done in person, on the phone, or in passing with a simple “Happy New Year” that’s uttered quickly. Of course I take the time out to say Happy New Year but it’s a nice little surprise to get a card in the mail wishing a person well for the New Year! Well…anyway the moral of the story is I think we sometimes forget in the rush of Christmas to remember how important the New Year is. It’s a fresh start. A time for new beginnings. A time to remind ourselves of the things that are truly important in life. To remind our friends and our family how much we love and appreciate them. Christmas and pressies are lovely but I hope you all remember how important the New Year is too! Many Wishes for a Happy, Healthy New Year that’s filled with new beginnings! Adventures are to be had! Take full advantage of life because my dear, dear friends it’s far to short to spend it with a frown on your face ? Sincerely, -Your Muse (for this year and hopefully many more to come!) Year End Review: 2007 Favorites List By Isabella Muse on December 30, 2007 13 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Fab Favs We are soon closing up 2007 and a New Year will be upon us within a few days! In celebration of that I’ve compiled a list of some of my favorite products of the year! Asking me to choose a single favorite item in each category is impossible so I’ve listed a few of them instead! My mind changes often and my taste in makeup changes day to day so something that may have been my favorite last week is probably not the same this week! Most of the items on my list are items that I’ve really enjoyed using this year! Some are age old favorites while some are brand new items! I wish I could take the time out to type a little something about each but if I did we’d end up with a huge blog entry to say the least! I’ve just decided to list my favorites and if I’ve reviewed them before or featured them I’ve included a link so if you’re inclined to find out more you can click the link and be magically transfered to the review or impression I got of the item! You can also comment or e-mail me a question about any of the items and I’ll be happy to help! I’d really love to hear about your favorite items this year too so please by all means comment or e-mail me ? You don’t need an account to comment ? It’s open for everyone! Much happiness for a great New Year! I hope Musings will be bigger and better this coming year with more of what you want! Thank you for being such loyal readers!

Cineora @ Sasa By Isabella Muse on December 30, 2007 15 Comments in Japanese Brands If you shop Sasa you probably already noticed that they updated the website and have quite a few new items. A few months ago Iris from Rouge Deluxe gifted me with a beautiful Cineora Powder and Eyeliner set. You can click here to read about it. Cineora was a brand I never heard about prior to receiving this gift. I had never seen it on my trips to Japan and it was quite brand new to my eye. After trying it I soon fell deeply in love with it especially the powder. You can’t appreciate the powder as much unless you’re facing the dilemma I currently am. As of late my undereye area is extremely dry. I’ve always had dry patchy skin in the Winter and oily in the Summer. But this year I find that my undereye area is suffering terribly. I’m not sure if I can blame it on the weather and to be honest I think much of it has to do with getting older. Fact is I find myself applying eye cream day and night now instead of once daily. I also see the fine lines creeping in and I’m freaking out in a major way. Well…. That’s all rather depressing. The moral of the story is that I normally apply concealer and I pat my powder on under my eye area to set. I am no longer able to do this. My eye area is so dry that applying powder after my cream concealer is literally aging me 10 years or more. Seriously. So now I’m faced with the horror of having to just apply my cream concealer minus powder to set it which means my concealer isn’t lasting as long as I’d like. The powder and the concealer is caking badly due to my eye area being so dry!! The good news is Cineora Powder has saved the day! Serious. The powder is super fine, silky, and light. It smooths under my eye area to set my concealer without creasing, fading, or aging me due to my dry skin! Bless be! I’ve received many an email about the cute packaging Cineora comes in and where can it be purchased etc… The only way you could get this would be jumping a flight or calling on a dear friend (if you have any living in Japan). I’ve never seen this sold online, be it E-bay or online shops. Nowhere have I seen these products sold. So what’s the really good news? Well if my previous post (and this post) have created any lemmings for Cineora you can now purchase it at Sasa.com! I can’t say how thrilled I am this is available at Sasa! It saves me the trouble of asking friends to get it for me and ship it over! It’s a bit more expensive but the packaging and the product is so brilliant I don’t think you’ll mind much shelling out the money! Sadly, they only carry the powder and the mascara. No liner as of yet. But I’m just happy to have a place to replenish my powder and not have my mates running around Tokyo to get this for me! You can click here if you’re interested in fulfilling your need for Cineora! Cineora as far as I know doesn’t have a huge line up and I believe the powder, liner, and mascara is it. But it’s such a killer brand you won’t mind that they don’t have a ton to offer as the powder will completely wow you enough! The powder is available for $16.50 USD and the mascara is available for $13.90 plus Free Shipping for orders over $50! Sadly, the liner (which I love!) is not available as of yet on the site! This is most definately a Muse Approved item! Megan’s Cosmetic Tutorial Take 2 By Isabella Muse on December 29, 2007 10 Comments in Friends The Muse’s little friend Megan is back and teaching us all about cosmetics! I want to adopt this child! She talks like a little English old lady! “Remember to smile!” I love her! Please let me have her! The Muse wants a army of little girl’s just like her to take over the cosmetic world! Take a look: How about those blending skills folks!? And the lipliner! Sheer perfection! Someone needs to remind Megan she’s gorgeous without the cosmetics ? Click here to visit Megan and her cousin Rows at Mostly Make Up (Mind you Megs is the genius behind the entire blog! I’m kidding, I’m kidding!). Note: Megan is only 7 and she’s not really doing up her makeup for a night on the town! She’s simply a very little girl enjoying her older cousin’s cosmetics and having a little bit of fun! No children were harmed in the making of this video and I promise Rows spoils her rotten and takes very good care of her from what I’ve seen ? So no worries that Megan is going wild applying goops of cosmetics and running around London Town with it on and no Rows does not hold a shot gun to Megan’s head while forcing her to depot eyeshadow she only does that with her boyfriend! Hehe…couldn’t resist!']",113ee391d89e87716ab901ff10b89a3c1561967f,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4203,

"['Sephora Glitter Spray By Isabella Muse on January 9, 2008 5 Comments in Pointless Products , Sephora Welcome to my newest category, Pointless Products! This is where I’ll post on a occasion when I run across a pointless beauty products. And believe you me plenty are around! Allow me to christen my new category with my first Pointless Product: Seriously do people really purchase this! No one adores glitter as much as me but the idea of a can of spray glitter sold at Sephora just scares me. This is something a local party store would sell during Halloween right next to the case of silly string! Unless you’re 13 and going to your first boy/girl party this would be a very pointless product! The Muse says stop being ridiculous Sephora! Off to Vegas for CES! By Isabella Muse on January 4, 2008 12 Comments in Of Geeks , Pieces of Life Hello pretties! I’m off to Vegas for CES! Sadly, CES has nothing for the cosmetic lover to muse over however if you happen to be a geek, like the Muse, you’ll be happy to read all about my adventures when I get home! Don’t worry part of my adventure will consist of hitting the MAC Pro store in Vegas while I’m there so it won’t all be about geeky bits! I go to CES, Macworld, and Defcon (and other geeky conferences I won’t mention here for fear of appearing too much like the nerd I am) almost ever year. This year I’m unable to be away too long from my office due to our renewal season being so amazingly busy! So I’ll be away for two days only minor correction it’ll actually be 4 days if you count the weekend (contrary to popular belief I don’t blog all day! I have to earn my crust somehow and blogging about cosmetics just doesn’t cut it. I actually own and operate my own insurance offices with my sister riding shotgun!). Some exciting info about CES: Yoko Ono will be there! I’m one of the few surviving fans ( and Paul McCartney’s a fan too! There’s a joke in there somewhere if you’re quick enough to catch my weird sense of humor!) of the Plastic Ono Band! In my weird musical tastes I somehow see the Plastic Ono band as a musical masterpiece! I’m excited to just meet Yoko Ono as I believe she’s responsible for some of John’s better work contrary to the fans that are calling blasphemy at the moment! If you’re a Beatle fan you (like me) probably have a healthy love hate relationship with Yoko Ono so saying she’s responsible for some of John’s best work is ok to admit! Let’s see who else….Natasha Bedingfield and Mary J. Blige! I’m throwing names out that I think you’ll know because if I start flinging geeks at you chances are you’re going to say “who the hell is she talking about?”. I haven’t quite dug into my schedule yet and I’m not entirely sure what’s going on during what dates and what I’ll be able to fit in and what I’ll miss but I can tell you a few items that I’m hoping to catch up with while there! High-Performance Audio & Home Theater Exhibits Keynote Addresses Gaming Exhibits Emerging Technology Exhibits Robotics Keynote with Winblows Creator Bill Gates (There would be another joke in that!) Jerry Yang is doing some sort of keynote speech as well I believe which I’d like to see! CNET’s Best of CES Awards I’m quite excited! Wish me luck and maybe I’ll score awesome tech gear as well as amazing cosmetic purchases! I doubt I’ll come home from Vegas without some sort of makeup in tow! However, I can’t promise much as I’m attending with a hoard of geeky guys that are most definately not going to want to take time out to shop for cosmetics but we shall see what happens! Wish me luck! See you in a few days ? Happy Weekend! DuWop Moon Venom Review By Isabella Muse on January 4, 2008 2 Comments in DuWop A few weeks ago I had told you about DuWop’s newest gloss entitled Moon Venom. Click for details. The thing with Lip Venom is you either really love and appreciate it or you loath it. It’s really that simple. I fall into the love group. Some people find that the sting is a bit too much to handle and that’s especially the case if you’re sensitive. I’m not sensitive at all and I find the bite from Lip Venom quite nice. I have all the Lip Venoms they have released up until now and when Moon Venom popped up that too got quickly added to my collection. Each release is different from the last in sparkle. That’s about the only difference in the glosses. They all taste the same, they all give the same clear glossy look, they all work the same to plump your lips up however each has a sheer sparkle to them that’s quite different. Flash Venom comes in versions of gold and silver sparkle while Pink Shimmer Venom, you guessed it, comes in a pink shimmering version. Moon Venom falls somewhat into the Flash Venom category as it’s a similar silver however it’s a bit more of an intense sparkle to it so it looks almost iridescent when applied instead of just straight silver sparkle. All in all it’s quite lovely. It does it’s normal duty of making my lips look just bitten plus I get the added bonus of such a beautiful sparkle. At $17USD for such a small tube it’s a bit costly however I find these last literally for ages on end so it’s quite inexpensive for getting so little product that lasts for so long. I use my regular Lip Venom for one to two touch-ups daily and it’s about a year old! Moon Venom is mostly definately a Muse Approved item! But be warned it packs a mighty bite! Paul & Joe Spring Collection 2008 By Isabella Muse on January 4, 2008 12 Comments in Japanese Brands , Paul and Joe , Spring Collections 2008 I asked my most lovely friend, Iris, from Rouge Deluxe to see if Paul & Joe would be releasing it’s X Disney on her end of the world but sadly it appears Paul & Joe will not be bringing X Disney to Singapore shores! Great big sigh of disappointment for Singaporeans far and wide ? I wonder why not. Anyway, that’s the rather bad news! The good news is here is what it looks like (if you haven’t yet been exposed to it): The collection is quite small and I find myself both loving and hating that. I love that I’m not going to have to spend 1 trillion dollars to get the lot of it and I hate that it’s so damn cute that it’s gagging for more pieces in it! Know what I mean? It’s a pretty simple selection of products with alot of emphasis on the uber sweet packaging! I mean look at those containers? So, so sweet! The set includes all of the following: Face Color B The face powder comes in two colors which appear to be a standard pink and a lovely peach color. They are 3,990 yen per a pot which is roughly $36USD each. Bit costly but not too bad considering the cute factor. Hey, money is no object when cute comes into play right? I’m slightly worried these will be a bit on the sheer side but it’s mostly about the collecting it rather then getting big color pay off. Sounds strange but when you collect cosmetics purchasing a product for LE reasons only is a standard practice among the cosmetic junkie elite! Hand Cream Next up we have the hand cream which is darling as well but falls into the silly price range at well. This is selling for 2,100 yen which is about $20USD give or take a few cents! The price has not turned me off to wanting it so it’s definately on the “want” list. I’m also generally curious about the smell. It’s going to be quite funny if it turns out to be unscented! But hey the packaging is damn cute isn’t it?! Milky Lip Treatment Last in the collection is the milky lip treatment. This is 1,890 yen which is about $17 USD or so. Looks equally cute as the other pieces in the collection. Overall, I’d say the hand cream and lip treatment are pointless and the real gems in the collection are the two face powders. In all seriousness if you’re a collector you’re going to want the lot be it pointless or not but if you’re looking to save a dime maybe purchase the pink powder only as that looks the most appealing of the lot! I asked for all four items and I’m hopeful that my mate will be able to locate them all as this is somewhat a favorite of mine so far in the Japanese Spring Collection line ups! Stay tuned for my review on each of these products! How about you? Loving this? Wanting it? Tell the Muse! Lush Be Popular in the Rogerson’s Household By Isabella Muse on January 3, 2008 4 Comments in Lush , Pieces of Life Peter celebrated his 64th with a little Lush! Look at the glow on his face after receiving a Green Green Bubble Bar from Lush! I have no idea what he’s doing with the soap but I believe he’s taking a little sniff either that or he thought he could eat it! One never knows with Peter. The grapevine has told me he ate a bit of the Lush popcorn packaging and soon after realized “soap” flavored popcorn is not all that great for a snack! This has to convince you to buy some bubble bars and soap from Lush now right? If you haven’t been with the Muse since the start of her little blog you might be a bit confused as to who this character is. Confused? Mystery solved by clicking here . Bonus Shot: Peter’s girlfriend Dorothy expressing her enthusiasm for Britain! I imagine she’s thinking to herself “Let’s do it for England kids!” I nicked that expression from someone sorry it was just too good not to add in! I’m sorry I just generally enjoyed this shot and had to throw it into the mix! I had told Jonny that it would’ve been even better had she strolled out just wearing the British flag and naught else (I’m positive Peter would have loved that too)! This pictures remind me how long and in between it’s been since I last talked to Peter :(. You won’t meet a better man to match wits with then him! Sadly, Peter, once in love and lust with me, has left me for his beautiful Dorothy. I try hard not to be too jealous as they traipse across England together living happily ever after! I’m kidding, I’m kidding!']",fc135d8db0e8dc4822c11f076d3b5129870efefa,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4201,
"['Parado Eyeliner By Isabella Muse on January 3, 2008 6 Comments in Japanese Brands Parado’s newest eyeliner could take the place of MAC Technakohl for me! It’s looks mighty fabulous my dears! I love soft kohl liners as they are always a snap to use when you don’t have a steady hand for liquid liners! It’s on my wish list! Want it? Need it? This could reach Muse Approved status soon! Check back for my review soon! Latest Obsession: Napoleon Perdis Eye Patrol in Private Angel By Isabella Muse on January 3, 2008 7 Comments in Latest Obsession , Napoleon Perdis I haven’t really jumped on board when it comes to Napoleon Perdis. Many of the products get rave reviews but I personally haven’t seen too much to wow me after testing the items at my local Sephora. Honestly, many of the products sounded awesome such as the China Doll Foundation and Concealer. Thankfully I didn’t get crazy and order these items online because it turns out that some are downright awful. At least to my eyes. The concealers and foundations are a weird off orange color that remind me of a sixty year old ex-socialite with a bad orange tan from Miami (Kinda how I picture Paris Hilton in 30 Years). An example of what I mean: We love you Donatella but SPF is always in fashion my dear! Actually, come to think of it many of the foundations sorta match Napoleon Perdis’s spray on tan. To get an idea of some of the colors of China Doll Foundation picture Napoleon Perdis as he is here but with more of an orange overcoat! I’m honestly not being brutal or dissing this brand just for the sake of it. I really felt like the products weren’t at all that great. I was pretty shocked at the colors. Who wears this stuff? For serious. I will say that some products were damn right good and one of which has made it to my Latest Obsession list. I ended up purchasing one Eye Patrol in the color Private Angel. I honestly wanted every single color in the Eye Patrol line. The colors are delightfully sheer yet full of sparkle! Private Angel is thee perfect gold I’ve had the pleasure of owning. It’s a gold color infused with a million little bits of finely milled shimmer. It’s really a versatile color that can be used standing all alone by itself with a bit of liner and mascara or as a base for a more dramatic color or as a highbrow color to light up your current look! For all Napoleon Perdis’s faults I’m saying the line redeems itself with these great shadows! However, I do predict that these products will sooner or later fall victim to the 75% off Sale at Sephora! I’ll be waiting in the wings to snatch up some more Eye Patrol shadows until then! Do check them out! Have some already? Love ’em? Tell the Muse! Beaute de Kose Cyber Shine Eyes Limited Edition Eyeshadow Palettes By Isabella Muse on January 3, 2008 5 Comments in Beaute de Kose , Spring Collections 2008 One of my absolutely fav lines in Japan is Beaute de Kose. They have a fine line of cosmetics and I always love the LE products that are released. These Cyber Shine Eye palettes are most definately on my wish list! Don’t let the picture fool you I’m positive these pack a mighty shimmer and shine contrary to the picture looking matte and ordinary! Cyber Shine Eyes is available in two color variations 01 and 02! It appears 01 is Blues, Purples, and other cool tones while 02 consists of a Gold, Beige, and other warmer tones! I want both to be honest! Not only am I loving the colors the palettes include (and the promise of sparkle) but I’m loving the compact itself. It’s such a slick and shiny affair! Very nice! The palettes are sadly not cheap at 4,800 yen per compact. That’s a bit hefty for a four color palette which somehow, in my weird twisted mind, leads me to believe these should be quite gorgeous! Anyway, these are most definately on my Spring Collection wish list! If you’re loving Beaute de Kose as much as me you might want to check out my post about the Star Twinkle Collection by clicking here ! Want these? Tell the Muse! Stila Cherry Crush By Isabella Muse on January 3, 2008 4 Comments in Spring Collections 2008 , Stila I happened to plop this in my cart when shopping for Benefit Throb powder. Meet Cherry Crush, a brand new lip and cheek stain from Stila: I’m always on the lip and cheek stain bandwagon and this would be no exception as it looks pretty great. Expect a review shortly when I get mine but for now I will say it’s looking rather nice! It’s $24 which is a bit much but I’m hoping this turns into the perfect natural red flush for my lips and cheeks! Want it? I know I do! Can’t wait to get my hands on it! Steals and Deals Weekday Edition By Isabella Muse on January 3, 2008 2 Comments in Steals and Deals These deserve a mention my friends! 20% off your $100 or more at Bliss! I purchased a pair of pink MBT’s with this and couldn’t be more chuffed as that’s an amazing deal! I also stocked up on Shampoo/Conditioner and Shower Gels!

"['Year End Review: 2007 Favorites List By Isabella Muse on December 30, 2007 13 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Fab Favs We are soon closing up 2007 and a New Year will be upon us within a few days! In celebration of that I’ve compiled a list of some of my favorite products of the year! Asking me to choose a single favorite item in each category is impossible so I’ve listed a few of them instead! My mind changes often and my taste in makeup changes day to day so something that may have been my favorite last week is probably not the same this week! Most of the items on my list are items that I’ve really enjoyed using this year! Some are age old favorites while some are brand new items! I wish I could take the time out to type a little something about each but if I did we’d end up with a huge blog entry to say the least! I’ve just decided to list my favorites and if I’ve reviewed them before or featured them I’ve included a link so if you’re inclined to find out more you can click the link and be magically transfered to the review or impression I got of the item!

"['Happy New Year! By Isabella Muse on December 30, 2007 6 Comments in Babbling Bits Just last week I was wishing each of you a Happy Christmas and now I’ve gone and blinked and a New Year is on us already! I’m hoping this year will be a great one full of health, happiness, and love! I practice the art of nengaj? for New Year. Nengaj? is the Japanese tradition of sending out cards to family members and friends wishing them health and happiness for the New Year. I’m not a crafty person by any means but each year a few days before New Year’s I take to making my own cards to wish all my friends and family a very Happy New Year! I think it’s a great tradition and I’ve been doing it for as long as I can remember since being introduced to it by one of my best friends who lives in Japan. Of course you can just send a card you purchased but I do love making my way to different shops in China Town to locate pretty stationary, stickers, and bits to make the cards with! It’s quite fun! This isn’t something that’s normally done here in the States. New Year’s greetings are done in person, on the phone, or in passing with a simple “Happy New Year” that’s uttered quickly. Of course I take the time out to say Happy New Year but it’s a nice little surprise to get a card in the mail wishing a person well for the New Year! Well…anyway the moral of the story is I think we sometimes forget in the rush of Christmas to remember how important the New Year is. It’s a fresh start. A time for new beginnings. A time to remind ourselves of the things that are truly important in life. To remind our friends and our family how much we love and appreciate them. Christmas and pressies are lovely but I hope you all remember how important the New Year is too! Many Wishes for a Happy, Healthy New Year that’s filled with new beginnings! Adventures are to be had! Take full advantage of life because my dear, dear friends it’s far to short to spend it with a frown on your face ? Sincerely, -Your Muse (for this year and hopefully many more to come!)

"['New Year’s Resolutions By Isabella Muse on January 2, 2008 42 Comments in Babbling Bits , Pieces of Life I’ve gone and decided to make a few Resolutions for myself this year that I so know I’ll break but it’s fun making them anyway and looking back next year to see if I actually keep any of ’em! What are some of yours? Mine are (in no particular order): Drink more water! I’m a big fan of tea and it’s my main drink of choice (I was British in my previous life. Serious!). This year I’ve decided that I’ll add more then 64oz (8 glasses) of water into my diet. It does wonders for my skin so that’s totally an added bonus! I’ll stop stockpiling K-Dramas and start watching them! I have a wicked, weird habit of purchasing the newest K-Dramas on DVD as soon as they launch on YesAsia. I literally stockpile K-Drama like it’s the end of the world and these dramas will somehow aid me during the demise of the planet. I’ve found that I’m way too busy to get through an entire set and my collection is becoming so vast that it’s taking over my DVD shelf. So this year I’ve decided that I won’t so much as glance at any K-Drama boxsets without first watching what I already have! Bloody hell I have ones that were released in ’03! How’s that for ridiculous (I also happen to do this with Bollywood, Anime and Japanese horror films! But thankfully it’s not as bad as my obsession with Korean soaps or maybe it is hmmmmm!!). Holy cow I think I have Hotelier for 3 years now and only watched the first episode! SHEESH! I will only buy parts of a collection rather then entire collections! Again, my obsessive nature gets the best of me and I find that I do the age old, collect them all, pokemon type deal with cosmetic collections! I’ve decided this year I will only buy what I need rather then entire lots of items at once! I’m ridiculously addicted to cosmetics and I’m hoping to think with my head this year and not be so compulsive with my purchases! I will use my limited edition products without feeling guilty! Limited Edition cosmetics bring out the parental side of my nature. I take extra special care of items if I don’t think I’ll be able to get them again and most times I find myself not even using them which is completely and utterly shameful! I collect Chanel palettes and have some over 8 years old untouched, brand new, in the box. That’s fabulously awful and this year I’ve decided I will start breaking into my beauty vault without feeling like I’m breaking the law! I’ve already started on this resolution when I cracked open one of my bottles of Guerlain Forever Gold and went right ahead and used it! Click here for details! I will use that eyeshadow palette this year! I will use those meteorites this year! I will! I will! Maybe! Kinda….Sorta….. I’ll organize my e-mail better and reply faster! I’m terrible with e-mail! I’m unorganized and leave people awaiting replies for ages on end! It’s so utterly rude of me but in my defense I will say that I’m uber busy with life, the universe, and everything so sometimes it’s really difficult to get replies out! I have so many people I want to talk to at once and sometimes I’m just too disorganized to get replies out quickly!!!!!! This year I vow I’ll take better care of my inbox and stop avoiding the mess and start cleaning it up! It’s rather weird that I’m so unorganized when it comes to e-mail as I’m quite an organized person (hell I have my CD’s in alphabetical order and my DVD’s seperated into genres!) but it’s just one of those things I guess! I’ll stop giving millions of dollars to Steve Jobs (Right after MacWorld Expo 2008) This will never happen but I thought I’d add it in anyway. I’m gonna stop biting your Apple Steve! It’s too bloody expensive to be a Mac lover! I will not buy designer shoes and purses that cost more than my future child’s (if I have any that is) education! I promise to get right on this Resolution bandwagon as soon as I have these Jimmy Choo half boots in my possession! Honest! I swear! It’s easy enough to give up LV when J-Lo is doing scary ads for them (That disgruntled pissed off look on her face is from paying $1999999999.00 for that bag she’s holding! How do I know? I wear the same expression when leaving the store with similar bags in tow…well….maybe not…..but the blissful utopia soon ends when the credit card statement comes in the mail! J-Lo must have just gotten her statement! See how she’s ready to fling the bag at someone! “Marc Anthony get over here I need to whip your arse with this bag so I feel better about the cash I dropped on it!”) I love shoes and I love purses and paying obscene amounts of money for them really is sick. E-Luxury sent me a Christmas card this year that must mean I’m either a good customer or I went way overboard! I need to utilize Bag, Borrow, and Steal more often! Click! I’ll adapt my musical tastes to the general population! My taste in music runs from the extreme to the weird. It includes everything from Classical to J-Rock to Heavy Metal and Vintage Rock to Acid (especially Dutch Trance please thanks so much) and most definately Euro Trash oh and don’t forget Show Tunes (Can you say John Barrowman? Hey before Who and Torchwood the man had a singing career (and still does except for his tiny little mistake with his latest CD but no worries he’ll bounce back!)! I rarely venture outside of listening to any of the newer songs that can be found on regular radio stations. About 50% of my CD collection consists of Japanese Rock (I have a rather die hard crush on Gackt. I can’t help myself bish?nen really do it for me!) So basically my main problem is if you stick what’s her name..oh ya…Carrie Underwood or some other “pop” favorite flavor of the month under my nose I’ll probably sneer and turn away! So my Resolution is to accept the flavor of the month and know more about it so when someone casually mentions Carrie Underwood or that Montana girl or those three brothers what are their names? Jonie Brothers? Well if someone casually mentions these people or their songs in a conversation I can be somewhat versed on who they are instead of giving a blank stare and later replying with “Who?” Honestly, I feel rather retarded when someone mentions a popular song and I haven’t a clue about it! Another reason I’m bringing this up is because my sister Tivo’ed Dick Clark’s Rockin’ Eve, don’t ask me why she does this it seems rather pointless to watch this crap after the fact but she does and hey who am I to judge. Anyway she recorded it and about half the musical guests were not even remotely familiar to me. For instance, at one point on Tuesday morning I walked in and that annoying Ryan Seacrest was interviewing the Montana chick and I looked at my sister and said “Who’s that?” (and no it wasn’t because I had an extremely lately night! I generally didn’t know who the girl was!). I later realized that I should KNOW about this girl as people are literally lying to get tickets to her concert and paying huge sums of cash to attend (Thanks to Google I know all there is to know about her now!)! It’s like I’m completely out of touch with the American musical population (and I live in America! There in lays part of the problem! I should know this stuff right?!?!?!)! This year I shall educate myself on popular music! Go from this: To This: I’ll work harder on my relationship! Ahh Edie and Michael! I can’t think of a better picture for this resolution! Long distance relationships suck. My boyfriend lives in England (I honestly don’t think I could ever settle for a man that wasn’t English) and I live in New York (not always hopefully) and over the course of several months I feel like our relationship has hit rock bottom. I’d love to be able to pick myself up, dust myself off, and try harder to make things work better. Stop being sensitive, stop with stupid fights, be more understanding, etc…..I think we generally drive each other nuts lately (or maybe I’m driving him nuts!) and we somehow forgot how to do the thing we do best together, have a laugh. And make fun of Americans! I’m kidding, I’m kidding! I’m a yank myself why would I ever do a thing like that?! I meant to say he’ll make fun of the Americans and I’ll laugh when none are around! See? I’m patriotic and respectful to my country! In all seriousness when you’re fighting so very much with the person you love so much it’s literally kills you a little bit inside with each harsh word and causes for many a sleepless night. I wish we could just laugh again! I’ll take better care of my undereye area! You read my blog so you know how obsessive I’ve been about my undereyes lately and wrinkles! 30 came in October and since then it seems my undereyes decided to say “ok it’s time for us to begin puffing up, wrinkling, and generally behaving badly”! So I’ve decided I’ll take better care of my undereye area (10 years too late but hey maybe I can reverse the damage!)! I’ve been using eye cream since I was like 18 but it appears it hasn’t done much to help with the tiny lines I see forming! I think it has to do with me and my roughness when quickly applying my concealer! This year I’m not going to smooth on I’m going to pat on gently. Wish me luck as the urge to smooth is hard upon me most mornings! For treating my eyes overnight! For treating my eyes throughout the day! Be gone puffiness! I will absolutely NOT keep ever issue of Heavy Metal, Vogue, and Doctor Who Annual! I plan to stick to my guns this year on this. I’m a bit of a geek (I use the term “bit of” very loosely as I wouldn’t want to admit being a full blown geek to my readers when I’ve tricked you all into believing how very posh, suave, and generally awesome I am. I’m exaggerating a little aren’t I?) so that’s where Heavy Metal and Doctor Who Annual come into play. I have issues of Heavy Metal dated back to the late 80’s sometimes I wonder if there might be a teenage boy hidden in my body or something (lord knows I hope NOT!). I do the same with Vogue, I think it stems from my hidden hope that one day I’ll meet Tom Ford and we’ll sit down, have a cuppa and pour over my backdated copies of Vogue together (and maybe he’ll realize he doesn’t want Ivan anymore and would rather play house with me! What?! A girl can dream can’t she?!)! I’m a sad little human being when it comes to Fantasy Art and Vogue. At least Doctor Who Annual can be controlled some (especially since it bloody sucks as of late) but Vogue and Heavy Metal is a bit (again I use that “bit of” terminology very loosely!) out of control at the moment. It’s really a rather sad little habit of mine and it needs to stop. I’m obviously a packrat as you can see. I’ve challenged myself to dig in and E-bay off some of my older issues of Heavy Metal without crying over them when I do it and thrash some of my issues of Vogue. My eyes are watering as I type this…. SOLD! For One Trillion dollars on E-bay (well maybe not this particular issue but I can definately find a 1977 issue that’ll nab me a $100! WAIT! I know! I can be like this guy and sell it all in a LOT! Click! ) Trash awaits me love! You might have to pry this issue from my cold dead hands because chances are I won’t let it go while blood is still pumping through these veins! Organize CP’s better! I’m always happy to arrange a CP for lovely people but the problem is that I’m too busy to get items shipped out in a timely fashion! So I’m sitting ontop of things for ages on end while these poor, poor people await their items! I’ve resolved myself to do better with shipping CP’s out in a timely fashion! I aim to be timely and more organized with CP’s in 2008! Wish me luck! And finally last but never least…..be the best person I can be! I’ve got this covered already I think as I’m not such a bad sort ? I’m generous, I’m very kind, I’m sweet, I have flawless good manners (Told you I was British in another life didn’t I?), I’m giving, I’m honest to a flaw….I’m the super hero type disguised in the short, round, and average suit. Well maybe not super hero……. Hopefully I didn’t bore you too much with my Resolutions! I firgure if I have them down in written format somewhere I’ll be more inclined to keep them! Plus I have all of you to keep me on the straight and narrow path! So….what are your Resolutions this year? Any pack rats like me? Tell your Muse! You may also enjoy... Hi There!

"['Lush Wizard Bubble Bar Review By Isabella Muse on October 2, 2014 5 Comments in Bath & Body , Fall Collections 2014 , Lush , Shower & Bath , This is Halloween PR Sample Slip into a relaxing bath with the new Lush Wizard Bubble Bar launching for Halloween 2014 ! If you happen to be a lover of Lush Jingle Spells you’ll be quite excited to know this little Wizard spells just like it! As the weather gets brisk there is nothing I love more than running a hot bath in the evening with one of favorite Lush bath or bubble bars! Slipping into the warm water while listening to the cool wind blow through the trees in my backyard (the window in my bathroom faces my backyard and back deck) is so relaxing. Sometimes I’ll take along Alan Cumming for the ride and watch the latest episode of Masterpiece Mystery while turning into a prune. I don’t really rely on baths to get clean as I’m more of a shower girl. But to wind down after a very long day they are ace! The Lush Wizard Bubble Bar is the perfect Lushie scent to relax with. It smells so quintessentially Lush! Like stepping into a Lush store and being faced, head on, with a variety of fragrances none of which you can actually specifically point out. He has relaxing juniperberry and fennel and he turns your water into a deep, dark swirl of lovely purple. As hard as it is you’ll have to crumble him to use him! Simply start your bath water, crumble up your little Wizard, and he’ll create mounds and mounds and mounds of bubbles and lather you can pop your weary little body into. There’s nothing like ducking under the water with a mound of bubbles frothing on top and just listening to the sound of your own heart beat as you hold your breath for that second you’re under ? This little Wizard also makes your skin nice and smooth plus he scent will linger well after he rinses down the drain! Unfortunately, the Lush Wizard Bubble Bar is only around for Halloween and like any good wizard he’s fast to wave his wand and make a grand exit so grab him before he’s gone for good!

This one sparks, fizzes, and creates a little Halloween boogie time in your bath! Between Lush Sparkler and Lush Northern Lights I’m unsure which is my favorite bath bomb of the moment. They aren’t kidding when they say it’s like setting off fireworks in your tub. Each bath bomb is made with popping candy so it creates a sparkling, fizzy, crackling bath when you drop it into warm water! Not only does it pop and fizzle away happily but it also creates a gorgeous shimmering water! And scent is amazing. Lemony sweet rose!

Yes, you read that right. I hear the cries of rage right now. SO many of my friends are addicted to Pink Sugar as if it were crack. Sadly, it does absolutely nothing for me. I love sweet, I love sugary. However, I don’t love Pink Sugar. It’s revolting to my nose. Sorry for those who love it. It’s just not on my love list. However, I do know it has a quite a cult following. So here’s a Steal and a Deal for fans of Pink Sugar! Head on over to QVC and enter item number A15376 to nab you a duo of Pink Sugar Hair Perfume Sprays! I adore hair perfume sprays, too bad it’s Pink Sugar scented! These are $22.50 for two 3.38oz bottles of the spray! I’ve never seen this offered elsewhere so it could be exclusive to QVC! Happy Shopping Kiss Chocolatier Collection By Isabella Muse on January 9, 2008 2 Comments in Japanese Brands I’m really lemming Kiss’s Chocolatier Collection rather badly! The lipglosses aren’t very me but I must say both look really yummie! What sells me most about the entire collection is the model!

"['The Muse Heads to the MacWorld Expo! By Isabella Muse on January 11, 2008 14 Comments in Of Geeks , Pieces of Life Forget that geeky kid that dates Drew Barrymore! The new spokesperson for Apple should be Gackt! Rawrrrr! Anyway, your Muse is abandoning you again for a few days! Forgive me? The last time I left, one of my readers, Mandy (whom you must all know by now!) proclaimed that “the kids forgot what I looked like” while I was gone! Sadly, they may just forget again as I’m leaving you all again for a few days (you could have a case against me for divorce here! Although, I’ll fight you all to the death as no way am I giving up half my cosmetic collection!). Don’t forget me too much k? *sniff* I’m on my way to sunny California this time (well maybe not sunny!) to pay homage to Apple. This conference consists of a smaller group of people then what you’d find at CES and we all bow low to our leader Steve Jobs while salivating over any bones Apple throws our way. Many geeks consider Macworld the poor man’s (poor man is used loosely as you have to have major bucks to keep up with Apple’s ever revolving technology!) CES but I rather enjoy it! Sadly, many Mac users are forced into the Winblows environment whether we want it or not. I myself run a dual boot with Winblows on one partition, FreeBSD on another, and most importantly, Leopard on my main boot. If it was up to the Muse the world would run on a distro and we’d happily go about life! But sadly that’s just not the case (I may be carrying most of my OS on a thumb drive soon after seeing MS Office released for the MAC! Someone gag me please! This be a marriage most revolting!). Anyway! The good news is while I am in San Fran I’ll be visiting and staying with my very good friend Alyssi! She’ll be joining me on my adventures! I haven’t seen her in at least 9 months now so it’ll be good to catch up with her! Items I’m looking forward to: All of the MacLabs are sold out but lucky enough I have planned ahead and gotten into a fair few! The 15th, Jobs will be doing his yearly keynote and again, I’m very excited about what he’ll be saying! I have quite a packed schedule for the very few days I’ll be there and I hope to get it all done! I’d love to stay longer but sadly work calls me back so I can’t be away too long! I’ll miss you all and I’ll be back shortly with updates ? Stila Illuminating Finishing Powder Review By Isabella Muse on January 11, 2008 4 Comments in Stila I have a mixed review for the Stila Illuminating Finishing Powder for you! I’m currently having a love/hate relationship with these. The texture is lovely. They are made up of a very fine shimmering powder that glides on your face near perfectly. If you try these on the back of your hand you get a rather gorgeous shimmering effect but sadly that doesn’t apply to your face. Upon applying to your face the shimmer is barely noticeable which is somewhat disappointing. It does however create a rather subtle glow on your face. The great thing is wearing these on a clean bare face works some kind of magic. I tried it and it gave me a beautiful highlight and it really helped with the shadows and dullness my skin sometimes has. I haven’t yet tried it but these would probably make a great base for your eyeshadow as well or on their own as an eyeshadow and they are truly beautiful shades! I’m not entirely sure why I’m not completely in love with them as of yet. I think some of it stems from the fact that they appear so much more beautiful and shimmery on the back of my hand but the same effect doesn’t apply when I use it on my face! However, I have read it all depends on what brush you use when applying these so hopefully with a little patience I’ll find the perfect brush to use! Overall, they are really pretty powders! Not nearly as good as MAC Mineralized Skinfinishes but not bad either. At $32 USD per a powder these aren’t cheap sadly however they do have the potential to be great! I’m just testing the waters at the moment so I’m caught between loving and hating them! The packaging is excellent on these in my opinion. It’s a hard aluminum case with an easy pop off lid! It’s quite simple yet cute! I can’t yet give these a Muse approval for purchase but I am slowly falling in love with them! Have these? Love them? Tell your Muse! John Barrowman and Bill Baily on Buzzcocks By Isabella Muse on January 11, 2008 6 Comments in British Babblings , Celebs , Of Geeks Off the topics of cosmetics temporarily ? If you LOVE John Barrowman and Bill Baily as much as me you’ll adore this clip! That’s my new catch phrase! “Talk to the hand because the wrist is pissed” hehe! I’m not sure what had me laughing more Bill Baily with his “I ain’t never gonna be your bitch!” (But he never had a problem being Dylan Moran’s bitch now did he?! I crack myself up sometimes!) or John Barrowman completely agreeing with Simon about what a show whore he’s been of late (Dancing with Stars, Buzzcocks, Torchwood, Who, The Weakest Link, Need I go on?)!

"['Bath and Body Works Spring Collection 2008 Sneak Peak By Isabella Muse on January 10, 2008 8 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Shower & Bath , Spring Collections 2008 I snapped a few pictures of the Bath and Body Works Spring Collection Catalog for you guys! I’m sure some of you have already seen it but my lovely readers in Europe and Asia (sadly Bath and Body Works doesn’t extend to your area but you can always have a lovely mate in the US CP for you!) probably haven’t so here’s a little Sneak Peak at the Spring Collection! Sadly no mention of any Temptations which really stinks as I do look forward to those (Read about prior Temptation line ups by clicking here and here ). I think we might see one new one for Valentine’s Day like last year and soon after we’ll have a Summer Collection! Bath and Body Works Spring Collection 2008 These look fabulous! It’s Orange, Lime, And Raspberry Mentha Body Washes! Mmmm a minty fruity twist! I’m slightly, slightly wary of these as the regular Mentha Body Wash has a strange underlay scent that’s somewhat medicine like so I’m scared these might have that same type of bitterness! However, I am very curious about them! This includes matching glosses as well! Available May 12th: Body Washes $12 USD Each Lipglosses $7.50 USD Each Japanese Cherry Blossom is revamped with a new scent entitled Blushing Cherry Blossom. I’m not a big fan of the Japanese Cherry Blossom as it’s a bit too floral for me however they promise this will be blended with crisp citrus which sounds very intriguing! Available April 21st: Blushing Japanese Cherry Blossom Eau de Toilette $19 USD Blushing Japanese Cherry Blossom Lotion $10 USD The new Far East Escape Collection sounds lovely. The description on this says the ingredients include sake, rice bran oil, and green tea extract. Available January 28th: For Heaven’s Sake Oil to Cream Cleanser $15 USD Rice to the Rescue Body Scrub $17.50 USD Clean Karma Body Wash $13.50 USD Mystic Silk Body Lotion $15 USD Self Medicating Body Butter $15 USD The signature collection also includes a new scent called Enchanted Orchid this too sounds lovely. I’m not big on floral but the scent of orchids is something I do like! This collection also includes a new product called Satin Veil! Available March 3rd: Enchanted Orchid Shower Gel $10 USD Enchanted Orchid Body Butter $14 USD Enchanted Orchid Satin Veil $14.50 USD Enchanted Orchid Eau de Toilette $19 USD Jill Stuart Spring Collection 2008: Seductive Eyes By Isabella Muse on January 10, 2008 4 Comments in Japanese Brands , Jill Stuart , Spring Collections 2008 Jill Stuart’s website has been updated a few weeks ago with the Spring Collection. I just got around to looking through the site today and I must say the Seductive Eye Palettes aren’t thrilling me over much. Of course my inner cosmetic demon is screaming at me to get them. Seductive Eye Palette Colors I was happy to see the model wearing one of the palettes as normally the models appear to be very natural in the eye area but they have really went all out with the current model and did her eyes up rather nicely using one of the palettes. Along with the four new palettes they released a new Cheeky Blush color as well plus the perfume that I reviewed yesterday ( Click here to see Jill Stuart’s Cheeky Blush Line and Click here to read my review on the perfume!). Overall, it’s a very elegant, beautiful collection as always but I can’t help but be a little disappointed. How about you? Want it? Skipping? Tell the Muse! Sana Excel Spring Power 3D Curler Limited Edition Glitter Pink Version Review By Isabella Muse on January 10, 2008 11 Comments in Excel , Japanese Brands , Sana I got myself a Shu curler this past Summer and every since after I haven’t gone back to another curler (read about the first time I became smitten with the Shu curler by clicking here !). I’ve been through many curlers and none have worked as well as my Shu! But the Excel Spring Power Curler did tempt me with it’s allure of Limited Edition Pink Glitteryiness (is that even a word?). When I seen it on the Sana website with the Excel Christmas Collection I knew I had to have it. It was cute, it was compact, and it had something important called “Spring Power”. My god it sure did sound amazing! I love Excel cosmetics so anything else this great brand puts out must be fantastic right? Wrong. Where as the Shu is long, slick, and easy to handle the Excel is more compact which actually isn’t a problem at all. It fits very comfortably in my hand and my fingers slip right in, nice and snug in the handle. The size as far as I can see isn’t a problem at all and I was quite excited about how very tiny it was and how great it fit into my hand. This was surely a sign of wonderful things to come, sadly not! Now the beauty of the Shu curler is it fits the contour of my eye perfectly without pinching, tugging, or just general ouch! The Excel, to my horror, pinches like a lobster (I think I lost a few eyelashes somewhere along the way!!!!). Ow! It doesn’t fit well along the contour of my eye and it almost seems as if it isn’t catching all my lashes plus I have to sort of sit and maneuver it around my lashes and eye, I feel like I’m doing a puzzle and the piece isn’t fitting so I have to sit and jiggle it in. When I finally do have it fitted correctly to my eye and squeeze down I get a really harsh pinch! Ugh! Now the entire idea of a spring back on the handle seemed interesting although I’ve figured out it’s somewhat pointless! When I use my Shu curler I hold down for a few and I’m ready! With the Excel the point of having a “springing” action in the handle seems just to make life more difficult. The urge of the handle to pop right back after making contact with your lashes is instant which leads to a problem of waiting a few for the curl to set in so to speak. If you curl your lashes you must know what I mean! Squeeze once and yes of course your lashes do curl up but the handle snaps back really quickly and holding it down is a bit tricky and tiresome due to the “spring”. I like to hold the curler down for a minute to let the curl set in a little bit. This is especially important if you’re using a curl keeper spray for your curler like I do (if you aren’t familiar with curl keeper it’s an Asian product, it’s not available in the US as far as I know, that you spray on your curler and it holds the curl of your lashes, almost like hairspray for your eyelashes). My next gripe would be with the curler pad. It’s not a soft foam sadly. It’s more like a plastic piece and it’s hard and it hurts. I think the pinching not only comes from the fact that this isn’t fitting my eye correctly but also from the hardness of the pad! Overall, if the promise of a spring powered curler and the delights of pink and glitter have blinded you and you felt the urge to purchase this I’d say you’re better off skipping. This is only cost me about 800 yen I believe so it didn’t break the bank too much! Take your money and buy a Shu curler you’ll be happier! If you’re planning on purchasing this I’ve seen it range from $12.50-$16 USD at Asian online shops so that indeed would be major money lost as at that price you can just buy a high end curler! The weird thing is I believe this is a best seller for Sana but me it’s just money not spent too well! Heroine Mascara Remover Review By Isabella Muse on January 10, 2008 4 Comments in Japanese Brands I love Heroine cosmetics as much as the next girl and I have to say the Mascara Remover isn’t too bad a deal! The sole purpose of purchasing this was to remove heavy duty Japanese mascara like Excel (read my review on Excel’s awesome mascara by clicking here), Beaute de Kose, and other brands. I normally use Sephora brand eye makeup remover (if you have something better do let me know as I’m always on the look out for good eye makeup remover) and it does a great job of getting off anything I put on my eyes even MAC liquidlast! However, it has a bit of a problem removing Japanese mascara especially heavier inky ones (if you use Japanese mascara you know the intense texture). The Sephora remover does a pretty good job of getting it off but after my entire face is cleaned up I’m still noticing my eyelashes are a bit tacky feeling or shedding fibers (if I used a fiber mascara) which means it hasn’t gotten everything! In comes to play Heroine’s Mascara Remover. I firgure after using the Sephora remover and rinsing up my entire face I could use the Heroine as a way of coating off any left over gunk that the other remover left behind. It appears that it does an ok job of it. Today I used KATE Primer and KATE Gel Mascara. KATE’s mascara isn’t particularly difficult to remove but since I used the Primer first it thickens the mascara some and gives me a tiny bit of a problem removing it completely. I swiped some of the Heroine Mascara Remover over my lashes after my entire face was clean (prior to moisturizing). Afterward I wiped each last with a cotton pad. Nothing was on the pad however my lashes lost that “hard” feeling I get when mascara is still on plus my lashes felt soft and conditioned. I’m not sure how well this will work with heavier mascaras but I’m curious to find out. All in all it’ll only set you back about 882 yen ($8 bucks USD) so it couldn’t hurt to try it! The general idea of using this as your primary mascara remover would be nuts and I’m not entirely sure that’s what they expect (I sure hope not) but using it in conjunction with your regular remover you should see ok results! So far I give a tentative ok rating and when I use it again, as I said before, with a heavier mascara maybe it’ll be a glowing review! Have it? What did you think after using it or similar products like it? Want it? Tell the Muse! Stila Resort Collection By Isabella Muse on January 10, 2008 2 Comments in Spring Collections 2008 , Stila Stila’s Spring Collection is in the air! The collection includes one blush duo and three eyeshadow trios. All are repromotes aside from a new shade in one of the eyeshadow trios. To be honest all the trios look brand new to my eye especially gold glow. It’s a very nice collection but not prominent on my Spring Collection Wish List!

FairyDrops Mascara Review By Isabella Muse on January 17, 2008 15 Comments in Fairy Drops , Japanese Brands I’m able to bring you this review thanks to the lovely Taryn who gifted me with this mascara! Thanks Taryn ? ( Click here to read more about the lovely parcel Taryn sent my way!). One thing that I am truly obsessive and passionate about is Japanese mascara. I. Love. Japanese. Mascara. I find Japanese mascara does exactly what I hope for and more. It extends, deepens, thickens, lengthens, and just makes my lashes perfect in all ways! I haven’t met a brand I don’t love! Where as I’ve spent tons of cash on mascara I can get right here in the US I never found one as good as some of the cheapest brands I can get out of Japan! That being said onto the awesome review of Fariy Drops Mascara! Fairy Drops is indeed a unique brand of mascara! You MIGHT be wondering what’s so special about Fairy Drops well if you look at the picture below you’ll see the really interesting and unique wand for this mascara! The wand is the magic in this mascara! Basically it’s made up of three small clumps of brushes. Each brush not only lengthens and thickens your lashes but also separates your lashes so you aren’t dealing with a bit clumpy mess of product! It actually creates an illusion of not wearing mascara at all. I’ve tried many great mascaras that work a treat but none do such a fab job of separating my lashes so well! I normally have to separate my own lashes with a comb after applying but with this I don’t need to! The brush does all the work for me! Not only does it do a superior job of separating my lashes but it also has a knack for catching every single lash! I normally struggle a bit with my inner lashes but this catches them all with one swipe! The texture, like all Japanese Mascaras, is very thick but the difference with this one is it appears a bit on the light side as well! If you’re lashes are a bit sensitive I think you’re safe using this as it feels like the formula is very gentle on my eyes and my lashes are not feeling “hard” for lack of a better word. I feel like I’m not wearing mascara at all! Removal was very easy with minimal rubbing! I swiped each eye twice with a cotton pad and all the mascara came off perfectly. My lashes are thick and strong however I feel comfortable saying this would be a good mascara for those with weaker lashes or thin ones as it didn’t break off any of my lashes during removal. The staying power is great as I put this on around 6:30 in the morning yesterday and I had no fading, flaking, or raccoon eyes so it’s definately standing up to all my tests for long wearing! Overall, it’s an amazing little product that I’m totally in lust with at the moment! Fairy Drops Mascara is most definately Muse Approved for purchase! You can get yours from JPmon! Thanks again to Taryn ? Benefit Thrrrob Review By Isabella Muse on January 17, 2008 15 Comments in Benefit , Spring Collections 2008 I got my Benefit Thrrob Powder ages ago and I’m finally reviewing it for you! YAY! Click here to read my original post about Benefit Thrrob Powder. I have to give this powder a big Muse approval for purchase as I’m in love with it at the moment! At first glance I was pretty disappointed for a few reasons. First of all it looks all too similar to the other love of my life, Dandelion, however I soon find out they are quite a deal different from one another. The second reason I was feeling disappointed was the powder was quite sheer when I first opened the box. Huge sighs of grief left my lips when I seen that the powder wasn’t as vibrantly pink as I had hoped! When I seen this on the site I thought for sure this was the answer to my prayers for beautifully flushed cheeks but upon seeing the powder I thought for sure it was another big disappointment from Benefit! However, I take back all my negative thoughts after using it! The powder is a beautiful silky texture with a touch of shimmer but as I said it’s a bit on the sheer side when you’re just glancing at it! However, after applying it to my cheeks I was delighted that the shade is deeper on, very beautiful, and natural! I actually tried it sans foundation and I found it gave me a lovely little glow of pink that was truly perfect! If you’re in love with natural looking powders and blushes this would be something you’ll want! A little foundation, a little gloss, and some of this will give you a truly fresh, glowing look! If you’re scared of shimmers, glitters, or sparkle you can rest easy as the shimmer in this is very subtle and barely noticeable! First thing I did when I got this was take out my Dandelion and do the comparisons. I have to say that I do get almost the same look from Dandelion however with Thrrob I noticed that the color is slightly deeper and a bit more pink where as Dandelion is pink yet not as deep. I normally apply Dandelion over my blush and let it work it’s magic however I rarely wear it alone where as Thrrob can be used both under or without blush! Although Dandelion can certainly be used on it’s own I found that Thrrob gives a much more brighter look rather! I’m not particularly certain that Thrrob is anymore pigmented then Dandelion however it is a bit more vibrant but not overly so! Thrrob and Dandelion Where as Dandelion is a soft pale peachy pink, Thrrob is more of a true pink. Thrrob goes on as a reddish pink to me so you’re getting that “just out of the cold” look where as Dandelion you get more of a soft, highlighted glow. Thrrob is $28 USD and available now directly from Sephora or Benefit Cosmetics. Overall, I can definately give this a go ahead for purchase! I’m really loving it at the moment! Benefit finally got it right this time and I’m happy to see a product I’m loving by them as it’s been ages since I purchased an item that I wasn’t a tad disappointed with! Good job Benefit! Benefit Thrrob is most definately Muse Approved for purchase! For a different review about Benefit Thrrob click here to visit Mandy and read her thoughts on this powder!

By Isabella Muse on January 16, 2008 11 Comments in Friends My reader and friend Taryn got a beautiful haul of goodies from JPMon a few weeks ago! I actually blogged about it, you can click here to refresh your memory and read about her haul! One of the items she was very excited about was the Fairy Drops Mascara. I got hyped over this as well after seeing the unique brush it came with and was eager to do my own order! Before I could do an order Taryn was offering up her extra mascara to me! *blush* She sent it over with a TON of extra goodies that totally made me sniff! She was amazingly generous and sweet to put such a lovely package together for me and I wanted to show off some of what she sent me! All my awesome goodies! Tada Fairy Drops Mascara! This stuff is amazing! I used it this morning after opening the box! I’ll be doing a review shortly! She also sent me a jar of Jelly Pong Pong Venus Pearls! Holy cow! These are amazing and I’ll be reviewing them shortly! I’ve been wanting to try them for ages and ages! Taryn totally read my mind that I wanted to give these a whirl ? I’ll be reviewing them shortly as these are a must try! Ben Nye Lux Powder Sooooooooooooo shimmery and gorgeous and yum! Love it! Will be reviewing it too soon ? AHHHHHH! Tons of new piggies to try! Yay! Big thanks to Taryn! You totally made my day! I was sniffling while I opened it all! Thanks darling! Big Hugs! Treats from Row By Isabella Muse on January 16, 2008 9 Comments in Friends After getting back from the airport this morning, prior to heading to work, I hopped in the shower, got dressed, and sat down to sort mail! Much to my surprise and delight a little parcel from England was in with the lot of boring bills, catalogs, and other garbage mail! Hmmm what could this be!? Tearing it open out poured a ton of great things! Lush soaps, Soap and Glory Lipgloss, Molton Brown Lotion, sweets, and much more! Oh my it felt like Christmas! I was particularly fixated on the rather large chunk of Lily Savon soap I was holding in my hand as I’ve been dying to try it and haven’t yet! It smelled so good that I held it to my nose during the duration of reading the card and letter tucked into the parcel! Turns out my beautiful goodies was thanks to my most lovely mate Rowene. So this is a HUGE thank you to a very gorgeous friend for making my day brighter when jet lag was setting in! Your thoughtfulness totally made me happy! I’m utterly chuffed to have great pieces of Lush Miranda and Lily Savon gracing my shower! I was so eager to use Lily Savon that I ended up washing my hands with it just so I could try it! I’m a big fan of Miranda and haven’t had any around in a good long while as mailorder UK has a knack for being out of stock everytime I order! One item that happens to not be in the pic is the Boots Eye Gel she sent which is now totally rocking my world for depuffing my tired eyes today! I’ll be reviewing the lipgloss (been wanting to try Soap and Glory for AGESSSSSSSSSS), the soaps, and the eye gel very soon! The card from Rows that’s gracing my fridge door! How cute! The Curly Wurly soon disappeared after this pic! Both actually…and a little bit after that the Black Jack made an exit as well! My tummie is in heaven as I haven’t had a Curly Wurly in a good long while! Sadly the sweets that the Muse sent to Row have been gobbled down by Row’s evil boyfriend! ? Thanks Rows! I’m lucky to have such a great mate like you! You sincerely made my day with your sweetness! *mwah* Ramblings About A Delightfully Broken Resolution! By Isabella Muse on January 16, 2008 26 Comments in Babblings , K-Dramas/T-Dramas , Pieces of Life Well…. I broke one of my resolutions (See my New Year’s resolutions by clicking here ) last week when I ordered Coffee Prince from YesAsia.com but I’m not taking responsible as I was tempted by two evil readers to watch this! It’s their fault not mine! Hehe! I couldn’t wait to get it as it released the 15th, so I ended up going to Book Off (It’s a Japanese Media Store that sells used books, DVD’s, general Manga, etc….) and purchasing the set from them and canceling my online order. It was lucky they even had it as they don’t always get in the latest K-Dramas plus it was an early release (I ended up watching some of this while on the plane to California)! I’d like to thank those two readers, Humming and HT, for the great recommendation as Coffee Prince is wonderful so far! I watched the first 5 episodes and I have to say it’s quite darling within the first few hours so I can imagine how great it’ll be as the story progresses! This is working it’s way onto my favorite list pretty fast and I can’t wait to sit down and watch the rest of it (the entire series is 17 episodes so I’ll be busy for a while!). The subtitles are high quality on this so if you’re purchasing the English version have no fear in that direction! One minor complaint is the subtitles are running by really quickly so I find myself rewinding a bit. I’m sure as I watch more I’ll adjust to the quickness and I really can’t rant too much at all since the quality of the subtitling is excellent with the English DVD version (Although I did catch a few times where they referred to “her” instead of “he” and I’m wondering if that was intentional!??!)! Aside from that the box set was really beautiful and well worth the price (as all Asian box sets are)! I believe they had a special press of the DVD box set but I went with the regular one. It was quite a bargain at $79.99 USD as YesAsia was selling it for $99.99 USD! Yoon Eun Hye is absolutely adorable in this and I was shocked to see her hair cut so short! She can totally pass for a young boy! After seeing her in Palace and watching her in this it’s difficult to wrap my brain around the character she’s playing in Coffee Prince! She presents herself in such a way it’s easy enough to mistake her sex, I find the illusion of her gender especially easy enough to believe as I do not speak or understand Korean so the expression and tones are lost on me. If she is using a feminine tone I wouldn’t notice at all as I’m not familiar with the language enough to catch it so I can easily sit back and see her as a male character without a problem. The tomboy role has been done before with actress/singer Jang Nara in My Love Patzzi but Yoon Eun Hye takes the role of a tomboy and totally turns it on its ear! Gong Yoo looks as gorgeous as ever in this and he counteracts on Yoon Eun Hye’s character so well! The two of them make the ideal, beautiful gay couple (If only Yoon Eun was actually male that is)! Truly they compliment each other wonderfully, one built and tall, while the other is petite and short! It’s also really nice to sit down to a K-Drama that doesn’t have anyone dying (at least I don’t think anyone will) or having some terminal disease! It’s also refreshing to do away with the jealous character as well. (someone had mentioned the same in a comment on my New Year’s resolution post! I must say I don’t mind the jealous character but it’s rather nice to get away from it for a while and just enjoy a funny love story!) K-Dramas can be a little too typical sometimes! This seems to be a really nice romantic comedy! My head can do without the depressing bits and my heart can really enjoy the laughter and love! I burst out laughing quite a few times already(APOLOGIZE! APOLOGIZE!) especially with the “blind date” who had hairy under arms! I was also smirking during the shopping spree and the dressing up of Yoon Eun’s character in a suit! Very cute scene! Kim Jae Wook happens to be in this as well which is no great chore on my eyes by any means. His girlish good looks make me swoon (and of course his character probably plays off of his looks, we shall see!)! He’s only part of the supporting cast but really just seeing him in passing will be wonderful to behold as he’s fantastic eye candy! I think maybe the appeal and beauty of bish?nen is lost on most sadly (but definately not on me!!!!!)! He’s too yummie for mere words! He is by all means Muse Approved. Can I haz him on a plate pleaze? Anyway…..quite off the topic of cosmetics today aren’t I? I just wanted to say thanks to my two readers for recommending this! I love it so far! Anyone watch it? Want to see it? It’s definately not makeup but Coffee Prince is most definitely Muse Approved for purchase! You’ll want your own copy so you can watch it again and again (I haven’t even seen it all yet but I can obviously see it’s going to be a favorite!)! This one was well worth breaking my resolution for! Visee Spring Collection 2008 By Isabella Muse on January 11, 2008 5 Comments in Japanese Brands , Spring Collections 2008 , Visee As reported by the Muse’s gorgeous friend Iris ( Click here to visit Iris), Visee’s website has been updated with it’s new Spring Collection and the Muse is rolling around in fits of excitement at the offerings! I’m especially in lust with the new mascara! It looks amazing (the Muse has a fetish for Japanese mascara). The two new Jewel Crush Eye Palettes look similar to colors that have already been released however I’m still wanting them of course! The new colors are E-6 and E-7 however E-6 appears very similar to E-2 and E-7 looks quite the same as E-4. The only real difference is the colors in the new palette seem deeper. Again, this isn’t preventing me from buying them but I was a bit disappointed the colors were a bit of a rerun! The loose shimmer pigment looks very nice and will pair up nicely with any of the palettes or on their own! Other bits that were released were lipglosses and nail varnish however neither are on my wish list! At the moment I’m currently wanting all the loose powders, the two new palettes, and the mascara! How about you? Iris has done a break down of what Kumi Koda (don’t we all wish we looked as glam as her) is wearing in the promo photos!

"['Stila Illuminating Finishing Powder Review By Isabella Muse on January 11, 2008 4 Comments in Stila I have a mixed review for the Stila Illuminating Finishing Powder for you! I’m currently having a love/hate relationship with these. The texture is lovely. They are made up of a very fine shimmering powder that glides on your face near perfectly. If you try these on the back of your hand you get a rather gorgeous shimmering effect but sadly that doesn’t apply to your face. Upon applying to your face the shimmer is barely noticeable which is somewhat disappointing. It does however create a rather subtle glow on your face. The great thing is wearing these on a clean bare face works some kind of magic. I tried it and it gave me a beautiful highlight and it really helped with the shadows and dullness my skin sometimes has. I haven’t yet tried it but these would probably make a great base for your eyeshadow as well or on their own as an eyeshadow and they are truly beautiful shades! I’m not entirely sure why I’m not completely in love with them as of yet. I think some of it stems from the fact that they appear so much more beautiful and shimmery on the back of my hand but the same effect doesn’t apply when I use it on my face! However, I have read it all depends on what brush you use when applying these so hopefully with a little patience I’ll find the perfect brush to use! Overall, they are really pretty powders! Not nearly as good as MAC Mineralized Skinfinishes but not bad either. At $32 USD per a powder these aren’t cheap sadly however they do have the potential to be great! I’m just testing the waters at the moment so I’m caught between loving and hating them! The packaging is excellent on these in my opinion. It’s a hard aluminum case with an easy pop off lid! It’s quite simple yet cute! I can’t yet give these a Muse approval for purchase but I am slowly falling in love with them! Have these? Love them? Tell your Muse! You may also enjoy...

"['Treats from Row By Isabella Muse on January 16, 2008 9 Comments in Friends After getting back from the airport this morning, prior to heading to work, I hopped in the shower, got dressed, and sat down to sort mail! Much to my surprise and delight a little parcel from England was in with the lot of boring bills, catalogs, and other garbage mail! Hmmm what could this be!? Tearing it open out poured a ton of great things! Lush soaps, Soap and Glory Lipgloss, Molton Brown Lotion, sweets, and much more! Oh my it felt like Christmas! I was particularly fixated on the rather large chunk of Lily Savon soap I was holding in my hand as I’ve been dying to try it and haven’t yet! It smelled so good that I held it to my nose during the duration of reading the card and letter tucked into the parcel! Turns out my beautiful goodies was thanks to my most lovely mate Rowene. So this is a HUGE thank you to a very gorgeous friend for making my day brighter when jet lag was setting in! Your thoughtfulness totally made me happy! I’m utterly chuffed to have great pieces of Lush Miranda and Lily Savon gracing my shower! I was so eager to use Lily Savon that I ended up washing my hands with it just so I could try it! I’m a big fan of Miranda and haven’t had any around in a good long while as mailorder UK has a knack for being out of stock everytime I order! One item that happens to not be in the pic is the Boots Eye Gel she sent which is now totally rocking my world for depuffing my tired eyes today! I’ll be reviewing the lipgloss (been wanting to try Soap and Glory for AGESSSSSSSSSS), the soaps, and the eye gel very soon! The card from Rows that’s gracing my fridge door! How cute! The Curly Wurly soon disappeared after this pic! Both actually…and a little bit after that the Black Jack made an exit as well! My tummie is in heaven as I haven’t had a Curly Wurly in a good long while! Sadly the sweets that the Muse sent to Row have been gobbled down by Row’s evil boyfriend! ? Thanks Rows! I’m lucky to have such a great mate like you! You sincerely made my day with your sweetness! *mwah* You may also enjoy...

Apparently these Stila Illuminating Treatment Powders are big in Japan or at least that’s what Stila says. Stila has been introducing different cosmetic bits that were once available in Japan only over the course of the last few months. Adding to that they have introduced this mineral based powder for a lighter coverage. It also supposedly contains a cooling agent which sounds interesting! I really find water-based, cooling foundations interesting! This is available now from Stila for $45 USD! You may also enjoy...

"['Stila’s Spring 4 Eyes Palettes By Isabella Muse on January 23, 2008 2 Comments in Spring Collections 2008 , Stila Stila has introduced two new quads for the Spring entitled Spring 4 Eyes in two flavors, Montemart and Marrakesh. According the Stila’s website each palette is mini size and the shadows are about the size of a US nickel! They sound very cute but the price tag of $38 USD doesn’t thrill me nor do the colors! The palette itself looks quite nice with the silver embossed Stila logo but I’m not excited enough to shell out nearly $40 for a tiny palette! Montemart is a cool palette that contains shimmering shades of pinks and purples while Marrakesh is a warm palette that contains shimmering shades of golds and bronzes! They look very cute but I think I’ll be passing as I know of at least four other collections that have caught my eye and are on the top of my Must Have List for the Spring (Plus I don’t want to be caught in three months having spent the original price tag and seeing them on sale as Stila has been having a TON of sales as of late!).

"['Ettusais Glitter Princess Collection By Isabella Muse on January 28, 2008 4 Comments in Japanese Brands , Spring Collections 2008 Ettusais has updated it’s website with a new glittery collection of goodies! 5 Glitter Pencils have been released in an array of lovely colors for 1050 yen each and 3 LE Lipglosses are available for 1575 yen! The Japanese and Chinese site has been updated with the latest collection but the Singapore and Taiwanese site has yet to see the update so I’m unsure if my lovely ‘pore friends will be able to nab these! If anyone knows do tell me as I’m curious! I plan on getting maybe one of the pencils and two of the glosses but I’m undecided as of yet. The collection definately looks very cute and I’m a sucker for cute glosses! Want it? Have it already? Tell the Muse! Jonathan Antin Takes on Bath and Body Works By Isabella Muse on January 28, 2008 2 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Haircare Once upon a time, in a land far, far away Jonathan Antin ran his hands through my hair and soon after I fell deeply in love with him. Later on he proposed to me….! Serious! This is all true! Honest! Ok…well…maybe not the part about proposing…I could have made that part up but he did touch my hair but I had to pay him for it which was all a minor technical hiccup! Anyway…I rather like Jonathan and find him sexy in a weird sort of way! I dunno what it is but something is definately there. It could be his California Surfer accent, or it could be his unmovable hair and the fact that he goes around combing it back like he’s The Fonz, or maybe it’s because Jonathan has that certain flair for being gay yet straight (god, I love men who can pull that off)! In reality I think he just holds a certain Tom Ford wannabe look about him which must be what’s tricking me into believing he’s hot. The Muse hearts you Tom and don’t forget it! Anyway who knows what it is! The good news is if you have a certain lust or lemming for Jonathan product you can now get it at Bath & Body Works. Bath & Body Works is now offering Jonathan’s full line of product on there site! Click here to view the line up! So hmmm…. This isn’t too exciting right? We can get this stuff on Sephora if we want it right? Come on though! Think ahead! Think like the Muse and remember that next year when the Semi-Annual Sale comes around you too can make a killing stocking up on Jonathan product for 99.9% off the regular price! Yay! Well…not so Yay because his products aren’t that fab! But it’s ok…we love you anyway Jonathan…especially your hair…we really love that! Speaking for the rest of the population we also really love the way you throw a hissy fit better than any girl in the world! An uncanny resemblance dontcha agree? (For those clever enough you must have gotten that reference to “dontcha”! Come on girls! Wake up! I’m easily amused hehe! Come on! I find less and less to laugh about lately at least let me have my corny ? jokes!) Smashbox O-Gloss Review By Isabella Muse on January 26, 2008 17 Comments in Smashbox Ahh another completely pointless product! What would life be like without them? I purchased Smashbox O-Gloss and have been using it daily for two weeks prior to sitting down to write this review and I’m still somewhat speechless as to what to say about it. It pretty much lacks in all departments so save your pennies and don’t bother. First of all the texture isn’t fabulous. It’s not tacky and it’s not sticky and let me tell you it’s definately not glossy. I really can’t think of a good way to describe how it feels going on. It just feels somewhat blah! It has virtually no shiny factor to it at all and it sorta kinda dries my lips a little bit. The gloss is clear and it’s supposed to “match” your true color and of course I wasn’t expecting much as we all know how much of drama comes with Smashbox O-Glow but it’s safe to say that there isn’t any drama with O-Gloss as it’s completely and utterly clear and doesn’t change color at all, at least it didn’t for me. When you apply O-Glow at least it turns from clear to a delicate shade of pink upon contact with your skin but I can’t claim the same for the gloss. It virtually stays clear in the tube and on your lips. I’ve gotten no color at all from it. Zip, Zero, Nada! Have I ended up with a bad tube? It’s possible as I’ve heard other reviews stating it changes to a bubblegum pink when applied but on me I just get the same dull flesh colored lips! Mind you I’ve been playing with it daily for the past few weeks and it doesn’t change at all! I wouldn’t mind bubblegum pink at least it’s color but it’s clear on me, completely clear! The tube is $22 USD and definately not worth it as it’s a smaller size then your standard gloss plus it doesn’t perform the way it promises. Hell, I wouldn’t mind the price so much if it actually worked. Sorry Smashbox I have to give this one a big thumbs down! Not worth your cash, stay clear! The Muse and The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day By Isabella Muse on January 26, 2008 19 Comments in Pieces of Life My god it’s been the utter week from hell! I need to rant a little! I’ve been so sick since Sunday and I having thee worst agonizing sore throat EVER! If this wasn’t enough about two million other things have happened to totally unsettle my week! My best jubako (I brought it while in Japan! It was sooooo freaking special to me!) was shattered into two million pieces this morning when I grabbed for it quickly! Ugh! GRRR! I was so upset I almost cried! To make matters worst I repacked my bits into a bento and that too freaking fell on the floor (my office kitchen is littered with the remains of my carefully packed bento right now!)!!! My god the horror! How freaking crazy is this!? *sniff* Bloody hell I find packing a bento very relaxing but not this morning! To make things even worst…………!!!!!!!!! I had billing reports due out today and Fed-Ex came early (they came at 10:45 AM?!?! WTH! They are supposed to pick up at 4:30 PM!!!!!!!) and they weren’t done this means that I have to make the stupid long track after work to drop them off at Fed-Ex myself! I wouldn’t mind so much if I was feeling 100% but I’m feeling about 10% at the moment! It’s excruciatingly painful to swallow at the moment due to my very sore throat, I lost my keys and I’m having to use my valet key for my car (I’m so scared it’s going to snap in the ignition), I can’t find anything on my desk at the moment, my lunch is ruined……. My stomach is growling at the moment as I haven’t eaten anything aside from hot tea in two days and I’m not below taking my chopsticks, sitting cross legged on the floor and picking the remains of my bento off the floor…..anyone wanna join me? Pray tell what else can go wrong today? Please can I go home now and back to bed? Did I mention that I can’t find anything on my desk? I said that already didn’t I? Someone shoot me…. Just shoot me…put the Muse out of her misery…… Miserable Muse By Isabella Muse on January 23, 2008 20 Comments in Pieces of Life Hey guys! I know many of you have come to expect daily updates from me 3-4 times a day and I just wanted to say sorry as I’ve been a bit remiss lately because I’m suffering from the worst sore throat ever and it’s making me miserable and quite weak! I stayed home Monday and went to the Doctor yesterday but I’m still feeling very poorly today! I have so much to do at my office today it’s surreal when all I want is my bed! Anyway! I thought I’d compile a list of past posts for you while I’m busy working and feeling yuck so you’ll at least have something to enjoy while I’m slow posting!

"['Bubblegum Pink By Isabella Muse on January 29, 2008 14 Comments in Beauty Babblings I find myself completely fascinated with Bubblegum Pink glosses and lipsticks as of late! It all started after seeing an FOTD of Lancome’s Seashell on Vanessa’s lips over at Nessasary Makeup ! Seashell has popped up on everyone’s blog as of late including our lovely little cookie, Lilan, from the Daily Cookie who I believe the Seashell craze originated from! Lilan is busy converting the blogging community to the delights of Seashell! Thanks Miss Cookie we love you for it! Now your Muse normally stays away from Bubblegum Pinks because they aren’t so flattering on my very full face but nothing could keep me from purchasing two shades of bubblegum pink this season! The new Dior gloss plus the Lancome Seashell has started me on a downward spiral of collecting as many flattering shades of pop pink as I possibly can! I found myself falling deeper in love with such a silly shade of pink when I noticed Yoon Eun-Hye wearing it in her Joinis promo images! You probably already have heard that Yoon Eun-Hye has replaced Kim Hee-Seon as the new face for Joinis. I came across some of her promo images and I just fell in love with Bubblegum Pink all over again! As you can see in the photos below she’s wearing a lovely mod pink which definately wouldn’t work on me but it’s cute none the less and has since changed my mind about lighter pinks! I’ll be doing some FOTD’s using different pinks very soon so do keep your eyes peeled! Loving all this pink? Got some pinks you can recommend the Muse? Tell me! Spring Collections 2008 Round Up By Isabella Muse on January 29, 2008 18 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Japanese Brands , Jill Stuart , Lavshuca , Majolica Majorca , Nars , Smashbox , Spring Collections 2008 Many of you are already in the know about what’s coming up in the Spring but I thought I’d do a bit of a Spring Round Up of the Collections that are popping up with a little commentary about each! Do share your own thoughts and tell me how you’re feeling about these collections! NARS was one of the first Spring Collections I seen pop on the scene with it’s Shanghai Lily Collection. It also happens to have set the theme for this year’s Collections with it’s bold look. As beautiful as the collection is it leaves me with a bit of a question mark hanging over my head as it’s not in keeping with my general look of Spring! The colors are very bold and dark reminding me of a Fall Collection rather then the light feeling of Spring. The star of the collection for me would be the newest eyeshadow in Abyssina which is soft pearl shimmer. Overall, I really do love the look of the collection but it loses some of it’s appeal when the weather begins to warm up and I’m looking for a softer look! If they released this for the Fall I’m positive I’d be all over it like white on rice however this fails to wow me at the moment! I’ll definately pick up Abyssina but the rest I can do without until the colder weather sets in and the feel of Spring has left the air! Smashbox hits another foul ball with it’s Green Room Collection. It consists of tons of bronzey shades and again it appears they confused seasons here. This look reminds me of a more Summer feel with it’s warmer, golden colors! Last Spring we got a rather nice surprise with the Tokidoki Collection however this too wasn’t worth your time. Aside from the gorgeous Tokidoki themed packaging the actual product and colors were a bit too sheer for my lighting thus this year we ended up with another dud. The Green Room Collection fails on all accounts for me and I can’t pick out a single item out of the collection that intrigues me. This one is can be skipped on all accounts. For the sake of being an avid collector I did indeed purchase some of the Givenchy Denim Collection this year just because I’m so diseased but I can’t help but feel ripped off. Again, we have really dark colors for the Spring! I’m starting to get confused what Season we are heading into here! The collection has absolutely nothing to redeem itself and it consists of all dark, deep colors that I can’t even associate a Season with! I hate to say these things as I’m such a collector and fan of Givenchy but this collection leaves no lasting impression on me! Saks also happened to pop up with a new Prismissime for the Eyes which consists of colors from the Sweet and Decandent Chocolate Prismissime. It’s quite lovely and has since made it’s starring appearance on Sephora however again another disappointment. I purchased this even thought I already own the Sweet and Decandent Chocolate Prismissime palettes separately but it’s not an absolutely have to have for a few reasons. One would be the fact that again the colors are completely off Season for me and secondly if you have the original palettes you really don’t need to shell out the cash for this new palette unless you’re as sick as I am! After some confusion it’s finally been cleared up that the blue-purplish blush you may have seen as part of the Collection is an Asian Exclusive, Japan to be exact I believe so of course we got ripped off on that. I debated myself for a while whether I should have my friend get me the blush but I’ve since decided I’ve overindulged in this collection and I really don’t need more items I probably won’t even use! Overall, the Collection is interesting but it loses points for it’s dark colors! If you’re a collector I, of course, recommend it for purchase. If you’re not, it’s safe to skip it! After much debate I decided to get a majority of the Lavshuca Spring Collection! In keeping with the current theme Lavshuca decided to take the Fall road as well and introduce a ton of palettes that contain some bronzey, brownish looking colors with one lighter shade. Again, I’m scratching my head in confusion! A good friend of mine, Mayu, lives in Japan and isn’t so busy at the moment so I’ve had her do the Spring Collection Shopping Spree for me and I ended up getting the new Noble On Eye Palettes. Just call me curious but I have to see for myself what the drama is with these palettes. They intrigue me to say the very least. The new slim style lipshades have also piqued my interest and I’ve decided I must try these as well but if you ask me they just look like the same standard Lavshuca lipstick in new packaging but we shall see! Overall, this too seems to be a disappointment but I’m eagerly awaiting the package which should be here soon so I can review these! Majolica Majorca has my heart this season with their newest Majolook palettes! I cannot wait to get my hands on these! At least the colors are reminding me of Spring here with beautiful pinks, aquas, and golds! Thank you Shiseido for having a heart and gifting us with true Spring palettes! Click here to read more about MJ’s newest Collection! Much to my utter dismay Jill Stuart’s Seductive Eye Collection totally broke my heart. How do I dislike thee, let me count the ways! Matte shadows? My god the horror! Similar to every other JS Palette released? Check. More dark colors? Sheesh. I can’t believe I’m about to admit this but I skipped on all of the newest releases from JS this year and I plan on sticking to my word about purchasing these as they were just not interesting at all!

What have I come across? Let’s see! So far the line has pretty much stayed the same however they stuck three new Body Sprays on the site in the last few days which leads me to believe we’ll see some more new items pop up slowly over the course of the next few weeks!

By Isabella Muse on January 28, 2008 8 Comments in Babblings , Celebs Cosmetics will return shortly but now a word from our sponsor……. Wow. That’s really the only word that comes to mind when I heard that New Kids on the Block are regrouping and rejoining the pop civilization as we know it. Wow. This both scares and embarrasses me. Would you look at Joey’s hat? The height of fashion circa the 90’s! This basically means I have to embarrass myself by admitting that I actually loved this group when I was…11…12….13? It’s so long ago I can’t even recall my age how very sad! If you tell anyone about this I’ll deny it in aces! Prior to discovering what real girly men are made of in Japan I was subjected to the girlish delights of New Kids on the Block (Hey, this isn’t Japan and we have poor imitation girly men here in the states! I just live here don’t blame me!)! Now where as the Japanese produce idols that are seriously drool worthy we here in the US are subjected to such groups as the long forgotten Jordan, Joey, Danny, Mo, Larry and Curly (I forgot the rest of the names so I just added in the bit about Mo, Larry, and Curly). Seriously I really did forget their names oh wait one just came to me! Donny! What about Jordan’s brother what’s his name? We can just go around calling him Mo for the remainder of this post! I remember at first Jordan was the one I cried over (and hyperventilated and fantasized over) and later on I realized that a majority of the female population was actually crying over Joey so I quickly reverted to crying and screaming over Joey since everyone else was doing it and I didn’t want to be the outsider! I think I was a late bloomer as everyone else was way into our friendly boy band before I was and I remember at the time my best friends Ellen and Kelly having their concert on VHS (VHS is probably before your time kids so go and google it) and it would be some sort of Friday ritual to sit down and watch it. Hell, I can even remember Ellen’s four year old sister dancing around to “Hanging Tough”….ah memories! So what’s the point of this fine post? No point! I’m just enjoying taking a trip down memory lane! Actually what I’m enjoying even more is the fact that the potential for funny is definately in this comeback! I need to laugh so bring it on New Kids! I welcome your come back with open arms! I can’t wait to see five grown men regroup and reform a boy band from 100 years ago! This should be awesome! Hmmm…do you think Mark Wahlberg might consider making a comeback with the Funky Punch and releasing a new CD? Maybe not. He’s kinda sorta an actor now I think? Only in American can you go from being Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch to Mark Wahlberg, Oscar and Emmy Nominated Actor! Prior to heading home I leave you with this gem from youTube: “Donny’s D on the backup drug free so put the crack up”! What the hell does that even mean…..I think I’ll e-mail Mark before leaving work and ask him about the lyrics!']",015d0eb66e277d2422fccdb05b4d1207fb04f6a4,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4190,

"['The Muse and The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day By Isabella Muse on January 26, 2008 19 Comments in Pieces of Life My god it’s been the utter week from hell! I need to rant a little! I’ve been so sick since Sunday and I having thee worst agonizing sore throat EVER! If this wasn’t enough about two million other things have happened to totally unsettle my week! My best jubako (I brought it while in Japan! It was sooooo freaking special to me!) was shattered into two million pieces this morning when I grabbed for it quickly! Ugh! GRRR! I was so upset I almost cried! To make matters worst I repacked my bits into a bento and that too freaking fell on the floor (my office kitchen is littered with the remains of my carefully packed bento right now!)!!! My god the horror! How freaking crazy is this!? *sniff* Bloody hell I find packing a bento very relaxing but not this morning! To make things even worst…………!!!!!!!!! I had billing reports due out today and Fed-Ex came early (they came at 10:45 AM?!?! WTH! They are supposed to pick up at 4:30 PM!!!!!!!) and they weren’t done this means that I have to make the stupid long track after work to drop them off at Fed-Ex myself! I wouldn’t mind so much if I was feeling 100% but I’m feeling about 10% at the moment! It’s excruciatingly painful to swallow at the moment due to my very sore throat, I lost my keys and I’m having to use my valet key for my car (I’m so scared it’s going to snap in the ignition), I can’t find anything on my desk at the moment, my lunch is ruined……. My stomach is growling at the moment as I haven’t eaten anything aside from hot tea in two days and I’m not below taking my chopsticks, sitting cross legged on the floor and picking the remains of my bento off the floor…..anyone wanna join me? Pray tell what else can go wrong today? Please can I go home now and back to bed? Did I mention that I can’t find anything on my desk? I said that already didn’t I? Someone shoot me….

"['Smashbox O-Gloss Review By Isabella Muse on January 26, 2008 17 Comments in Smashbox Ahh another completely pointless product! What would life be like without them? I purchased Smashbox O-Gloss and have been using it daily for two weeks prior to sitting down to write this review and I’m still somewhat speechless as to what to say about it. It pretty much lacks in all departments so save your pennies and don’t bother. First of all the texture isn’t fabulous. It’s not tacky and it’s not sticky and let me tell you it’s definately not glossy. I really can’t think of a good way to describe how it feels going on. It just feels somewhat blah! It has virtually no shiny factor to it at all and it sorta kinda dries my lips a little bit. The gloss is clear and it’s supposed to “match” your true color and of course I wasn’t expecting much as we all know how much of drama comes with Smashbox O-Glow but it’s safe to say that there isn’t any drama with O-Gloss as it’s completely and utterly clear and doesn’t change color at all, at least it didn’t for me. When you apply O-Glow at least it turns from clear to a delicate shade of pink upon contact with your skin but I can’t claim the same for the gloss. It virtually stays clear in the tube and on your lips. I’ve gotten no color at all from it. Zip, Zero, Nada! Have I ended up with a bad tube? It’s possible as I’ve heard other reviews stating it changes to a bubblegum pink when applied but on me I just get the same dull flesh colored lips! Mind you I’ve been playing with it daily for the past few weeks and it doesn’t change at all! I wouldn’t mind bubblegum pink at least it’s color but it’s clear on me, completely clear! The tube is $22 USD and definately not worth it as it’s a smaller size then your standard gloss plus it doesn’t perform the way it promises. Hell, I wouldn’t mind the price so much if it actually worked. Sorry Smashbox I have to give this one a big thumbs down! Not worth your cash, stay clear! You may also enjoy...

"['Jonathan Antin Takes on Bath and Body Works By Isabella Muse on January 28, 2008 2 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Haircare Once upon a time, in a land far, far away Jonathan Antin ran his hands through my hair and soon after I fell deeply in love with him. Later on he proposed to me….! Serious! This is all true! Honest! Ok…well…maybe not the part about proposing…I could have made that part up but he did touch my hair but I had to pay him for it which was all a minor technical hiccup! Anyway…I rather like Jonathan and find him sexy in a weird sort of way! I dunno what it is but something is definately there. It could be his California Surfer accent, or it could be his unmovable hair and the fact that he goes around combing it back like he’s The Fonz, or maybe it’s because Jonathan has that certain flair for being gay yet straight (god, I love men who can pull that off)! In reality I think he just holds a certain Tom Ford wannabe look about him which must be what’s tricking me into believing he’s hot. The Muse hearts you Tom and don’t forget it! Anyway who knows what it is! The good news is if you have a certain lust or lemming for Jonathan product you can now get it at Bath & Body Works. Bath & Body Works is now offering Jonathan’s full line of product on there site! Click here to view the line up! So hmmm…. This isn’t too exciting right? We can get this stuff on Sephora if we want it right? Come on though! Think ahead! Think like the Muse and remember that next year when the Semi-Annual Sale comes around you too can make a killing stocking up on Jonathan product for 99.9% off the regular price! Yay! Well…not so Yay because his products aren’t that fab! But it’s ok…we love you anyway Jonathan…especially your hair…we really love that! Speaking for the rest of the population we also really love the way you throw a hissy fit better than any girl in the world! An uncanny resemblance dontcha agree?

"['The Face Chart by Dustin Hunter By Isabella Muse on May 22, 2013 3 Comments in Friends When my parents asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up at the age of five I said, “An artist”….when they asked me again when I was eight the reply was the same….and this continued for most of my youth. Unfortunately, outside of stick figures, I cannot draw, paint, etc…I have virtually no artistic talents. Nada…nothing…it’s kinda hard being an artist when you can’t get past those blasted stick figures. But a rare few of us have that special talent, one of those people happens to be Dustin Hunter . I share a love of makeup and beauty (as well as 80’s soapy mini series ) with Dustin but NONE of his talent. He created the Face Chart to brush up your artistic talents for not only pros but for everyone. The Face Chart are simply blank face sheets which you can use to apply makeup to aiding you in creating new looks or even for practicing on. Pros can use these as guides in a runway show, stage, or film productions or to practice their techniques. Everyone else, like me, can use them as to polish up their skills or create a new look on paper prior to trying it out on your own face! It’s a great way to get in some practice for makeup application and make just make you into the artist you aren’t!

"['@Cosme @ Your Drugstore! By Isabella Muse on February 1, 2008 6 Comments in Beauty Babblings I can’t read characters but I still visit @Cosme for the pretty pictures! @Cosme is basically the same idea as MUA or Total Beauty. The website is the “it” place for up to date information about new cosmetics, collections, skincare, etc….. It contains user created reviews for products and from what I can understand of the site it sure does a great job of keeping on the edge of Japanese cosmetic releases and more! I ran across this gem recently on there site and I thought I’d share because I thought it was rather awesome! From what I can understand these little machines will be installed in drugstores and basically you wave maybe?! either the product or your cell phone over it and it’ll pop the review up on your phone! I’m not sure how it works but it’s basically something that helps with getting reviews from @Cosme to you prior to your purchase! Why this might be exciting to you? @Cosme contains user reviews which means that you’ll get an honest, straight forward answer about the product you’re purchasing from a girl that’s already tried it and either hated it or loved it! How awesome would it be to head to Sephora, pick a blush out (or any other product), and get a user review on the item instantly! I love this idea!

Too Faced Spring 2008 Collection: Galactic Glam By Isabella Muse on January 31, 2008 22 Comments in Spring Collections 2008 , Too Faced Too Faced is taking us too a galaxy far, far away with it’s Spring Collection entitled Galactic Glam! Much of the collection consists of quick fixes such as a new primer, liner and cleanser but some interesting eyeshadows and such have popped up too! Borderline $18.50 USD This pencil is a colorless stick that keeps your lipgloss from traveling all over your face and down your chin to your cheek…etc….you know what I mean right? It’s been done before but Too Faced decided to jump on the bandwagon and do their very own version! I’m slightly curious. I’ve tried pencils like this before and haven’t had much success to be honest. Shadow Insurance $17 USD Nothing can tear me away from my Urban Decay Potion Primer not even Too Faced’s new shadow insurance. This primer promises that your eyeshadow will stick all day however I already have my trusty UDPP so I’m not really needing to try anything new plus my primer is $2 bucks cheaper! Ya Boyeeeeeee! Lip of Luxury $18 USD Now here’s an interesting little lipstick. It’s champagne infused. I wonder what the hell that means? Do you think they inject it with tiny doses of champagne? I’m in if they do! Nothing like a bit of bubbly on the side of my lipstick! I love the cute pink packaging with sparkly diamond topper! The Hopeless Romantic Quickie Palette $29.50 USD Meh…another quickie chronicle? I don’t really like these too much to be honest as I find them messy! They are ok I guess if I can find them on sale but really to pay full price I’m not interested. The set includes two layers instead of the standard one layer so it’s somewhat unique in that! Lash Injection Antidote $23.50 USD This is basically formulated to remove Lash Injection but they forget to mention how much Lash Injection sucks! I don’t need a $23.50 mascara remover when the said mascara comes off without any help at all! Lash Injections sheds fibers like a cashmere sweater! You don’t need a remover when it comes off so easily by itself! Mood Swing $18.50 USD Another lipgloss that promises to be your custom shade of color. Probably doesn’t work. Just my humblest! Galaxy Glam Eyeshadow $19.50 USD Ahhh the star of the show! Now these are something to get hyper about! These shadows are infused with beautiful swirls of shimmering blues, golds, greens, and pink! They look rather awesome to my eye but I’m a tad bit worried that they won’t give the desired look I’m hoping for and just turn black when on! We shall see! Want any of this? Love it? Hate it?

Laneige Darling Big Eyes Palette By Isabella Muse on January 31, 2008 9 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Japanese Brands , Laneige Laneige released a Limited Edition Palette a few months ago entitled Darling Big Eyes. I originally saw this on Kathi’s reviews ( Click here to visit her) and I knew I had to have it! After searching for this in a few countries (Singapore, China, Japan, Etc…) I failed to locate it. It’s like Where’s Waldo to locate this damn thing! Seriously, I’ve had problems locating cosmetics in the past but this particular palette was ridiculously elusive. After some serious hard work I ended up giving up on it and chalked it up as being something I’d lem for life but never own (how dramatic am I?). A week ago I got a random package in the mail and low and behold when I ripped open the envelope out spilled the very difficult to locate Darling Big Eyes Palette! Oh Joy! I was crying in excitement! Turns out a “virtual” friend of mine on MUA had sent it to me as a little present as I gifted her a bunch of tarts and a warmer a few months ago so she remembered how much I was wanting this palette and came across it and got it for me! I now have in my possession this ultra cute palette! Behold: You can’t honestly say this isn’t the cutest thing you ever seen! The palette is ultra tiny and has a little hanging loop on th end which I guess you could use on your cell phone but I’m not so nuts I’ll be using this as a cell phone charm! This contains three shimmering shades of shadow in silver blue, pink, and cream. It flips open to reveal the three shadows and mirror plus it has a sweet little draw that pulls out to reveal two sponge applicators! I haven’t yet used the shadows but I have dabbed my finger in and it appears they are quite pigmented! I think most of the appeal of the palette is it’s size and cute design! Overall, it’s definately a really cute collector’s item and I’m properly chuffed to finally have it! I wish I could tell you the price but I failed miserably at ever locating this so I don’t know it’s original price tag! This particular one is a gift and I don’t want to be rude and ask how much the person paid for it! If you happen to live in Asia definately have a look around and see if you can locate one! I’ll be doing an FOTD shortly with this and I’m eager to try it out for size! I’m also slightly hesitant to use it as it’s too cute to spoil by dipping my brushes into it! Sigh! Have this? Tell the Muse what you think! Want it? Good luck finding it as I had the devil of a time locating one! Laneige Slide Compact in Light Pink By Isabella Muse on January 31, 2008 12 Comments in Asian Brands , Korean Brands , Laneige ZOMG! How much do you love the baby pink slide compact from Laneige? I freaking adore this thing! I have the standard boring blue slide compact but I so want the baby pink one as it goes so well with my iPod and iPhone! Ooooo so pretty! This compact is so geeky chic! I really like the formula of the moisture foundation plus it has SPF which makes me a happy Muse and now even better we got the awesome pink sliding compact!

"['Stila Asian Exclusive: Pon Pon Gerbera By Isabella Muse on February 5, 2008 1 Comment in Spring Collections 2008 , Stila A new Stila Collection is available on the site this morning which is entitled Pon Pon Gerbera and centers around the Gerbera daisy! The new collection is themed as an “Asia Exclusive” but as we know from the Christmas Collection that’s probably not the case at all. However, the collection is very pretty and consists of a new palette, one new blush, a lipgloss, and a glitter liner! As pretty as the collection is I wouldn’t run too quickly to purchase it as Stila has been having a crazy amount of sales lately and I’m positive within a few months these items will be greatly reduced! Pon Pon Gerbera Palette $45 USD Pon Pon Gerbera Blush $18 USD Pon Pon Gerbera Lip Glaze $20 USD Glitter Eyeliner in Purple Pink $18 From what I can tell the only repromote in the collection is the Glitter Eye Liner aside from that the rest of the items are newly released colors!

Bobbi Brown Concealer Palette Review By Isabella Muse on February 4, 2008 22 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Face of the Day You might remember me discussing the Bobbi Brown Concealer Palette last week when Bobbi Brown was on QVC, click here for the details! I tivo’ed the show and ended up fast forwarding through it late one night last week. As I sat there with my cuppa tea and snack size Peanut M&M’s I was somehow tempted by the evil lure of Bobbi to order the concealer palette that she was smearing under the model’s eye as if she was trying to cover up not only dark circles but possibly the entire eye area as well (I blame my spontaneous purchase on the amount of sugar in the M&M’s)! Even while watching her brutal cover up job I was still tempted to order this little palette for my very own. I was especially wanting it after hearing so many rave reviews about Bobbi Brown concealer all over cyber space and beyond! I got it. I used it. And I’m here to review it just for you! Don’t you feel special? Whether I like it or not remains to be seen as I haven’t quite made up my mind if I’m keeping this or sending it back (Yes, you can send back used cosmetics to QVC and they smile and say no problem here’s your money back!). First of all I hate the price. $58 USD gets you a tiny palette and a little baby brush and my wallet it screaming about the amount of cash I dropped on some concealer however if this was available in store you wouldn’t get the brush and it would probably be around the same price so no sense complaining right because after all you got a free bloody brush! The palette contains a light shade of concealer, a darker shade, a foundation stick concealer (which I’m confused about!) and a fine white powder to set the concealer. I’m confused what the hell I’m supposed to do with the foundation stick concealer and I can only assume that it’s used as a spot treatment however I have been using it under my eye area truth be told. Why I need two shades of concealer is also puzzling me but I do like the fact that I can play Frankenstein Lab with all the shades and create my perfect shade of concealer. Just for kicks I’ll give you a break down of how I used it and hell I know it’s probably wrong but I find it worked a treat when used this way! I take a little of the darker shade of the two concealers and mix it with the light shade and then I dip it in the foundation stick concealer and mix it up a little bit. I proceed to layer it under my eye and pat it into place. After this I take some more of the lighter shade and I tap it on! Finally I finish it by brushing on a tiny bit of the setting powder very lightly (I can’t do too much powder since I find powder under my eyes makes me appear quite old lately!)! Done! Coverage is perfect. It really does cover well. However, coverage comes at a price and I find the formula is very heavy for my particular eye area. I’m getting old, my god did I just say that? and I’m noticing that my eye area is very delicate and dry and this particular concealer takes a bit of work to blend which I’m not liking! I don’t like touching my eye area too much with it being so delicate and I find that this needs a bit of work to blend perfectly into my skin. It’s very creamy and appears very moisturizing but it does have a nice knack for sinking into the fine lines under my eyes after a few hours. My regular concealer of choice is Benefit Bo-ing but I switched over to Dior’s Skinfinish Radiance Booster Pen when I noticed it was settling into my fine lines. I find the Dior very creamy and it conceals quite well for me minus the caking under the eye (I don’t recommend it if you have very dark shadows or circles to conceal as it won’t do a good job!). After using the Booster Pen and switching to this palette for a few days I notice that I’m getting much better coverage but I’m also having to deal with patting my eye to remove the excess which is settling too comfortably in my fine lines! Grrrr getting old blows! Overall, the coverage is great but I’m thinking the palette might be for a younger girl to enjoy. If your eye area has some fine lines or is dry this might be something you might want to skip on! I love the fact that this lasts all day long with little to no touch up and I also love how well it covers and makes me look wide awake however the deal breaker is the fact that it cakes a bit and the coverage is very thick! A thicker formula is fab for now but what about Summer? Who wants to walk around with a thick layer of concealer under their eye? The brush this came with is great as well! Strangely enough I love the brush so much because it comes with a cap! Most concealer brushes you have to leave home, either that or suffer concealer all over your makeup bag! However, this comes with a nifty little cap that covers up the messy concealer end of the brush! The brush is dual ended and includes a fluffy powder brush on one side and a harder tipped concealer brush on the other end. It may turn you off that it’s so tiny but I can say it works double duty and is perfect for working the concealer into your eye area plus it’s portable and perfect for touch ups! I love the brush! [email protected] @K a cool cap! Messy concealer be gone! Cover up the brush with the included cap! Click here to see my Visee Aqua Shining Eyes FOTD and you can compare my regular concealer to this FOTD using the Bobbi Brown palette. I really should have done these sans flash but my camera doesn’t take good pics without flash! Sorry! You can see that my eye area looks smoother, brighter, and much more flawless with the Bobbi Brown palette where as in my Visee FOTD my eye area looks a bit saggy, darker, and tired looking! I guess my eye area almost looks whiter too weirdly enough but not in a bad way! However, it does, in my opinion, appear to make my eye more awake and flawless looking! I’m still debating with myself on if I’m loving the palette or disliking it! I think it might work it’s way into my heart soon but that remains to be seen! P.S. Sorry for the lack of gloss, blush, and such! It was worn off after a long day ? These pics were taken quite late so my makeup was longggggg gone! Visee Aqua Shining Eyes FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 4, 2008 17 Comments in Face of the Day Cam whoring it up again! I really liked how this came out so I did some silly pictures and some regular ones! Our lovely angel Iris , had recommend me Visee Aqua Shining Eyes a while back ago and of course when she told me about it the first thing I said was “Nope! Not for me! I don’t like cream shadows!” but of course I should have known that her recommendations are always solid gold! I’ve since collected all the colors in the Aqua Shining Eyes and I love…wait correction….I LOVE them! Here’s an FOTD I created using GD002! I’m posting this with good reason as I’m about to post my Bobbi Brown Concealer Review and these pics will serve as my before and after using the palette! Goofy?! Silly?! Stupid?! Dumb!? Dumber?! Kiss Spring Collection 2008: Chocolatier Collection Review with FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 4, 2008 12 Comments in Face of the Day , Japanese Brands , KISS , Spring Collections 2008 It’s that time of the year again kids! It’s time for the newest Spring Collections that are popping up in stores since as early as the beginning of January! Many beautiful products await my review this week and I have a ton of new items to review, discuss, and show you guys! I’m going to launch my week of review with Kiss’s newest Spring Collection entitled Chocolatier which is a small, yet beautiful collection of goodies! I’m not sure you can call this an official Spring release as it only consists of a palette and two lipglosses however the quality more than makes up for the quantity! You can click here to read my original post about this line up! I originally thought I’d just want the Mocha Chocolate gloss but since my obsession with pink gloss has set in I decided to get both glosses ( CLICK! to read about my need for pink gloss!). I’ll start my review off by setting in on the glosses! I was shocked to learn that these are flavored glosses as normally Japanese glosses are tasteless however these are flavored and beautifully so might I add! The pink gloss carries the beautiful flavor of strawberry ice cream while the brown gloss carries the flavor of Chocolate Mocha! Neither lacks an artificial taste or smell! They both taste wonderful and the smell is simply to die for, very much like the real thing! This flavor plays a redeeming role in my review since I’m not particularly a fan of the texture on these. The gloss is a bit tacky and sticky which is a deal breaker for me however since they smell and taste so wonderful I forgive the formula. I’m not thrilled with the way these apply either. I find they apply a bit streaky so you really have to layer it on to get good decent coverage! However, even though the formula stinks and the application is crummy once it’s on it looks rather great! This morning I wore the pink. I couldn’t wear it alone since it’s rather sheer however with a tiny bit of Stila Cherry Crush I found the color really looked great. The pink color really popped and although I’m not a fan of such a mod pink I thought it looked rather nice! Sadly, since I’m licking my lips constantly to taste it I’m not sure how long it’ll last on! The formula happens to be very thick and in the running with a MAC lipglass so it’s safe to say once you apply enough of this it should last you a few hours! Overall, I really do like these and I’m pleased to have purchased both! Chocolate Mocha Strawberry Next up, our eye palette! The eye palette has me yearning for brown mascara this morning as I used it. Why? Because brown mascara would have went so well with the beautiful shades of pink and brown! The shadows in this are a pale pink, a dark mauve pink, a sandy beige pink, and a deep chocolate brown liner. These are pigmented enough to create a beautiful, natural look! I have a few Kiss palettes but this could make it’s way onto my favorite list shortly! The colors aren’t exactly Spring but they are natural so it’s very user friendly for all the seasons! I’m particular fond of the beautiful smoked eye look that the chocolate liner creates. All four colors just work so have no fear that you’ll end up with a palette that leaves you puzzled or clueless how to use it. The colors just go together and work well to give you a perfect pink look with a lovely underlay of brown thus the name of the collection comes into play as it reminds me of a Strawberry Sundae with Chocolate syrup on top! To begin my application I used the pale pink shade as a wash of color over my entire eye area from upper brow area all the way to my lid! The diagram suggests applying this particular color on the center of your eye area so I paid special attention to apply it the middle of my lid as per the recommendation of the packaging however I did find that once I applied the deeper pink it washed out the pale color! After this I proceeded to use sandy beige color to highlight my high brown area taking care to blend downwards. After this I used the darkest pink shade on my lid and crease area and completed the look by applying the dark chocolate liner to my upper and lower lash line. I also used a bit of the palest pink on my bottom lash line to brighten up my eye area. I was very, very light with the chocolate brown on my bottom lash line since I find that brown shades on the lower part of my eye makes me appear a bit tired and washed out! Overall, I really love the look the palette and the gloss created together! To create the look below I simply used the Chocolatier Palette plus the Strawberry Gloss! I think brown mascara would have really made the look POP! but I only own black so I ended up using the new KATE Gel Mascara which I’ll be reviewing tomorrow for you! Apologies for all the photos but I was so in lust with the palette I ended up cam whoring big time! I highly recommend nabbing the entire collection for yourself as it’s a beautiful lot of goodies to have! The Kiss Chocolatier Collection is most definately Muse Approved for purchase! Want this for yourself? Already have it? Tell the Muse! Laneige Spring Collection 2008: Snow Bloom By Isabella Muse on February 4, 2008 11 Comments in Asian Brands , Korean Brands , Laneige , Spring Collections 2008 Laneige’s Spring Collection has launched in Korea and is making it’s way across the Asian board. Most of the Laneige sites haven’t yet been updated with the new collection but it is out and available in Korea (lucky you if you live there!)! It’s quite a beautiful collection! Although, I want some of it I may refrain as I haven’t even dug into my Winter Collection from Laneige yet! The collection consists of a loose powder, eyeshadow palette, and blush palette! The packaging is quite beautiful and I’m having a hard time not purchasing all of it! I’m not sure which Asian countries are getting the update aside from Korea and China. I’m also unsure what the import to Singapore will be and if available the price range as sadly Singapore gets hit with a bit of a price jack. The Loose Powder 30,000 KRW (approximately $31-$33 USD or so). The blusher carries the same price tag while the eyeshadow palette is a big lower in price at 28,000 KRW (approximately $29-31 USD). Expect to pay a raise of about $9 -$11 USD per item online. I’m noticing the powder popping up online for $39-40 USD and the blush and eyeshadow palettes at around the same. Point makeup instructions are available on the Korean site if you want to know what was used on the model and how to achieve the look. Overall, another beautiful offering from Laneige!']",d99502a375eefebc74ed80ab68b6f5eafa5afd4c,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4185,

"[""Longing for a Clio Update By Isabella Muse on February 4, 2008 2 Comments in Asian Brands , Clio , Korean Brands One of my fav brands in the cosmetic world is a little Korean brand that goes by the name Clio (Actually it’s an Italian brand thats sold exclusively in Korea! Go firgure!). Clio hasn’t updated it’s site since it’s Fall 2007 Purple Collection and I’m longing rather badly (and hopeful) for a Spring Collection of some kind! I thought I’d drag you all into my melancholy and let you relive some of my old Clio posts! Enjoy! Click here to read my review on Clio Blushers!

New York Times Slams Beauty Bloggers By Isabella Muse on February 1, 2008 30 Comments in Babbling Bits Someone had sent me a link to the New York Times article that is basically slamming beauty bloggers far and wide. Click to read! I thought I’d address some of what was being said in this article because I don’t want Musings of a Muse to end up slandered by any of this. About 99% of the products I review on Musings are items I purchased with my own sweat, blood, and tears. I work a daily 9 to 5 job as a self employed insurance broker where I make money. I proceed to take my money and splurge it on cosmetics! I do not give myself the title of beauty editor, beauty reviewer, or any other important title simply because I don’t think of myself in such a manner. I’m more your average, everyday girl that’s sincerely and seriously addicted to cosmetics in a major, sickening way! It’s rare I get products for “free” from companies and if I do you’ll only ever get my truest opinion on those items. A majority of you already know that if I don’t like something I’m definately not cutting corners when I give my opinion or review! I imagine some PR companies are scared to touch me because of my brutal slandering of a product when I hate it! The moral of the story is I’m not here for free swag nor am I here to pimp products I don’t even like. I am, however, here to interact with each one of you and tell you my truest opinion of items I purchase with my own money not products I’ve gotten free from companies. I am not affiliated with cosmetics companies nor do I endorse them! The Muse is and always will be simply an everyday girl that loves cosmetics with a passion! Getting to know each of you and talking to you daily about products and life is what Musings of a Muse is about for me. I think of each of you as a close friend and it saddens me many of you are far away (most of you are in different countries) and we can’t sit down like normal folk, have a cup of tea, and chat. Musings of a Muse started out as a silly form of entertainment for myself and to this day I am always flattered when I look at my traffic and I see how many girl’s (and guys) come to visit me here! This is my two cents on that article. It hurts and saddens me to think that the Beauty Blogging World is portrayed in such a shady light. The fact that this article is in the New York Times really disappoints me as it’s a newspaper I read daily with great glee (especially the weekend edition). The truth of the matter is that I’ve talked to many of bloggers across our blogging sphere and each one I’ve chatted to and become friend’s with have always been sincere in their intentions to bring readers good, solid content about items they love to use or hate! The next time you stop by Musings or any of your favorite Beauty Blogs think of all the hard work the writer does to keep you updated on current beauty finds! Musings of a Muse will always stay true to it’s origins, A Blog of Musings from a Cosmetic Whore. Cheers! Aube Winter Collection 2007 By Isabella Muse on February 1, 2008 8 Comments in Aube , First Impressions , Holiday Collections 2007 , Japanese Brands , Winter Collections 2007 At the rate I’m going I could have reviewed Aube’s Holiday/Winter Collection next season! Sorry about the delay getting this out! I’ve had this collection for a while and I haven’t yet tried any of it but last night I decided to finally crack it open and take a peek at the colors! When the collection came onto the scene I wasn’t too tempted but later on I decided that I needed to add some of it to my beauty arsenal! They released a pressed powder with this that a friend of mine was unable to locate sadly so I missed out on that! Out of all the goodies I only ended up with three items which were the newest Jewerly Shower Eyes and the two loose shimmering powders! The palette is quite gorgeous although not what I expected. Upon seeing the promo images it appeared the model was sporting a white sparkling baby blue look but upon getting the palette I learned the colors are a tad bit different and it left me slightly puzzling over the best way to get her look but that hasn’t swayed me from loving it! The main color in the palette is a cream gold sparkle followed by a beige bronze color and a dark chocolate liner color. The Shower part of the palette (and star of the shower in my opinion) is the light blue gold infused cream color! It’s a beautiful shade and it really sparks up the main colors of the palette! I’m not going into detail about application here but if you’re interested in understanding how the palette works do click here to review my main review on Aube’s Jewelry Shower palettes! My sole rant about the palette was the packaging. I was slightly disappointed that the packaging wasn’t the standard shiny metallic style. It seemed they changed the compact to a matte finish instead of the regular shiny metallic compact! I really liked the pretty pink shimmer to the old compacts! Old Packaging vs New Packaging The palette sold very well in Japan from what I understand as my mate had a difficult time locating it upon it’s release! The other two items I got were the loose shimmering powders which come in a nice glass bottle. I really love the presentation on these and the packaging is ultra cute however application is a bit messy! The powders come in a nail polish style bottle but they do not have an attached applicator. I thought this would come with a spatula applicator or a brush of some sort attached to the bottle topper but that’s not the case sadly. In order to apply you have to tip the bottle while stopping it with a finger tip and then lightly dab the powder where you want it! It’s a wonderful silky, sparkly powder that can used on your face, cheeks, or body however application is a tad bit messy with just a fingertip for applying. I guess you can use a really slim brush to fit into the bottle and take a little powder out at a time but I’m still wishing these came with an applicator of their own! The two shades available were gold and pink and both are well worth getting as they are truly beautiful shimmering shades! Overall, I really like this collection and I’m glad I decided to get some of it! I highly recommend at least nabbing the palette if you have the means of locating it! Have this collection? Love it? Want it? K-Drama Ramblings By Isabella Muse on February 1, 2008 19 Comments in Babblings , K-Dramas/T-Dramas , Pieces of Life My evil readers recommended I try out Sassy Girl for size! Sadly, I believe it’s no longer available stateside as I couldn’t find it anywhere so I ended up buying a rather shady copy of it from an Asian video store in Queens. I really hate buying versions like this because the subtitles are awful. I normally wait and buy the English Version of K-Dramas but since Sassy Girl is so new an English DVD Set is unavailable. I believe the official release was available from YesAsia upon it’s release in October or November but it’s since sold out and it takes ages to get back in stock! Impatient as I am I wanted it now thus I ended up with this set! So I got it! Yay! I just finished Coffee Prince and I’m happy to say it was rather awesome! As I was telling a reader in comments Coffee Prince isn’t your standard K-Drama! All the normal ho-hom elements are definately in Coffee Prince. Example: Girl meets Boy. Boy is rich, Girl is Poor. Girl and Boy fall in love. Boy treats Girl kinda harshly. Boy’s family strongly disapproves Girl’s background. Yada yada yada etc..etc…typical Korean Soap! However, even though Coffee Prince follows the same old story plot as every other K-Drama I’ve seen it does have redeeming qualities that sets itself apart from your standard drama! The twist of the main character pretending to be a boy is one thing that makes the drama really different and interesting! Plenty of comic relief from a great supporting cast helps relieve the tension in the story! Quite a few sexy, romantic moments really add a nice touch of sweetness to 17 hours you’re wasting on this! The beginning, the middle and the ending is very fulfilling thus when it’s over you’re actually feeling like you’ve lost some new found friends instead of wanting to bawl your eyes out that you wasted time on a soap that killed off one of the main characters! Anyway! That’s my little mini wrap up and review of Coffee Prince ? YAY my copy of Coffee Prince’s Soundtrack! Tis awesome you need it! I’m now looking forward to watching Sassy Girl after all the rave reviews! I just ordered Witch Yoo Hee, SOS, Sweet Relationship, Foxy Lady and Heavenly Forest…so I guess this means my Resolution to NOT buy K-Dramas until I watch what I already have has gone out the window? Sigh. Oh well! I don’t have enough hours in the day to watch all these but it’s sure fun trying to watch at least an hour a night and failing miserably! What are you watching right now?

"['Too Faced Spring 2008 Collection: Galactic Glam By Isabella Muse on January 31, 2008 22 Comments in Spring Collections 2008 , Too Faced Too Faced is taking us too a galaxy far, far away with it’s Spring Collection entitled Galactic Glam! Much of the collection consists of quick fixes such as a new primer, liner and cleanser but some interesting eyeshadows and such have popped up too! Borderline $18.50 USD This pencil is a colorless stick that keeps your lipgloss from traveling all over your face and down your chin to your cheek…etc….you know what I mean right? It’s been done before but Too Faced decided to jump on the bandwagon and do their very own version! I’m slightly curious. I’ve tried pencils like this before and haven’t had much success to be honest. Shadow Insurance $17 USD Nothing can tear me away from my Urban Decay Potion Primer not even Too Faced’s new shadow insurance. This primer promises that your eyeshadow will stick all day however I already have my trusty UDPP so I’m not really needing to try anything new plus my primer is $2 bucks cheaper! Ya Boyeeeeeee! Lip of Luxury $18 USD Now here’s an interesting little lipstick. It’s champagne infused. I wonder what the hell that means? Do you think they inject it with tiny doses of champagne? I’m in if they do! Nothing like a bit of bubbly on the side of my lipstick! I love the cute pink packaging with sparkly diamond topper! The Hopeless Romantic Quickie Palette $29.50 USD Meh…another quickie chronicle? I don’t really like these too much to be honest as I find them messy! They are ok I guess if I can find them on sale but really to pay full price I’m not interested. The set includes two layers instead of the standard one layer so it’s somewhat unique in that! Lash Injection Antidote $23.50 USD This is basically formulated to remove Lash Injection but they forget to mention how much Lash Injection sucks! I don’t need a $23.50 mascara remover when the said mascara comes off without any help at all! Lash Injections sheds fibers like a cashmere sweater! You don’t need a remover when it comes off so easily by itself! Mood Swing $18.50 USD Another lipgloss that promises to be your custom shade of color. Probably doesn’t work. Just my humblest! Galaxy Glam Eyeshadow $19.50 USD Ahhh the star of the show! Now these are something to get hyper about! These shadows are infused with beautiful swirls of shimmering blues, golds, greens, and pink! They look rather awesome to my eye but I’m a tad bit worried that they won’t give the desired look I’m hoping for and just turn black when on! We shall see! Want any of this? Love it? Hate it?

Lavshuca Noble On FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 6, 2008 19 Comments in Face of the Day As promised my FOTD from this morning using one of the new Lavshuca Noble On Palettes (If you missed my post on the new Lavshuca Collection do CLICK and have a peek!). This particular palette was the aqua version. I hate the way it came out! I dunno if I can chalk it up as the colors being all wrong in the palettes or just a rushed job of application this morning! I also used one of the new Rouge Essence Bars in RD2. I took pics with and without plumping gloss as I thought it would help with displaying the texture and shimmer minus gloss! Without Gloss With Gloss BONUS: The Muse making an idiot of herself!

By Isabella Muse on February 6, 2008 14 Comments in Celebs I read about the Koda Kumi gossip on a blog a few days ago but Iris from Rouge Deluxe has reported on it as well! If you haven’t yet noticed Visee’s website has been down the past few days and it’s all do to problems with it’s spokesmodel, Koda Kumi! If you’re not familiar with Koda Kumi she’s a Japanese pop star and of course the model image for Kose’s Visee line! I won’t go into details about what happened with her as you can click your way over to Iris and read the details for yourself! I will however say that I don’t think what was said was meant in an ill or mean spirited manner. I guess she thought she was being very “scientific” but it came out completely wrong! However, she’s cost Kose (and herself I imagine) a ton of money! You’d think she’d have known better then to say something like that! I’m wondering what Kose is planning to do with the new line up that just released?! New spokesmodel? Anyway! Thought you might find it of interest if you live stateside and haven’t heard about it and happen to be a fan of Visee or Koda Kumi!

How about you!? Lavshuca Spring Collection 2008 First Impressions By Isabella Muse on February 6, 2008 10 Comments in First Impressions , Japanese Brands , Lavshuca I’m positive many of you will be hyper and happy about this entry as I know quite a majority of my readers are big Lavshuca fans (as am I!). I was excited and disappointed with the Spring releases as the colors ended up being very dark and dull. My excitement at the release of new palettes was definately high however my first glimpse left me feeling rather crestfallen with the color selection being so very “un-Spring” like! The current palettes, entitled Noble On Eyes, have evolved yet again and although they remain familiar in size they differ in small ways from the standard Grade Eye Select Palettes in the general catalog. I was in high debate if I wanted any of this collection but as I am such a mush I gave into temptation and got all five palettes released and three of the new lipshades! A few of the differences that I took note of were the fact that the palette now consists of three colors instead of the standard four shades, the applicator is no longer a dual tipped sponge, it now has a brush on one end and a sponge liner brush on the other side, and the packaging of the palette is slightly different in color and design. The new packaging carries a floral cut along the outer edge all the way around and the color went from pinkish purple to a dark purplish pink. Evolution of the Lavshuca Palette Most shocking is the fact that each of these palettes appear to carry all the same dark base colors while leaving us with one vibrant shade for our lid! Le Sigh! How very boring! However, the good news is that each has a bit of a lighter or darker shade to it so really even though they appear the same they have little tiny differences! Still disappointing none the less but at least it’s not a total loss that I have five palettes with the exact same colors! The palettes come in a pink, blue, green, orange, and tan variation. To create your look with these you’ll be using the lightest shade (on the bottom left corner) on your highbrow as a highlighter and also as a liner for your bottom lash line. You’ll use the middle color on your crease and the dark shade (upper right hand) as a liner. This is basically what I can glean from the diagram. Hmm. Sounds interesting!? I guess it’s best we use our imaginations while applying and see what we can do with such wonky colors! From what I can see BR1 and BG1 carry the same base colors while the middle color is different! PK1 may look dark but actually the lower left hand corner color appears to be a very sandy pink color to my eyes! GN1’s lower color is a golden sheen while OR1 is a sandy beige. The upper color is mostly the same in three out of five of the palettes. OR1, BG1, and BR1 appear the be the same while GN1 is a lighter variation and PK1 is the lightest in the lot! So even though they appear to carry the same colors they are very slightly different from each other aside from BR1 and BG1. The Spring Collection happened to bring a new color release for the Grade Color Select palettes which I didn’t get as it was blacks and grays and I have plenty of each. Sadly, no new colors for the Grade Eye Select which may mean they are phasing them out of the catalog. I hope not as they are actually my favorite! We shall see what Summer brings! It deserves to be mentioned that color pay off is what you make of it. A lighter hand will get you a beautiful natural look while a heavier hand that’s packing on color with leave you with a more bolder, vibrant look. Lavshuca shadows have good pigment to them and with a little work you can create a lovely eye with them! I used BG1 this morning and sadly it came out a complete mess to me. Working the darker browns with the lighter aqua shade in the palette was difficult at best. The completed look, to me, appears very washed out and just ugly. I’m really not loving how these combine! Although they look great on Puffy in the promo images I am unable to prefect the same look. Using the darkest shade to line the aqua just made it a mess so I ended up removing it and tried applying the darker shade to my lid while highlighting with the aqua, again I got crummy results. I somehow ended up with the lightest shade highlighting my highbrow, the aqua all over my crease and lid, and the darkest shade applied lightly on my lid and lining my upper lashline! After all this drama I think it came out crap! Maybe I was rushing too much this morning so I can’t give these a totally bad review yet! I have to test a bit more to make my final decision. With the palettes they also introduced a brand new lipstick entitled Rouge Essence Bar. To me it’s basically the same old standard lipsticks but in keeping with the current theme they just packaged it different. However, the formula for these does appear creamier and less gritty then the original lipshades. I find the old lipshades had glitter in them and weren’t as flawless to apply as these are plus they had a bit of a gritty feel to them! These are very moisturizing and creamy and have excellent color payoff and indeed they do have a touch of shimmer! I think I may want a few more of these! I ended up purchasing three colors. RS1, RD2, and RD1 Evolution of Lavshuca’s Lipstick I’ll be uploading my FOTD later today so you can see one of the palettes in action! I’m not particularly thrilled with these to be honest and I think you can safely skip these if you’re unable to locate them at retail price. If you’re a collector or you can get these at retail they may very well be worth picking up. The lipsticks are a definite buy as I found them very good quality! Overall, a little bit of a disappointing collection! Got some of this? Want it? Loving the shades of the Noble Eye Palettes? Not so much? Discuss! Bobbi Brown Gel Eyeliner Review By Isabella Muse on February 5, 2008 36 Comments in Bobbi Brown I don’t know how but I’ve somehow became a Bobbi Brown groupie (you must be exhausted hearing about Bobbi Brown cosmetics so much this week!). Bobbi Brown is alot like the little boy in kindergarten who hits a little girl because he likes her. I’ve slapped Bobbi Brown around a few times in some old posts as you might recall but it’s probably just me hiding a deeper love for her product then I realized thus I’m the little boy! I was on a Bobbi Brown kick last week so I purchased her gel eyeliner and I’m hear to rave about it! I’m normally a big fan of KATE gel liner or Smashbox cream liner. I rarely venture outside of using those two brands. Fact of the matter is I do indeed collect many MAC Fluidlines but rarely reach for them! My hand normally goes for either KATE or Smashbox. Another fact is I rarely line my eyes. A girl on Specktra once told me that in order to wrap up my look it’s best to line my upper lashline and lower waterline and believe me it was the best advice ever because liner really makes an eye look pop! However, I tend to create very bold looks and using liner on top of that makes me look quite like a “painted lady” (read between the lines). You’ll catch me using eyeliner for an evening out or when I’m using a lighter shade of shadow and that’s about it. Anyway, the story is getting long and you’re getting bored! On with the review! I don’t normally like gel based liners because I find they apply streaky and I have to fill in the area after I apply. Which means I have to have a steady hand to apply and a steadier hand to reapply because the first time I didn’t get the coverage I wanted to begin with! This happens to me with MAC FL much of the time I use it which puts me into a battle of loving and hating it. The good news is Bobbi Brown Gel Liner goes on smoothly, seamlessly and once. I don’t have to re-line the area. One line is dark enough and perfect enough to last me all evening (or day) long! The texture is “melty” and soft but it doesn’t make application difficult. Normally my sole reason I don’t use MAC FL as much as I should is due to the weird melting, soft formula that streaks for me. However, this gel liner applies very dark the first time, no streaks, and gives me a perfect, smooth line! I realize MAC FL has a cult following but I’m not really all that big a fan, sorry guys! However, I’m loving the Bobbi Brown Gel Eyeliner at the moment! Three Cheers for this one! It’s Muse Approved! Before Liner. Aw no pop! After Liner. POP! Sorry lots of similar pics! You can tell I was messing with makeup that night big time right?! Review: KATE’s Newest Gel Mascara By Isabella Muse on February 5, 2008 6 Comments in Japanese Brands , KATE , Spring Collections 2008 After much debate I decided to purchase some of KATE’s newest Spring Collection this season! One item that particularly caught my eye was the new Gel Mascara. I have the latest gel mascara that was released this winter but I decided I’d like to try out the new formula as curiosity got the best of me! I’ll be featuring some of KATE’s new palettes in an upcoming post but for now I’ll be reviewing the mascara for you! I’m not particularly sure if I love or hate the new formula so this is a bit of a mixed review. First of all one of the most surprising factors of the new mascara is the applicator. This doesn’t have the standard brush applicator, in it’s place we have a new short comb applicator. To me it just looks like a stick with little ridges set into it. It’s in no way like the standard MJ Lash Extender comb applicator it’s far slimmer. The good news is if you’re Asian and your lashes are very tiny this may very well be your ideal mascara as the applicator has a special knack for pulling lashes out and forward for beautiful volume! I purchased one of these mascara’s for my sister as she was curious about the original gel formula and this really works well on her minuscule lashes! She has really tiny baby lashes and the applicator worked them out and up very well! KATE’s New Gel Mascara with the new applicator New vs Old (KATE’s new applicator featured on top while KATE’s old standard brush applicator is shown on the bottom) The applicator also works well at capturing lashes in the inner corner of the eye. The lashes in my inner eye are always difficult to get at but this fits right in and takes them from limp to fab! The texture is the same as the original gel mascara to me but maybe a little bit lighter. If you’ve never tried the original formula it basically a very light texture that feels very natural on! I’ve found a lighter hand is best when applying as I did notice it was clumping up a bit while applying. I think a combination of the applicator and the clumping turned me off slightly. I’m not particularly a fan of the new applicator unfortunately. I’m not entirely sure why I’m not loving it as I adore the Bare Escentuals brushless mascara which is almost the same concept as this plus I really love the old Kate Gel Mascara! I think it’s an ok update to the line but I’m not quite at the stage where I can’t live without it. Slightly good news is that someone did comment in my Visee Aqua Shining Eyes FOTD ( Click! ) and asked if I had done something different with my lashes! So maybe, just maybe this is actually doing something good for my lashes! I may feel differently after using this more but at the moment I’m undecided! Have this already? Love it? Want it? Discuss! Bobbi Brown Pink Raspberry Collection Review and First Impressions By Isabella Muse on February 5, 2008 10 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Face of the Day , First Impressions , Spring Collections 2008 Hold onto your seats we are reboarding the Bobbi Brown Train and my week of Spring Collection reviews continues! Taking a little break from the Japanese front today I bring you a Spring Collection from the US shores! I’ve had bumpy rides with Bobbi Brown before but I gave into my need for more Bobbi last week when I seen her on QVC. I dunno what it is but QVC really sells me on cosmetics! Damn them straight to hell and back (scratch the back part! Let them stay in hell and rot!). Seriously, you know how it is when you watch QVC and that sudden hardcore NEED rocks your world and before long you find yourself snatching up the phone like the QVC agoraphobia fan club that does daily calls to review cosmetics and skincare they are using in the comfort of their own homes since they don’t venture outside the house! Wow..that was rather dramatic wasn’t it? But truth be told in that statement my friends! I want to know these people who call QVC at 4AM, my god maybe I’m one of them (no I’m not! I haven’t reached that height of insanity yet thanks very much!)! Anyway. As I’ve been saying for the past few days I’ve tivo’ed Bobbi’s episodes like the mad little lady I am and watched them over the past few days and Bobbi sold me on a few of her items. I think maybe it was that host Lisa that really sold me on the items I purchased. You know the one? She acts like you’ll never ever in this lifetime or your second (if you believe in that sort of thing) will you be able to get this super rare, ultra limited edition palette! MY GOD GET IT NOW BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE! WE ONLY HAVE 2 IN STOCK! IF YOU MISS THIS YOU’LL NEVER GET IT AGAIN (Two days later you find it at your local Cosmetics Company Outlet for half the price!)!!!!!! Wow….what was I saying? Oh yes, Bobbi Brown. Anyway, I was watching Bobbi slather concealer on a model’s eye while making her up with the Pink Raspberry Palette and in that instant, as Bobbi multitasked through a look like the ultra awesome wizard she is, I realized I too, must OWN this palette! I had previously seen the palette in action on Erika’s blog, Makeup Bag , and as gorgeous as Erika looked sporting the palette I just felt it wasn’t me. The hot pinks and dark shadows just weren’t calling my name at all however I did end up purchasing two of the potted rouge colors from this collection previously from Nordies which I meant to review but never got around too! Lucky you I’m going to do it all in one big post (prepared to be bored or enlightened or a little of both)! After watching Bobbi work her magic with the palette I wandered over to her website and started browsing the Pink Raspberry Collection and a few clicks later I had a cart full of stuff I didn’t need but was lemming rather hard (and I didn’t have to pay $4 bucks or more per an item to get it shipped to me! Screw you QVC stop trying to make money off me with your damn stupid shipping costs!)! Somehow, I’m not even sure how, I ended up with all of the Pink Raspberry Collection and I’m hear now to tell say that you too need all of the collection too simply because I don’t want to be alone with my sickness. No seriously you really need to check some of this collection out because it has some rather great items! I think what really sold me on this was the promo images of the models! They look so fresh and naturally beautiful with their full, pink glossy lips and lovely pink cheeks! The palette is really a gorgeous yet simple affair that contains some rather vibrant yet elegant shades! At $55 USD it isn’t totally cheap but you’re getting a nice bit of product for the price and high quality product at that. However, you can safely skip this unless you’re really lemming it hard or you like simple makeup! The look this creates is very simple, pretty but still somewhat dull in my opinion! The shadows are matte and plain but the blush somehow makes up for that and when used together you get rather vibrant eyes with popping cheeks if that makes sense at all! You’ll get a beautiful pink blush, two lip creams, and two shadows. The pink blush is definately the gem in the palette! It’s vibrant and contracts beautifully with the darker eyeshadow as I mentioned above! By the very way, strangely enough after ordering this I ended up going to the Cosmetics Company Outlet and finding the Bridal Palette from last year for half the price with almost identical colors in it. It’s the story of my life to miss steals and deals sigh! Overall, it’s a beautiful palette for the Spring and it can be worked right into everyday use and remains “season-less” for me as it’s perfect for a casual Spring or Summer day! If you so please you can spice up Fall and Winter with a bit of pink as well and use it then! However I hate the fact that the powder gets in the lipcreams and such! Palettes like this normally get a pass up by me because they are so messy but this one was too pretty to pass up so I guess I’ll live! A month or so ago I had purchased the potted rogue for cheeks and lips and these definately deserve a look at! I got my colors in Pink Raspberry and Raspberry, one is a light true pink color while the other is a deep pink. These are $22 USD each and have a fitting price tag as they contain a good bit of product for the price plus the colors are pigmented and longwearing! As I’ve mentioned in my last few posts I am now officially part of some sort of Pink Gloss club! I’ve been snatching up Pink Glosses left and right and it appears it’s the height of fashion in my little world (I rule there so back off! You can visit if you behave yourself!) . I got the two glosses that came with this collection which I originally said wouldn’t look good at all on me. I’m about to contradict myself so hold onto your panties! I’ve since fallen in love with Pink Popsicle which is a very deep pink gloss! If that wasn’t enough I went and got the Glitter Lipgloss as well in Pink Raspberry! Both are ultra beautiful! Particular Pink Popsicle which makes my lips pop and sizzle! I particular love the applicator on these as it picks up plenty of product to get my lips nice and shiny with little effort! I’m also deeply in lust with the pigmentation as I don’t need to stain my lips prior to use since the color is deep enough to wear on it’s very own! Pink Popsicle Pink Raspberry Finally after much debate I ended up with the lip pencils and guess what? I love ’em! I’m not much of a lip pencil fan and I’m also not one for lining my lips but these are too cool! They are super moisturizing and again, like the gloss, very pigmented! A little swipe of these, some gloss on top and you’ll be looking posh! To wrap up all my gushing (by now you wanna vomit) I must say that the collection is great. Previously I was thinking that it wasn’t so wonderful but after trying this stuff for myself it’s making it’s way onto my favorite list for the Spring! You seriously have to take a look at the Bobbi Brown website or head to your local counter and have a peek! I guarantee you’ll fall in love with a few of these items and want them for yourself! The Bobbi Brown Pink Raspberry Collection could possibly be one of the best Spring Collections released western side! I’ll happily stick the Muse Approved sticker on these items! I know I’m overdosing everyone on pictures lately but I thought it would make up for the fact that my camera takes such crummy swatch shots. At least you can have a general idea of how the makeup looks on so I’ll be including FOTD’s with each of the reviews I do this week! Below I used the Pink Raspberry Palette plus Pink Popsicle Lipgloss. I found it came out simply nice. Nothing too crazy but not too boring either. Interesting FOTD I’d call it! I’m less then flawless this morning as you can fine lines on my right hand eye due to Bobbi’s Concealer Palette that I reviewed yesterday. It hasn’t been 20 minutes since I put it on and already I have creasing into my fine lines! Rant! I also happened to use Majolica Majorca’s newest lash extender in this FOTD which I’ll be reviewing for you later this week! Got some of this already? Love it? Want it? Hate it?

"['Laneige Spring Collection 2008: Snow Bloom By Isabella Muse on February 4, 2008 11 Comments in Asian Brands , Korean Brands , Laneige , Spring Collections 2008 Laneige’s Spring Collection has launched in Korea and is making it’s way across the Asian board. Most of the Laneige sites haven’t yet been updated with the new collection but it is out and available in Korea (lucky you if you live there!)! It’s quite a beautiful collection! Although, I want some of it I may refrain as I haven’t even dug into my Winter Collection from Laneige yet! The collection consists of a loose powder, eyeshadow palette, and blush palette! The packaging is quite beautiful and I’m having a hard time not purchasing all of it! I’m not sure which Asian countries are getting the update aside from Korea and China. I’m also unsure what the import to Singapore will be and if available the price range as sadly Singapore gets hit with a bit of a price jack. The Loose Powder 30,000 KRW (approximately $31-$33 USD or so). The blusher carries the same price tag while the eyeshadow palette is a big lower in price at 28,000 KRW (approximately $29-31 USD). Expect to pay a raise of about $9 -$11 USD per item online. I’m noticing the powder popping up online for $39-40 USD and the blush and eyeshadow palettes at around the same. Point makeup instructions are available on the Korean site if you want to know what was used on the model and how to achieve the look. Overall, another beautiful offering from Laneige!

"['@Cosme @ Your Drugstore! By Isabella Muse on February 1, 2008 6 Comments in Beauty Babblings I can’t read characters but I still visit @Cosme for the pretty pictures! @Cosme is basically the same idea as MUA or Total Beauty. The website is the “it” place for up to date information about new cosmetics, collections, skincare, etc….. It contains user created reviews for products and from what I can understand of the site it sure does a great job of keeping on the edge of Japanese cosmetic releases and more! I ran across this gem recently on there site and I thought I’d share because I thought it was rather awesome! From what I can understand these little machines will be installed in drugstores and basically you wave maybe?! either the product or your cell phone over it and it’ll pop the review up on your phone! I’m not sure how it works but it’s basically something that helps with getting reviews from @Cosme to you prior to your purchase! Why this might be exciting to you? @Cosme contains user reviews which means that you’ll get an honest, straight forward answer about the product you’re purchasing from a girl that’s already tried it and either hated it or loved it! How awesome would it be to head to Sephora, pick a blush out (or any other product), and get a user review on the item instantly! I love this idea! More images: You may also enjoy...

"['Ettusais Glitter Princess Collection Review By Isabella Muse on February 11, 2008 8 Comments in Japanese Brands , Spring Collections 2008 Yay! It’s Monday! Who would think Monday would be so exciting right!? It’s exciting because I have some new goodies to show you as Japanese Spring Collection Week continues from last week! This morning I wanted to show you Ettusais’s Glitter Princess Collection with an FOTD however the FOTD part is a bit late coming so I’ll upload it later today! However, I can show you the small haul I got from this collection now! A few other Spring Collections made a dent in my wallet but Ettusais Collection I sorta skipped on! As cute as it was I didn’t get too crazy in my selections and only ended up hauling two glosses and an eyeliner from the items that were released. The collection consists of 5 Glitter Eyeliners and 3 Lipglosses, you can see my original post about the collection by clicking here . The liner I got was the pink one. I decided on the pink because I truly don’t have too many pink liners in my collection and I thought it would look great with gold shadows and such. The other liners were tempting but I was trying to practice some sort of willpower as I purchased the entire lot of MJ Jeweling Eye Pencils this Fall and I was thinking to myself do I really need the entire 5 color selection of Ettusais Glitter Pencils? I think not. Best stick with one! Yay for me keeping my word and getting only one! The color is actually very nice and as predicted goes well with gold as I used it this morning to create a beautiful gold and pink look. The amount of glitter in the pencil is ok. Not really good or great but just ok. The pencil is at first a bit difficult to apply as the texture is hard but it warms up quick enough and slides on pretty well with minimal tugging. The liner color is a deep funky pink while the glitter within is silver. In all honesty the color reminds me of a lipliner rather then an eyeliner pencil but it’s still a really cool color to have in my beauty arsenal! Overall, it’s rather an inexpensive yet nice pencil at 1050 Yen (about $10 or less USD). You’re not blowing a whole lot of cash on it and it has some pretty good sparkle and color pay off. I’m just not sure I liked the texture though as it went on rather cakey but it is a nice color as I said and does have a good amount of sparkle to it! I’d say skip it if you can’t get it retail! If you have the means of getting it at cost then pick up one or two colors to try it out for yourself! The other two items that I ended up with were the pink and red lipglosses. These I’m very happy with aside from some minor ranting which I’ll get to shortly. Each has a nice, healthy dose of shimmer to them and the applicator is your standard spatula style which I love as you can really load up on gloss with this style of applicator (gotta love the Japanese!). The swirls in the gloss are actually not for design only. You have two styles of swirl in the gloss one of which is a pigmented lipshade. If the applicator happens to hit it you’ll get a nice tint of colors to your lips as well as gloss! The other swirl is a dose of glitter and again if the applicator happens to hit it you’ll get a bit of a silver tinge to the your lips when applied! The formula is highly glossy, shiny, and very water based for a moisturizing, beautiful finish to your lips. If you love glosses that feel wet all day this be the gloss for you! Minor rants. The pretty swirls will get messed up after dipping in a few times with the applicator *sniff*! That stinks but what can you do? And my biggest rant of all would be the lack of flavor to the gloss. Sigh. Why oh why don’t the Japanese flavor glosses? It’s rare I’ve run across a gloss that was flavored Japan side! Why!? I really miss the flavor but I guess it prevents me from chewing the gloss off! I’m sure I’ve ingested my fair share of gloss to last me this lifetime so I guess the lack of flavor is a good thing right? The glosses are worth picking up if you have the means of getting them at retail which is 1575 yen (about $15 USD) if not I’d say they are safe to skip! As nice as they are paying jacked up costs for them isn’t worth it! This mini collection form Ettusais is quite a nice selection of goodies but not one of the best I’ve run across this Spring so I’ll have to refrain from sticking a Muse Approval Seal on it! Love this? Have it? Want it? Speak to the Muse! Kesalan Patharan Spring Collection 2008: Spring ColorVeil By Isabella Muse on February 11, 2008 4 Comments in Japanese Brands , Kesalan Patharan , Spring Collections 2008 Kesalan Patharan website has been updated with the newest Spring Collection and it looks very promising which means I’ll definately be bugging friends to get me some of this! The base creator looks very nice which consists of a Nuance Color, Highlight Color, Cheek Color, and Shading Color. Knowing me I’d just dip my entire fluff brush in it and just smooth it over my face to lighten and freshen up my look! Two selections are available for the Base Creator which are the Orange and Pink. Both shades are LE and 4200 yen each. Three lipglosses have been introduced as well which are LE and 2300 yen each. They all look super nice! The colors are very vibrant and bold! I’m loving these and particularly liking the darkest shade of pink. Lipgloss Color Selections: Other items available are new colors of the Facecolor N palettes in a brown and blue selection: They also happened to update with some new brow powders and such but these don’t really hold much interest to me! The real star of the show are the gorgeous, bold, vibrant glosses! At least for me these are definately appealing! Overall, it’s a very nice set of goodies! Want any of this for your very own? Love it? Tell the Muse! Gransebon Spring Collection 2008: LoveSomeLady By Isabella Muse on February 11, 2008 2 Comments in Japanese Brands , Spring Collections 2008 Gransenbon has updated it’s site with a very tiny Spring Collection! From what I’ve seen they are only introducing three new colors in the Grand Eye Eyeshadow Palettes. I don’t think these are LE so no use going crazy trying to locate them! Appears they may become part of the general catalog but sadly I’m not completely sure. The new palettes are Apricot Chai, Lady Grace, and Mermaid Tiara. To be honest I’m not jumping around in excitement as these look like palettes I already have in the series so I may safely skip! For your viewing pleasure some of the Grand Eye Eyeshadow Palettes from my personal collection: On your wish list? Love ’em? Tell the Muse! Japanese Spring Collection Cosmetic Week Concludes By Isabella Muse on February 8, 2008 5 Comments in Japanese Brands , Spring Collections 2008 It’s sadly the end of the week and I have to bring a close to Japanese Spring Collection Week! *sniff* I wish I had more time on the weekend to update but I find I get too busy to blog during the weekends so you guys will have to wait until Monday for more goodies!

Sephora Spring 2008 Catalog By Isabella Muse on February 8, 2008 12 Comments in Sephora , Spring Collections 2008 Guess what? Sephora’s updated it’s site with it’s newest Spring Catalog! The theme this year is “Beauty as Art” and I’m not particularly loving the cover art! However, model images on the inside definately look promising! Sadly, the catalog for me is a disappointment which is no great surprise I guess. Most of what is featured we pretty much already know about and plus they have the standard stuff that they pimp constantly in the catalog like Benefit’s Bad Gal Mascara (Worst freaking mascara in the world!), Lash Injection (another loser!), and of course little bits of Sephora stuff is littered through (It’s their catalog so I guess they have to pimp some of their own line right?) like lipsticks, shadows, the brush selection etc….. It’s a snore for me which is good news as I’ve dropped plenty on Japanese Spring Collections this Season so money saved! Check out the catalog yourself by clicking here! Loving the newest Catalog?

"['Bobbi Brown Pink Raspberry Collection Review and First Impressions By Isabella Muse on February 5, 2008 10 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Face of the Day , First Impressions , Spring Collections 2008 Hold onto your seats we are reboarding the Bobbi Brown Train and my week of Spring Collection reviews continues! Taking a little break from the Japanese front today I bring you a Spring Collection from the US shores! I’ve had bumpy rides with Bobbi Brown before but I gave into my need for more Bobbi last week when I seen her on QVC. I dunno what it is but QVC really sells me on cosmetics! Damn them straight to hell and back (scratch the back part! Let them stay in hell and rot!). Seriously, you know how it is when you watch QVC and that sudden hardcore NEED rocks your world and before long you find yourself snatching up the phone like the QVC agoraphobia fan club that does daily calls to review cosmetics and skincare they are using in the comfort of their own homes since they don’t venture outside the house! Wow..that was rather dramatic wasn’t it? But truth be told in that statement my friends! I want to know these people who call QVC at 4AM, my god maybe I’m one of them (no I’m not! I haven’t reached that height of insanity yet thanks very much!)! Anyway. As I’ve been saying for the past few days I’ve tivo’ed Bobbi’s episodes like the mad little lady I am and watched them over the past few days and Bobbi sold me on a few of her items. I think maybe it was that host Lisa that really sold me on the items I purchased. You know the one? She acts like you’ll never ever in this lifetime or your second (if you believe in that sort of thing) will you be able to get this super rare, ultra limited edition palette! MY GOD GET IT NOW BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE! WE ONLY HAVE 2 IN STOCK! IF YOU MISS THIS YOU’LL NEVER GET IT AGAIN (Two days later you find it at your local Cosmetics Company Outlet for half the price!)!!!!!! Wow….what was I saying? Oh yes, Bobbi Brown. Anyway, I was watching Bobbi slather concealer on a model’s eye while making her up with the Pink Raspberry Palette and in that instant, as Bobbi multitasked through a look like the ultra awesome wizard she is, I realized I too, must OWN this palette! I had previously seen the palette in action on Erika’s blog, Makeup Bag , and as gorgeous as Erika looked sporting the palette I just felt it wasn’t me. The hot pinks and dark shadows just weren’t calling my name at all however I did end up purchasing two of the potted rouge colors from this collection previously from Nordies which I meant to review but never got around too! Lucky you I’m going to do it all in one big post (prepared to be bored or enlightened or a little of both)! After watching Bobbi work her magic with the palette I wandered over to her website and started browsing the Pink Raspberry Collection and a few clicks later I had a cart full of stuff I didn’t need but was lemming rather hard (and I didn’t have to pay $4 bucks or more per an item to get it shipped to me! Screw you QVC stop trying to make money off me with your damn stupid shipping costs!)! Somehow, I’m not even sure how, I ended up with all of the Pink Raspberry Collection and I’m hear now to tell say that you too need all of the collection too simply because I don’t want to be alone with my sickness. No seriously you really need to check some of this collection out because it has some rather great items! I think what really sold me on this was the promo images of the models! They look so fresh and naturally beautiful with their full, pink glossy lips and lovely pink cheeks! The palette is really a gorgeous yet simple affair that contains some rather vibrant yet elegant shades! At $55 USD it isn’t totally cheap but you’re getting a nice bit of product for the price and high quality product at that. However, you can safely skip this unless you’re really lemming it hard or you like simple makeup! The look this creates is very simple, pretty but still somewhat dull in my opinion! The shadows are matte and plain but the blush somehow makes up for that and when used together you get rather vibrant eyes with popping cheeks if that makes sense at all! You’ll get a beautiful pink blush, two lip creams, and two shadows. The pink blush is definately the gem in the palette! It’s vibrant and contracts beautifully with the darker eyeshadow as I mentioned above! By the very way, strangely enough after ordering this I ended up going to the Cosmetics Company Outlet and finding the Bridal Palette from last year for half the price with almost identical colors in it. It’s the story of my life to miss steals and deals sigh! Overall, it’s a beautiful palette for the Spring and it can be worked right into everyday use and remains “season-less” for me as it’s perfect for a casual Spring or Summer day! If you so please you can spice up Fall and Winter with a bit of pink as well and use it then! However I hate the fact that the powder gets in the lipcreams and such! Palettes like this normally get a pass up by me because they are so messy but this one was too pretty to pass up so I guess I’ll live! A month or so ago I had purchased the potted rogue for cheeks and lips and these definately deserve a look at! I got my colors in Pink Raspberry and Raspberry, one is a light true pink color while the other is a deep pink. These are $22 USD each and have a fitting price tag as they contain a good bit of product for the price plus the colors are pigmented and longwearing! As I’ve mentioned in my last few posts I am now officially part of some sort of Pink Gloss club! I’ve been snatching up Pink Glosses left and right and it appears it’s the height of fashion in my little world (I rule there so back off! You can visit if you behave yourself!) . I got the two glosses that came with this collection which I originally said wouldn’t look good at all on me. I’m about to contradict myself so hold onto your panties! I’ve since fallen in love with Pink Popsicle which is a very deep pink gloss! If that wasn’t enough I went and got the Glitter Lipgloss as well in Pink Raspberry! Both are ultra beautiful! Particular Pink Popsicle which makes my lips pop and sizzle! I particular love the applicator on these as it picks up plenty of product to get my lips nice and shiny with little effort! I’m also deeply in lust with the pigmentation as I don’t need to stain my lips prior to use since the color is deep enough to wear on it’s very own! Pink Popsicle Pink Raspberry Finally after much debate I ended up with the lip pencils and guess what? I love ’em! I’m not much of a lip pencil fan and I’m also not one for lining my lips but these are too cool! They are super moisturizing and again, like the gloss, very pigmented! A little swipe of these, some gloss on top and you’ll be looking posh! To wrap up all my gushing (by now you wanna vomit) I must say that the collection is great. Previously I was thinking that it wasn’t so wonderful but after trying this stuff for myself it’s making it’s way onto my favorite list for the Spring! You seriously have to take a look at the Bobbi Brown website or head to your local counter and have a peek! I guarantee you’ll fall in love with a few of these items and want them for yourself! The Bobbi Brown Pink Raspberry Collection could possibly be one of the best Spring Collections released western side! I’ll happily stick the Muse Approved sticker on these items! I know I’m overdosing everyone on pictures lately but I thought it would make up for the fact that my camera takes such crummy swatch shots. At least you can have a general idea of how the makeup looks on so I’ll be including FOTD’s with each of the reviews I do this week! Below I used the Pink Raspberry Palette plus Pink Popsicle Lipgloss. I found it came out simply nice. Nothing too crazy but not too boring either. Interesting FOTD I’d call it! I’m less then flawless this morning as you can fine lines on my right hand eye due to Bobbi’s Concealer Palette that I reviewed yesterday. It hasn’t been 20 minutes since I put it on and already I have creasing into my fine lines! Rant! I also happened to use Majolica Majorca’s newest lash extender in this FOTD which I’ll be reviewing for you later this week! Got some of this already? Love it? Want it? Hate it?

"['A Rant By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2007 2 Comments in Beauty Babblings I’d like it to be known I’m a snobbish bitch. Yes I am and quite proud of my little self too! Today’s rant is about E.L.F. Pray tell, who the hell buys (or even thinks about) buying cosmetics that cost a $1? This is WRONG in so many ways! WRONG WRONG WRONG! When you’re 12, 13, or 14 years old you have an excuse to purchase make-up that costs a dollar but when you’re in your older teenage years and into your twenties the excuses have RUN out! If you’re buying $1 cosmetics it’s probably best just to strike a match and burn your money. Get ye a job and stop buying cheap make-up for the love of god and all things holy! Rant over.

"['Shop Makeup, Cosmetics, Skincare, and Beauty at Bed, Bath, and Beyond! By Isabella Muse on June 7, 2012 48 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Beauty Bits & Bobs , Beauty on a Budget , Drugstore Makeup Brands (Pictured above Bed, Bath, and Beyond the Beauty Mecca of cosmetics and makeup galore!) You might hear me shout the good word of Harmons far and wide for my drugstore beauty purchases. Harmons is actually an extension of Bed, Bath and Beyond and basically acts as any good Walgreens and CVS carrying all your everyday need products like deo, toothpaste, shampoo, etc…They also have a stupid killer selection of the latest and greatest drugstore beauty brand selections at great prices (like sometimes cheaper than the Evil Empire aka Walmart). But… Some folks don’t have Harmons around. That’s why I highly suggest you check out a Bed, Bath, and Beyond or two. My Bed, Bath and Beyond has a HUGE selection of beauty bits and bobs. Take a look! That “Beyond” part? It refers to the fact I can buy any number of great beauty products at my Bed, Bath and Beyond. I took these photos at my local BBB and as you can see there are literally aisles upon aisles of not only makeup but also skincare, haircare, and basic everyday need products like deodorant. The great thing about shopping either Harmons or Bed, Bath and Beyond is the fact they are always sending out 20% off coupons or $5 off $15 etc…I suggest signing up for their newsletter as occasionally they e-mail these coupons. One thing I noticed about Bed, Bath and Beyond, even though they are essentially the same entity as Harmons, is the price on makeup is a little more than what you’d find at Harmons. Odd but true. Either way….I do suggest checking out your local Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised what a vast selection of beauty goodness there is available. Is your BBB stocked with beauty? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"['Natural Fafinette with Bold Lips FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 14, 2008 34 Comments in Face of the Day I was playing with Fafi this morning! I couldn’t resist so you’re about to get picture overload as I love, love, love the natural look I created with super bold lips! It came out kinda nice in my humble opinion! I must say that I did my fair share of ranting yesterday but the colors are truly outstanding on this collection! The blush is amazing for my skintone and the lipstick I used totally popped for me! It’s honestly the most exciting selection I’ve seen in a while! Ok enough babbling on to the pics! What I Used: Face Sassed Up Beauty Powder Hipness Blush Lips Flash n’ Dance Sony CP Lip Silicon Eyes Fafi Eyes 2 Beaute de Kose Mascara BONUS: New geeky sneaks! AHHH! I picked these up at the Disney Store, so kawaii! I’m a huge Jack fan! Couldn’t help myself! Total Goth Chic! Dontcha just love ’em!? I Heart Jack! If anyone has any Fafi FOTDs to share do send ’em to me at [email protected] Cheers! FAFI for MAC First Impressions, Reviews, And General Babble By Isabella Muse on February 13, 2008 52 Comments in First Impressions , Hauls , MAC , Spring Collections 2008 Ok. I came, I saw, and I conquered Fafi today. I picked up my bits just a little while ago from Nordies and it’s a nice haul of MAC that has some ups and downs which I’ll of course share you with you fine folk! So if you live under a rock or you just haven’t heard MAC’s latest collection is designed by French artist Fafi! The collection consists of an array of vibrant, bold shades that’ll sure to please the make up adventurer. It’s generally a super collection because some of the colors are truly outstanding however as with all MAC collections you’ll run into one or two items that seem to be a complete rerun! I’ve been collecting MAC for about…mmmm maybe a year and a half? Maybe more but I’m not entirely sure to be honest. Some of you have fell off the MAC bandwagon a long, long, long time ago but I’m still riding my MAC high and for some reason I haven’t quite come down from my trip as of yet. I’m hoping I’ll come down soon because boy I’ll be richer that’s for sure but the fact is I love MAC. It’s high quality with a low price tag. Sincerely who doesn’t like that cocktail? I’m far from a diehard considering I cheat with so many other brands but I still do have a special place in my heart for MAC. Those of you who long fell off the train or just never boarded it I definately give props too because I sincerely find it difficult to just say no to MAC! Fafi has a good few flaws so I’d best lay them out before getting to the good stuff! The biggest flaw, biggest BOO!, and biggest rant goes to the fact that the cute Fafinettes displayed on the packaging are labels and by the very way not only are they sticky labels but they are peeling off right out of the bloody box! I’m looking through BRAND NEW, IN THE BOX lippies that I purchased and I’m noticing tears on the label already! What the hell MAC? I’m wondering was this to save money or just pure dumb laziness! I read about this before and was a tad worried but convinced myself it’d be fine. Wrong. Not only does this make the compacts, quads, and lipstick tubes look cheap but also totally ruins my day that they are peeling freaking off right in front of my eyes. Great. Fact is you aren’t going to be towing any of it around ladies. Granted these are items we’ll probably keep the boxes for and place them in the beauty vault but some people do like to tote these things around for the cute factor and honestly it’s now pretty bloody impractical since you have to worry about the labels peeling off if they rub against other bits in your makeup case. I’m puzzling and wondering what the hell MAC was thinking!? MAC redeems itself by actually printing the emblem on the beauty powders but the quads, lipglasses, and lipsticks are all stickers! Another rant from your Muse. I’m simply hating the fact that they have decided it was ok to do the same exact image on ever Beauty Powder, lipstick tube, etc…..So we got three incredible beauty powders couldn’t they do a different image on each powder? A little rotation couldn’t hurt anyone could it? I’m now the proud owner of four of the six lipsticks released with again, the same image. Rotate? Variety? Please? It would have been super cute to have at least two images on the lipsticks and maybe three separate images on the Beauty Powders! The quads I guess I could forgive. Minor rant but seriously hello? It’s variety calling. The streets of New York are lined with slushy snow and little droplets of icy rain are pelting away since this afternoon thus the Muse wasn’t too inspired to head to her freestanding store so she got lazy and went to Nordies for her lot of goods which means she missed out on the tote bag and dolls! But hey I guess it’s good as it’s money saved? Or maybe not as I’m sure I’ll be tempted to head in and grab them shortly. Either way I did luck out because my gorgeous MA had waited for me as her shift ends at 6and I was running late at work so she waited PLUS treated me to dinner after I shopped Fafi! I felt special! I’m possibly through with my ranting as of now so I guess I can settle in on the raving! The lippies is the collection are solid gold for me. Really bright, bold shades that I wouldn’t normally pick up but I was feeling daring so they most definately ended up in my bag! I got 4 of the 6 released. I got Utterly Frivolous which is a pretty matte coral with a bit of pink to it. I also got Strawbaby which is my favorite of the lot! It’s a pretty deep rose, gorgeous in my book. Flash-n-Dash also ended up in my bag. This is pretty bold and falls into the neon pinky orange category, it’s very un-Musey but I couldn’t resist! Fun n’ Sexy passed under my radar as well and it is absolutely shockingly pink with a fuschia edge if ever I did see one! Utterly Frivolously , Strawbaby, Fun n’ Sexy, and Flash-n-Dash Lipglasses I only got two and I left the other two. Squeeze It quite reminded me of the color Happening Gal that was released with the Barbie Loves MAC Collection so I safely skipped it. I did end up with Totally It and Cult Fave. Totally It is a bit similar to Malibu Barbie but it’s a bit more vibrant and will go well with the Fun n’ Sexy lippie! Cult Fave is a rather natural shimmering pink shade. Totally It and Cult Fave Both blushes TOTALLY ended up in my cart. Real winners in my opinion! Fashion Frenzy is a blushing pink while Hipness is a kicking peach! Hipness and Fashion Frenzy Beauty Powders that were released with this collection are definately worth your cash! I got all three as they are most definately too difficult to pass up! Sassed-Up is a peach with gold sparkles while Verve-Acious is a beautiful beige with gold sparkle. Now the problem is I got all three of the powders but my MA stuck two of Sassed-Up in my bag! Duh! I have to go back for Belightful! I’ll be sure to post pics when I have it! Verve-Acious Sassed Up Last but never least our quads. From what I understand only two of the colors in both quads are repromotes but don’t quote me. I loved the colors and even though I have similar shades you know I can’t say no! Fafi 2 is my favorite and very Spring! The palette is perfect aside from one shade which is Prankster. Prankster is navy blue and just not as beautiful nor as complimenting as the other shades in the palette. Gold, Coral, and Light Green all shimmer and wink at me in this quad! Love, Love, Love it! Definitely worth picking up! Fafi 1 has some very nice colors as well but another weird bluish black awaits us in the quad. Mmm oh well! Pink, Cream, and Beige are colors found in Fafi 1. Fafi 1 Fafi 2 I picked up the small makeup case and the LE bag with brush as well which are both very cute! Overall, it’s a nice collection as I said with some minor flaws. Items that are definately worth picking up: Beauty Powders Fafi 2 Blushes Strawbaby Lipstick Paint Pots didn’t call to me. I find them difficult to work with so I skipped all of them! Everything else is repromoted such as mascara and such! Nail Varnish…well…we all know the drama of my nails so a skip for me. I can’t stick a Muse Approved sticker on this. It’s VERY nice but it just can’t get the Muse’s approval with the shabby design! It really disappointed me in that aspect and it’s a bit unforgivable! I expect more from MAC! Let’s hope the same mistakes aren’t made with Heatherette! If so, we’ll all have to go on strike from MAC! So how about you my pretties? What did you get? What did you love? Hate? Just not a MAC girl? Tell me allllllllllll about it! Or send me your haul pics and reviews at [email protected] I’d love to see and post ’em for others to see if you’re so inclined to share ? Bit More Bobbi Brown Pink Raspberry FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 13, 2008 3 Comments in Face of the Day My Bobbi Brown post on the new Pink Raspberry Collection got a few comments about colors so I thought I’d do another Bobbi FOTD today! You can read more of my review on this collection by clicking here if you missed it! Super simple one as I was rushed yet again today! I LOVE LOVE Bobbi Brown Rouge in Raspberry! When I’m in the sun for a short period a time, prior to browning up like a sausage, I tend to get a highlight of yummie pink on each of my cheekbones and this mimics that to a tee without the gross “tan”, “bronze” look I get when I’m outside too long minus sunblock! And anything bad I ever said about the lip crayons I totally take back! They give my lips such pop plus they taste like peppermint! Rock on! I used one of the single eyeshadows from Maquillage. For some reason there has been a frenzy for Maquillage lately hehe! So I thought I’d display some of the shadows in action! They are silky and lovely but a bit sheer but definately lovely if you like a less bold look! What I used: Face Bobbi Brown Pot Rouge For Lips and Cheeks in Raspberry Eyes KATE Gel Mascara Spring Edition ( Click here for my review) Victoria’s Secret Sexy Little Things Please Dazzle Me Mascara Glitter Topcoat in Pink Platinum KATE Gel Liner in Metallic Gold Maquillage Eyeshadow in PK222 Lips Bobbi Brown Lip Crayon in Wild Raspberry Sony CP Curvy Lip Silicon Majolica Majorca Spring Collection FOTD using GR741 By Isabella Muse on February 13, 2008 34 Comments in Face of the Day Of course I couldn’t wait to long before digging into GR741 from MJ’s Spring Collection! You can read my review of the Collection by clicking here if you missed it! Sadly I rushed while doing this morning and I mucked it up badly ? However, I think it deserves a re-mention that GR741 is probably the most pigmented Majolook palette I have ever come across and it’s quickly becoming a fav for me! This should definately be in your Spring shopping cart! It’s worth picking up before it disappears for good! What I Used: Eyes Majolook Trick On Palette in GR741 Majolica Majorca Lash Enamel Neo Mascara (aka MJ Lash Extender) Lips Stila Lipglaze in Raspberry Face Jill Stuart Blush in Aurora Rose Majolica Majorca Spring Collection 2008 Reviewed By Isabella Muse on February 12, 2008 32 Comments in Majolica Majorca , Spring Collections 2008 This is probably my most exciting entry to date in my Japanese Spring Collection review! It’s the Majolica Majorca Spring Collection for 2008 and boy am I excited to tell you about it! I’ve noticed I have quite a few new readers lately so I’ll briefly explain that MJ (or MM to some folk) aka Majolica Majorca is a smaller branch of Shiseido. It’s an inexpensive brand that can be found in drugstores in Japan. Although it originates in Japan it does find it’s way across the board into China, Taiwan, Singapore, Etc…..although sadly never the US. The Spring Collection brings us three new palettes that are entitled Majolook Trick On Palettes. The palettes are a bit different from the standard Majolook Palettes and are quite interesting to say the least. Where as the regular Majolook palettes come with a combination of powder eyeshadow and cream liner or powder eyeshadow and cream highlighter these palettes are a quad of powder shadows minus the cream liner or cream highlighter. The palette is actually broken down as follows: 2 Powder Eyeshadows 1 Powder Eyeliner (Can be used as an eyeshadow as well if you’re inclined) 1 “Trick” On Powder The Trick On powder is an interesting texture in comparison to the other shadows in the palette. It’s a light shimmering powder that can used as a highlighter or on top of the darkest eyeshadow shade. It’s a lighter formula when compared to the other shadows in the palette. I used it as a highbrow highlighter and in the inner corner of my eyes for a bit of pop! Of the three palettes introduced only GR741 (The aqua variation) is limited edition. All of the shades are definately worth picking up in my humble opinion as you can create some rather beautiful looks using these. As I’ve said in previous posts these aren’t super duper pigmented however with a bit of work you can create beautiful eye looks with them. This morning I used the GR741 and I created a rather nice look that I’ll be uploading later today! It’s probably the most pigmented Majolook palette I own! The deep greenish aqua shade is gorgeous and very beautiful! It’s definately my favorite of the three released and if you get nothing else this is well worth your cash if you love bold shades of eyeshadow! GR741 As you can see GR741 is beautiful! Starting from the bottom left hand side is the highlighter color in a soft iridescent baby blue color, next to that is the deep aqua green liner, above that is the cream colored “Trick On” color, and next to that the base color in a lighter beautiful greenish aqua color! I created a rushed look with this today and it came out ok but I’m looking forward to taking my time next run with it and seeing what I can create! As I said above it’s quite possibly the most pigmented Majolook palette I own! PK740 This is my 2nd favorite color combination of the three palettes released. It contains a beautiful array of browns and pinks which I find I really love lately! Starting at the left hand side we have a beautiful cream color sparkle to use as a highlighter, next to that a lovely chocolate liner, on top of that the “Trick On” powder is a shimmering bluish white, and next to that the main base color is a lovely pink! BR742 Out of all three palettes, BR742 is the one I liked the least but it does have some redeeming factors. The browns and greens are surprisely reminding me of Spring. Starting at the bottom left hand side we have iridescent bluish white shade, next to that a really deep dark brown, on top of that an iridescent pale green, and next to that a beige brown! Even though it’s not my favorite I definately see the potential to create a rather nice greenish look for Spring with this palette! A new lash extender was released with the Collection and I’m sure as you already know from reading my past posts I’m a big lover and supporter of MJ Mascara. This particular release is rather good and I’m glad I didn’t pass on it. It feels very natural on and doesn’t make my lashes stiff at all. It feels like I have some sort of Lash Conditioner on and the formula is very interesting in comparison to past releases for that reason! According to Iris at Rouge Deluxe the new formula contains “gloss oil” which in my humblest opinion can definately be felt when it’s on. I found this a very interesting release as it’ll be beautifully light during the Spring and Summer! Who wants stiff, dark lashes in warmer months right? Something light and natural is perfect and this new formula definately accomplishes that! A hearty rave for this! And of course as with all releases it’s long wearing and smudge proof! The other items released in the collection that I skipped on were Honey Balm Swirl Lipglosses. These weren’t so appealing to me as I already own some of the Honey Plump Balms. The Majolook palettes are 1575 yen each and the new Lash Extender is 1260 yen. Sadly expect to pay a huge jack in price if you’re shopping non-retail. A few shops have jacked the price up considerably. Although it deserves to be sad the palettes are worth the price increase! Overall, the new Spring Collection from MJ most definately gets a YAY from me and a Muse Approved sticker! Maybe I’m bias and just a lover of MJ in general but this is most definately a favorite for me this Spring! Want it? Have it already? Loving it? Speak to the Muse!

"[""Reader’s Request: KATE Glamtrick in GN-1 FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 19, 2008 19 Comments in Face of the Day , Reader's Request Ok guys! As per your requests I did an FOTD this morning with the new KATE Glamtrick palette in GN-1. The palette is very versatile and you can choose to do a light or a darker look using it. Don’t be discouraged that the dark look I created won’t be good for Spring because that’s not the case. I choose to do a darker look but if you desire you can definately lighten the look up! Later in the week I’ll do a lighter look with it but for today I choose to do a deeper look! The quint is definately worth picking up as it’s truly a nice addiction to the Glamtrick line up! I know some of you had said that KATE’s line was sheer and I’ve never experienced that with any of KATE’s palettes and this particular FOTD definately proves how much you can build color up with these! You can click here to view my original post about KATE’s Spring Collection! I got a bit picture happy as I really loved the way this came out and I paid special attention to it as I know many of you were curious about what sort of looks you could create using this particular palette! I hope you enjoy looking at this as much as I enjoyed creating it and hopefully this helps you decide whether GN1 is something you want to add to your collection of palettes!

Biteki Purple and Green Spring Dupe FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 18, 2008 34 Comments in Face of the Day I started out using blue this morning but I decided that I wanted to dupe the latest Biteki Purple and Green look! PJ at A Touch of Blusher has posted the promo video for Biteki which is where my inspiration for this look came from! I haven’t gotten my latest issue of Biteki and I’m quite eager to get it as I’m curious about the promo DVD it comes with! My look came out a bit too sparkley as I was running late for work and did it quickly which sadly means it came out sloppy! However, the good news is that you can easily recreate the look if you have the colors I used! They are practically identical to what the model is wearing in the Biteki ad and with a lighter hand you can dupe the look perfectly!

KATE Spring Collection 2008: Review and First Impressions By Isabella Muse on February 18, 2008 30 Comments in First Impressions , Japanese Brands , KATE , Spring Collections 2008 I’m really lagging behind with this review! I meant to do it last week but Fafi took up residence on my blog and I was obsessing over it so this particular collection got shoved behind! The good news is I’m here this morning to review it for you, babble a bit, and give you my 1st impressions of the KATE Spring Collection for 2008! My original impression of the new KATE line was a bit of a snore. I was on a bit of a Spicy overload as I have practically every single palette in the Spicy line so new ones did kinda make me take pause and wonder did I need these? I guess it got the better of me and I did end up indulging in some of the new line up! One item that particularly caught my eye was the newest color in the Glamtrick palettes. In keeping with the current flair of green that’s splashed all over the place KATE released a greenish Glamtrick palette that I am absolutely in love with at the moment! This palette contains an assortment of shimmering shades to make up that perfect green eye look and if you’re so inclined you might want to dab a bit of purple in somewhere to create the coveted green and purple look that’s so popular at the moment! The palette contains 4 shadows total and one liner color. The colors are a range of greens, silvers, and white while the liner is a deep dark forest green. The entire affair is pure perfection in my eyes and I’ve been eager to try this out since getting it! Glamtrick in GN-1 Speaking of palettes the newest ones to grace KATE’s line are the Line Spicy N Collection. Nothing to new about these aside from colors. The line consists of two shadows and two liners that you can interchange to create some very simple yet bold looks! I got two color selections from the give offered. You don’t absolutely have to run out and get these. They are very nice color combos but aren’t something you have to have if you currently have a large wish list I’d say push these to the bottom! I ended up purchasing them because in all honesty they are cheap as stale chips so I firgured I might as well! But if you’re unable to get them at retail I suggest picking up the newest Glamtrick instead! The two color selections I purchased were GD-1 and PK-1. PK-1 contains a shimmering pink eyeshadow and a beige shadow with complimenting liners of white and beige while GD-1 contains shimmering shadows in gold and brown and liners in blue and white. GD-1 PK1 KATE also introduced a square cut eye liner which I am in love with. This is a very chunky square cut liner that contours perfectly to the lash line. I love it simply because it creates a rather gorgeous smoked out eye without the need for smudging it yourself. The liner is quite thick so you can create a large outlandish line or you can rub it along your lash line for a very smokey look! This is most definately worth picking up and is truly a gem of a liner! Ideally you can create a thin line with it if you desire but it’ll take a bit of work however using it as a tool for creating a thick line or just for smudging some liner on is absolutely perfect! I adore that this eliminates one step in creating a smoked out liner look! When “smoking” my liner I normally line and then proceed to smudge with a q-tip, brush, or finger however with this liner I can smudge as I walk it across my lashline! Sheer perfection! Good job with this KATE! I ended up purchasing the newest KATE Gel Mascara as well which I’ve already reviewed in a prior post! Click here for details! Last but not least are the newest colors in the Powder Gel Liner! I already have a majority of the gel liners and these new colors particularly caught my eye. Both are metallic, shimmering shades of gold and silver and simply gorgeous! I’ve already used the gold in a few of my past FOTD’s from last week and the week before! I’m super chuffed with these. The liner formula is absolutely dreamy and a bit different from past KATE gel liners. It’s almost like applying a thin layer of powdered shimmer onto my lashline! So pretty and unique! For my Maquillage lovers you’ll be happy to know that they did similar color releases with their Spring line up! I was debating on the KATE and the Maquillage ones for a while and just ended up with KATE because it was cheaper plus I’ve tried them before and was happy with the results! Overall, the collection has some really great items in it! I highly suggest nabbing the new square cut liner, the gel liners, and the new Glamtrick palette! Dramatic Fafinette FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 15, 2008 20 Comments in Face of the Day In contrast to yesterday’s very natural Fafinette FOTD I decided to get loud and bold! Missed it? Click! I’m stuck up at my office still and it’s gone on 6.30…sigh…I wanna go home rather badly as I am bone tired today but I have so much to get through that I really must stay and get it done! The good news is I can take a tiny, baby break to slap my Face of the Day Up really quick! Today I didn’t use any Fafi on my eyes but I definately accented my lips and cheeks with some of the collection! I don’t entirely like the way this came out as it may be a bit TOO much but it’s funky I guess! Sometimes I think I may be getting a little too old to pull these looks off ? I fear that leaving the house in neon oranges and pinks is chalked up as “Old enough to know better and young enough not to give a crumb!” teehee!

"['Dior Extreme Fix Powder By Isabella Muse on February 15, 2008 17 Comments in Dior What if I told you that for $44 USD you could have a silky, transparent powder that you’d brush on your face to make your foundation last all day long. Would you buy it? I’ve personally never run across a powder that allows my foundation to last more then say mmm 5 hours or so. Of course I should mention that I don’t wear a full foundation face. Lucky enough I don’t need full coverage so my basic routine consists of T-Zone application. I use cream foundation so a swipe of foundation down either slide of my nose, on the corners of my chin, and across my upper lip (due to shadows on my skin found on my upper lip line and chin area) is all I need to look very fresh. I set my foundation with either loose powder or MAC’s Mineralized Skinfinish. Done. Not much to my routine. However, I do notice I need a fresh up within 2-3 hours and by the time hour 5 strikes I’d say my foundation is pretty much gone along with my blush, lipstick, etc… Behold my new solution for bullet proofing my foundation: Meet Dior’s Extreme Fix Powder. I seen this little gem a few months ago on Nordies website and honestly it held little appeal as its promise of making my foundation long lasting seemed empty and meaningless! I’ve tried powders before how could this be different!? Recently I came across this on one of my readers blogs and her review created an intense lemming for the powder. I soon found myself feverishly googling for more reviews on the product. I came across the powder on MUA with a rating of 5.0! Bloody hell I’ve never seen much of anything get 5.0! Every review I’ve run across is a rave about how well this simple, clear powder creates an amazing shield against the elements and your face so your foundation lasts all freaking day long! $44 USD is not much to spend if this means my makeup will last all day! The moral of the story is Dior Extreme Fix Powder is on my hit list and I’ll be reviewing it shortly! Believe you me if it works it’ll get a double Muse Approved Stickering! Click here to read all about it on Divalicious Glamazon! If you’re an MUA’er click here to read the raving reviews! Dior Extreme Fix Powder is exclusive to Nordies so if you’re wanting it you’ll need to head over there to get some! Tried it? Love it? Want it? Tell the Muse! Tarte Health Couture Set By Isabella Muse on February 15, 2008 9 Comments in Spring Collections 2008 , Tarte You know you want it! If you love Tarte this be for you my friends! $45 USD nabs you a Full Size Cheek Stain in Blissful, Full Size Mascara, Clean Slate Primer, Lock & Roll Eyeshadow Duo in Quartz, and Full Size Borba Inside Out Gloss in R&R! Sweet! I’ve never heard of Blissful so it must be a new color or exclusive to this kit! I imagine those of you who love the cheek stains will want to buy the kit just for that alone! Want it? Tell the Muse! Happy Valentine’s Day! By Isabella Muse on February 14, 2008 10 Comments in Babbling Bits , Of Geeks So it’s Valentine’s Day isn’t it? Minor depression as my boyfriend lives in the UK but we did spend a rather awesome evening talking, being goofy, etc…! I kinda sorta think V-Day is somewhat a bit too commercial for my likes. I don’t think I need a particular day of the year to tell someone I love them! Heck I do that everyday anyway ? But I did want to take a sec to say Happy Valentine’s Day to each of you and your loved ones! It’s not all about lovers! My parents get me a V-Day pressie every year and I give them one! Same for my sis! ? And some special friends too! So even if you’re single you can make it about someone else that holds a near and dear place in your heart. Single, Married, or In a Relationship the Muse wishes you only the happiest feelings in the world on Valentine’s Day! If I could I’d give each and every one of you a big squishy hug and some hershey kisses too (because fat content is important on Valentine’s Day!)! I hope your day is special whatever you do! And hey what better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day then with great pick up lines from the Captain right? You’ve been officially Shatnerized with this post! And yes the Muse believes even back then it was a hair piece! For shame William, for shame! Dear oh Dear Spock you cheeky little monkey! Naughty! Naughty! Lambie Socks! By Isabella Muse on February 14, 2008 10 Comments in Bath and Body Works Remember these? I flipped over these during Christmas and none were to be found in the land ! However, lucky enough I did end up with a pair! The good news is they are now up and available on Bath and Body Works Website again! But I have better news! BEHOLD: Do you love these? Admit you want them! $10 bucks! It’s the Lambie Slipper Sock! Ahhh! *runs around in circles* I want these so badly! I went to my local BBW when I stopped off for Fafi last night and of course they had them but someone smeared freaking lipgloss on ’em! I asked if they had another pair and of course I got a killer attitude and a big, fat “whatever is on the shelf Mizzzzzzzzzzz!” Thanks for nothing! The good news is they are available online! The Muse likey and wants two pairs please! And you know you’ll be running to get ’em too! Who can resist the lambs!? Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull By Isabella Muse on February 14, 2008 7 Comments in Of Geeks , Pieces of Life Oh. My. God. The Muse is in geeky heaven watching the preview for the new Indiana Jones movie! I nearly wet my pants, nearly, very nearly. Although if possible there may be just a bit too much CGI for me. I know, I know but we’re talking old school Indy here…a little less CGI would give it that vintage feel! By the very way Mr Spielberg maybe just maybe we could have done without Shai Lebeouf. Bloody hell I had to deal with him in Transformers and that was like root canal surgery now Indiana Jones? You’re ruining my geeky childhood here (and geeky adulthood)….! Sinseriously…I did not need Shai Lebeouf mucking up my Transformer experience! Anyways. Aside from those minor rants…this has the potential to be awesome. Cross your fingers we don’t have a lemon on our hands here a la Lucas’s money grubbying Episode 1, Episode 2, etc…….that had dollar signs written all over it!']",3f8265a519f74319b4915955177809bbc075d177,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4178,
"['Majolica Majorca Spring Collection FOTD using GR741 By Isabella Muse on February 13, 2008 34 Comments in Face of the Day Of course I couldn’t wait to long before digging into GR741 from MJ’s Spring Collection! You can read my review of the Collection by clicking here if you missed it! Sadly I rushed while doing this morning and I mucked it up badly ? However, I think it deserves a re-mention that GR741 is probably the most pigmented Majolook palette I have ever come across and it’s quickly becoming a fav for me!

"['Bit More Bobbi Brown Pink Raspberry FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 13, 2008 3 Comments in Face of the Day My Bobbi Brown post on the new Pink Raspberry Collection got a few comments about colors so I thought I’d do another Bobbi FOTD today! You can read more of my review on this collection by clicking here if you missed it! Super simple one as I was rushed yet again today! I LOVE LOVE Bobbi Brown Rouge in Raspberry! When I’m in the sun for a short period a time, prior to browning up like a sausage, I tend to get a highlight of yummie pink on each of my cheekbones and this mimics that to a tee without the gross “tan”, “bronze” look I get when I’m outside too long minus sunblock! And anything bad I ever said about the lip crayons I totally take back! They give my lips such pop plus they taste like peppermint! Rock on! I used one of the single eyeshadows from Maquillage. For some reason there has been a frenzy for Maquillage lately hehe! So I thought I’d display some of the shadows in action! They are silky and lovely but a bit sheer but definately lovely if you like a less bold look!

"['Natural Fafinette with Bold Lips FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 14, 2008 34 Comments in Face of the Day I was playing with Fafi this morning! I couldn’t resist so you’re about to get picture overload as I love, love, love the natural look I created with super bold lips! It came out kinda nice in my humble opinion! I must say that I did my fair share of ranting yesterday but the colors are truly outstanding on this collection! The blush is amazing for my skintone and the lipstick I used totally popped for me!

"['Avon Horizon Blush by Jillian Dempsey By Isabella Muse on February 21, 2008 23 Comments in Avon , Celebs , Wish List I saw Avon’s new blush in the latest issue of Bazaar Magazine (Avon in Bazaar? I know right? What the hell!?). The blush in question is entitled Horizon Blush and is designed by Jillian Dempsey. A long time ago, in a land far away Jillian Dempsey was actually a leading firgure for Deluxe Cosmetics (remember that brand?) but more importantly, dig this, Jillian Dempsey is married to Patrick Dempsey. Who would’ve have guessed? Sure they share the same last name but I didn’t know this was his wife (it could be because that I’m in denial he’s married with kids as I still have that beautiful fantasy of me running around Seattle Grace in a naughty nurse uniform while he chases me around with a syringe in one hand and a can of whipped cream in the other!) I’m thinking to myself that it can’t be too fun around that house. I mean how does she introduce herself? Hello I’m Jillian, yes my husband is McDreamy and I work for Avon. Ouch. Jillian, honey, quit Avon or let the Muse have McDreamy for her very own! In all seriousness Jillian has some redeeming qualities, one of which happens to be the new blush she created for Avon! Thanks Jillian you aren’t at the level of McDreamy but you’re slowly gaining speed! The Muse likes this blush because it reminds her of the Solar Duo Blush that was released for the Body Shop Summer Collection last year! Sadly the Muse only has one of the two colors released from that collection as she broke one when it fell off her vanity! Twas a sad sad day! But now I have these new blushes from Avon to invest my time (and money) into and maybe they can replace my gorgeous Solar Duo Blushes! The blush is available in two shades of peach and pink. These are gradation blushes that can be applied for a sheer wash of color or build up for intensity. One end holds a light side and one end holds a darker side of each color. So…these are $7.99 USD (I know, not what you’d expect from a lady married to the 7 million dollar man but hey a girl’s gotta do what a girl’s gotta do!) and I’m questioning how pigmented they can be but I must remind myself that Avon had shocked my socks off a few months ago with it’s rather awesome Cynthia Rowley Collection (Missed my review? Click here to read up )! I think I want these (minus the cheap brush they come with! Thanks very much!). Count these on the Muse’s wish list! I’m going to give Jillian a try and maybe I can think up a rather clever nick for her while I’m at it hmmm McMakeup? McAvon? McBlush? Want these? Curious? Tell the Muse! Paint Pot HORROR! By Isabella Muse on February 21, 2008 19 Comments in Beauty Babblings , MAC , Spring Collections 2008 I failed to mention in my previous dribble and babble post ( Click! ) about MAC Fafi that I purchased Cash Flow Paint Pot! All you evil, evil people convinced me I was doing an injustice to MAC by not purchasing at least one paint pot! Staring at the array of paint pots on display with the Fafi goodies I heard each of you in the back of my head chanting and urging me to buy all six (god I’m so sick!) but I decided that I don’t like them and I stuck to my guns on that however, somehow, someway Cash Flow did end up in my cart and I hold each of you accountable! It’s a rather nice shade though isn’t it? Hehe! Have it? Love it? Tell the Muse! The Mysteries of MAC Fafi Beauty Powder By Isabella Muse on February 21, 2008 16 Comments in Beauty Babblings , MAC , Spring Collections 2008 After skipping over to Sephora I also skipped over to the MAC store to pick up the Fafi Tote and a Fafi Doll for myself as I hadn’t gotten either with my Fafi Haul! I walked out of the store with a Fafi Doll but not the tote as it was just too overwhelmingly big for me! I’m already short and wobbly so I really don’t need a huge tote to carry around that’ll be completely unflattering! I mean seriously what’s attractive about a short, round girl walking down the street with a tote bigger then her entire body! This is not cute, not cute at all! I had hopes it would be medium size but it’s actually big enough to carry enough food for a small village plus your car keys so I skipped! Granted for $60 USD that’s alot of bag for your buckage but it was just a bit too large for me, I’d have personally liked a smaller bag. It deserves to be mentioned that the only tote the Muse carries around that is that large is a PBS tote (the height of couture people) and I won’t give it away for the world (You’ll understand if you happen to be a PBS dork!). On a happy note if you’re slim and amazon size (amazon in the Muse’s case is anyone 5’2 and above) you’ll probably look uber attractive carrying this around! Anyway. I didn’t only leave the store with a doll but I’ll get to that later as I want to discuss this doll! Now for some diseased reason I wanted all three dolls but ended up with one as they are all the same poses just different colors and such. My desk is already littered with Doctor Who figures, fantasy art sculptures, skulls, Nightmare Before Christmas figures, and a ton of other rubbish that would be fitting for a 13 year old boy however the Muse is fully grown so she felt to make this lot of items more sophisticated she’d add a Fafi Doll! That would surely make all the other crap on my desk look really posh and important right? Wrong. She’s so tiny that she’s lost in the sea of general Sci/Fi paraphernalia that already resides on my desk. For some odd reason I thought these might be bigger then a tube of lipstick. That’s about her height and size! She’s so very tiny and delicate. Sigh. Cute but really small. I guess what I’m trying to say is you really don’t need these unless you’re caught somewhere between childhood and adulthood like the Muse! Sheesh my cheek stain is bigger then her! Cute but somewhat disappointing. Oh well. Now the main reason I’m actually writing this post is because I wanted to share with you something interesting! I originally purchased three of the Beauty Powders which were Verve-Acious, Belightful, and Sassed-Up. I believe that Belightful is the only repromote in the lot but you, my dears, can correct me if I am wrong. I have none of these so I indulged in all three last week during the official release. Today while wandering around the MAC Store low and behold my eye spots a new powder! What be this? It’s a pure, white shimmering shade entitled Delicacy in the Fafi packaging! Turns out Delicacy is also a repromote but I don’t own it so I’m glad I purchased it. It’s rather gorgeous to be honest. Why it’s at MAC Stores and not counters I haven’t a clue! I think, I somehow recall, that our beautiful friend ‘Nessa at Nessasary Makeup had mentioned the stores running out of Belightful and offering Delicacy instead! Don’t quote me on that but I think that’s what I had read on her blog! MAC Beauty Powders from the Fafi Collection Fact of the matter is that I’m kinda excited to have this particular shade in the Fafi packaging! It reminds me of NARS Albatross but a white version! Perfect for highlighting your face with a bit of gorgeous sparkle! MAC Beauty Powder in Delicacy I’d definately wander over to your local MAC store and have a peek! I think it’s a nice addition to Fafi! Pop Lid Neon: The Sequel By Isabella Muse on February 20, 2008 12 Comments in First Impressions , Pop , Spring Collections 2008 Pop’s new palette got a little love from me earlier today when I posted about it! Click here to see my original post. Soon after my post the need for this little palette grew and I found myself skipping my way (not literally but isn’t it damn hysterical to picture the Muse skipping?) to Sephora a little while ago to pick it up! It’s been a very long, busy week at work with many late nights so I deserved a little pick me up treat! The palette is all I wanted it to be and I’m hopeful I can get some decent looks out of it! It’s pretty tiny for $22 USD and it’s not super duper pigmented so you’ll have to build up color a bit but I think it’s fair enough to say that it’s a pretty sweet little array of ultra cool shadows! I love that I can have six luscious neon shades in one place! These totally work together for some vibrant, loud looks! The inside cover suggests a few ideas for using the palette which is a nice little touch! Seriously for $22 bucks it’s well worth it in my opinion! If you want to re-live the 80’s or you’re just looking for something fresh and fun for the Summer this be the palette for you! The Muse thinks she may approve it but she has to give it a test run tomorrow! Stay tuned for an FOTD! Some swatches as requested by a reader: Sorry but my cam kinda takes crummy swatch photos! These are actually way more vibrant then they look on the back of my arm! Have this? Want it? Tell the Muse!

"['Ettusais Limited Edition Cinderella Kit By Isabella Muse on February 26, 2008 Leave a Comment in Japanese Brands Ettusais has been on my hit list lately every since I purchased some of the new Spring Collection! Click! I randomly came across the Limited Edition Cinderella Kit while browsing for Ettusais cosmetics at Gooddealer! In keeping with the Disney theme of Spring ( Click here and here for other Disney Collections released!) Ettusais has released a Limited Edition Cinderella Cosmetic Kit. I can’t tell you an exact release date of this but it may be older then a Spring release and I’m leaning more towards a release for the past Holiday Collection probably! The kit includes an eyeshadow, blush, lipstick and gloss palette, applicators, blush, shimmering powder, a curler, and a cosmetic case! Cute right? It appears there are four variations of the kit all the same aside from the shimmering loose powder which comes in your choice of white, purple, pink, or orange! The kit is only $40 USD so really you can’t go wrong for the price! Dior Vernis Long Wearing Nail Lacquer By Isabella Muse on February 25, 2008 11 Comments in Dior , Spring Collections 2008 Dior is releasing a new nail varnish for the Spring entitled Dior Vernis which will be $19 USD and available shortly from Sephora . It’s rare I take good care of my nails. I’m a biter, a picker, and generally naughty when it comes to taking good care of my nails! However, on a rare occasion I do take sometime out to treat my nails better and even, gasp, have them done! Now I have an extra excuse to start taking care of my nails with Dior’s new lacquer being introduced. The color is a vibrant, bold blue that the Muse likes alot! I haven’t been this excited about a nail varnish since Chanel’s Black Satin release! My Baby Want it? Need it? Tell the Muse! New Ultra-Moisturizing Mentha Lip Tints from C.O. Bigelow at Bath and Body Works By Isabella Muse on February 25, 2008 2 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Spring Collections 2008 If you’re a fan of the Mentha Lip Tints from C.O. Bigelow you might happy to hear they released a slew of new colors. The flavor remains the same which is the intense, cooling peppermint but the color variety is updated to include tints like Magenta , Coral, Plum, and a few other colors! The tints are on sale now at Bath and Body Works for 3 for $15! The flavor is too intense for the Muse but the price is right! Want ’em? Love ’em? Hate ’em? Tell the Muse! Bpal: Neil Gaiman Selection Updates By Isabella Muse on February 24, 2008 6 Comments in Books , Fragrance , Of Geeks , Pieces of Life A little bird whispered into my ear about possible updates to the Neil Gaiman Selections on Bpal. If you’re a collector of Bpal or just a general fan of Gaiman this may be exciting to you! If you’re unsure what Bpal is have a click over here for some info! If you have no idea who Neil Gaiman is you suffer the dire consequences of possibly being kicked off my blog permanently, ok maybe we’ll forgive you but just this once! k? k. The Muse worships at the shrine of Gaiman so anything Gaiman related is always great! The little bird told me about a scent being released entitled Snow, Glass, Apples. Oh Joy! My heart literally stopped when I heard this! Can you imagine such a blend as this? I’m picturing something cool and refreshing with bits of fruit and and a beautiful underlay of ozone! Snow, Glass, Apples was written over 10 years ago and is a twist on the age old story of Snow White. I actually have a copy of it that was purchased from BDP at the time. I believe, don’t quote me, you can find a few copies laying around on Amazon that collector’s are selling if this is something that interests you. In all honesty if you’re not a Gaiman fan you’re sincerely not going to want to shell out the money for a copy so maybe stick to his newer works that are readily available and about. The good news though is now you can purchase a perfume oil that captures the story! I’m very eager to hear if this is true. According to my little bird it appears that the scent was available at Bpal Will Call. Whether it was allowed to be purchased I’m unsure of as the details are foggy but it does seem that the Gaiman selection on Bpal at the moment, which consists of 7 blends, will be updated soonish! Weeeeeeee! I have high hopes for this new blend because really the ones available at the moment aren’t entirely Muse approved. In other Gaiman related news…The Graveyard Book is completed! Squeal! Around 12:55pm (UK Time) yesterday Neil updated his blog to say a few nights ago he completed the book and is now busy tweaking it ( CLICK! ). Needless to say I’m excited! A new perfume oil, A new book, a new film (Coraline is being released in 2009)…..A great start to Monday morning me thinks! 20% Off Vintage Stila By Isabella Muse on February 22, 2008 11 Comments in Steals and Deals , Stila I’m positive we might all be Stila’ed out!

Watching them together brings back great memories of The Screen Savers which in turn makes me think of the great ways that I plan on herding up a bunch of geeks and torching the G4 building one day! Anyway. The moral of today’s story is you can re-live your geeky days of youth and see Kevin and Alex outside of Revision3 broadcasting today! Jump ahead for the deets. So check it. Kevin and Alex are going mainstream tonight and are making a guest starring appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. If you’re a follower you prob already caught the eppy of Jimmy being the first “official” guest star on a Diggnation eppy who’d think you’d see Kevin, Alex, and of all people, Jimmy Fallon together!? But tis true….see it below. I think Jimmy is a really funny guy but I haven’t yet seen his show as the word is out it’s a nap but of course I got my Tivo all set for a record to see Kevin and Alex on the show. Could be the fan girl speaking but I think Kevin and Alex are amazingly funny so I’m looking forward to seeing their antics on late night TV.

"['The Flash Looks Damn Good in a Chuck By Isabella Muse on November 30, 2011 3 Comments in As Seen By the Muse , Of Geeks , Pieces of Life , Shoes The year I started Junior High School (7th Grade) I discovered Flash. I remember it like it was yesterday. I went to Catholic School and our graduating class (8th Grade) had 8 or 10 kids in it, pretty small eh? You can imagine the town it was located in was equally tiny. Of course, every small town has some sort of tiny comic book store in it in my experience and that would be the case here. After school one day I was waiting for a friend in said small town and wandered into the comic book store on the corner and discovered and purchased my first every copy of a Flash comic book. Since that time, I’ve accumulated many older versions as well as new and spent too much money doing so but it’s a collection I’m very proud of. And you guessed it, I could not let a pair of Flash Converse pass me by….behold… I loves ’em! P.S. If you have plans to order any of the Converse DC Collection beware, they ship with a 45 lace and sport an 8 eyelet design. I highly suggest adding a 54 lace to your cart when checking out to get the best lace up on the sneaker. Just my opinion! You may also enjoy...

"[""Ettusais Blush Review By Isabella Muse on February 28, 2008 25 Comments in Japanese Brands My obsession with Ettusais continues with a review of these interesting little mousse blushes that I picked up! I don’t like these but I won’t give them a bad review because they are actually great yet a bit too natural for me. First of all the packaging is ultra cute and I believe that’s what sold me on these. They come in a tiny glass jar with a cute screw top! Awww! Packaging really sells me on a product and in this case I had to have these as they were so yummie looking! A few US companies do a similar style blush such as Clinique’s Touch Blush. These have the feel of a silky mousse. It’s very light and airy! Application is a breeze as these blend on perfectly and sink into the skin practically on contact! The color selections I got were a dark bronze peach, a cooler, lighter peach, and a natural pink. Here in lays part of my dislike of the blushes, they go on very sheer and give me a beautiful glow of color but it’s a bit too natural for me. I like blush that’s vibrant and these just give me more of a natural, I’m not wearing any blush flush. All in all they are very cute and are interesting to use but I just can’t love them! They are looking for a new home ? If anyone is interested shoot me an e-mail! Dalenna’s First FOTD By Isabella Muse on February 28, 2008 4 Comments in Friends , Guest Face of the Day Looks , Pimpin' My awesome little mate Dalenna decided to brave the storm and jump onto the FOTD bandwagon!

While you’re giving her love you should also help me hate on her for her flawless silky hair…sheesh why doesn’t my hair behave so great??? Cheers D! Great job sweetie! I look forward to seeing more FOTD’s in your future posts! Skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream Review By Isabella Muse on February 27, 2008 11 Comments in Skincare Thanks to the Total Beauty Network I was able to lay my hands on the posh, pricey Pure Cloud Cream from Skyn Iceland. I was really looking forward to trying this out and possibly doing cartwheels around the room when I heard I would get a chance to test it out! I heard big time rave reviews about not only the Pure Cloud Cream but also all of the Skyn Iceland line! Well… I’m sad. I have to give this a thumbs down sadly. For one thing the price of $75 for 1.7oz scares me slightly. I really shouldn’t say that as my regular moisturizer costs $85.45 for 1.5oz but at least it works amazingly well! Maybe I didn’t get the benefit of it since it’s recommend for super sensitive skin types where as I’m more of a dry type during the winter. It promises to restore skin from intense weather conditions but I really wasn’t seeing much of a difference. I faced the elements for the time I was sampling it (rain, sleet, snow) and my skin came out without much change. The formula is very thick which got me super excited as I thought it would be excellent nourishment for my dry, patchy skin. After using this for almost two weeks my skin is actually missing my old moisturizer! It didn’t create any problems for me, it didn’t cause dry skin, or oily skin or any other such problems however it just didn’t feel like it was doing anything for my skin where as with my regular moisturizer I can feel and see it working. My face looks fresher, less dull, and moist when I use my regular brand. At the very least for $75 bucks I was hoping I’d see some change in my face! From dull to glow? Nope. Nothing. I can’t recommend this one for purchase but I am curious about the rest of the line! Got this? Love it? Want it? Tell the Muse all about it! Beauty on a Budget: Milani Runway Eyes Wet/Dry Eyeshadow Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on February 27, 2008 60 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Hauls , Milani Uh oh. I think Vincent Longo is sitting at his desk and being uber pissed at the fact that Milani turned around and snatched his formula for their new Runway Eyes Wet/Dry Eyeshadow! They not only duped the eyeshadow, formula, and part of the name but I think they actually, if it’s possible, did it better then Vinny! Oh my! “Grrr! Damn Milani! Who do they think they are stealing muh eyeshadow formula! Get my lightsaber! This means war!” Last week I was wandering around my favorite Drugstore Queen’s blog, Vanessa , when I noticed she was pimping out Milani’s newest eyeshadows. We bow to you Vanessa and your awesome, artful application with mere drugstore brands! How does she do it!? She’s actually Wonder Woman in disguise! Able to leap tall buildings, race faster then the speed of light, and apply $2.99 eyeshadow like it’s Chanel! Seriously, have you seen the art she creates with really cheap cosmetics? I honestly can’t believe my eyes! This is talent people! TALENT! Behold Milani’s New Eyeshadows! Pretty! Swatches from Left to Right Milani Lily White, Vincent Longo Sparkle White, Milani Shamrock, Vincent Longo Verite, Milani Blue Lagoon, and Vincent Longo Mermaid Blu Shamrock vs Verite Blue Lagoon vs Mermaid Blu Lily White vs Sparkling White Anyway. Somehow whenever I visit with Vanessa I get these strange urges to purchase drugstore brands! I’m slightly disgusted by these urges but I must say I have them none the less! She makes everything looks so appealing! Suddenly Covergirl sounds like the call of MAC to my ears! I’m a snob. I admit that while blushing. I just don’t have any true feelings for drugstore brands stateside and I just can’t put any love or money into inexpensive brands but the more I read ‘Nessa’s blog the more I struggle with my intense lemmings to go to CVS and Walgreens! Lord! Last week I gave into my temptations and wandered over to CVS to purchase Milani’s Runway Eyes Wet/Dry Eyeshadow! And I’m actually glad I did. This is my first drugstore purchase in….years…! I rarely touch drugstore brands stateside and you’ll never catch me setting foot into a CVS, Walgreens, or Harmons! My Haul of Yum! Strangely enough as I entered CVS last week I thought maybe the building would fall down around me and crumble because it was such an epiphany to have me enter it’s realm! I think I heard angels sing as I entered through the sliding glass doors and perhaps a single ray of pure sunlight touched my face in welcome! I could have made that all up but you’ll never know for sure because you weren’t there so nanner nanner on you! Now I’d never admit to you that I actually had to visit three freaking CVS stores before I found these eyeshadows! They were sold out everywhere but I’d never admit that I went to three separate stores to find them because that’s just not the case…not me…no way…I’d never do anything THAT extreme! I gathered up eight compacts in my arms and frantically searched and proceeded to panic when I couldn’t locate the light blue shade and pink shade that I had seen on ‘Nessa’s blog! My god the horror! They sold out of these essential colors! Didn’t they realize the Muse was in their presence?!!? Now the shadows are $5.49 USD but last week they were on sale so you’d buy one at the price of $5.49 and proceed to get the second at 50% off which brought it down to $2.75 for the 2nd shadow. I had the audacity to turn to the cashier and ask for a rain check after I brought the 8 colors! Hells here I am shelling $350 some odd dollars out for the MAC Fafi Collection last week yet I was worried about missing out on the buy one get one 50% off sale at CVS! Lord! Anyway I guess you wanna here my review on these bad boys after all that long babbling dontcha? The review is easy. Ready? Get them now. Run, Fast, Quick now and get yourself some of these! They are GOOD…no..sorry..they are GREAT! Milani did a most fabulous job with these. If you like sparkle, if you like glitter and shimmer and shine you want these. I’m literally keeling over that these only cost $5.49 USD regularly! Who’d have freaking thought!??!?!? The quality is excellent! Pigmentation is actually BETTER then the Vincent Longo Diamond Wet/Dry Eyeshadow. Shimmer? BETTER then Vincent Longo’s! These go on smooth, silky, and light your eye up with gorgeous glimmer and twinkle! Dry they are stunning and wet they are bold and vibrant! The applicator these come with is a dual end. One end is a sponge and one end is a brush. It’s rubbish in my opinion. It’s twisted in such a way that you can’t really make too good a use out of it. Garbage for me. But aside from that very minor flaw these shadows have knocked my socks off! I’m utterly devastated I wasn’t able to lay my hands on the other colors (I believe I’m missing two now! The pink and lighter blue shades.) All the colors available in my humble opinion are sincerely workable with any coloring! The shades range from black, to white, to beautiful golds, browns, and greens! I can’t begin to explain how shocked I am how good these are! They contain much more shimmer then the Vincent Longo ones and I find they go on better as well! I get alot of fall out with Vincent Longo’s while these aren’t nearly as bad and clean up is a bit easier! I’ve noticed that these contain a very fine shimmer of golds and silvers where as the Vincent Longo shadows only contain silver which I guess accounts for the intensity of the sparkle you get in these and why they are so much more brighter and eye popping then the Vincent Longo ones! Black Out Lily White Silver Charm Beach Sand Bronze Doll Blue Lagoon Shamrock Overall, these are a freaking steal! If Milani puts out more items like this in the future they’ll have a fan for life! Well done! These come with the Muse’s highest seal of approval! I haven’t been this excited about a product in a very long time! Get you to your local drugstore and pick them up now! Want ’em? Have ’em? Love ’em? Tell the Muse! I definately want to discuss these with you! By the way, Iris, if you’re reading this, I got you some! YOU NEED TO TRY THESE! I think you’re going love ’em! Benefit Erase Paste By Isabella Muse on February 26, 2008 35 Comments in Benefit Oh ya baby I’m spinning the wheel of chance again and I’m ordering me some Erase Paste from Benefit! As you know from my past posts I have a love-hate relationship with Benefit! Some of the products are absolute essential items during my day to day cosmetic application and some items are just plain rubbish! However, I’ll make an exception on the hate part of my relationship and introduce you to Benefit’s new fix all entitled Erase Paste! Yes, indeed I ordered this little guy all for myself! I’m a big supporter and fan of Benefit Boi-ing and at one point it was my Holy Grail, cure all, I can’t live without it undereye concealer of choice! It still is in some aspects but my eye area is growing a tad bit dry and older so I need a bit more to hold myself together lately. Erase Paste sounds sincerely promising and I’m just hoping by some chance it’s just as good and or maybe even better then Boi-ing! This is a multitasking concealer that can be used undereyes and on your face! I’m personally purchasing it to use under my eye area and I’m so hopeful it’ll be a moisturizing concealer! I’ve found that Benefit excels at making some really good fix its such as Boi-ing, Lemon Aid, and Eye Bright! Some of you may be a bit put off by the fact that it comes in a jar. The potential for germs and other fine bacteria is definately there but it does come with a spatula so your hands and fingers aren’t digging around in the pot. I’m anal so this doesn’t thrill me and giving me a plastic spatula for application still doesn’t sway my opinion that this could have been put into a tube of some sort! That goes for Boi-ing too by the way! So if you’re listening Benefit less compact and jars and more tube! Since I don’t need an entire face of foundation I’m looking forward to trying this out under my eyes and on my t-zone to brighten myself up a bit minus the chore of foundation! Of course, as with all Benefit products, this promises the world in a cute jar! Whether or not it actually works and rocks my world remains to be seen! [email protected] @K! Easy as 1-2-3! And you’re perfect! It’s that simple……we’ll see about that! This is $29 USD and you can nab it now with Free Shipping using code BRIGHTEN. I’ve been burned before by Benefit but I’m hopeful that this might be a bloody great product!

"['Shu Uemura Mini Eyelash Curler Review By Isabella Muse on February 26, 2008 35 Comments in Shu Uemura , Spring Collections 2008 Oh yaaaaaaaaaaa! The Muse got the new Mini Shu Eyelash Curler and it’s all that and a bag of chips…mmm…..I don’t really like chips…it’s all that and some double chocolate chip cookies! w00t! Much better! Ok so I got this today and when I first slid it out of the box I quickly realized it was a heck of alot smaller then my standard Shu Curler! My god are they skimping on me!? Have no fear the size actually works to your advantage when you’re using this bad boy. I guess that’s why they named it Mini right? I should mention that I’ve somehow become retarded when using this! It’s like learning to ride a bike without training wheels. Your standard Shu Curler can be compared to riding around town on your ultra awesome bike with some training wheels on for safety where as the new mini eyelash curler is riding around minus the training wheels. I had to relearn how to curl my lashes tonight. I’m sincerely stupid because it took me about 20 minutes of messing with this thing before I got a knack for using it. Now I have mad skills and I went from amateur to awesome in 20 minutes! 20 minutes well spent my friends because I almost poked my eye out a few times there. In all seriousness it does take a bit of practice to get a feel for using this but once you’ve become one with your Mini Curler it’ll open a whole new world for you! I’m seriously impressed with the fact that I can get the pesky inner lashes and curl them up in a snap! Don’t get me wrong my old standard size Shu curler can easily capture every single lash in one go but sometimes, on a rare occasion it does miss some of my inner lashes! Now I can slip my mini curler right in to take over the job and curl up any loose ends! Now as I was saying my standard Shu Curler already does everything I need it too so why do I need a mini version? The mini version gives me doe eyes! This is fabulous for curling the outer corner lashes while leaving your inner lashes straight! This will give you that doe or doll effect! That flare at the outer corner of your eye really creates a beautiful, unique look! Ahh the perfect doll look! If you happen to have very small, stubby lashes this should be a perfect tool for curling with. I have very full lashes so I can use this for creating unique, precise looks something not easily accomplished with my regular Shu curler however if my lashes were a bit stubby or short this is a very good precision curler for pulling them up, out, and giving volume and curl to pesky, short lashes! As I mentioned earlier the size is quite small but it doesn’t take away from the comfort level. It fits snugly, securely and naturally between your fingers and the size actually helps with the precision of curling! It’s such a good size that it offers your hand the stability to do your work while holding fast and steady! The size also accounts for the fact that you’re applying a bit more effort when curling with this. You need to work this gently against your lash line as it’s tricky to use at first so the size makes the transaction a bit easier! Shu’s Mini Curler beside the standard Shu Curler (Pictured from Left to Right) My regular Shu Curler never gives me a problem with pinching but the mini version is even better with that to be honest. Occasionally I align my regular curler incorrectly, squeeze down, and get a mighty fine pinch! At no fault of the curler but my own clumsy efforts when curling! Duh! It’s unlikely you’ll experience that when using the Mini version since you’ll be curling your lashes in sections which makes for good precise work and less ouch! Overall, I love this thing and happy to have it in my beauty arsenal! My regular Shu Curler is the Cadillac of curlers so we’ll dub the mini as the BMW of mini curlers! You can click your heals over to Shu’s website and grab one for your very own! $17USD gets you a very cute curler that works a treat to say the least! Visit Shu Uemra’s Website by clicking here ! The Mini Eyelash Curler from Shu is most definately Muse Approved! Got this already? Love it? Want it? Tell the Muse! Read all about my ravings for the original Shu Curler by clicking here! Bare Escentuals Foiled Eye Tutorial Kit By Isabella Muse on February 26, 2008 6 Comments in Bare Escentuals So today was like the day from bloody hell! I was up at 5AM, got to work by 8:30AM and proceeded to work my butt off until 10:40PM! Ugh! Very busy day! My office was bustling something fierce so I sincerely needed to stay over and crack down and do some major work after hours! My sister was running shotgun and we worked our way through a gazillion renewal files before heading home to get some much needed sleep! BUT SLEEP I cannot do! Why you ask!? Because I must update my blog for you fine, gorgeous, beautiful people! My updates were sadly lacking today due to my busy schedule so prior to laying down to rest I shall lay the ground work for tomorrow’s masterpiece entries and post them tonight so when you wake up in the AM all bright eyed and bushy tailed you’ll have plenty of new exciting “Musey” posts to read! Excited? I knew you would be! Thankful? No problem make checks payable to Musings of a Muse! Cash Donations are welcome as well! I’m kidding, I’m kidding! I was doing my daily browse through Nordie’s and I came across a new Bare Escentuals Tutorial Kit. You may remember I did a review on the Smokey “V” Eye Tutorial Kit not so long ago! You might want to wipe away the cobwebs and re-read the review by clicking here ! The new kit is entitled Foiled Eye Tutorial! Wahoo! Exciting! I already own a Foiled Eyes Kit from BE and I love it! This particular kit isn’t as big as my original kit which contained two eyeshadows, one liner, and a brush. This set includes a dual ended brush and two shadows hmmm bit smaller then the original kit! It deserves to be said that the price on BE has gone up a tad bit. The kit is $32USD and for some reason I think I need to rant about that. If you break it down that means you’re paying about $11 or so per an item in the set. Not bad but when you’re faced with two shadows and a brush in your hand I’m thinking to myself, “That’s it? That’s all I get?”. I have no idea why I’m ranting about this as I’ve been known to lay down that much for a single eyeshadow so what the hell am I complaining about? I just expect to get more from BE for less and I guess when I lay out that thirty some odd dollars I want a massive kit of awesomeness like I’m used to getting from them….am I making any sense at all? My original kit cost me $28 USD and had more goodies then this particular kit however the lemming is strong and the fact that it’s $4 extra and I’m getting less hasn’t lessened the need and I find I want this particular kit (which means I’ll be scouring E-bay like a little demon until I possess it for way below retail cost). I really like these little kits. I enjoy the fast, easy, tutorials they come with! The packaging is superb. It’s like makeup for dummies in one easy to do box! If you have no skill this is such an awesome way to pick up a few tricks and beautify yourself all in a few simple steps! Anyway I guess I’m babbling! I took some pics of the original Foiling Eyes Kit that was released about 3 years ago! As I said before I really loved this kit and this new set really appeals to me because of how much I loved the original release! Strangely enough I just recently got two emails asking about foiling techniques! So here you go! A simple kit to achieve just what you want plus easy instructions! These work with simple water! A drop or two and you’re good to go. If you have mixing medium around you can use that too but I find simple water from the faucet works best. I don’t normally like using a mixing agent or water during application simply because I’m a quick artist. I like to get my stuff on fast and go! When using an agent you have to wait for the first color to dry prior to placing your next color and for me that’s a bit too many steps! However, since the effect you get with these is so cool when they are wet I find that I don’t mind so much waiting on the dry down time! On to the pics! Dry Wet Wet My camera doesn’t take the best swatch pictures in the world but as you can see from the photos the colors take on a whole new hue and dimension when they are applied wet and they get that “foil” effect to them plus they go from beautiful to gorgeous with a few drops of simple water! This particular kit is no longer available however the newest kit is up at Nordies should you wish to purchase it! CLICK! Love it? Have the old kit? Want the new kit? Tell the Muse! Juicy Couture Strawberry Fields Cosmetic Organizer By Isabella Muse on February 26, 2008 10 Comments in Storage I promise I’m simply not going to order this because it’s entitled Strawberry Fields…can you tell how much of a Lennon fan I am? I love Juicy Couture. It goes against everything I stand for but I sincerely love the brand! I can’t help myself. I just plopped this bad boy into my cart simply because the name was so bloody appealing! Uh oh I think I hit submit too! How cutes is it? Don’t lie, you know you want one too! Ettusais Limited Edition Face Compact By Isabella Muse on February 26, 2008 4 Comments in Japanese Brands , Spring Collections 2008 It’s that time of the year when many Asian brands introduce new pieces to their base cosmetic line ups! Ettusais has updated it’s website with it’s new base makeup and their limited edition compacts caught my eye in particular! I have a special place in my heart for Japanese foundation compacts, especially any releases that Sofina puts out. These two compacts caught my eyes as they are so gorgeously Spring! Each compact is 1000 yen plus an additional 3150 yen for a foundation cake. I’m thinking I might get the compacts to put my Raycious powder in! Pretty! Est?e Lauder Shimmering Powder Pearls By Isabella Muse on February 26, 2008 11 Comments in Estee Lauder Gasp! Do you love it? I sincerely love Guerlain’s Meteorites but at $51 USD they can be a bit pricey! I can get these from Est?e Lauder with a brush for $40! The Muse loves it alot! I’m sure they aren’t as good as Meteorites (you can try to convince me otherwise) but the price sure is nice and they look interesting enough for a try! Have ’em already? Loving them?

"['Bpal: Neil Gaiman Selection Updates By Isabella Muse on February 24, 2008 6 Comments in Books , Fragrance , Of Geeks , Pieces of Life A little bird whispered into my ear about possible updates to the Neil Gaiman Selections on Bpal. If you’re a collector of Bpal or just a general fan of Gaiman this may be exciting to you! If you’re unsure what Bpal is have a click over here for some info! If you have no idea who Neil Gaiman is you suffer the dire consequences of possibly being kicked off my blog permanently, ok maybe we’ll forgive you but just this once! k? k. The Muse worships at the shrine of Gaiman so anything Gaiman related is always great! The little bird told me about a scent being released entitled Snow, Glass, Apples. Oh Joy! My heart literally stopped when I heard this! Can you imagine such a blend as this? I’m picturing something cool and refreshing with bits of fruit and and a beautiful underlay of ozone! Snow, Glass, Apples was written over 10 years ago and is a twist on the age old story of Snow White. I actually have a copy of it that was purchased from BDP at the time. I believe, don’t quote me, you can find a few copies laying around on Amazon that collector’s are selling if this is something that interests you. In all honesty if you’re not a Gaiman fan you’re sincerely not going to want to shell out the money for a copy so maybe stick to his newer works that are readily available and about. The good news though is now you can purchase a perfume oil that captures the story! I’m very eager to hear if this is true. According to my little bird it appears that the scent was available at Bpal Will Call. Whether it was allowed to be purchased I’m unsure of as the details are foggy but it does seem that the Gaiman selection on Bpal at the moment, which consists of 7 blends, will be updated soonish! Weeeeeeee! I have high hopes for this new blend because really the ones available at the moment aren’t entirely Muse approved. In other Gaiman related news…The Graveyard Book is completed! Squeal! Around 12:55pm (UK Time) yesterday Neil updated his blog to say a few nights ago he completed the book and is now busy tweaking it ( CLICK! ). Needless to say I’m excited! A new perfume oil, A new book, a new film (Coraline is being released in 2009)…..A great start to Monday morning me thinks! You may also enjoy...

By Isabella Muse on February 22, 2008 22 Comments in Face of the Day , Pop , Spring Collections 2008 , Vincent Longo Welcome to my combined review of the Vincent Longo C_Scope Collection that I babbled about yesterday PLUS the Pop Lid Neon Palette as well! Isn’t it fun to get a double dose of two brands in one post? I was babbling quite a bit yesterday about Vincent Longo’s C_Scope Collection so if you missed it you can click here for a recap! I also babbled about (and swatched) Pop’s new palette Lid Neon if you missed it click here and here to get in the know! Let me start by saying I’m quite in lust and love with the Vincent Longo C_Scope Collection! After swatching myself happy at Sephora with every single shade in the collection I decided, after much debate and deep thought, that I’d go with the mascara and liner in blue. Truly it was a difficult choice and I wanted to walk out of Sephora with at least three other colors but somehow, some way I showed a willpower I didn’t even know I possessed. Although I imagine the other colors will make a starring appearance in my collection soonish! The blue I choose is a the truest blue I’ve ever owned. I don’t own any colors like it and I’d never have thought to pick such a color for myself but after seeing the promo images I was pretty much sold! It’s a solid, true, primary blue and might I add it goes wonderfully with the blue in the new Pop Lid Neon Palette I purchased. I decided this morning I’d pair up the Pop Lid Neon Palette with my Vincent Longo mascara and liner. What I created is a bit scary and needs a bit of tweaking to look good but I think with a lighter hand and a bit more time I can do a sincerely awesome look! I should mention that I hate liquid liners with a passion. HATE! They are so difficult to apply! Stick me with a pencil or a potted liner and I’m good to go, give me liquid and it’s like sending me to a hanging! I have no skill when it comes to lining with liquid (I have had success with Cenora Liquid Liner though! Yay me!)! I just suck at it, pure and simple. The good news is that the liners from the collection are so deeply pigmented. It’s like applying ink to your lashline and it’s impossible to screw it up. It just slides right on perfectly and personally you don’t need much talent for application. I dunno why but since the blue is so loud and outrageous it just makes it easier to apply for me. If I’m using black in a liquid liner I tend to notice if I screw up or if my line is messy and not so straight where as with the bright, bold blue I didn’t notice any such thing. I think the fact that the color is so very vibrant that you’re not noticing any minor imperfections. Any goof ups I did have, I corrected easily by gently following the line I made with a q-tip, reapplying, and again lightly touching up with a q-tip! Presto! Bob’s your uncle! Perfect line! As I mentioned earlier I also picked up the blue mascara. This I didn’t like as much as the liner simply because I felt like it was clumping my lashes up during application. Pigmentation, like the liner, is excellent! It literally turns your lashes bright blue! So outrageous! But I didn’t enjoy the way it applied. The applicator is a comb applicator so no brush here which is good because you’ll get excellent coverage this way but I’m not loving the clumpy feel and look of my lashes after application. More raving ahead after that minor rant……. The collection also introduced a new product entitled Lip Vinyl. Four shades are currently available and I’m hopeful they’ll slowly add more. I got the color Fellini Red and I absolutely adore it. Wow. Super duper pigmentation. I can’t speak for the other colors but this is seriously some killer lip product here! A quick swipe gave my lips a very full on, drop dead red pout! I don’t normally like reds but I have to say I loved how awesome this looked on! It might be even too much if possible! I felt like Marilyn Monroe for a second there! The formula is strange because it does apply somewhat wetly but it’s dry on your lips and very matte which I don’t like. I’m not one for a matte lip color so a little gloss on top makes my lips very happy, VERY red, and very shiny! Gorgeous! This morning I decided to pair my Pop Lid Neon with the Vincent Longo liner and mascara. Many of you had asked how pigmented the Pop Lid Neon palette was and I couldn’t truly answer without first trying it on my eyes. I’m here to tell you it’s worth your bucks! It’s very pigmented and the one color I used (blue) went on beautifully! All the colors are matte, again I’m not a matte lover, but I am happy to have this little guy in my beauty arsenal because the shades are excellent and you can get hundreds of looks out of one little kit! The shadow is silky and applies with ease and it’s very long wearing! As I was saying I paired up my Vincent Longo blue liner and mascara plus the blue shade from the Lid Neon palette today and although the look was a bit overkill I think in the future I can definately work it a bit better! I went with very natural lips and cheeks because the blue was already loud enough in itself! On a side note the color lasted all day on both the shadow, liner, and mascara. No smudging, no flaking. On the upside of this I’m happy to report that the liner is pretty easy to remove. If you’re a MAC lover I’m sure, like me, you avoid Liquidlast Liner like the plague! Seriously does anyone buy it? You need gasoline dipped cotton balls to remove it from your eyes! It doesn’t budge! It terrifies me! It’s like applying tattoo ink to my lashline! The good news is you get the same incredible lasting power and pigmentation with Vincent Longo’s liner but the ease of removal that MAC Liquidlast liner fails at! So here’s what I created, don’t laugh, it looks kinda crummy and needs alot of work! My favorite part is the liner which is why I’m showing you this! It’s so very beautiful and has that wonderful “wow” and “pop”! I’m eager to try the liner on it’s own and maybe smudge it up some and see what kind of effect I can get! By the way don’t mind the fact that I have a huge stain of blue in the inner corner of my eye, it was removed after taking the pictures! I noticed it and was like UGH! UPDATE: Sorry guys but I’m removing the FOTD pics. Totally feeling bummed after getting some crummy comments but the good news is the review is still here! W00t! Gene Simmons on Ugly Betty By Isabella Muse on February 21, 2008 14 Comments in Babbling Bits , Celebs , Pieces of Life So Gene Simmons has been whoring himself on telly lately….This is off the topics of cosmetics so you might want to turn away while I babble vintage rock. I couldn’t sleep last night so around 3 am I found myself sitting up in bed with my ultra awesome sweetest softest blanket from Bath and Body Works (I love that thing) and powering up the Tivo to catch up on Ugly Betty. It’s been weeks since the last episode and I just now got the chance to have a watch! Much to my delight Gene Simmons popped up during the last 2 minutes of the show. Dontcha love that Gene Simmons whores himself all over TV lately? Celebrity Apprentice, Ugly Betty, Family Guy, and even SpongeBob Square Pants! You think maybe 30 years ago Gene Simmons thought to himself “Hey when I’m 60 I think I’ll lend my ultra awesome voice to a kids show about a Sponge that lives under the sea in a pineapple! ROCK ON!” Or even better yet wouldn’t it be awesome to hear Gene sing the theme song? Holy cow I’d rock out to that. Anyway. Gene also has his own reality show on A&E called Family Jewels. As I watch Gene and his slightly dysfunctional family the thought crosses my mind of how the mighty have fallen! I can’t wrap my mind around the fact that Gene Simmons, God of Rock, has a reality show. Wow. Just Wow. I think I was 5 and my cousin Joe, was about 17 or 18 and he’d pump up KISS on his very low end car stereo (the height of technology in our hay day) in his pimp’ed up Monte Carlo. Yup, my cousin was the Fonz. That’s right. He drove a pimp daddy, deep red Monte Carlo, wore a leather jacket, and had all the girls swooning at his feet. To this day my dad always looks back on Joe with fond memories and is in awe that he’s a family man now! Who would have thought all the grease in his head would lead to a beautiful wife and kids (sadly he doesn’t have much hair left to grease which the Muse is fond of reminding him of). Anyway my deep appreciation for vintage rock is due to him I guess. Mostly my blog stems from the fact that I miss Joe alot lately (he hasn’t been doing so well but that’s a story for another day). As I was watching Gene Simmons wag his tongue around on Ugly Betty last night I couldn’t help but think it would crack Joe up that this is where Gene Simmons has ended up circa 2008! The moral of the story is we love you Gene but less cheese and more rock please! You’re killing your image! If you’re any kind of a fan of KISS you might be tickled to know that it appears the writers of Ugly Betty have even infiltrated Paul Stanley as he’ll be on the show too shortly! Lord…what is the world coming too? I’m predicting the future and I’m seeing Paul and Gene on Home Shopping Network next year selling anti wrinkle cream that goes on white and black and gives you the alluring charm of the Demon or the Starchild! I can’t wait till I’m 60 so I can buy it ? Discuss (I imagine everyone is thinking shut up get on with the cosmetics already!)?']",d0b0ff9433ec07f2bec0713234965609e62fcabf,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4174,
"['Pop Lid Neon: The Sequel By Isabella Muse on February 20, 2008 12 Comments in First Impressions , Pop , Spring Collections 2008 Pop’s new palette got a little love from me earlier today when I posted about it! Click here to see my original post. Soon after my post the need for this little palette grew and I found myself skipping my way (not literally but isn’t it damn hysterical to picture the Muse skipping?) to Sephora a little while ago to pick it up! It’s been a very long, busy week at work with many late nights so I deserved a little pick me up treat! The palette is all I wanted it to be and I’m hopeful I can get some decent looks out of it! It’s pretty tiny for $22 USD and it’s not super duper pigmented so you’ll have to build up color a bit but I think it’s fair enough to say that it’s a pretty sweet little array of ultra cool shadows! I love that I can have six luscious neon shades in one place! These totally work together for some vibrant, loud looks! The inside cover suggests a few ideas for using the palette which is a nice little touch! Seriously for $22 bucks it’s well worth it in my opinion! If you want to re-live the 80’s or you’re just looking for something fresh and fun for the Summer this be the palette for you! The Muse thinks she may approve it but she has to give it a test run tomorrow! Stay tuned for an FOTD! Some swatches as requested by a reader: Sorry but my cam kinda takes crummy swatch photos! These are actually way more vibrant then they look on the back of my arm! Have this? Want it? Tell the Muse! You may also enjoy...

Shu Uemura Exclusive Face Chart for Musings of a Muse By Isabella Muse on March 3, 2008 37 Comments in Face of the Day , Shu Uemura , Spring Collections 2008 Hey guys! I wanted to share this exciting news with you last week when I originally got it but I was too busy to recreate the look so I didn’t want to post it without my spin on it! One of the key makeup artists at Shu Uemura, Misumi Kitano, created a gorgeous exclusive face chart for readers of Musings of a Muse using the brand new Rebirth Collection! I was lucky enough to nab some of the Rebirth Collection for myself and it’s delightfully Spring-like! I didn’t have everything that was used in the face chart so I improvised with some stuff from my own collection! What was used in the face chart: Cheeks: Glow on Harmonious Orange Lips: Rouge Unlimited in Dewy Beige Eyes: Rocket Eye Pencil Energy Flow Pristine Green Eyeshadow Precise Volume Mascara Black My dup of the face chart: What I Used: Cheeks: Milani Mineral Blush in Mai-Tai Eye Shu Uemura Rocket Eye Pencil in Aqua Flow Shu Uemura Pristine Green Eyeshadow MAC Pigment in Charteuse Fairy Drops Mascara Lips Smashbox O-Gloss Urban Decay Lip Envy in Envious I’m happy to say that I got a chance to sample some of the Rebirth Collection from Shu and it’s quite gorgeous. It’s one of the few Collections that is very light and Spring-like! Many collections this year went for very bold and dramatic colors that didn’t completely suit my taste for Spring but Shu came out with a beautiful range of soft Spring colors such as greens and yellows that are sure to suit the upcoming warmth of Spring! The title of the Collection is quite fitting as each spring their is a Rebirth and regrowth of life around us! Flowers, Trees, Etc…the colors and the name are well suited! The highlight of the collection for me are the rather awesome stackable tri color pencils. These come in three colors that are stackable to create one easy to carry pencil. These are a very creamy pencil that can be applied as an all over color or an eyeliner! Two color combinations are available which are Energy Flow and Aqua Flow. Both sets include three color selections for $20 USD. These trios are Limited Edition. Overall, the collection is quite lovely and worth having a look at! The Muse loved recreating the look from the face chart Misumi created for Musings! A big thank you to Misumi for taking time out to design the chart! Check out Shu’s Rebirth Collection at the Shu Uemura Website. If you’d like to copy the face chart and do your own creation and share it with the Muse and readers of Musings of a Muse do e-mail it to me at [email protected] !

And now I’m about to review Benefit Erase Paste for you! Click here to read my original post about Erase Paste! So I basically spent $26 to test this new multitasking concealer out from Benefit so you guys didn’t have to! Aren’t I the bestest friend in all the blogging world? I have mixed emotions about Erase Paste. It’s not particularly working for me but it may work for you. I think it depends on what sort of skin type you’re sporting, what you’re concealing, how old you are, etc…. You’ve already heard me moan, piss, and whine about how my under eye area refuses to cooperate with me lately. I’ve developed dry skin under my eyes plus a bit of puffiness and fine lines which equals disaster for Benefit Erase Paste. I primarily purchased this to use as an under eye concealer but it’s so thick and blends so horribly that it cakes, creases, and ages my eyes. I was hopeful that the texture and formula would be as moisturizing and as easy to blend as Benefit Boi-ing but this is far more thicker and blending is difficult, lots of tugging involved which I’m not thrilled with. I guess this can be considered moisturizing but the formula feels as if it dries to a powder even though that’s not what it’s doing. It emphasizes the dryness of my eye area terribly which makes me look more older than awake and brightened as it promises. A little goes a long way since the coverage is excellent. It should do a great job if you have dark circles and cover the pesky buggers up completely. I got the lightest shade and it still appears very beige in the jar which I don’t particularly like because it also applies that way. It matches my skin tone well enough but I normally like to go a shade or two below when working on my eye area. This brightens the area up yes but it almost feels and looks like I took my cream foundation (My skin is combo but mostly dry so I use cream foundation) and applied it under my eyes. Very strange! The spatula it comes with is a god sent. I personally wouldn’t want to dip my finger into the jar for obvious reasons but if you don’t mind, hey some of us don’t which is fine, it’d be terribly difficult to get any product out simply because this stuff is so thick you need to use the tiny spatula to scrap it out of the jar. I have some mixed emotions about this since it does make my eye area looks some what rested but honestly my other concealers work much better at doing this without aging my eye area, creasing, or caking up plus they are lighter in texture and the color is a few shades below my normal foundation color where as Erase Paste basically matches my foundation in color almost. The jar this comes in isn’t as large as you might think it is when viewing the promo images. I purposely avoided looking at the size of the jar since I wanted to be surprised at how tiny or large it might be. Turns out it’s about the size of a potted lipgloss. Not so big at all but honestly the product should last you a year or so since you need so little for coverage. Erase Paste next to my Shu Lip Lacquer for size comparison My review is based on using this as an eye concealer only. I didn’t try hiding blemishes as I have none and I didn’t try it as a full face brightener as I was wary of applying such a thick cream to my face! You honestly can’t use this on the full of your face in my humblest opinion as it seems like it’ll clog your pores in a major way! Instruction Pamphlet Included with Erase Paste for different options of use! People who might find this product helpful would be those girls that suffer with little dryness under their eyes. It might be a dream concealer for those of you with super dark circles and no dryness as it may blend easier without dry bits to worry about! So far I’ve used this twice. I can’t give it a completely bad review as I do somewhat like the coverage it gives. This morning after major prepping of my eye area it even blended a bit better then it did the first time I tried it and I’m not experiencing as much creasing. If you prep really well prior to application it blends not so badly however still plenty of tugging involved for proper application. Is it me or do you really hate when people say pat your concealer on? Pat your moisturizer on! I mean seriously in my humblest opinion if I pat on my concealer it looks stupid and if I pat on my moisturizer it pills under my eye! I have to very gently rub with my ring finger and then blot and then pat. I know how bad it is to tug but I do have to gently rub it in to blend correctly! Benefit suggests patting Erase Paste under your eye…ummmm…that isn’t going to work so well! The formula is so thick you’ll look like you’re running around with a layer of beige color cream under your eyes if you just pat and not rub. Who might love this: Girls with younger, fresher eyes! Those of you with dark, dark circles you need to conceal and cover up! Girls with mild acne that wish to conceal a blemish here and there! Those of you who do not have a dry under eye area! Who might hate this: Those of you with older eyes. Fine lines, wrinkles, and dry skin beware! Ladies that do NOT like tug on the eye area to blend! I can’t yet give this a Muse Approval for purchase but it’s slowly growing on me. If it’ll ever becomes an absolute staple in my beauty regime remains to be scene but I somehow doubt that! It’s somewhat good but it’s far from being great! I highly recommend stopping at your Benefit Counter or heading to Sephora to test this out prior to purchasing it! I’ll keep you posted as I’ll be using this for the remainder of the week before I deciding if I’ll be returning or keeping it! Have this already? Want it? Love it? Hate it? Tell the Muse!

Lunasol Geminate Diamond Palette FOTD By Isabella Muse on March 3, 2008 9 Comments in Face of the Day You may recall that I had was in with all of the Lunasol Geminate Eye Palettes when they were introduced. I went nuts and just said to myself “MUST have all!” At the time I recall my good mate Iris from Rouge Deluxe saying she liked the Diamond palette the least. At the time Iris had purchased me the Diamond palette and I was in agreement with her that it was probably not as nice as the others plus would be a bit sheer as well! It’s rare I’m in disagreement with anything she says so I was definately on the bandwagon that this particular palette wasn’t as beautiful as the rest of the lineup! However, I beg to change my opinion! It’s become a fast favorite of mine the times I’ve used it and I’ve created some ultra stunning, shimmery looks with it! I love, love, love how the colors all just work so well together! This is what I created a few days ago when using it: It’s quite nice but it’s a bit of shimmer overload! My fallout was a mess! Oh well I’m still enjoying all the glittery bits and pieces!

"['Gene Simmons on Ugly Betty By Isabella Muse on February 21, 2008 14 Comments in Babbling Bits , Celebs , Pieces of Life So Gene Simmons has been whoring himself on telly lately….This is off the topics of cosmetics so you might want to turn away while I babble vintage rock. I couldn’t sleep last night so around 3 am I found myself sitting up in bed with my ultra awesome sweetest softest blanket from Bath and Body Works (I love that thing) and powering up the Tivo to catch up on Ugly Betty. It’s been weeks since the last episode and I just now got the chance to have a watch! Much to my delight Gene Simmons popped up during the last 2 minutes of the show. Dontcha love that Gene Simmons whores himself all over TV lately? Celebrity Apprentice, Ugly Betty, Family Guy, and even SpongeBob Square Pants! You think maybe 30 years ago Gene Simmons thought to himself “Hey when I’m 60 I think I’ll lend my ultra awesome voice to a kids show about a Sponge that lives under the sea in a pineapple! ROCK ON!” Or even better yet wouldn’t it be awesome to hear Gene sing the theme song? Holy cow I’d rock out to that. Anyway. Gene also has his own reality show on A&E called Family Jewels. As I watch Gene and his slightly dysfunctional family the thought crosses my mind of how the mighty have fallen! I can’t wrap my mind around the fact that Gene Simmons, God of Rock, has a reality show. Wow. Just Wow. I think I was 5 and my cousin Joe, was about 17 or 18 and he’d pump up KISS on his very low end car stereo (the height of technology in our hay day) in his pimp’ed up Monte Carlo. Yup, my cousin was the Fonz. That’s right. He drove a pimp daddy, deep red Monte Carlo, wore a leather jacket, and had all the girls swooning at his feet. To this day my dad always looks back on Joe with fond memories and is in awe that he’s a family man now! Who would have thought all the grease in his head would lead to a beautiful wife and kids (sadly he doesn’t have much hair left to grease which the Muse is fond of reminding him of). Anyway my deep appreciation for vintage rock is due to him I guess. Mostly my blog stems from the fact that I miss Joe alot lately (he hasn’t been doing so well but that’s a story for another day). As I was watching Gene Simmons wag his tongue around on Ugly Betty last night I couldn’t help but think it would crack Joe up that this is where Gene Simmons has ended up circa 2008! The moral of the story is we love you Gene but less cheese and more rock please! You’re killing your image! If you’re any kind of a fan of KISS you might be tickled to know that it appears the writers of Ugly Betty have even infiltrated Paul Stanley as he’ll be on the show too shortly! Lord…what is the world coming too? I’m predicting the future and I’m seeing Paul and Gene on Home Shopping Network next year selling anti wrinkle cream that goes on white and black and gives you the alluring charm of the Demon or the Starchild! I can’t wait till I’m 60 so I can buy it ? Discuss (I imagine everyone is thinking shut up get on with the cosmetics already!)? You may also enjoy...

"['Japan’s Answer to Benetint By Isabella Muse on March 7, 2008 11 Comments in Asian Brands I adore stains! Big time ! I love the natural, flushed look you can get from a stain. I’ve been a big time user of Benetint for ages but in all honesty I’ve found far better alternatives. Benetint is a bit sheer for me and I can get a deeper color from other brands. Good quality stains don’t come cheap however I’m about to show you an inexpensive, high quality one! I got this off of JPmon but believe it or not I’ve also seen it in various Asian supermarkets in the US. Fact is I never knew what it was prior to seeing it on JPmon. When you’re in an Asian supermarket surrounded by stuff you aren’t familiar with you practice caution when making your selections. My main reason for not purchasing it was the fact that I wasn’t sure what it was for. Sure it has a beautiful geisha-like girl on the cover but that doesn’t mean anything! This could be dip for chicken or something how could I know it was cosmetic? Seriously have you been to an Asian market before? EVERYTHING has cute labels! Packages of Baby Star (this is a snack) have really cute images on it! The US is not yet exposed to the kawaii packaging of food and just about everything else. Hell, the only thing cute about our food packages would be cereal. America wants to shove cereal down the throats of babes so they showcase cute tigers, tucans, and three strange little elf like chefs named Snap, Crackle, and Pop. Hey, I never claimed we were creative in the US! Anyway! I was ordering some Kose Airy Whip on JpMon as the shipping is a bit cheaper for a few cans in comparison to my friends buying it and shipping it over (because you have to stock up on Airy Whip like it’s the end of the world as we know it) when I noticed that this same cheek stain that was available in my local Asian market was here at JpMon! Hmm! After being hypnotized by the delightful animation of the cute girl applying this I knew I must have! So on with the review after all that babbling…! I can’t recall how much I paid for this on JpMon but it was cheaper in the store I believe at $6 bucks or something like that. I just added it to my cart at JpMon as I was doing an order anyway so why not! This is a bit thicker then Benetint but easy enough to blend. Three dots across your cheeks, smile, blend, and perfect flushed cheeks. A tiny bit lasts all day, literally. As with all cheek stains it’s virtually waterproof, smudge-proof, and atomic bomb proof! This stuff isn’t going anywhere unless you take it off! This will work well enough on medium light skin tones like my own and it’ll also flatter a medium dark skin tone. My sister is what I call a coffee skin tone and it looks beautiful on her and even more flattering then on my own paler skin! This is something you might want to nosy around your own markets or small shops for if you have any local ones! If I can find it here I’m positive you’ll be able to find it in similar markets! Who doesn’t have a local Asian market around? If anything it’s probably the best cheapest brand of tint I’ve come across and I’ve tried them all! Works way better then Benetint that’s for sure! Sephora Urban Decay Makeover By Isabella Muse on March 7, 2008 11 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Sephora Another interesting look from Sephora! I’m a tad bit scared as I believe rigamortis is setting in here! Are you scared? I am too. I just want to know why she’s all pale under her eye area? What the hell happened?

By Isabella Muse on March 7, 2008 27 Comments in Babbling Bits , Hauls , Storage [email protected] @K! Aren’t these darling? I got these a few nights at this little shop in Chinatown. It’s sorta a Sanrio style store that carries all sorts of kawaii bits and bobs plus your run of the mill Hello Kitty stuffins! I got these for makeup storage as I was running out of room for some palettes I had and thought these would not only store them but also look really sweet on my vanity! They are really slim and long and the perfect height and size for MAC quads! I got them for $1.99 USD because Sue lurves me but they are regularly $2.49 USD which isn’t bad either in my humblest opinion! But of course I couldn’t just leave with the boxes! I ended up with these cute pill boxes as well which were $1 USD Each! I heart Kiki and Lala! Little Twin Stars Rock ? Of course I couldn’t leave without sampling the Hello Kitty warez! I got this cute little pencil box that I’m going to use for brushes when I’m away on holiday and such! It’s large enough to hold a few and has two trays! I ended up with this mini perfume atomizer as well! So kawaii! And finally Sue gifted me with this cute lipstick case! It’s a long silver heart shaped tube that’ll store one lipstick. Click the little button on the side and it pops open and a mirror is on the inner cap! Cool right? Thanks Sue the Muse hearts you (she reads my blog teehee)! Anyway that was all rather random I guess but it was all so cute, especially the storage boxes I couldn’t resist sharing! Cheers! Ghost Hunters Return: Uh Oh Another One of Those Non-Cosmetic Posts By Isabella Muse on March 5, 2008 7 Comments in Of Geeks , Pieces of Life w00t! Ghost Hunters returned tonight! The Muse has set the Tivo and recorded every juicy minute (when I’ll get a sec to watch it is anyone’s guess!)! Don’t get me wrong I’ve been enjoying Ghost Hunters International but I was missing Tango in a major way! The Muse crushes on Tango in a rather strange way! What’s not the like? He stutters slightly, he’s twitchy as hell, and he looks like he might fall over if I blow on him but hey he hunts ghosts that’s enough for the Muse! I met Tango at a geeky Fangoria style convention about a year and a half ago and can I tell you he’s as neurotic in real life as he is on the telly but still damn cute! Sadly, I don’t have pics as I was being as neurotic as he is when I met him! I may have even developed some sorta stutter! Imagine if I met a real celebrity? I’d fall over and have convulsions! So an anonymous poster had posted in my Lestat blog and said that “she loves the random geeky bits…” I can’t begin to tell you how properly chuffed I was when I read that! I got that warm, fuzzy feeling in the pit of my stomach and I felt like I had accomplished something for the geeks of the world! YES I’ve evolved and become not only your makeup guru but your geek god! I rock! Kidding. Seriously I was super proper happy that she was enjoying content that was geeky in nature minus the cosmetic side. Thus this particular post came alive after I got her comment because I sincerely want to share the joys of the Ghost Hunters with possible fans in Cosmetic Land. Granted Ghost Hunters has gone from somewhat scary to “oh my god this is so fake” to “wow Jason looks strange being bald and all and having a beard” to “warning: Purely for entertainment purposes only”. I’m saddened by the fact that Ghost Hunters has taken the commercial path and choose endorsement over science. I’m not a big believer in ghosts in all honesty (I am a believer in aliens if that counts?!) but during the first season of Ghost Hunters they had me slightly believing that maybe just maybe it was true. But it slowly went downhill soon after and I was unable to take much of it seriously. Over the course of it’s run I’d say it was from being sorta believable to being hopelessly full of bologna! Anyway even if it is for entertainment purposes I still enjoy it in a major way! I’m actually quite saddened the team has dwindled down so much and all the awesome people I enjoyed laughing at (Brian anyone?) are long gone. However, at least I get to see Brian and Barry make fools of themselves in England, Scotland, Etc…Seriously what’s better then Brian in England running around like an idiot! The team has since added that Kris or Chris chick who I find deeply annoying! The original cast is pretty much null and Jason, Grant, Steve, and Tango are all that remains but I get my kicks where I can and enjoy it even minus half the originals. Personally the Muse wants a show named Ghost Hunters Dave Tango Style but I doubt it’ll happen but if you want to start a petition give a yell! Love GH? Hate it? Heart Tango? Tell the Muse! I Heart youTube! By Isabella Muse on March 5, 2008 77 Comments in Babbling Bits , MuseTV , Pieces of Life I thought I’d share with you some of the really hysterical comments I get daily on youTube. I literally laugh myself silly sometimes at these comments and I can’t help but show you some of these because they may just amuse you too! In order to be a video blogger you need to have really tough skin. People are brutal. I’ve had people tell me I have fat hands, I talk too much, and worst! Lucky enough the positive outweighs the negative in my entire time on youTube however I’ve never seen so many people so interested in where I get the money to buy cosmetics. I’ve taken to telling them I sell organs and rob banks! Seriously, when did it become anyone’s business where I get money to pay for anything I might own? Lordie! I guess these people didn’t have a Mum like mine growing up! If I dared ask such a question I’d get hit over the head with a broom stick or a wooden spoon (My mum’s Italian!). My mother instilled some serious manners into my sister and I and asking people where they got the money to buy something or how much it costs is a number 1 offense! That’s like seven years to life in my mother’s book! I’m not ranting here I’m just generally amused! At first I was shocked but as I got used to youTube I realized that this was something I’d face daily and now I’m not so much shocked or hurt but just plain amazed at what people say! Mind you these are NOT children! These are grown adults ranging from 19-35 or more! The funny thing is on a rare occasion some of these, as I dubbed them, “strange ones” follow me over to blogger and make generally rude comments. Mind you I really dislike taking away a person’s freedom of opinion and I generally want people to say what it is they are thinking but somehow these “strange ones” think it’s their god given right not only to insult me on youTube but waltz on over to Musings, pop a squat, and insult me here! After all that babbling allow me to paste a few of my personal favorites: Comment: OMG you breath so loud you talk and then it sounds like your gasping lol. My reply: sorry ’bout that. I hadn’t noticed I was gasping or breathing loudly. I doubt she noticed the sarcasm in my “sorry ’bout that…” This particular gem comes to us from a 23 year old young lady. In my travels through youTube everyone is VERY, VERY fond of telling me about infections, eye damage, bacteria, germs, etc….as if I didn’t already know all this. This particular comment was in reply to the fact someone had said that powders are good for at least three years. I assume she wants me to use an eyeshadow once and throw it out after 2 months! Once you open them though, you’re supposed to throw them out wayyy earlier than that; otherwise, you’re just setting yourself up for any eye infection. Update: No Pink Eye Yet! Phew! As I was saying earlier people are positively fascinated with my income! Comments: ooo mmmyyy ggooosh!!!..loopove your collection!!!!… how mcuh money do spend on makeup??.. i mean just for 1 eyeshadow or blus..etc..cause u said u don’t buy cheap makeup liek the bodyshop..and i can’t even afford body shop cosmetics…=).. man! u talk alot at the beginning… where do u get all that money to buy these stuff.. u must be rich!.. anw, its quite an awesome collection cheers~ so what do you do for a job to afford all this makeup? lol I felt like replying None of your damn business LOL but I was nice! I thought the LOL at the end was a nice touch! woahh…..i want your makeup. each of those eye shadows are like 13 dollars!! your probably broke huh. ahahaha. How do you afford all your goodies?! They amaze me! x Wow! How do you afford all that stuff? Do you have a mac pro card? Either way, that is still a lot of money! I saw your stash videos. I would love to just have like a fraction of what you have! No I don’t but damn I WISH I did! How mutch money did all the stuff cost must have been really expensive? But everything looks so yummy and delicious!! How do you afford to buy high priced cosmetics at one time? and do you have a mac pro store near you? They are equally fascinated with how much I talk and aren’t shy of telling me in rude terms how much I talk: Comment: you really do talk a lot. ? but great stash This one has a an irritated smiley at the end! I guess my talking really pissed her off! The nerve of me! Talking in my own videos! Comment: WOW u talk alot!!! Folks are also very fond of telling me that I giggle too much, I say ummm too much etc…. Comment: u sat “ummm” alot in this video omg lol Well I guess you get the idea! And you can imagine that one of the main reasons I don’t do videos (and am slowly fading out FOTD pictures) anymore is because of all this drama! It’s sincerely too much of a headache to monitor comments on youTube and take out time to reply to what I consider some seriously weird comments. I’d much rather spend that time here with you guys interacting, discussing cosmetics, and just having a generally good time! Strangely enough this post wasn’t inspired by youTube. It was actually taken from the fact that I’ve made a guest starring appearance on a few forums this week. Pictures of my stash and my self were taken from here and placed on a forum. Some of the comments were good ones but some were downright scary from what I saw. I actually wasn’t upset by anything that was said (I’ve been dubbed the “fat girl” on the forums it appears) because over the past year of blogging the written word and blogging video I’ve grown such a tough skin that none of this fails to shock me anymore or hurt me for that matter. It interests me that people find me so fascinating that they want to rip me a new a**hole without every getting to know me as a person! But oh well..to each his or her own! My take on it is I’m still the same old person I was yesterday and I’d personally never say or do anything that these people do and I take pride in that. I’m a generally nice and good person and I sadly fail to expect the same in people lately but I defiantly treasure those who have the same type of heart that I do! Hope you enjoyed my foray into youTube! Do feel free to comment minus the OMG WHEREZ U GETZ TEH MONIES FOR DAT!? Hehe! Cheers! PS Do remember that I love each of you and 99.9% of the comments I get on Musings of a Muse are awesome so do keep chatting to me and commenting! I love hearing from each and every single one of you!']",2a52f7ff15bd165d820994a5a43ab7b892941dd6,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4167,

"['Rimmel Underground Spring Collection 2008: Rock, Spark, and Spin By Isabella Muse on March 11, 2008 6 Comments in Beauty on a Budget Yea, yea, just call me a regular drugstore whore. I’m quite a freak lately and have been making the rounds into drugstores far and wide. I’d normally never venture within the realms of a US Drugstore however I’ve had to get a few things for our mate, Rows, at Mostly Makeup thus I’ve seen the inside of one too many drugstores lately and I find…I’m sorta liking it! I ran across Rimmel’s Spring Collection while rolling around the floor at Harmon’s searching out Milani Wet/Dry Eyeshadows that weren’t to be had or seen! The collection consists of 6 cream shadow trios, 5 sparkling eye pencils, and 6 potted lipglosses. Rimmel is far from my favorite brand of cosmetics even though my sister swears by it like it’s God’s given gift to the mortal soul. I’ve only tried one item from the entire line and that was enough to set me off it for good. I can’t recall exactly but it was a mascara and that stuff flaked, ran, smudged, and just made me scream in agonizing pain at the unjustness of cheap mascara! WHY GOD WHY! However, the Rimmel Spring display did tempt me. It was all bold and bright and the eye pencils called my name and said “Buy us! Buy us! We’re only $3.99 Each!” So…I brought ’em. The eyeshadows held little appeal as I’m not much for creams and the idea of having three creams in one pot with no dividers made me shudder in fear! Imagine the mess? The glosses weren’t exactly that fab either! However, the idea of a sparkling pencil did get me slightly excited and the price was $3.99 so I got four of the five colors (I’d have gotten five but they sold out of the black shade!). I purchased these because they reminded me of MAC’s sparkler pencil yet in deeper, darker, funkier colors! Well…..the verdict is in and they go on smooth enough with a bit of tugging but I dunno I’m not thrilled. The formula could be a bit softer for easier application but it’s not completely bad either! $3.99 USD isn’t too bad a price and the color selection is quite gorgeous however I didn’t see so much sparkle but as just an eyeliner they did an ok job! The colors I got were Peridot which is a cold dark blue, Tiger’s Eye which is a gold based brown, Ultra Violet which is a sea green, and Lapis which is a brownish copper. The good news is these have fabulous staying power. These babies aren’t going anywhere once on! I seriously had to do some major tugging to get them off with oil based makeup remover! No fading, no smudging, and lasted all damn day and night! Tiger’s Eye, Ultra Violet, Peridot, and Lapis Sorry guys the swatches all kinda look the same! New cam is on the way soonish! As I said for the price you can’t really beat ’em! I can’t Muse Approve these but I’d definately recommend heading to your local drugstore and having a peek! You can see more of the collection at Lipstick, Powder, n’ Paint! Click! Have these? Want ’em? Love Rimmel? Tell the Muse! Boots No7 Cleanse & Care Eye Make-Up Remover Review By Isabella Muse on March 11, 2008 4 Comments in Boots , Eye Makeup Remover Here’s one for the trash kids! I was in Target a few days ago because my sister enjoys dragging me around that bloody store like nobody’s business! As she oohhhh’ed and ahhhhhh’ed over her finds I wandered over to the Boots section to have a peek. I generally like Boots line of products and I haven’t really purchased anything that I didn’t love however the eye makeover remover gets my big old “don’t buy” stamp. I normally get Sephora’s remover for $8 or when I’m feeling lucky I look through E-bay to score some cheap Bi-Facil (you seriously don’t think I’d spend $26 on that stuff did you? Sometimes the Muse is cheap!). However, I was feeling adventurous so I decided to grab some of the No7 Cleanse & Care remover and call it a day! I was thinking somehow this would become a staple as soon as I noticed that it had a pump! W00t! Awesome! Instead of having to dip my cleaner onto my cotton pad I could now pump the cleaner on! Wow how techy! The coolness ends right there my friends. Aside from the ultra awesome pump this does absolutely nothing in the way of removing hardcore eye makeup! I didn’t have much on but it was a whole lot of tugging to get it to remove anything. A few swipes later and about half a bottle I had successfully removed about 60% of my eyeshadow and none of my mascara. Sigh. Well that chalks this up as heading right into the trash can! $8 bucks down the drain and still a load of eye makeup on! Boo Boots! I’m disappointed in you! Have you used this? Love it? Hate it? Tell the Muse! Heath Ledger Broke?! By Isabella Muse on March 11, 2008 12 Comments in Celebs I was shocked to hear that Heath Ledger has a total of $100,000 to his name. I’m left wondering how the hell that’s possible? According to a news article on Yahoo the Brokeback Mountain star has a total of $100,000 in various bank accounts, a $25,000 car, and about $20,000 in furniture and home fixtures. He’s not in dept but he wasn’t exactly doing so great. Click! The man’s mad 23 films or so and he only squirreled away $100,000? Granted many of the films he’s starred in are Indie however he has been in some seriously silly Hollywood flicks…he had to be paid something for those right? Wow. Shocked here. Your Current Beauty Addictions By Isabella Muse on March 10, 2008 18 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Fab Favs My tastes in cosmetics varies from day to day, week to week, and month to month.

Tiffa Spring Collection 2008 By Isabella Muse on March 10, 2008 3 Comments in Japanese Brands , Spring Collections 2008 If you can believe it Tiffa has updated it’s website! Whoa. Big news here. I can’t recall the last time Tiffa bothered updating it’s site and not only have they updated but they have a new Spring Collection up and available! I’m not sure when this new line hits shops in Japan but I’d say shortly. Tiffa is a sub-company of Kanebo and carries a small but lovely line of products that are inexpensive. The updates to the line seem very interesting and I may add a few to my wish list! Three Glitter Liners have been introduced in pink, silver, and black for 1000 yen each. Also available are three “fragrant waters”. I’m not sure if these are body sprays or spray toners! And finally three cologne sprays! The introduction of these leads me to believe that the above could be spray toners! I sure hope so because they look interesting if they are! The new site is far easier to navigate if you are unable to read characters. The original site was cute but annoying as you had to unlock doors and such to see products. The new site offers a range of categories to find exactly what you are looking for quickly plus the pink theme is so sweet! Not really any major releases for Tiffa but it’s nice to see the brand isn’t forgotten as it’s been a while inbetween releases! I’m holding onto the hope that they do some more of the dual shadow shimmers! The gold and silver is gorgeous! Love to see more! Want these? Love Tiffa?

"['Koda Kumi is a Goner! By Isabella Muse on March 10, 2008 4 Comments in Celebs , Japanese Brands , Visee I was wandering around the Visee website this morning and it’s pretty much official that Kodi Kumi is a goner from the champaign. The new site is updated with a face chart when you click “What’s New?” Here’s what you used to get when clicking “What’s New?” As you can see Kodi Kumi has been replaced with a cutesy face chart! I believe the site went live again about a week or two ago and the images have been revamped to exclude Kodi Kumi from the ads. I’m not sure if she’s completely gone or this is temporary while the fire cools. I’m betting she’s gone completely and the Summer Collection will feature a new spokesperson! But we shall see! I’ll miss her actually as she has that edge that really brought Visee alive for me and I’m curious who they’ll replace her with! Below is the new Make-Up theme, again Kodi Kumi has been replaced by the cute face chart image! If you’re not up to date on the drama click here to read why Kodi Kumi is under fire at the moment! Benefit The Fast and the Flawless Kit By Isabella Muse on March 10, 2008 2 Comments in Benefit , Sephora , Spring Collections 2008 Benefit’s released a Sephora exclusive kit that includes it’s popular oil free foundation Some Kind of Gorgeous along with some other interesting bits and pieces. The kit also includes Eye Bright, Get Bent Lash Mascara, Benetint, a Mousepad, a carrying case. The kit is $48 USD and available from Sephora now. I’m personally not partaking of this particular kit but for you Benefit lovers this might be something you want to snatch up! I’ve always been curious about Some Kind of Gorgeous but each time I test it on the back of my hand in the store it just feels so wrong and the color is so beige and unflattering!! Love this? Want it? Tell the Muse! Happy Monday! By Isabella Muse on March 10, 2008 12 Comments in Babbling Bits , Pieces of Life Happy Monday girls (and guys)! Sadly, no new updates for the Muse today. I have about 5 good entries to post but sadly Blogger is still in weekend mode and refuses to work for me. Dunno what’s going on but I’m unable to upload pictures. It’s definately not a problem on my side but nothing on the maintenance page from Blogger either. Sigh. How very irritating! I’ve tried in several browses including Safari and no joy! So sadly, updates have to wait a while until this is fixed up! Hope everyone had a great weekend! I needed to get my mind off a few things so I really kept myself busy this weekend! I ended up going to two movies with friends, shopping with some friends, brunch with some friends I haven’t seen in a while, helped my mum get her Easter dinner shopping done, went to visit my cousin, did Spring closet and makeup cleaning, went to a poetry reading, went to a book signing, and a bunch of other stuff. All this excluding sleep lol! I’m kidding ? How about you? What did you do this weekend? It was major cold here. Strong winds about 26 degrees out! Brrrr! But it felt good walking along in a warm jacket and gloves. Sometimes it just feels nice to be out in the cold weather! Anyway! Updates to come as soon as Blogger decides to cooperate! This little problem should get my arse in gear to get my own website up and rolling and do away with Blogger completely! Back to work with my lazy self! Cheers! PS Good news. I was able to locate the Horizon Blush in Pink! w00t! I’ll be reviewing it shortly ? Laneige Snow Radiant Blusher Review By Isabella Muse on March 7, 2008 41 Comments in Asian Brands , Korean Brands , Laneige I was browsing around the Laneige site a few weeks ago and I came across the The Secret of the Snow Crystal Snow Radiant Blushers. Sounds like an epic motion picture! Now playing The Secret of the Snow Crystal starring Bai Ling! I’m not entirely sure if these were from the Holiday Collection or not and after much discussion and debate with a friend we decided that maybe they were something available from the Korean side of Laneige only! Anyway! I ended up getting the entire three that were released because they simply reminded me of MAC Mineralized Skinfinish and I rock Mineralized Skinfinish so that meant I’d be sure to shower love all over these! These were about the same cost as an MSF and honestly they have the potential for converting non MSF users. Some folk hate Mineralized Skinfinish because they are glittery and shimmery. A wide range of the colors released thus far have contained chunky bits of glitter and not everyone likes to hose themselves down with glitter the way the Muse does! Those of you who may have ranted that MAC’s powders have some major shimmer will be delighted to know that these perform the way you probably hoped for from MAC. They highlight, create a soft glow on your face, and enhance your blush minus the shimmer and glitter. The powder is soft and silky and easy to blend. The effect that these create is what I call a sort of photo finish glow. You can use these on natural bare skin or over your blush. I personally like to use them over my blush. You can also contour areas of your face for extra highlighting if you prefer. Laneige Snow Radiant Blusher in Snow Laneige Snow Radiant Blusher in Gold Laneige Snow Radiant Blusher in Pink Prism I think they are quite a nifty powder to add to your beauty arsenal and a wonderful alternative if you’re not loving the amount of shimmer you get from a MAC Mineralized Skinfinish!

My Celebirty Look-A-Likes By Isabella Muse on March 7, 2008 15 Comments in Babbling Bits , Celebs I decided to do one of these “Celebrity Look-a-likes” after seeing them on a few other blogs! I’m scratching my head wondering how my celebrity look-a-like falls into the Beyonce and Eva Langoria range! I thought for sure after putting my picture up it would compile and come up with images of Roseanne Bar, Rosie O’Donnell, and if I was lucky by some chance maybe they’d stick Mia Tyler in there! But I somehow got lucky. I really couldn’t care less about Eva Langoria but hell I don’t mind being compared to Beyonce but above all else they went and released my inner Asian and I’m now on par with the likes of Aya Matsuura. I feel like I’ve arrived. Aya Matsuura! Am I awesome or what!? Now another one I’m properly chuffed with is Brigette Bardot. Wow…I’m a sex symbol now baby!

By Isabella Muse on March 5, 2008 77 Comments in Babbling Bits , MuseTV , Pieces of Life I thought I’d share with you some of the really hysterical comments I get daily on youTube. I literally laugh myself silly sometimes at these comments and I can’t help but show you some of these because they may just amuse you too! In order to be a video blogger you need to have really tough skin. People are brutal. I’ve had people tell me I have fat hands, I talk too much, and worst! Lucky enough the positive outweighs the negative in my entire time on youTube however I’ve never seen so many people so interested in where I get the money to buy cosmetics. I’ve taken to telling them I sell organs and rob banks! Seriously, when did it become anyone’s business where I get money to pay for anything I might own? Lordie! I guess these people didn’t have a Mum like mine growing up! If I dared ask such a question I’d get hit over the head with a broom stick or a wooden spoon (My mum’s Italian!). My mother instilled some serious manners into my sister and I and asking people where they got the money to buy something or how much it costs is a number 1 offense! That’s like seven years to life in my mother’s book! I’m not ranting here I’m just generally amused! At first I was shocked but as I got used to youTube I realized that this was something I’d face daily and now I’m not so much shocked or hurt but just plain amazed at what people say! Mind you these are NOT children! These are grown adults ranging from 19-35 or more! The funny thing is on a rare occasion some of these, as I dubbed them, “strange ones” follow me over to blogger and make generally rude comments. Mind you I really dislike taking away a person’s freedom of opinion and I generally want people to say what it is they are thinking but somehow these “strange ones” think it’s their god given right not only to insult me on youTube but waltz on over to Musings, pop a squat, and insult me here! After all that babbling allow me to paste a few of my personal favorites: Comment: OMG you breath so loud you talk and then it sounds like your gasping lol. My reply: sorry ’bout that. I hadn’t noticed I was gasping or breathing loudly. I doubt she noticed the sarcasm in my “sorry ’bout that…” This particular gem comes to us from a 23 year old young lady. In my travels through youTube everyone is VERY, VERY fond of telling me about infections, eye damage, bacteria, germs, etc….as if I didn’t already know all this. This particular comment was in reply to the fact someone had said that powders are good for at least three years. I assume she wants me to use an eyeshadow once and throw it out after 2 months! Once you open them though, you’re supposed to throw them out wayyy earlier than that; otherwise, you’re just setting yourself up for any eye infection. Update: No Pink Eye Yet! Phew! As I was saying earlier people are positively fascinated with my income! Comments: ooo mmmyyy ggooosh!!!..loopove your collection!!!!… how mcuh money do spend on makeup??.. i mean just for 1 eyeshadow or blus..etc..cause u said u don’t buy cheap makeup liek the bodyshop..and i can’t even afford body shop cosmetics…=).. man! u talk alot at the beginning… where do u get all that money to buy these stuff.. u must be rich!.. anw, its quite an awesome collection cheers~ so what do you do for a job to afford all this makeup? lol I felt like replying None of your damn business LOL but I was nice! I thought the LOL at the end was a nice touch! woahh…..i want your makeup. each of those eye shadows are like 13 dollars!! your probably broke huh. ahahaha. How do you afford all your goodies?! They amaze me! x Wow! How do you afford all that stuff? Do you have a mac pro card? Either way, that is still a lot of money! I saw your stash videos. I would love to just have like a fraction of what you have! No I don’t but damn I WISH I did! How mutch money did all the stuff cost must have been really expensive? But everything looks so yummy and delicious!! How do you afford to buy high priced cosmetics at one time? and do you have a mac pro store near you? They are equally fascinated with how much I talk and aren’t shy of telling me in rude terms how much I talk: Comment: you really do talk a lot. ? but great stash This one has a an irritated smiley at the end! I guess my talking really pissed her off! The nerve of me! Talking in my own videos! Comment: WOW u talk alot!!! Folks are also very fond of telling me that I giggle too much, I say ummm too much etc…. Comment: u sat “ummm” alot in this video omg lol Well I guess you get the idea! And you can imagine that one of the main reasons I don’t do videos (and am slowly fading out FOTD pictures) anymore is because of all this drama! It’s sincerely too much of a headache to monitor comments on youTube and take out time to reply to what I consider some seriously weird comments. I’d much rather spend that time here with you guys interacting, discussing cosmetics, and just having a generally good time! Strangely enough this post wasn’t inspired by youTube. It was actually taken from the fact that I’ve made a guest starring appearance on a few forums this week. Pictures of my stash and my self were taken from here and placed on a forum. Some of the comments were good ones but some were downright scary from what I saw. I actually wasn’t upset by anything that was said (I’ve been dubbed the “fat girl” on the forums it appears) because over the past year of blogging the written word and blogging video I’ve grown such a tough skin that none of this fails to shock me anymore or hurt me for that matter. It interests me that people find me so fascinating that they want to rip me a new a**hole without every getting to know me as a person! But oh well..to each his or her own! My take on it is I’m still the same old person I was yesterday and I’d personally never say or do anything that these people do and I take pride in that. I’m a generally nice and good person and I sadly fail to expect the same in people lately but I defiantly treasure those who have the same type of heart that I do! Hope you enjoyed my foray into youTube! Do feel free to comment minus the OMG WHEREZ U GETZ TEH MONIES FOR DAT!? Hehe! Cheers! PS Do remember that I love each of you and 99.9% of the comments I get on Musings of a Muse are awesome so do keep chatting to me and commenting! I love hearing from each and every single one of you!

"['Ghost Hunters Return: Uh Oh Another One of Those Non-Cosmetic Posts By Isabella Muse on March 5, 2008 7 Comments in Of Geeks , Pieces of Life w00t! Ghost Hunters returned tonight! The Muse has set the Tivo and recorded every juicy minute (when I’ll get a sec to watch it is anyone’s guess!)! Don’t get me wrong I’ve been enjoying Ghost Hunters International but I was missing Tango in a major way! The Muse crushes on Tango in a rather strange way! What’s not the like? He stutters slightly, he’s twitchy as hell, and he looks like he might fall over if I blow on him but hey he hunts ghosts that’s enough for the Muse! I met Tango at a geeky Fangoria style convention about a year and a half ago and can I tell you he’s as neurotic in real life as he is on the telly but still damn cute! Sadly, I don’t have pics as I was being as neurotic as he is when I met him! I may have even developed some sorta stutter! Imagine if I met a real celebrity? I’d fall over and have convulsions! So an anonymous poster had posted in my Lestat blog and said that “she loves the random geeky bits…” I can’t begin to tell you how properly chuffed I was when I read that! I got that warm, fuzzy feeling in the pit of my stomach and I felt like I had accomplished something for the geeks of the world! YES I’ve evolved and become not only your makeup guru but your geek god! I rock! Kidding. Seriously I was super proper happy that she was enjoying content that was geeky in nature minus the cosmetic side. Thus this particular post came alive after I got her comment because I sincerely want to share the joys of the Ghost Hunters with possible fans in Cosmetic Land. Granted Ghost Hunters has gone from somewhat scary to “oh my god this is so fake” to “wow Jason looks strange being bald and all and having a beard” to “warning: Purely for entertainment purposes only”. I’m saddened by the fact that Ghost Hunters has taken the commercial path and choose endorsement over science. I’m not a big believer in ghosts in all honesty (I am a believer in aliens if that counts?!) but during the first season of Ghost Hunters they had me slightly believing that maybe just maybe it was true. But it slowly went downhill soon after and I was unable to take much of it seriously. Over the course of it’s run I’d say it was from being sorta believable to being hopelessly full of bologna! Anyway even if it is for entertainment purposes I still enjoy it in a major way! I’m actually quite saddened the team has dwindled down so much and all the awesome people I enjoyed laughing at (Brian anyone?) are long gone. However, at least I get to see Brian and Barry make fools of themselves in England, Scotland, Etc…Seriously what’s better then Brian in England running around like an idiot! The team has since added that Kris or Chris chick who I find deeply annoying! The original cast is pretty much null and Jason, Grant, Steve, and Tango are all that remains but I get my kicks where I can and enjoy it even minus half the originals. Personally the Muse wants a show named Ghost Hunters Dave Tango Style but I doubt it’ll happen but if you want to start a petition give a yell! Love GH? Hate it? Heart Tango? Tell the Muse!

"['Kawaii Storage and More! By Isabella Muse on March 7, 2008 27 Comments in Babbling Bits , Hauls , Storage [email protected] @K! Aren’t these darling? I got these a few nights at this little shop in Chinatown. It’s sorta a Sanrio style store that carries all sorts of kawaii bits and bobs plus your run of the mill Hello Kitty stuffins! I got these for makeup storage as I was running out of room for some palettes I had and thought these would not only store them but also look really sweet on my vanity! They are really slim and long and the perfect height and size for MAC quads! I got them for $1.99 USD because Sue lurves me but they are regularly $2.49 USD which isn’t bad either in my humblest opinion! But of course I couldn’t just leave with the boxes! I ended up with these cute pill boxes as well which were $1 USD Each! I heart Kiki and Lala! Little Twin Stars Rock ? Of course I couldn’t leave without sampling the Hello Kitty warez! I got this cute little pencil box that I’m going to use for brushes when I’m away on holiday and such! It’s large enough to hold a few and has two trays! I ended up with this mini perfume atomizer as well! So kawaii! And finally Sue gifted me with this cute lipstick case! It’s a long silver heart shaped tube that’ll store one lipstick. Click the little button on the side and it pops open and a mirror is on the inner cap! Cool right? Thanks Sue the Muse hearts you (she reads my blog teehee)! Anyway that was all rather random I guess but it was all so cute, especially the storage boxes I couldn’t resist sharing! Cheers! You may also enjoy... In Need of Some Extra Storage?

"['Japan’s Answer to Benetint By Isabella Muse on March 7, 2008 11 Comments in Asian Brands I adore stains! Big time ! I love the natural, flushed look you can get from a stain. I’ve been a big time user of Benetint for ages but in all honesty I’ve found far better alternatives. Benetint is a bit sheer for me and I can get a deeper color from other brands. Good quality stains don’t come cheap however I’m about to show you an inexpensive, high quality one! I got this off of JPmon but believe it or not I’ve also seen it in various Asian supermarkets in the US. Fact is I never knew what it was prior to seeing it on JPmon. When you’re in an Asian supermarket surrounded by stuff you aren’t familiar with you practice caution when making your selections. My main reason for not purchasing it was the fact that I wasn’t sure what it was for. Sure it has a beautiful geisha-like girl on the cover but that doesn’t mean anything! This could be dip for chicken or something how could I know it was cosmetic? Seriously have you been to an Asian market before? EVERYTHING has cute labels! Packages of Baby Star (this is a snack) have really cute images on it! The US is not yet exposed to the kawaii packaging of food and just about everything else. Hell, the only thing cute about our food packages would be cereal. America wants to shove cereal down the throats of babes so they showcase cute tigers, tucans, and three strange little elf like chefs named Snap, Crackle, and Pop. Hey, I never claimed we were creative in the US! Anyway! I was ordering some Kose Airy Whip on JpMon as the shipping is a bit cheaper for a few cans in comparison to my friends buying it and shipping it over (because you have to stock up on Airy Whip like it’s the end of the world as we know it) when I noticed that this same cheek stain that was available in my local Asian market was here at JpMon! Hmm! After being hypnotized by the delightful animation of the cute girl applying this I knew I must have! So on with the review after all that babbling…! I can’t recall how much I paid for this on JpMon but it was cheaper in the store I believe at $6 bucks or something like that. I just added it to my cart at JpMon as I was doing an order anyway so why not! This is a bit thicker then Benetint but easy enough to blend. Three dots across your cheeks, smile, blend, and perfect flushed cheeks. A tiny bit lasts all day, literally. As with all cheek stains it’s virtually waterproof, smudge-proof, and atomic bomb proof! This stuff isn’t going anywhere unless you take it off! This will work well enough on medium light skin tones like my own and it’ll also flatter a medium dark skin tone. My sister is what I call a coffee skin tone and it looks beautiful on her and even more flattering then on my own paler skin! This is something you might want to nosy around your own markets or small shops for if you have any local ones! If I can find it here I’m positive you’ll be able to find it in similar markets! Who doesn’t have a local Asian market around? If anything it’s probably the best cheapest brand of tint I’ve come across and I’ve tried them all! Works way better then Benetint that’s for sure!

"['Non Cosmetic Babblings About the Brit Awards 2008 By Isabella Muse on April 2, 2008 16 Comments in Babbling Bits , Celebs After a bit of a wait the US was treated to the Brit Awards a few weeks ago on BBC America. The original showing was about over a month ago British side I believe and I finally got to sit down and see it for myself rather then go through youTube clips, blogs, etc…. I always appreciate Brit Award shows far more then I do the US ones. I found the Brits really hang loose where as we are so commercial and Hollywood US side the Brits just sorta sit back, kick back the liquor, get loud and enjoy themselves. Not likely in the US Award ceremonies. The UK always remind me of a buncha drunk folk in a pub lushing it up. I don’t normally even like Award shows but if it’s British I’m all over it like white on rice! The awards were hosted by none other then the Prince of Darkness and his family. I freaking love watching the Osbournes in action. It’s like a trainwreck, you just can’t take your eyes off, particularly Sharon. I love Ozzy and I love Black Sabbath and watching Ozzy age before my very eyes has always taken a little bit of getting used too! Ozzy was fine, Jack was fine, Kelly was fine, but I couldn’t figure out if Sharon was high, drunk, or just being a show off in general. I go with being a show off. She’s one for flashing herself around and acting all hot in the pan. She was really, really irritating. I normally find her ok to deal with but last night I felt like slapping her upside the head. I must say that the amount of weight that Jack and Kelly have taken off is amazing and they really look very healthy and beautiful. Not that they weren’t before but they just look very cleaned up and mature. A big improvement over the old Kelly and Jack for sure. The strangest part of the entire night was when Sir Ian McKellen got up to present and proceeded to say, “If you’re wondering (and I was wondering) what I’m doing at the Brits, I’m here to meet MIKA!” At this point I gulped my tea the wrong way and spurted it back out at the TV. Wow. Way to out a guy Ian! I love me some Ian but this might be a bit too much considering how private Mika is about his sexuality and which side he’s pitching for. I imagine at this point the poor guy crawled under his table and prayed for death! The Muse’s favorite Doctor made his special appearance at the awards and general drool, panting, and such occurred as he walked on stage to present. David has a knack for swinging around the court in a manly manner or last night in this particular case he displayed his metrosexual sense of flair and style with a close fitting jacket and a ultra cute t-shirt with a star emblem. We love you David, you’re a god. He presented the award to Kylie whom walked right into David’s arms as I stared daggers at the screen. I felt a bit of chemistry there…hmm the girlfriend is going to be jealous David you cheeky little monkey! I almost threw the TV out the window at this point since I was gagging so hard watching Kylie’s little botox arse hug David so hard but I realized I had a good hour left of the show so best keep the telly sitting where it was! Amy Winehouse was surprisely sober during all this fanfare or at least she looked slightly sober. Her voice, as always, was beautiful. Her hair was in some decent sort of order, decent for Amy anyway. I suspect she took a few downers in the back prior to going on stage because damn she was very mellow. I almost didn’t recognize the “unwired” Amy! Rihanna was looking beautiful as always! I can totally understand why this chick’s legs are insured for a million bucks! Oh Lord I’m embarrassed for Sharon! I think the major highlight of the night was the brief 20 seconds that Jonathan Rhys Meyers hopped on stage to present. He was looking smoking HOT! We aren’t exposed to enough JR here in the states. Please can it be Jonathan Rhys Meyers time all the time? Thanks the Muse appreciates it! We know why you like his album Jonathan! I was also loving the Arctic Monkeys! They looked sweet as pie in my humblest! That could be a bias opinion as I love them so much! All in all an interesting night of beautiful brits! Did you see it? It should be available on youTube by now! Do share if you watched! You may also enjoy...

"['Pieces of Life: The Gossip Girl Edition By Isabella Muse on January 8, 2009 Leave a Comment in Babbling Bits , Celebs , Pieces of Life I only got the chance to watch the first five minutes of Gossip Girl this week since the Muse has been very, very, very, alot busy but did you check out who’s starring as Chuck Bass’s uncle? Well, hello gorgeous! Muse, who is this love muffin you speak of? Tis my future husband Desmond Harrington of course! Desmond played Joey Quinn in this season of Dexter and did a brilliant job of it might I add. Now the Muse normally doesn’t fall for manly men such as Desmond but she must say that his accent sends shivers down her little spine. Desmond was born in Georgia but grew up in the Bronx and that boy has the accent to prove it. Loves it! I don’t think I’ve seen him in a role where he’s fully dropped his accent so it’s always rather fetching to watch him work. Growing up in New York I have a deal for the accents around these parts…hells you should hear my friend Marc his accent is harder and rougher than Desmond’s! And hello now he’s playing Chuck’s uncle on Gossip Girl? The Muse is totally thrilled. Holy Hotness Batman! I sure hope that they keep him on Dexter next season as well because although he wasn’t cast in the most brilliant light the Muse just enjoys the extra eye candy on the show! Yums! I think they’ll set him up with Lily on Gossip Girl but from what I have seen…was he flirting with Blair in that first scene? This could get dangerous!

Benefit’s Talk to the Tan By Isabella Muse on March 12, 2008 15 Comments in Benefit , Spring Collections 2008 I’m not a big fan of self tanners, tanning, or anything else that has to do with the sun. I keep far away from bronzing, tanning, and anything else of that nature. I like my pure white skin very much thank you! However, if you happen to love tanning and such you might want to see out Benefit’s new tan in a tube entitled Talk to the Tan. As I recall Benefit used to have a similar product entitled Aruba in a Tube or something like that. Another equally scary product from what I remember! But ado if you’re dying for a tan in a tube do check out Benefit’s newest product! If you do try it I want details and a review! ? Curious minds how it works! I know my sister is dying to get her hands on this but she’s the type that loves to look like burnt toast. Babblings About Digital Cameras and Musings of Change! By Isabella Muse on March 12, 2008 10 Comments in Miscellaneous Blogging Hey Guys! I wanted to share something with you! I’m about to embark on the purchase of a new digi cam in April. I’ve been using my trusty Kodak and Sony for ages and I thought I needed something with a bit more meat. After carefully consulting with my digital camera guru, Vanessa , I decided to go with a Canon. She had recommend two solid models and after a bit of thought I decided to wait a little while and go with the Canon Powershot SD1100 which is releasing in April. I seriously don’t need another digital camera as I have plenty in the “digital graveyard” in my closet where all old technology goes to rest (mice, keyboards, cameras, printers, my commadore 64, my Apple Lisa, etc…etc..). It appears, like the geek I am, that I develop emotional attachments to hardware and have a hard time throwing it away! This particular model of the Canon looks very good. This is actually more a purchase for you guys then for me. I wanted something that would take high quality images of cosmetics, good bright photos of swatches, and close up shots. My old camera does ok with these things but I could definately use an upgrade! I normally avoid swatching because my camera takes such crummy shots and the colors appear wrong so hopefully the Canon will solve this problem and we’ll end up with some good true to color swatch pictures. Anyway! Thought I’d share and tell you to be on the look out for better pictures coming to a blog near you very soon! I think this will be extremely beneficial when your unable to purchase Japanese cosmetics at retail. The jacked up prices don’t give you an option to make a mistake with color if you know what I mean. So if you end up shelling out cash for Japanese Collections you’ll at least have the tools you need (my swatches and photos) to make proper color selections when purchasing! Most of you know that a majority of my Japanese cosmetics are purchased at retail cost. I have a few friends that live in Japan and they get me what I need and I do the same for them. But when you’re purchasing online prices have a tendency to rise from $5-$10 USD or more! A few other changes are also coming your way shortly…. Good changes I hope. A new adventure awaits readers of Musings of a Muse some of which I think might be exciting! I’m working on my own forum very soon so you’ll have a place to chat to fellow readers, swap cosmetics, chat about brands, etc….. There are many, many makeup forums around but I thought Musings of a Muse deserved it’s own forum! So it shall be very soon! I’ve wanted to do this for a long time but I just haven’t had the time but know it’s in the works! After much thought and consideration I’ve decided to start podcasting some of my posts. This should be live very soon depending on how much time I have to do it. Now you’ll not only have the opportunity to read my posts but you’ll also be able to listen to me babble about a collection, share my thoughts and opinions, and just do my normal giggle ummmm routine! Brace yourself while I try to remove the giggles and the “ummm’s” from my vocabulary! I’ve wanted to do this for a while and I thought it would be a fun and unique way to make my posts even more interesting! I think that’s about it for now! I hope you’ll find all these new additions as exciting as I do! Thanks to my old and new readers because this can’t be possible without each of you! Update: Camera is on the way! Amazon.com had listed it’s release April 15 but thanks to Taryn for showing the Muse it was available on Best Buy! So we’ll now have quality images soon! I hope it works well in low light situations and such! We shall see! Cheers Taryn! Thanks for helping a Muse out ? Biore PJ Party! By Isabella Muse on March 12, 2008 33 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Skincare This idea came to me today when I was talking to our little Cookie, Lilan, from the Daily Cookie . We were chatting back and fourth and she had mentioned she and her boyfriend had done a series of pictures using Bior? products last week. Honestly, guys, I begged and pleaded with our Cookie to please post these pictures and how much of a contribution this would be to the beauty blogging world! I tried! I really did! Let’s hope my hard work pays off and we get to see Lil and the boyfriend doing their review of Bior? shortly! For now I decided I needed my own pampering. It’s been a long, hard day at work so I decided to treat my skin nice! Pajama Party Provisions As you may have noticed I’m on a budget beauty buying cycle lately and one item that I believe gives alot of bang for my buck is Bior?. It’s one of the very select few brands from a drugstore that I trust and have found to actually work. Quite a few products in the line I love and I’m particularly in lust with what I can get from Japan in regards to Bior?. Seriously have you seen Japan Bior? products? Everything is all pink and sweet looking! As I was saying I had a long day at work so facial time! Yay! AWWWWWWWWWWWW the Muse is exhausted after her hard day at work! Her eyeshadow is smudged, her foundation is fading, her lipstick is long gone but her PJ’s sure do match! The Muse is such a chic girl isn’t she? I’m a bit lazy and I’m really not in the mood for my full blown facial regime of removing my makeup but have no fear Bior? Daily Cleaning Cloths are here! YAY! Seriously, I think we all fall into a bit of a funk some nights and aren’t too interested in spending alot of time removing our makeup! Especially when we just want to turn the lights off and go to bed! Daily Cleaning Clothes make that possible! Each cloth is pre-moistened with a cleaning solution that doesn’t have to be washed off. Wipe it across your face a few times and it’ll pretty much remove everything from your face. As you know I wear some bold shades of eyeshadow and this removes them without a problem! Although it doesn’t do that good a job on waterproof mascara but seriously neither do MAC cleaning clothes so honestly that’s not the fault of the cloth that’s just the formula of your mascara! Two clothes later and my face was happy, refreshed, and clean! After I got all that gunk off my face I needed a seriously good scrubbing down. The winter weather is harsh and my skin is suffering from some serious dryness, flakes and all! Gross! Sooooooo I got me some Bior? Unclogging Scrub and scrubbed my way into nirvana. This is the first time I’ve used this particular scrub and I must say it’s quite good. It does a fab job of removing flaky skin from my forehead and given time I imagine this will clear up the blackheads on my nose as well. If you’re acne prone this contains salicylic acid to clear up any nasties you have keeping house on your face! It was a good scrub and did a great job smoothing out my face but I found it to be a bit drying. That could be because it’s an acne treatment. If you’re oily this may very well be a god sent for you as it’s liable to dry up any oily bits on your face! The formula contains little microbeads! See ’em? It also has a very fresh smell! Now it was time for a bit of a facial! I adore Bior? self-heating mask! So good! This is seriously a fab mask! If you’ve never used this before you have to try it at least once! It’s a one minute facial that you rub into your skin and as you rub it heats and fells so warm and cozy and lovely! It exfloliates the skin while detoxing it and removing any yuck that might be lurking in your pores plus it’s good if your skin is oily! This feels wonderful in the Winter but I love using it in the Summer to combat oil on my forehead! \\ And since I love you guys so much I’m of course including photos of me wearing the mask…you’ll probably find some use to blackmail me with them later….. Scary Muse! BOO! Of course after all this I had to go the extra yard and attack the blackheads hanging out on my nose! What better way to do that then with a Deep Cleaning Pore Strip? Pore Strips are God’s gift to humanity. I’ve seriously never found a better product to remove blackheads. I scrub, and scrub, and scrub and I have seriously little success removing the blackheads from my nose that have taken up residence, built a condo, and have settled in with the kids. They stay there and never leave. Unless I go to a Spa and extract these chances are no product, expensive or inexpensive, will get these buggers to move up and out! However, I’ve had pretty good success it getting a nice cleanup using Bior? Deep Cleaning Nose Strips! Plus I like looking at the strip after it’s been on my nose 8 minutes…is that morbid? Sorry too much info there! In all seriousness I really do have an excellent success rate with these. I’m not saying they get deeply embedded blackheads but they do a bloody good job of getting about 75% of mine and my nose looks alot less like a porcupine after use! Yes, yes I know you want pics! More blackmail material coming right up! Finally to finish off my little skincare party Bior? Pore Minimizing Lightweight Moisturizer. This is new for me. I normally don’t stray from my current moisturizer but I was generally curious about this as it has an SPF 15. Honestly, as I get older I’ve been caring about having an SPF in my moisturizer and this is very light and silky and perfect for day wear. I’m not sure how much it reduced the appearance of my pores because I honestly have tiny pores anyway but in regards to the formula I’m pretty impressed. I travel alot and I love going on cruises and such and this would make an excellent daily moisturizer when out in the heat. It’s silky, smooth, and very light weight plus it has SPF. When you’re in a humid climate that’s about everything you’d want in a moisturizer! Plus it’s cheap as day old chips price wise! What’s not to love? I’m too set in my ways to change it for my current moisturizer but as a backup when going on Holiday this will definately make an appearance in my traincase! And finally here she is the Muse fresh faced, makeup less and simply Bior? clean! Wasn’t that fun? I work my 30 years good don’t I? Teehee! Do you use Bior?? Love it? Favorite products?

"['My Celebirty Look-A-Likes By Isabella Muse on March 7, 2008 15 Comments in Babbling Bits , Celebs I decided to do one of these “Celebrity Look-a-likes” after seeing them on a few other blogs! I’m scratching my head wondering how my celebrity look-a-like falls into the Beyonce and Eva Langoria range! I thought for sure after putting my picture up it would compile and come up with images of Roseanne Bar, Rosie O’Donnell, and if I was lucky by some chance maybe they’d stick Mia Tyler in there! But I somehow got lucky. I really couldn’t care less about Eva Langoria but hell I don’t mind being compared to Beyonce but above all else they went and released my inner Asian and I’m now on par with the likes of Aya Matsuura. I feel like I’ve arrived. Aya Matsuura! Am I awesome or what!? Now another one I’m properly chuffed with is Brigette Bardot. Wow…I’m a sex symbol now baby!

"['Happy Monday! By Isabella Muse on March 10, 2008 12 Comments in Babbling Bits , Pieces of Life Happy Monday girls (and guys)! Sadly, no new updates for the Muse today. I have about 5 good entries to post but sadly Blogger is still in weekend mode and refuses to work for me. Dunno what’s going on but I’m unable to upload pictures. It’s definately not a problem on my side but nothing on the maintenance page from Blogger either. Sigh. How very irritating! I’ve tried in several browses including Safari and no joy! So sadly, updates have to wait a while until this is fixed up! Hope everyone had a great weekend! I needed to get my mind off a few things so I really kept myself busy this weekend! I ended up going to two movies with friends, shopping with some friends, brunch with some friends I haven’t seen in a while, helped my mum get her Easter dinner shopping done, went to visit my cousin, did Spring closet and makeup cleaning, went to a poetry reading, went to a book signing, and a bunch of other stuff. All this excluding sleep lol! I’m kidding ? How about you? What did you do this weekend? It was major cold here. Strong winds about 26 degrees out! Brrrr! But it felt good walking along in a warm jacket and gloves. Sometimes it just feels nice to be out in the cold weather! Anyway! Updates to come as soon as Blogger decides to cooperate! This little problem should get my arse in gear to get my own website up and rolling and do away with Blogger completely! Back to work with my lazy self! Cheers! PS Good news. I was able to locate the Horizon Blush in Pink! w00t! I’ll be reviewing it shortly ? You may also enjoy... Pieces of Life: The Twilight DVD Edition I Heart youTube!

"['MAC Heatherette By Isabella Muse on March 18, 2008 18 Comments in MAC , Spring Collections 2008 MAC Heatherette is live on the website ( CLICK! )! w00t! This is long awaited by MAC fans and very exciting although I must say that I disagree with all the hype simply because MAC Fafi was the holy grail Collection for me personally. MAC Fafi for me had a better color selection and had more WOW then Heatherette is offering. Of course this doesn’t stop me from wanting a majority of this color story but for me MAC Fafi was much better and I think many of you agree with that after scoring some of Fafi for yourself! The lippies in Fafi were bold and exciting where as the Heatherette lipsticks are a bit of a nude mix up. For a round girl like me I avoid nude lippies like the plague less they make my face rounder than it already is! The palettes are lovely in this collection and I’m very excited about the gorgeous double ended liners (a first for MAC I believe?). All in all it’s a nice lot of goodies but for me Fafi remains a true love! My list of wants: All the eyeliner pencils! 1 lippie maybe? 2 lipglasses maybe? All the Beauty Powders for sure! Pink Pearl Piggie I can’t help but be a tiny bit disappointed. I wanted a bit more from this collection but the good news is I got the “bit more” from MAC Fafi! How about you? Loving this collection? What are you thinking of getting? Loved MAC Fafi more? Share your thoughts with the Muse! Click to read about my haul of MAC Fafi! Click to read my review and impressions of MAC Beauty Powders!

Want anything for yourself? Avon Horizon Blush by Jillian Dempsey Color Comparisons By Isabella Muse on March 17, 2008 25 Comments in Avon , Beauty Babblings Ok so I finally laid my hands on Pink Horizon which I was moaning about sometime last week ( Click! ). Since we were all musing and wondering what the hell the difference was between Pink and Apricot Horizon I decided to do pictures. I was finally able to locate Pink Horizon on E-bay since it’s still unavailable at Avon’s website yet but after much bitching, moaning, whining, and pissing about how much I wanted it I scored on E-bay and it popped into my mail box on Saturday! I was properly chuffed to have it as I was so utterly in love with Apricot Horizon I knew that the pink variation would be true love as well! I wasn’t wrong. As soon as I opened Pink Horizon I fell deeply in love once again! It’s perfectly pigmented, beautiful, and gives my face the perfect touch of color. I said it before and I’ll say it again these are well worth the effort of tracking down and purchasing for your own! Pink is truly pink. After the many musings we had over how Apricot Horizon looked so pink I’m happy to report that pink is truly pink. The pink variation of this is a truer pink then it’s peach sister and you can obviously see when the two are side by side which is the peach version and which is the pink. Apricot Horizon even appears more peachy then pink when it’s beside Pink Horizon. Color pay off is different from Apricot and I get more of a pinched pink look from Pink Horizon and more of a peachy glow from Apricot Horizon. All and all the colors are most definately different! After all that babbling here they are side by side: Apricot Horizon Pink Horizon Have these? Want ’em? Loving the shades? Tell the Muse! Korean Cosmetic Brands By Isabella Muse on March 17, 2008 77 Comments in Asian Brands , Beauty Abroad , Beauty Babblings , Korean Brands One of my readers had requested I do an entry on a few brands to look out for in Korea. I don’t purchase many Korean brands but I do enjoy looking out for exciting new Asian Brands as you know be it Japanese, Korean, or Chinese. Korea is a place that is near and dear to my heart simply because of it’s vast entertainment selection. Aside from Japanese pop culture I’d say that Korea definately holds plenty of appeal for me in the entertainment field. I adore Korean dramas as you may already know and some pop music as well (I’m more of a J-Rock girl but popular Korean music definately gets some of my attention). Do keep in mine prior to reading this that the post will probably create some hardcore lemmings so don’t hold the Muse responsible ? One of my all time favorite Korean brands which I haven’t be able to locate anywhere aside from Korea would be Clio. Clio reminds me of Bourjois Paris with it’s cute packaging and baked eyeshadows and blushes. I’ve done an entry on Clio prior to this but it deserves a revisit in this post. Clio is actually made in Italy but distributed in Korea. As I mentioned I haven’t seen Clio distributed anywhere else in the world aside from Korea but I could be wrong! From what I understand Sasa carries the line but I’m not sure where else in Korea you can purchase it. The line contains plenty of beautiful, funky cosmetics that are sure to appeal to those who love a bit of color. If you’re looking for a natural, neutral look Clio isn’t something you’ll want to look into however if you love a bit of color this will be something you’ll enjoy! Price is midway in my opinion with blushes running from about $19 USD and eyeshadows at around $14 USD. I’ve had little success locating Clio in online shops or on E-bay so if you want the line you’re either hopping a plane to Korea or asking a mate to pick you up some! Overall, it’s possibly one of my favorite brands. I own about 6 of the shadows or so and two of the blushes (I wish I had more) and they are all very pigmented, silky, and beautiful more so then Bourjois Paris if possible. Should you happen to be wandering around Korea another cosmetic line to keep your eyes on would be Laneige. Laneige falls into the luxury group of cosmetics in my opinion but the price is tiny in comparison to some lines. Laneige sells outside of Korea and can be found in Singapore and China however some of the better items pop up in Korea and later are distributed to other countries at later dates. I haven’t seen Laneige in Japan but again I could be wrong. Palettes are about $23-30 USD some lower. Prices vary from country to country and of course it remains cheapest within Korea. The line is extensive, covering point, base, skincare, and other bits and bobs. It definately has some very interesting items and if you have access it is worth looking at! Next up Etude…. Let me introduce you to Etude. Now Etude is truly an awesome line. It’s girlishly sweet with some seriously awesome packaging. It definately falls into a favorite category for me. The brand is available in drugstores and price wise isn’t too bad. The range is very extensive and includes a variety of cosmetics, skincare, fragrance, and other bits. The beautiful commercials and adverts are especially appealing and cutesy! In the video below I’m especially in love with the makeup from the Peach collection which is a new collection for Spring! Palettes range from $9 USD and up which isn’t bad at all. The shadows fall into the MJ line in my opinion which means they are pigmented as you make them out to be. It takes a bit of work to build up color but in the long run you can get a beautiful look using them! The new Pore Erasing Peach Base is something to keep your eyes out for. It quite reminds me of Benefit’s Erase Paste but looks like it’ll work much better plus it’s only $11 bucks! Etude is definately Muse Approved for purchase! If you’re in Korea you’ll definately want to keep your eyes open for products from Etude’s range! Banila Co is another girlish brand that I adore! The new Spring Collection looks much like Clio’s dual shadows but the price is a bit lower at about $9 USD per shadow. The highest item cost wise is about $20 USD. The line also includes a variety of items from base cosmetics, point, tools, skincare, and even body care! Banilia is available in drugstores and quality is excellent for the price! A higher end of cosmetics within Korea is Vidi Vici. Vidi Vici is created by Lee Kyung Min a famous makeup artist in Korean. The line for me is a bit unappealing due to the elegant packaging. I’m more for cute packaging which could be why Vidi Vici fails to wow me. The line up is geared more towards the working class lady and has that air of elegance minus the kawaii feel about 90% of cosmetics in Asia incorporate into their collections! As you may have suspected the price range is also geared towards the mature woman. Last but not least is VOV. VOV for me has the feel of Kose as some of the palettes resemble those in the line even the Spring Collection has the feel of Visee with it’s mirrored compacts! The prices are about the same as Kose as well with palettes ranging from $17 USD or so. The line up is appealing to all with it’s beautiful compacts and color combinations. The line isn’t as extensive as some brands but does have it’s fair share of point, base, skincare, etc…. Overall, it’s definately geared towards the fresh twenty something but the Muse isn’t twenty and she adores it! Well…That’s all folks! I hope you enjoyed this little adventure into Korean cosmetics! Do feel free to share some of your favorite Korean brands! I’d especially love to hear from those of you within Korea about prices, favorite brands, etc….. Comment box is open! Beauty on a Budget: Essence of Beauty Crease Brush Review By Isabella Muse on March 14, 2008 23 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Beauty Tools A new friend of mine asked me to to get some Essence of Beauty brushes for her this week. She asked for a particular set which was the dual crease brush. As I was doing her shopping I noticed that the brushes looked pretty good and I knew that these are a cult favorite of my sweet mate, ‘Nes, at Nessasary Makeup and that was good enough for me to want to try them! These cost $4.99 USD and are basically a dual package of mini crease brushes. The style reminds me of Bobbi Brown brushes with the wooden handle. The size of these intrigued me as they appear to be more a smudger style brush then a crease brush but hey it was worth trying for the price tag! The first brush is a tiny dome shape that reminds me of a Mally Beauty brush I own but the Mally brush is a bit more fuller where as this is smaller. I didn’t expect this to do much as it was way too small to properly work my crease area. I’m used to using MAC’s 224 and 227 on my crease. Present me with this tiny thing and I’m at a loss how I should be using it. But I happily tried it out and I must say it fits into the contour of my crease brilliantly and works a treat at blending shadows. I found that it actually gave me more management over the brush and bristles since it was far smaller then what I’m used too. I also experienced less fall out because the brush was so tiny. It also worked well on defining the v of my eye and blending inwards. As you can see I’m used to blending with a much larger brush! It’s quite a multitasking brush because I can use it on the v of my eye, within my crease, and also to line my bottom lash line with my shadow. The second brush with the package is even smaller then the first. It’s a step up from an eyeliner brush. This too worked surprisely well. It didn’t do that great a job blending the color completely but it worked fabulously defining the v of my eye and working the my color half way across my crease for contrast. I felt like both brushes gave me a bit more control over the look I was creating and I successfully manged to create an interesting look by contrasting a lighter shade of shadow all over my eye and a darker shade of shadow across part of my crease and v. Much to my delight neither brush shed a bristle the entire time I was using them and the brushes are very soft. The handles are mini size but again I felt like the handles being so small gave me much more control over what I was creating! It was kind of like having a pencil grasped tightly between my hands and it was nice and steady as I worked. As you can see below my outer eye is a shimmering light brown beige that contrasts nicely with the gold amber shadow I used. I created the look using the larger of the two crease brushes and proceeded to line my lower lash line with the smaller of the brushes! Overall, for the price, these were most definately an interesting little find and I’m generally curious about the rest of the brushes in the Essence of Beauty Collection! I can’t help but give these a Muse Approved Seal for purchase!']",8a8ca6c02481e61bb4f1fbc7f777273dec7d14f5,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4161,

"['MAC Heatherette First Impressions By Isabella Muse on March 19, 2008 35 Comments in First Impressions , MAC , Spring Collections 2008 Squeal!! I got Heatherette tonight! Wahoooooo! My MA at Macy’s called me around 3:30 this afternoon and said, “It’s hereeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!” So of course after the longest work day ever I headed over to pick me up some! The first thing I need to mention is the fact that Fafi is better. Sorry kids! I like Fafi’s color selection way better! Heatherette is definately a beautiful collection but Fafi still has my heart! Ok! Anyway! I got a majority of it of course because as you know the Muse is sick, diseased, obsessed, and generally addicted to MAC crack! The best news is I got my new digital camera in the mail today so you’re going to be treated to some high quality pics! I’m just starting to learn the new cam so if pictures aren’t fab gimme time to firgure out all the bells and whistles on this thing and we’ll be good to go! The palettes aren’t really much to write home about in all honesty. The compacts are gorgeous, pink, and glittery but aside from that the colors within aren’t so wow aspiring. The 1st contains Hoppin’ which is your best bet for a brow highlighter. It sort of reminds me of Shroom but not quite the same. It’s a creamy pale peach with a pearl finish. The next color is Mood Ring which is a sea foam green and the last color is Cloudburst which is a sparkling navy blue! Correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t Cloudburst part of Blue Storm’s release? I’m too lazy to go look through my shadows at the moment but it seems vaguely familiar to me! The 2nd palette is my favorite of the two but yet again the colors aren’t exactly anything to get to hyper over! Baby Petals is a very pale pink, V.I.P. is a bubblegum pink, and Cassette is a dark shade of purple. Unlike the first palette these colors all work well together and little thought goes into what sort of look you can create! Beauty Powders are of course a fast favorite for me! I’m utterly addicted to Beauty Powders and I’m officially chuffed when they are released in the LE packaging! Smooth Harmony is a muddy beige color that I’m not thrilled with but of course like the sick person I am it ended up in my cart! Alpha Girl deserves some of your attention because it’s quite a delightful shade of fleshy peach that I’m absolutely loving! Both are worth having a look at but Alpha Girl is the best of the two! I got three of the four lipsticks released one of which I’m considering returning because it looks a bit too nude for my taste. My two favorites of the lipsticks are Lollipop Loving and Hollywood Nights. Lollipop Loving is a beautiful coral with bits of gold shimmer and Hollywood Nights is a bright fuschia! I also got Melrose Mood which is a nude pink but I think it’ll go back. It’s way to mod for me to pull off even though it looks so beautiful on the display! The lipglasses I ended up with were Sock Hop which will go well with Lollipop Loving. It’s a beautiful true coral peach that’s very flattering for the Summer! I also got Style Minx which is a hot fuschia and of course it compliments Hollywood Nights beautifully! And lastly I got Starlet Kiss which is a lovely true pink! I’m wondering if I try some Melrose Mood with some Starlet Kiss if it’ll look good..hmmmm….! The dual pencils are the stars of the collection! These are something to get excited about in my opinion! One side is a regular pencil while the other side sports a soft sparkle pencil! Cheers! I got all four because I was easily tempted by both the price and the awesome color selection! I always find MAC pencils easy to work with and these are no exception! The color combs are gorgeous as well ranging from purples, blues, golds, and silver! Very nice! Lastly I got one pigment which was Pink Pearl. This reminds me of the pink piggie released with the Sweetie Cake Collection, the name of which escapes me at the moment (I believe it was Pink Mauved). The color is nice but I’d have loved a truer pink! We don’t have nearly enough true pink pigments in the catalog! Jardin Aires I skipped as I have it already and it’s a repromote from a past collection! I didn’t get the glitters simply because I already have Reflects Gold and 3D Silver is lovely but I’ll never use up that much glitter! I did get a healthy sample from my MA which will last me years I’m sure! Overall, the collection is lovely and worth some of your time and money however I found Fafi was a much better release color wise however Heatherette does deserve the award for better packaging! No stickers here. All the packaging is printed on and you won’t be running into any peeling sticker drama a la Fafi! Another fine collection from MAC and I’m excited to start creating some looks with it! Fafi is my truest love at the moment but Heatherette comes in a quick second! How about you? Got any of this yet? Want it? Love it? Feeling love for Heatherette or Fafi? How about the pic Tell the Muse! PS What do you think of the pictures taken with my new digital camera? Bobbi Brown Pink Satin Collection By Isabella Muse on March 19, 2008 14 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Spring Collections 2008 Oh god I feel the force of the lemming hard this morning! Have you seen this!? I’m sitting here doing my best not to order this gorgeous, beautiful set. I’m breaking out into a cold sweat as the object of my lust stares back at me in all it’s virtual glory on my monitor! I admit it. I’m a slave to Bobbi Brown lately. I’ve analyzed and done the math on this for the past five minutes deciding if it’s worth $140! Do I really need this at that obscene price?! Yes I do don’t I? Seriously, I really loved the Metallics Collection and now having a Pink Metallic Palette is making me excited enough to spit. Oh the struggle! I think I’ll get it, no I won’t, yes I will! Want it? Absolutely need it like the Muse? The Body Shop Spring Boom Spring Collection 2008 By Isabella Muse on March 19, 2008 16 Comments in Spring Collections 2008 , The Body Shop The Body Shop’s Spring Bloom Collection is available online and in shops! Exciting! I was lucky enough to view a beautiful FOTD created by a reader and fellow blogger using most of the collection and I must say I was very impressed! The colors are simply divine! I was particular in love with the Blushing Daisies Powder that was used to create the look! Body Shop has been coming out with some rather lovely Collections lately and I look forward to each one and always pick up two or three items from each color story released! This year the collection is entitled Spring Bloom and includes an array of yummie items that are sure to tempt to you! First of all as I mentioned earlier the Blushing Daisies Powder caught my eye! The powder is $19.50 USD and comes in a light and dark pink variation. This is a shimmering blush with a pearl finish! Everywhere I look I see eyeshadow duos and Body Shop’s Spring Collection is no different. They have released three color variations of shadow duos entitled Shimmer Buds that are $16.50 USD Each. The color range includes green and silver, gold and green, and peach and blue. I own a few of the single shadows from past collections and I’m happy to say they are packed full of sparkle and have excellent color payoff so I suspect these little guys are no different! With the Spring Collection a new set of Shimmer Blocks were released in a quad of four colors for $19.50 USD. The colors include Blue, Green, Gold, and Copper. Also available is a liquid highlighter in pink for $14 USD which offers a touch of color for giving your face a natural, highlighted glow! And finally two new glosses entitled Lip Bloom are available with the Spring Bloom Collection in Rose and Peach for $15.50 USD each. The Collection looks very lovely and each piece is limited edition however the prices do make me wince slightly. Quality is very good on these as I’ve collected a few pieces from previous color releases however the prices are near counter price and I can get even better quality for alot less. This year the prices increased by a dollar or two from last season and although the collection is lovely I think I’ll wait for the Season to end and nab these items on sale! Loving this? Have it already? Want it? Tell the Muse! Bath and Body Works Takes On Easter By Isabella Muse on March 19, 2008 4 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Shower & Bath Me want the duckie! I can’t help myself. I want these. Now. But I’ll wait for them to hit the sale rack at Bath and Body Works! Oh my god so cutes! A duckie with ears hehe! Bare Minerals bareDiamond Spring Color Collection Review and FOTD By Isabella Muse on March 18, 2008 15 Comments in Bare Escentuals , Face of the Day , Spring Collections 2008 A few months ago I had purchased the Bare Minerals bareGold Pure Luxury Gold Collection from QVC. The kit came with an Autoship option for those not in the know that simply meant that they’d send me a kit every few months that was similar in style to the bareGold Collection but with a different color selection. In total it’s four kits that I’ll be getting and so far I’ve gotten two which are the bareGold and now the bareDiamond. bareDiamond for me is a total disappointment. There isn’t anything redeeming in the kit aside from maybe the blush and brushes?! Where as bareGold had some very lovely golds and browns bareDiamond sports lighter shades for the Spring but the colors are completely off to me. The kit included: Diamond Gossamer Powder Eyeshadow in Clarity Glimmer in Marquise Liner Shadow in Bronze Leaf Blush in Hint Mineral Veil Lipstick in Gelato Angled Face Brush Soft Focus Eyeshadow Brush Eyeliner Brush Vanity Box First off the Diamond Gossamer is an absolute disappointment as I already have it from the Bare Escentuals Classic Rock Collection. It’s a fantastic gossamer to have and I absolutely love it but I didn’t need a second pot of this. However, somewhere in the back of my head I knew that one of the kits included a gossamer I already had so no problems I can swap or sell it off! The eyeshadow in Clarity is a nice enough color I guess but it’s a bit blah for someone that enjoys bold shades. It’s a pale blue, slightly iridescent shade that can be used as a base, highlighter, or all over wash of color. Formula is fantastic as always with Bare Minerals however for some odd reason I had a bit of a difficult time blending this well and the look I created with it today just came out rubbish! Clarity Eyeshadow The glimmer in Marquise is equally awful. The color is just blah, blah, blah. It’s a dirty chrome gray mix up that doesn’t do anything for me. Again I had a difficult time blending this for some reason hmmm…I see a pattern developing here! Marquise Glimmer The liner shadow in Gold Leaf has some redeeming qualities. It’s a brown bronze with little sparks of gold and purple that are quite lovely however it really left me feeling un-Spring like! Bronze now? It’s Spring! Gold Leaf Liner Now you’re supposed to take all three of these, combine them, and come up with some gorgeous Spring look. Um no. Don’t think so. I created mud with a bit of light blue thrown in for good measure. Actually the effect came out somewhat like the Lavshuca FOTD I did using the Aqua Noble On Palette ( Click to view the FOTD). The general idea is you apply Clarity as a base all over your eye, follow up with Marquise on the lid, and line with Gold Leaf and your finished look equals mud more or less with a bit of blue thrown in! The above FOTD was created using everything in the kit aside from the lipstick. I threw some Jill Stuart gloss on instead of the lippie that was included with the kit if you were curious what was on my lips! I don’t know who’s bright idea it was to match up browns and beiges with lighter blues but I’m here to tell you it doesn’t WORK! Bloody hell it looks awful! STOP doing palettes and kits with blue and brown it doesn’t work I SAY (at least for me it doesn’t!). Moving on…. The blush is actually redeemable after all the drama with the shadows and liners in the kit. I sort of liked it. It’s a dusky rose color and although it’s very subdued for me it does create a very natural, elegant look. I actually do like this and it will work well in taming down my wilder looks! Yay! One product that I actually like! Blush in Hint The lipstick is another blah for me. The color is rose but it has some peach in it as well! I actually didn’t even bother swiping or using it since it was so unappealing. Another one for the swap/sale bin! Finally the brushes were pretty good! The brushes are a bit different from the previous set aside from the large Soft Focus Brush. I already have this brush from the previous sets so that’s another for the swap bin! However, the Soft Focus Eyeshadow Brush is very nice. No shedding on this and it’s very soft and works well for washing color onto the entire lid. I tried blending with it but it doesn’t work at that for that task. Overall, a good brush for general color washing but not blending or packing color on. The other brush is a slim liner brush which is also very good. It’s a thin tip brush and it works well with the liner shadow the kit came with! The brushes are different from the bareGold aside from the Soft Focus Brush which is great as I don’t have dupes now. Overall, the Collection is a bust for me. The colors are way too weird and mixed up to create a good look, many of the items are duplicates I already have, and I just found the shadows and glimmer difficult to blend for some reason or another. If you’re still lemming this after my poor review you can call QVC direct (this isn’t available online for purchase) and use item number A77475 to order yourself one! The Muse gives this a big thumbs down for purchase! Waste of money, don’t bother. The good news is if you’re really loving any of this I’ll be putting up a Spring Sale page very soon so most of this will be thrown on that page for sale! Yay!

"['Korean Cosmetic Brands By Isabella Muse on March 17, 2008 77 Comments in Asian Brands , Beauty Abroad , Beauty Babblings , Korean Brands One of my readers had requested I do an entry on a few brands to look out for in Korea. I don’t purchase many Korean brands but I do enjoy looking out for exciting new Asian Brands as you know be it Japanese, Korean, or Chinese. Korea is a place that is near and dear to my heart simply because of it’s vast entertainment selection. Aside from Japanese pop culture I’d say that Korea definately holds plenty of appeal for me in the entertainment field. I adore Korean dramas as you may already know and some pop music as well (I’m more of a J-Rock girl but popular Korean music definately gets some of my attention). Do keep in mine prior to reading this that the post will probably create some hardcore lemmings so don’t hold the Muse responsible ? One of my all time favorite Korean brands which I haven’t be able to locate anywhere aside from Korea would be Clio. Clio reminds me of Bourjois Paris with it’s cute packaging and baked eyeshadows and blushes. I’ve done an entry on Clio prior to this but it deserves a revisit in this post. Clio is actually made in Italy but distributed in Korea. As I mentioned I haven’t seen Clio distributed anywhere else in the world aside from Korea but I could be wrong! From what I understand Sasa carries the line but I’m not sure where else in Korea you can purchase it. The line contains plenty of beautiful, funky cosmetics that are sure to appeal to those who love a bit of color. If you’re looking for a natural, neutral look Clio isn’t something you’ll want to look into however if you love a bit of color this will be something you’ll enjoy! Price is midway in my opinion with blushes running from about $19 USD and eyeshadows at around $14 USD. I’ve had little success locating Clio in online shops or on E-bay so if you want the line you’re either hopping a plane to Korea or asking a mate to pick you up some! Overall, it’s possibly one of my favorite brands. I own about 6 of the shadows or so and two of the blushes (I wish I had more) and they are all very pigmented, silky, and beautiful more so then Bourjois Paris if possible. Should you happen to be wandering around Korea another cosmetic line to keep your eyes on would be Laneige. Laneige falls into the luxury group of cosmetics in my opinion but the price is tiny in comparison to some lines. Laneige sells outside of Korea and can be found in Singapore and China however some of the better items pop up in Korea and later are distributed to other countries at later dates. I haven’t seen Laneige in Japan but again I could be wrong. Palettes are about $23-30 USD some lower. Prices vary from country to country and of course it remains cheapest within Korea. The line is extensive, covering point, base, skincare, and other bits and bobs. It definately has some very interesting items and if you have access it is worth looking at! Next up Etude…. Let me introduce you to Etude. Now Etude is truly an awesome line. It’s girlishly sweet with some seriously awesome packaging. It definately falls into a favorite category for me. The brand is available in drugstores and price wise isn’t too bad. The range is very extensive and includes a variety of cosmetics, skincare, fragrance, and other bits. The beautiful commercials and adverts are especially appealing and cutesy! In the video below I’m especially in love with the makeup from the Peach collection which is a new collection for Spring! Palettes range from $9 USD and up which isn’t bad at all. The shadows fall into the MJ line in my opinion which means they are pigmented as you make them out to be. It takes a bit of work to build up color but in the long run you can get a beautiful look using them! The new Pore Erasing Peach Base is something to keep your eyes out for. It quite reminds me of Benefit’s Erase Paste but looks like it’ll work much better plus it’s only $11 bucks! Etude is definately Muse Approved for purchase! If you’re in Korea you’ll definately want to keep your eyes open for products from Etude’s range! Banila Co is another girlish brand that I adore! The new Spring Collection looks much like Clio’s dual shadows but the price is a bit lower at about $9 USD per shadow. The highest item cost wise is about $20 USD. The line also includes a variety of items from base cosmetics, point, tools, skincare, and even body care! Banilia is available in drugstores and quality is excellent for the price! A higher end of cosmetics within Korea is Vidi Vici. Vidi Vici is created by Lee Kyung Min a famous makeup artist in Korean. The line for me is a bit unappealing due to the elegant packaging. I’m more for cute packaging which could be why Vidi Vici fails to wow me. The line up is geared more towards the working class lady and has that air of elegance minus the kawaii feel about 90% of cosmetics in Asia incorporate into their collections! As you may have suspected the price range is also geared towards the mature woman. Last but not least is VOV. VOV for me has the feel of Kose as some of the palettes resemble those in the line even the Spring Collection has the feel of Visee with it’s mirrored compacts! The prices are about the same as Kose as well with palettes ranging from $17 USD or so. The line up is appealing to all with it’s beautiful compacts and color combinations. The line isn’t as extensive as some brands but does have it’s fair share of point, base, skincare, etc…. Overall, it’s definately geared towards the fresh twenty something but the Muse isn’t twenty and she adores it! Well…That’s all folks! I hope you enjoyed this little adventure into Korean cosmetics! Do feel free to share some of your favorite Korean brands! I’d especially love to hear from those of you within Korea about prices, favorite brands, etc….. Comment box is open! You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Heatherette By Isabella Muse on March 18, 2008 18 Comments in MAC , Spring Collections 2008 MAC Heatherette is live on the website ( CLICK! )! w00t! This is long awaited by MAC fans and very exciting although I must say that I disagree with all the hype simply because MAC Fafi was the holy grail Collection for me personally. MAC Fafi for me had a better color selection and had more WOW then Heatherette is offering. Of course this doesn’t stop me from wanting a majority of this color story but for me MAC Fafi was much better and I think many of you agree with that after scoring some of Fafi for yourself! The lippies in Fafi were bold and exciting where as the Heatherette lipsticks are a bit of a nude mix up. For a round girl like me I avoid nude lippies like the plague less they make my face rounder than it already is! The palettes are lovely in this collection and I’m very excited about the gorgeous double ended liners (a first for MAC I believe?). All in all it’s a nice lot of goodies but for me Fafi remains a true love! My list of wants: All the eyeliner pencils! 1 lippie maybe? 2 lipglasses maybe? All the Beauty Powders for sure! Pink Pearl Piggie I can’t help but be a tiny bit disappointed. I wanted a bit more from this collection but the good news is I got the “bit more” from MAC Fafi! How about you? Loving this collection?

By Isabella Muse on March 25, 2008 4 Comments in MAC , Spring Collections 2008 , Swatches When I did my original post for Heatherette swatches I was having a difficult time getting a light enough image of the beauty powders so I swatched them on white paper!

Top to Bottom: Pink Pearl Pigment, Alpha Girl Beauty Powder, and Smooth Harmony Beauty Powder Spring Cleaning Updates By Isabella Muse on March 24, 2008 8 Comments in Babbling Bits , Miscellaneous Blogging Good Morning Lovies! Happy Monday! You may (or may not) have noticed that Musings has undergone a few minor changes. One important change for me was having a new domain name setup. You can now find Musings of a Muse at it’s new address, www.musingsofamuse.com! Yay! Exciting! If you by chance link me on your site if you could please as a personal favor to me update your link to reflect the change I’d be extremely grateful! Secondly, you’ll notice my layout changed a tiny bit. I felt like my three columns were a bit cluttered so I now have a column on the left and a column on the right and finally my posts are smack in the middle! Thirdly, I’ve added a cbox off to the right hand side of my column which you can use to comment randomly or just to say hey! I have a few ads up as well! If you find these irritating do let me know and I’ll try to come up with something else as I never want Musings to be about “commercial” or “corporate”. That’s not my aim with Musings at all so if you feel overwhelmed by ads you should tell me and I’ll do everything I can to reduce the clutter so you can have the content you come here for! I’ve temporarily moved my live chat room. I know it’s been ages since I held a live chat but I promise I’ll be adding it up soon and having a live chat ? A few items that are upcoming as you know are the Musings forum and some podcasts as well! That’s about it! I hope you’re as excited as I am about the changes! Maybe they’ll make your life a bit easier too when browsing around here as I believe it’s better organized now! Much Love and Hugs, From your Muse. Givenchy Japan Spring Collection 2008 By Isabella Muse on March 24, 2008 11 Comments in Beauty Abroad , Givenchy , Spring Collections 2008 Here are a few releases on the shores of beautiful Japan that won’t be available stateside.

I’ve done a complete 180 and I’m the biggest fan Bobbi ever did have. I can’t believe I went from bitchin’ how bad her products were (or at least some I tried) to how fantastic they are! I guess I seriously didn’t give her stuff a chance because lately I’m an utter convert, fan, and lover. I wanted to do a comparison review this week of Bobbi’s Cream Compact Foundation vs. MAC Moisture Blend Foundation. But since I splurged some cash on Bobbi’s Cream Compact I thought it would be a bit ridiculous and obscene of me to go buy some MAC Moisture Blend just to compare the two. I may still do so as I’m sick enough to go buy some out of the sake of curiosity but for now you’ll have to settle for my review of Bobbi’s Foundation. First off I should mention I don’t need a face full of coverage. If I had to go around with an entire load of mineral powder on my face all day or a ton of liquid foundation on you might as well shoot me dead in the head Zombie style. Seriously the idea of having all that on my face all day scares me. I guess there may very well be a bit of irony in that statement considering I pack on eye color like I’m going to a rave but hey eye color and tons of foundation are two very separate things people! Secondly, it deserves to be mentioned that I have some serious dry skin going on due to the cold weather. I’m a combination skin that gets oily come Summer and dried out in the Winter so using a cream foundation is an absolute life saver during colder weather! Bobbi Brown’s Cream Foundation promises flawless coverage, long wear, and relief for dry skin. Hey, I’m all over all three of those things! I think this is actually made with a mature lady in mind that has drier skin, wrinkles, etc….however it’s relief for my dry skin. I normally use a cream foundation anyway so I had no reason to adjust to this or learn how to use it etc…My normal foundation is the Morgen Schick Hide and Highlight palette which is something you have to pry out of my cold, dead hands one day but I will say that Bobbi’s Cream Foundation is slowly become a fast favorite that may very well end up topping my list soon! The formula is extremely easy to blend and is highly moisturizing. I use Bobbi’s foundation brush to apply to the inner corner of my nose and blend slowly outwards. I apply a bit to the shadows around my chin and shadows found under my nose, above my lip line. That’s it done. Coverage is beautiful and as flawless as promised! It also happens to last about 7-8 hours without touch up which really makes me do cart wheels! Sweet! 8 hours of continuous wear? The Muse likey! The compact has a sponge applicator it comes with as well which can be stored under the cream as it’s a flip top which makes for ease of touch ups during the day if you please. It goes on wonderfully smooth and my skin is quite happy afterwards as it doesn’t flake up as a powder would. It just sinks in and creates a lovely canvas for my makeup! I originally purchased Sand but it was way BEIGE! Holy cow! I swapped up for Porcelain and that’s perfect. Without Flash With Flash All in all definately worth my $40! I’m super happy with the results and the beautiful look of my skin when using this. If you have dry skin this is something you definately, sincerely need to try! Do you use cream foundation?

Clarifying Your Hair: Lush Big and Retread Review By Isabella Muse on March 24, 2008 27 Comments in Haircare , Lush I’ve already done a section on Lush Cosmetics Shampoo Bars a long, long while ago but I was doing my daily Sunday night hair clarifying ritual yesterday and I thought I’d share it with you guys since it works so well for me! As you know my hair mostly stays up and out of my face in a bun with a headband. I don’t like my hair flying around my head, my mouth, my face, etc….it irritates and annoys me since it’s so very long. I like it out of my face when I’m working so 5 days a week from 9 to 5 my hair stays firmly in it’s bun with a headband smoothing it back. After work and on the weekends I don’t mind it floating around but when I’m working it’s smoothed back! I wash it everyday. I do not believe that washing my hair daily will strip my hair of it’s natural oils yada yada yada. If it does, it does but the fact of the matter is I don’t feel clean unless my hair is washed so every morning I take a shower and I wash and condition my hair. During the week I use various shampoos, conditioners, and such. My hair doesn’t have a whole lot of maintenance attached to it during the week. It consists of me entering the shower washing it with my daily choice of shampoo and condition, air drying it, curling it into a bun, and going. I don’t blow dry my hair, I don’t curl it, etc….My hair is naturally curly, a bit dry, and long. I normally use a very small amount of gel to slick it back otherwise I do have a bit of frizz. Since I like to switch around shampoos and conditioners so much through the week my hair becomes weighted down from all the silicons in those products plus the gel causes it’s normal wreckage with my hair. What does that mean? It means my hair is heavy with a bit of buildup. We all get it, it happens to everyone. My Sunday evening routine prior to bed is to take a shower and clarify my hair. There is nothing in the world like the feeling of a lighter head of hair. It feels cleaner, my curls are softer, my hair is shiner, etc…after I’ve used a good clarifying shampoo. My personal choice for that shampoo is Lush Cosmetics Big. Big gets my hair so clean it nearly whistles. Seriously. If your hair is oily this is a god sent! Big is actually for people with fine hair thus the name comes into play here. Big is supposed to give volume and pouf to those of you with fine hair! I do not have fine hair but I still use Big regardless for me it’s a deep cleaning shampoo that rids my hair of buildup. If you suffer from dandruff this will surely rid you of your problem as it contains sea salt which is fantastic for massaging into your scalp to rid yourself of any nasty dandruff that’s made a home in your head! The formula of this is a tad bit weird and probably not like any shampoo you’ve run across before. It’s clumpy and full of seat salt so it basically looks like a pot of scrub for your face or body not something you’d use in your hair. Many people are a bit wary of trying it because they are worried the sea salt will not wash out easy. Have no fear the salt washes away quickly and easily. The lather is beautiful and the smell is fresh and beautiful. Now I had mentioned earlier on that this would be good for oily scalps. My hair is dry so do be warned that this will make your hair even drier when use it. It drys out hair big time so you need to follow up with a good conditioning. There in lays a good thing for the oily scalp folk as Big will definately dry up your scalp, remove the oil from your hair, and replace it with fluffy, soft hair! Since Big is so drying I follow up closely with Lush’s Retread Conditioner. Retread smells just as gorgeous as Big and compliments it well in my humble opinion! Retread is one of Lush’s thickest conditioners minus any silicones. Your hair might not know what to do without the silicones you get in your normal conditioner but as it adjusts it’ll thank you for treating it to such an amazing conditioner. I normally smooth a good amount on and leave it on for 5 minutes while in the shower right after I’ve rinsed out Big. During that time frame I take a large tooth comb and start detangling with Retread in and smoothing my hair back and while working the conditioner through. Since Big leaves my hair such a mess and in such a tangle it feels good to gently work the comb through while Retread helps with the knots that Big created. After 5 minutesI rinse with luke warm water and I’m done. I towel dry my hair after this and go to bed with it damp. In the morning my hair is fluffy, soft, and beautiful. After this treatment my hair seems to just behave better. It accepts product better, it brushes out easier, I don’t experience frizz or tangles as much, and my hair just seems to be thankful that I took a bit of time out to treat it to a nice clarify! So that’s about it ? The Muse highly recommends trying out Big and Retread for yourself! Retread is fantastic for daily use and as for Big I only recommend using it once a week and twice if you’re hair/scalp is oily! Already own these? Love them? Want to try ’em? Questions? Comments?

"['bareMinerals A Little Sun All-Over Face Color By Isabella Muse on March 27, 2008 4 Comments in Bare Escentuals , Summer Collections 2008 I hate the sun, bronzers, and anything to do with tanning but I will admit to being intrigued very slightly by the new Bare Minerals Kit entitled A Little Sun All Over. The color in this kit looks rather refreshingly healthy and the brush is sorta making me get a case of the “I want it!” sweats. However, I do realize, in some inner part of my brain thats actually logical, that the brush is probably utter rubbish and sheds like a bunny rabbit in Spring. I also realize, again in the part of my brain that holds logic (it’s far and between but it’s there people) that the color will be unflattering and will make my already very full face even fuller! But for some odd reason or another I find myself wanting this kit! Sigh. The life of a cosmetic junkie is a hard one. Want this? Have it already? Do tell!

Spotlight on Morgen Schick Lipshine: Tangerine Sorbet By Isabella Muse on March 26, 2008 6 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Morgen Schick , Spotlights I’m still making my own kind of music and singing my own special song when it comes to Pink glosses! As you know I’ve been obsessed with bubblegum pink lately! You didn’t know that? ZOMG! Click and you’ll be magically whisked away to a page that will tell you more about the Muse’s obsession with pink! Anyway….my love of bubblegum pink is here and alive and possibly kicking but just slightly on the back burner as I explore my options for Summer. I know, I know it’s only March blah blah blah! I can’t help myself! Summer is coming and I must be prepared! Today I was rotating my makeup (I’m allowed to do that as I have so much!) and I came across a favorite Lipshine of mine by Morgen Schick. I adore lipshines! Nicely but not overly Pigmented, Shiny, Tasty, and Gorgeous what more could a girl want in a gloss? Anyway! I was rotating some colors and I came across a Morgen Schick Lipshine in Tangerine Sorbet. I had to share this with you guys because it’s possibly thee most gorgeous shade of yum I have in my collection! I have plenty of oranges, peaches, corals, etc…but truly this is the best “pop” of orange I own! It’s a beautiful true tangerine shade that’s not outrageous but has just enough brightness to make it look amazing on! I’m working the close up shots aren’t I? Go on tell me how awesome I am! This is a super hot shade for Summer and definately worth having a look around on E-bay for! The Muse Approves it big time! Can’t find it on E-bay? Check out Morgen Schick website to purchase it!

I wanna bath in this stuff! No seriously though I think a brush applicator would totally kick it and get the product on in big, yummie, slippery slides! A sponge would suck! We shall see! Available from MAC very, very soon but not soon enough for me! Want ’em all? Love them? Dying for them? Tell the Muse! QVC Exclusive: Laura Geller ""The Tropics"" Lipstick and Gloss Set By Isabella Muse on March 26, 2008 2 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Laura Geller , Spring Collections 2008 Laura Geller was on QVC a few days ago as any good twisted cosmetic junkie would do I recorded the showing. I was fast forwarding through most of it but I came across this little kit she did and it intrigued me! The pictures actually don’t do the product justice. The lipshade appears on screen to be a very lovely burnt red color and the gloss on top made it into a golden dark peachy shade. It was rather nice on the model that was sporting it. They kept raving on and on about how good it smelled and tasted but no one said exactly what it was smelling and tasting of. I can only assume it’s some tropical taste hence the name!? The packaging also sold me as it’s studded in pink glittery bits. Cutes! The set is available from QVC for $24.25 USD under Item Number A6451. I haven’t ordered it because I’m playing good girl at the moment and saving my little pennies for Summer releases however I am curious and I do have a little bit of a burning lem in my stomach! If you’re familiar with the color PS Kiss this reminds me of that thus the need to purchase it is hard upon me! Want this? Own it already? Just love Laura’s cosmetics?

"['Bath and Body Works Twisted Peppermint Shapeable Foaming Soap Review By Isabella Muse on December 16, 2009 8 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Holiday Collections 2009 , Shower & Bath , Soap , Winter Collections 2009 Today I am all about Bath and Body Works Shapeable Foaming Soap…I’m all about it because I got it on sale teehee. Jump! It’s a bit childish so if you aren’t immature in spirit you can go ahead and jump past this review. Seriously, if you’re 20, 30, or 40 you probably shouldn’t haul foaming soap..but hey it’s goodness in my shower, I’m for it. Plus did I mention you can write on your shower walls and door with it, make a big old bubble beard with it, spiral it around your head, and generally prance around your shower with it on your unmentionables as you lip sync Don’t Stop Believin’. Of course, I personally don’t do any of those things but I’m just saying, you know? What is it? It’s a foaming soap kinda like shaving cream! They call it shapeable because you can kinda play with it like clay and mold it, why you’d want to do that is beyond me but I think it’s the kid at heart who will enjoy it or if you’re simply boring and stuck up you can go ahead and just wash with it, rolls eyes, creativity peeps, come on now. I like it because it’s in the popular Twisted Peppermint scent that Bath and Body Works so kindly brought back this year. It’s a mix of sweet, crisp, cool peppermint and a twist of vanilla, nom, nom! You can use it to shave your legs, use it to wash up with, or in any of the above ways I mentioned. Go on have fun, no one is looking. Loves it! Available now from Bath and Body Works at half off retail (in stores), $3.50 a can! w00t she scores!

Miss it? Today is a poll of favorites! So what’s your fav place for Bath and Body goodies? Are you a fan of Victoria’s Secret or Bath and Body Works? If you had to choose one which would it be? Which do you like best? ( online poll ) As for me I’m a big lover of Victoria’s Secret since they are a tad more on the unique side when compared to Bath and Body Works. Bath and Body Works used to have the edge with it’s interesting little cute items like the Temptations Collection but since they have gone very mainstream I find I prefer VS over BBW. Victoria’s Secret seemed to have more unique fragrances in their body splashes and they introduce some really fun items during the different seasons. So I’m def for VS. How about you?

"['Revlon Spring Collection 2008 By Isabella Muse on March 26, 2008 29 Comments in Revlon , Spring Collections 2008 I know, I know. Why the bloody hell am I posting about Revlon? So unlike me. I should put a disclaimer on this post to say I do not buy Revlon. The reason I’m posting this is because much of my target audience flows in from abroad. I love you yanks but sadly you aren’t my main reader quota. We tend to take what we can get here in the US for granted and likewise for those of you around the world. There in lays my inspiration for this post. Something as simple as Revlon’s Spring Collection may not yet be available around the globe (or available at all for that matter) so it’s my responsibility as a good blogger to inform all my readers outside of the US what happening here in drgustores! Yay me! So I came across some of the Revlon Spring Collection at CVS when I was doing some personal shopping for Miss Rows at Mostly Makeup. Here’s what I came across (hold your applause until the end): Revlon does this big deal about how limited these are but this isn’t Japan which basically translates as you can get this crap for ages and ages and it never leaves the shelf. How limited is that? I think I’ll sue Revlon for false advertisement! Remember when they released those Just Bitten Lip Stains 500 years ago? Oh sorry it was last year I think! Well those are still hanging around the shelf. Yay for limited edition products! Anyway! Here’s the line-up, without further snarky, wise cracking commentary from me! Floral Affair Sheer Powder Blush Available in 4 Color Selections Make a Sheen Eyeshadow Palette Available in 4 Color Selections Marble-ous Match Liner Available in 5 Shades Soft on the Eye Sheer Loose Powder Eyeshadow Available in 3 Color Selections Mix and Mingle Lip Palette Available in 6 Shade Selections Prices range from around $6.99-$9.99 USD and most places have buy one get one 50% off type a deals depending on the sale at the tim! I actually must say that collection is interesting! I won’t personally buy any of it but it does appear rather nice to look at! So…that’s all folks! Hope you enjoyed this brief foray into US Drugstore Brands (mind you Revlon is available almost everywhere in the world but unsure if this particular collection has reached shores other then our own here in the US). Loving this? Own it? Despise Revlon as much as the Muse? Tell me all about it! We Have Instant Messenging! By Isabella Muse on March 25, 2008 3 Comments in Miscellaneous Blogging Bless Be!

KATE Glamtrick Palette Review By Isabella Muse on March 25, 2008 53 Comments in Face of the Day , Japanese Brands , KATE I’ve gotten alot of comments mentioning KATE as not being pigmented enough or not the best quality, etc… This made me want to do a review of my own on KATE because it’s one of my favorite Japanese Brands and I think the quality is fantastic! One of my favorite products in the KATE lineup are the Glamtrick palettes. They are sincerely some of the best quality palettes I’ve come across Japan side. The colors blend fantastically and the smoky eye looks you can create are truly fabulous. KATE has an edge about it that other brands don’t and this reflects in the darker color selection available from KATE. In particular the Glamtrick palettes sport darker colors used to create very interesting smoky eye looks. The Glamtrick palettes contain a total of five colors. One light shade of shadow, one dark contrasting shadow, one base, one liner, and a shimmering shade used over your completed look. The palettes are at 1600 yen (about $16 USD) and in my personal opinion give alot of bang for your buck! In order to create each look I used the lightest shade as a base on my entire lid, I proceeded to stroke the next medium shade from my lid to my crease, after this I packed on the darkest in my crease and on half of my top eye lid. To complete my look I lined my bottom and lower lash line with the shadow liner and dusted on a bit of the sparkling/shimmer shadow on top of the entire look and Bob’s your uncle the perfect smoky look! Created Using BU-1 Created Using GD-1 \\ Created Using BR-1 Created Using GN-1 Created Using BK-1 KATE has an entire line of various palettes but I thought I’d share the Glamtrick ones with you as they are my favorite in the line! The palettes make creating what I called a “colored” smoky eye look goof proof and they take the smoky look to a new level with interesting shades instead of your standard gray/black look. KATE’s Glamtrick palettes are most definately Muse Approved for their inexpensive cost, quality and pigmentation, and ease of use! Love these? Yearning to try KATE? Hate ’em? Tell the Muse! Shadow Shields: A Lifesaving Review By Isabella Muse on March 25, 2008 24 Comments in Beauty Tools I’m struck gold. Literally. I’ve come across thee most awesome product in the world of Beauty! This is seriously better then any tool I’ve come across and it’s an utter life saver for me! I wear many shimmering shades of shadows. Gimme Sparkle! Gimme Glitter! Gimme Shine! I love it! The more the better. But please don’t give me nasty fall out ? Sadly, I’ve never had an easy time of it when it comes to cleaning up fall out. I’ve tried the powder under the eye trick, doesn’t work. I’ve tried blotting it away with a makeup sponge, doesn’t work either. I’ve tried holding a piece of tissue under my eye while applying eyeshadow, no good. I’ve sincerely tried everything to lessen or eliminate my fall out problem! If you use intensely dark shades or you love sparkle you must have the same problem as me! I’ve never really had any success in cleaning up fall out. Normally when I try it ends up all over the place. If you’re a big lover of MAC pigments, again, you know what I am talking about! But have no fear the Muse is here to bring you something to eliminate your fall out and keep your undereye area and cheeks free of shadow fall out! The wonderful Michelle Villanueva gets the Muse Approved award for creating Shadow Shields. I’ve seriously been looking for a product like this for years and years and years. So what are Shadow Shields? Basically they are tiny little pads that have a stick on back that you place under your eye to catch fall out! w00t! I’m so excited I may spit! The pads are half moon shaped and have adhesive all over the back however you only need to remove a little piece of the adhesive to get this on your eye. Somehow, someway the pad fits to the contour of your eye and folds upwards slightly creating a little bowl shape under your eye which catches all your shadow fall out. The result? Beautifully made up eyes minus nasty fall out all over your cheeks and under your eyes! These work amazingly well however they take some getting used too! I’ve used these a few times already and I’m now Miss Master Pro at using them however my first attempt with these was a tad bit difficult. You have to sort of get used to the forget that you have something stuck under your eye as you work with your shadow. It’s also a little bit clumsy at first when tugging your eye so you can smooth shadow on (I’m a tugger. I slant my eye slightly with my pinky as I apply shadow, liner, etc….). However, after a tiny bit of struggle I finally mastered it and I can now officially say I won’t be able to live without these! They seriously made a huge impact on my looks. I normally walk around with fall out everywhere because it’s just so hard to clean it all up!!!!!!!!!!!!!! However, these helped me create a beautiful look without the stress of bits of eyeshadow and pigment all over the bloody place! You can get 50 of these for $16.95 USD! That’s a steal in my opinion! Although I will admit to being slightly a cheap-o with them! Why? Because I’ve taken to using one pad for both eyes hehe. I do one eye, peel off my Shadow Shield, and place it under my other eye! So I’m getting quite a bang for my buck with 50 pads! But honestly you don’t need to be stingy as the price is really good for a set of 50, that’s 25 uses! If you’re a MAC lover or use other pigmented shadows or shimmers you need these. No question. I know many of you love MAC as much as I do and using such highly pigmented eyeshadows causes major fall out so here’s your solution to perfect eyeshadow application each and every time! These come with my highest Muse Approval stamp! Get them now! You need them! Serious. Thanks to Michelle for creating every girl’s new best friend!

Pop Eye Cake Review By Isabella Muse on March 25, 2008 5 Comments in Pop I’m on a freaky Pop trip lately! I can’t seem to get enough of it! Today I wanted to review the Pop Eye Cake I got because it’s so awesome and I wants more colors! Now! I was lucky enough to test out the Pop Eye Cake in Bright Pink this week and I created so many looks with it tis ridiculous. It only contains 5 colors but you can do so much with the colors that you end up creating 20 different looks or more with one little compact! Sweet! First of all the packaging is uber cute. It reminds me of Cargo’s packaging as it comes in a cute little tin which is great for knocking around your purse as it won’t spill, break, or open! Each Eye Cake is $19 USD which evens out to less then $4 USD per a color in the tin. These come in 13 or so color combinations so you have plenty of variety when selecting what you want. Bright pinks, blues, golds, you name it and Pop has you covered. The pink is perfect for me because I truly think pink is my most flattering shade. All the colors are somewhat matte aside from one shimmering shade which you can use as an undercoat or overcoat for a bit of sparkle and shimmer! The pinks range from light, dark, and deep. There happened to be a bluish gray color in with my pinks which worked well as a bottom eye liner for one of the looks I created using this but I’m still in high debate how else to incorporate it in with so much pink! Looks you can create range from bold to natural it’s all up to how many colors you use, how heavily you pack on color, and what you’re looking to create. Colors are good quality and pigmented and they blend a nice little treat! Honestly, I’m loving this little guy and want a few more of the colors available! As I get older I find that I lean more towards buying palettes like this to avoid the drama of packing a ton of makeup when I travel! This sincerely simplifies life because the colors just all work well together. Ease of use is sincerely a plus when you’re running around in the morning! I’d say the Pop Eye Cake is Muse Approved for purchase! Check out Pop’s website for other combinations available! Click here to sneak a peek at Pop’s Day to Play palette which I’ll be reviewing very soon! If you missed it, I happened to review Pop’s Rose Belle Blush palette last week!

"['Bobbi Brown Moisturizing Cream Compact Foundation Review By Isabella Muse on March 24, 2008 9 Comments in Bobbi Brown My love for Bobbi knows no bounds lately. I’ve done a complete 180 and I’m the biggest fan Bobbi ever did have. I can’t believe I went from bitchin’ how bad her products were (or at least some I tried) to how fantastic they are! I guess I seriously didn’t give her stuff a chance because lately I’m an utter convert, fan, and lover. I wanted to do a comparison review this week of Bobbi’s Cream Compact Foundation vs. MAC Moisture Blend Foundation. But since I splurged some cash on Bobbi’s Cream Compact I thought it would be a bit ridiculous and obscene of me to go buy some MAC Moisture Blend just to compare the two. I may still do so as I’m sick enough to go buy some out of the sake of curiosity but for now you’ll have to settle for my review of Bobbi’s Foundation. First off I should mention I don’t need a face full of coverage. If I had to go around with an entire load of mineral powder on my face all day or a ton of liquid foundation on you might as well shoot me dead in the head Zombie style. Seriously the idea of having all that on my face all day scares me. I guess there may very well be a bit of irony in that statement considering I pack on eye color like I’m going to a rave but hey eye color and tons of foundation are two very separate things people! Secondly, it deserves to be mentioned that I have some serious dry skin going on due to the cold weather. I’m a combination skin that gets oily come Summer and dried out in the Winter so using a cream foundation is an absolute life saver during colder weather! Bobbi Brown’s Cream Foundation promises flawless coverage, long wear, and relief for dry skin. Hey, I’m all over all three of those things! I think this is actually made with a mature lady in mind that has drier skin, wrinkles, etc….however it’s relief for my dry skin. I normally use a cream foundation anyway so I had no reason to adjust to this or learn how to use it etc…My normal foundation is the Morgen Schick Hide and Highlight palette which is something you have to pry out of my cold, dead hands one day but I will say that Bobbi’s Cream Foundation is slowly become a fast favorite that may very well end up topping my list soon! The formula is extremely easy to blend and is highly moisturizing. I use Bobbi’s foundation brush to apply to the inner corner of my nose and blend slowly outwards. I apply a bit to the shadows around my chin and shadows found under my nose, above my lip line. That’s it done. Coverage is beautiful and as flawless as promised! It also happens to last about 7-8 hours without touch up which really makes me do cart wheels! Sweet! 8 hours of continuous wear? The Muse likey! The compact has a sponge applicator it comes with as well which can be stored under the cream as it’s a flip top which makes for ease of touch ups during the day if you please. It goes on wonderfully smooth and my skin is quite happy afterwards as it doesn’t flake up as a powder would. It just sinks in and creates a lovely canvas for my makeup! I originally purchased Sand but it was way BEIGE! Holy cow! I swapped up for Porcelain and that’s perfect. Without Flash With Flash All in all definately worth my $40! I’m super happy with the results and the beautiful look of my skin when using this. If you have dry skin this is something you definately, sincerely need to try! Do you use cream foundation?

"['Visee Aqua Shining Eyes Review By Isabella Muse on April 2, 2008 29 Comments in Japanese Brands , Visee Visee doesn’t get nearly enough love on my blog. It’s one of my very favorite brands from Kose and available within Japan only sadly! I’ll be reviewing Visee Spring Collection shortly but today I’m doing a review on my favorite product offered from Visee which is the Aqua Shining Cream Eyeshadow. If you read my blog often enough you’ve come to realize how much I detest cream shadows with a passion however Visee Aqua Shining Eyes is a favorite cream shadow of mine and it gets my highest seal of approval! PK 801 BL 901 These come in a beautiful array of colors which is a key selling point for me! They also pack an extreme bit of sparkle and shimmer which, as you know, the Muse adores. PU 100 PK 800 These blend beautifully! Three little dots on your lid and a quick swipe of your finger and you’ll have beautiful sparkling eyes! Pigmentation is excellent and the formula is so good that the color lasts all day! A key selling point on these for me is the sparkle and shimmer I’ve never run across a cream shadow that packed so much beautiful glitter! WT 001 One con is the price and the size of the product. Although you need very little of the shadow to get a beautiful eye look the size of the tube seems uber small and it feels like not alot of product is inside for the price of 1,890 yen per a shadow. GR 700 BL 900 Aside from that very minor rant Aqua Shining Eyes are definately a go for me and I adore them and can’t help but recommend them to you! GD002 BE 301 BE 300 They are definately worth trying out for yourself! If you’re a big fan of creams these will surely appeal! GY 003 Visee’s Aqua Shining Eyes are most definately Muse Approved for purchase! The Muse sporting Visee Aqua Shining Eyes in GD 002 ( Click for more pictures of this color!) Have these? Love ’em?

Smashbox Blowout Sale By Isabella Muse on April 2, 2008 8 Comments in Smashbox , Steals and Deals I could have predicted that the Smashbox Tokidoki Collection would someday end up on clearance.

It was utter and complete rubbish! A really great waste of cash! However, if you happen to lem it you can nab it now on sale from Smashbox and a few other bits and bobs are available to satisfy your need for savings!

Majolica Majorca Mascara Review By Isabella Muse on April 1, 2008 45 Comments in Japanese Brands , Majolica Majorca I think it’s about time that Majolica Marjorca Mascara had a review of it’s own don’t you? I get tons and tons and tons of questions, e-mails, comments, and general chitter about MJ (MJ is just short for Majolica Marjorca) mascara daily. Readers ask me about it constantly and I’m here to finally give a proper review of it because it’s my personal choice for favorite mascara! I use many different mascaras but MJ remains forever after my favorite mascara! I recommend this as if I have an endorsement plan with Shiseido! I wish I could say MJ was readily available at your local drugstore but, sadly, it’s not. MJ entire line is exclusive to Japan however the Muse highly recommends searching the internet and scoring yourself some because MJ’s mascara comes with my highest seal of approval! I haven’t run across a mascara better then the Majolica Majorca’s Lash Expander or as I deemed it Lash Extender. The name changes all the time as new versions are released but always, aside from small differences, the formula remains the same great mascara. Each Season a new version is released of this fine Mascara and each Season it gets better and better and better. There are two versions available of the mascara one of which is what I personally prefer using. That version is the Majolica Majorca Lash Expander. The other version is the Lash Enamel Glamour. Hmmm so what’s the difference anyway? Lash Enamel Glamour promises volume where as Lash Expander lengthens. I find that Majolica Majorca’s Lash Enamel Glamour does a crummy job with volume and extending lashes. For me the formula feels different compared to the expander. Whenever I use it my lashes clump, appear spiky, and my overall look is normally ruined! Thus I’m not a fan or supporter of Lash Enamel! However, The Lash Expander is a different story altogether. Each versions promises new lengths for your lashes which always makes me giggle but it’s all rather true sort of. The versions keep going higher and higher with the lengths you can achieve on your lashes. 10x’s, 20x’s, etc…etc… Honestly, the claims are somewhat true. You can lengthen your lashes a whole hell of alot using this. My lashes are full already but this makes them look amazingly longer, fuller, and beautiful! Almost as if I am sporting falsies however the look remains much more natural! The formula doesn’t smudge, flake, or cause general raccoon eye drama! It lasts all day and into the night (Yes, it’s waterproof!)! It keeps curl beautifully in my opinion and my lashes don’t feel heavy when on! The newest edition actually has some sort of conditioning oils in the formula which makes my lashes feel very soft. I can’t rave enough about this. It’s honestly the best mascara I’ve come across and believe you me I’ve tried plenty. The applicator is a comb style which enables you to comb on the mascara. Yes, this might be scary to a few of you and some that just hate applicators like this but for me it does an amazing job of combing out my lashes, lengthening, and keeping the curl all day! I feel like the comb works well at disturbing the product and brushing it on and I believe it’s completely responsible for the building up the length of your lashes. Last Fall MJ introduced a primer to go along with it’s mascara. I wasn’t particularly thrilled with the primer as it had way too many fibers and it didn’t appear to do much. In all honestly I don’t feel like I need to prime when using MJ mascara as it does the job well enough minus primer. I felt like the release of the primer was somewhat useless and turns out, for me, it is. I don’t like fiber mascaras in all honesty and I felt like the primer was fiber rich which caused me to feel like I had little hairs in my eye or something. It deserves to be mentioned that although MJ mascara is advertised as a fiber mascara at times it does not contain fibers that I’ve noticed in the formula! The formula quite reminds me of black ink! It has the exact same texture ink would! Sounds weird I know but I promise it works amazingly well! Majolica Majorca Lash Base As I had mentioned earlier each Season MJ releases a new formula of the mascara. Some Seasons the releases are colored or glittery. Last Summer they released a blue version of the mascara which got a total rave from me! And this Christmas they released a silver glittery overcoat which got another HOORAY! from the Muse! Majolica Majorca Glitter Topcoat Majolica Majorca Blue Mascara The Early Summer release brings us a new and exciting color! I’m very eager to lay my hands on the new mascara as it’s being released in a very beautiful burnt orange color! No matter the formula or the color Majolica Majorca definately gets a Muse Seal of Approval for purchase! Love this mascara? Love Majolica Majorca? Tell the Muse! Mally Beauty CityChick Nude Lip Kit Review By Isabella Muse on April 1, 2008 19 Comments in Mally Beauty I should start off this review by saying I HATE NUDES! Now that I’ve ranted a bit allow me to rave. I’ve been somewhat curious about Mally Beauty lately. I’ve only tried a few of her items and after being wow’ed by her neat little concealer last week I’m happy to report that I was able to test drive a few of her kits this week, the first of which I’m about to review for you. This morning I was doing a very calm, neutral look. Yes, it’s April Fools Day and No, I’m not kidding around I really did a nude, natural look this morning, honest. Well, as nude as the Muse goes in terms of cosmetics. First of all I should say how cute is Mally? I find her fascinating to watch on QVC. She’s so excited about cosmetics and passionate about what she does. Dontcha love that? I really dig her voice too for some reason! Is she cute or what? My review today is about the CityChick Nude Kit which comes in an ultra cute pink case! I love pretty things and this is most definately pretty. The kit comes with this uber cute metallic pink case that houses a gloss and a dual end liner pencil. The kit retails for $22.80 USD on QVC.com (Item Number A73014). The price is right as the quality is excellent. It evens out to about $11.40 USD per an item not including the bag which is seriously not a bad deal at all in my humble opinion. The kit is available in two shades which are nude deep and nude light. I tested out nude deep. As I said in the beginning of this review I hate nudes. I’m already sporting a very full face and I feel like nudes make my face appear even rounder however I’m happy to report that this actually worked well for me and I actually felt kind of sexy with the lip I created using this little kit! My lips looked very full and juicy after using it as well and mind you it’s NOT a plumping gloss! The gloss itself is a very intense liquid formula that really packs a punch. The formula is very thick but that doesn’t make it tacky or sticky. It feels very natural on and gives you a feeling of not even wearing gloss at all! The Muse likey that! The color is a cross between nude, beige, and a bit of brown thrown in. Not very exciting but once it’s on WAHOOOO very sexy! It also happens to come with a brush applicator which the Muse Approves of in a major way as I hate sponge applicators for glosses! The dual end liner is very, very interesting! One side sports a primer while the other side has a natural almost berry chocolate colored liner. Now the primer I was wary of at first. I don’t normally prime my lips but I decided to get the full experience and try this out. I’m really excited about the primer simply because it does exactly what it’s supposed to do and more! The primer offers full coverage of your lips and intensifies the gloss by 100%! It’s very melty so you have to be careful with how much you use and how you use it. The packaging suggests sticking it in the fridge for a bit to harden. It offers more coverage then normal foundation or even MAC lip primer for that matter. It really, really does a super job of nuding out your lips completely and making your gloss or lipstick intensify in color! I used this with the included gloss and also with a lipstick but I felt like it worked better with my lipstick then with the gloss! It really made my lipstick pop and it’s turned me on to priming my lips as it’s not a normal practice of mine! The liner is a beautiful shade of chocolate with a hint of berry to it and it compliments the nude shade of gloss beautifully. I don’t normally line my lips but again I wanted to go for the full experience when testing this so I lined up. I must say that it made my lips appear fuller by lining pre-gloss which was a curious feeling looking at myself. I felt like Angelina Jolie for a second there. Wide lips, full pout. So yum! I actually love this kit. It’s sincerely an interesting little combo of goodies that creates a very interesting look! For me it’s a different look which may be why I’m loving it! I don’t normally veer away from my bold looks so this was definately an interesting experience! The Muse sporting some kissable lips after using the Nude Lip Kit! All in all I’d say the CityChick Nude Lip Kit is Muse Approved for purchase. The Muse likey and thinks you will too! Click here to read up on Mally’s new concealer! Pop’s Day to Play Palette Review By Isabella Muse on March 31, 2008 16 Comments in Pop Another Pop Review for you guys ? I’ve been playing with the Day to Play Palette for about two weeks now and I must say it’s fantastic. Remember I mentioned this during the holidays? Click! This particular kit is a gorgeous wallet style with a cute button clasp. The package definately sells it for me as it’s really cute for toting around. It almost looks like a checkbook style wallet. This comes with a brush as well and a little brush loop inside the wallet for attaching it. Flash Without Flash This particular palette is quite a steal for the price at $42 USD which is about $1.75 USD per a strip of color as you get 24 shades of fabulous shadows. If you don’t have a vast collection of eyeshadow and are looking to start one up so you’ll have a variety of looks you can create this little palette is definately alot of bang for your buck. With 24 shades you can create a multitude of looks ranging from natural and elegant to loud and outrageous! I’ve been using the top part for the past few days as it contained the most Muse Approved colors that ranged from bold greens and blues to beautiful pinks and reds. The top half the palette contains all the vibrant popping shades where as the bottom contains more natural shimmering shades of browns, pinks, and pastels. Bottom Top This is also particularly great for beginners or those of you afraid of a little color. I love how Pop always includes a handy little card of color in with the packaging to show you which colors work well together and what sort of looks you can create using the palette. Color Card: Instructions for different looks! The colors are of good pigmentation and blend very easily but lack too much shimmer which is sometimes a deal breaker for the Muse but since the colors are so lovely I can’t complain over much! They have a very fine sheen of shimmer but not an overload which can be good since fall out isn’t a major problem plus it makes them easier to work with! I know a few people who had expressed interest in buying this when I did my original post and I’m here to say it’s definately worth your time. Pop does a range of these palettes but this is by far the nicest I’ve seen. Most of the older palettes they did contained 12 shades of shadow but they are now doing bigger and better palettes which also include blushes. I’m really loving these at the moment as simplicity is becoming a daily part of my regime. The brush included with this is plenty to create the look you desire. One end is a fluffy eyeshadow brush and the other is a flat liner style brush. All in all Pop gets my vote for cool palettes as of late. Simplicity with a range of gorgeous colors! Cheers to that! The Muse like the Pop Day to Play Palette and recommends having a peek at it! You can find out more about Pop by clicking here to visit the Pop website!

"['I Heart the 80’s FOTD By Isabella Muse on March 31, 2008 37 Comments in Face of the Day Tis 80’s Monday girlies! A few of us on the blogsphere got together and decided to do some 80’s looks!

I know I’ve mentioned that before and many of you already know it as you’re as passionate about Japanese Cosmetics as I am however I thought it deserved a remention in my introduction because I have quite a flow of newer readers visiting with me lately and I thought that’d be a nice little way to introduce this review plus give them a little info about the brand. Maquillage is not my favorite brand in the Shiseido line (I’m sure you can guess which my favorite is…go on comment and tell me!). For me Maquillage is a hit or miss sadly. Some products are really good and some aren’t so great. The price range is lovely, the packaging is fabulous, but the actual products are sometimes too sheer or not particularly the best quality in the world. I’m not that big a fan of the shadow compacts, the liners, or the glosses. However, I do give a better portion of my money to Maquillage on a rare occasion! Today I’m reviewing Watery Crash Eyes from Maquillage. I don’t follow Maquillage as much as I do other Japanese brands so when something new is released I know of it but not when it was released so I’m unsure which collection these are from. A very sweet friend of mine did some personal shopping for me in Tokyo last week and she picked up Watery Crash Eyes as a request from me. Sadly, I’m not quite so into it. The lemming for this came from the fact that it reminded me of Chanel’s Ombre D’eau Fluid Eyeshadow but the Maquillage price is much more affordable. The color selection isn’t vast by any means and this particular product is only offered in 5 colors. I got the PK213 which is a beautiful baby pink color. Now I can’t fairly give this a poor review. The reason for that is the product is actually good and the problem is that I’m just too bloody picky with cosmetics. The texture and formula is wonderful as it blends a real treat however a few things I don’t like about it are the finish which is more of a shine than a shimmer if that makes sense, I’m also not loving how much I need to use to get color onto my lid as this is very sheer, and finally I’m just not enjoying the total look it created for me. As I was saying it blends very well, just dot and smooth on. The texture is thick and creamy. All and all I see no problem with the formula however it’s lack of shimmer kind of disappointed me. I should mention that I’m not a fan of cream shadows and honestly the main reason I had purchased this was because it not only reminded me of the Chanel but also Visee’s Aqua Shining Eyes so I was kinda hopeful this would be as good a quality as both of those. The product is sheer so you have to do at least three layers to get some color onto your lid. One layer will not do much of anything. I noticed that it doesn’t dry fast either which is a good thing because if you mess up while blending you can easily go back and smooth your finger around a bit more without worrying about it being dry and messing the entire look up. This is particularly nice as well when you’re layering the color because you’re not packing color onto an already “dry” look. My final look when I was done layering and blending wasn’t exactly great. No pop sadly. But as I said I can’t give it a bad review because the formula is very good (especially the fact it stays wet so long before setting which makes for ease of application). I’m just a nitpicker because I enjoy a bit more shimmer and the look I achieved was more of a shiny, neutral look! If you enjoy simplicity without shimmer or pop this might very well be something you’d enjoy using. For myself I’m not loving it at the moment but I’m going to continue using it to see how I feel after a few weeks! Here’s what I created using Watery Clash Eyes: Here’s what I used: Eyes: Maquillage Watery Clash Eyes in PK213 Visee Mascara Lips Bobbi Brown Lip and Cheek Rouge in Pink Raspberry Bobbi Brown Lipgloss in Pink Popsicle Cheeks: Bare Minerals Blush in Fruit Cocktail Love Maquillage? Own this already? Adore it? Hate it? Tell the Muse! Mally Beauty Liquid Eye Brightener By Isabella Muse on March 27, 2008 7 Comments in Beauty Babblings I’m procrastinating at work. Shhhhhh! Don’t tell anyone! That’s the best part about being self-employed you actually can’t get yourself in trouble for procrastinating but of course later on today I’ll give myself a good talking down to make myself officially responsible. I honestly deserve a little procrastination today as I had a super asthma attack yesterday evening so a bit of chillaxing at work is just what the doctor ordered! Mostly this consists of me sending e-mails back and fourth with our favorite Cookie from The Daily Cookie (I’m dragging her into the procrastination vortex with me!), browsing around for new ideas for blog entries (comment box is open to your suggestions!), and trying to somehow someway get caught up with e-mail in my inbox (maybe I can somehow get through 10 years of e-mail in under 10 minutes!)! While I’m doing all this I also happened to surf my way over to QVC to check up on Mally Beauty. One of my readers, friends, and fellow New Yorkers, Adina, had mentioned that Mally had some updates over yonder so of course I had to investigate it for myself! I didn’t see anything too interesting but I did run across something new or at least I think it’s new called Liquid Eye Brightener! This stuff sounds awesome! It’s basically a powder but when you drop it into your hand and rub it turns into a liquid. Once liquidated (is that even a word?) you pat it gently under your eyes for a little concealing magic to make your eyes look refreshed, awake, and beautiful! I’m very curious about this and I’m wondering if it’s good for touch ups! I normally tote around a Dior Radiance Pen for touch ups but I find it too messy honestly…hmmmm I want this! I might wait though to see the reviews first! I really like the format of the bottle as well with the small dropper style squeeze top! This is $22.80 USD and is available now from QVC, A81636. What do you think? Nay or Yay? Ok now it’s back to work with me…seriously…..honest….maybe….sorta…….kinda…… Summer Collection 2008: Aube Gloss Frutina By Isabella Muse on March 27, 2008 13 Comments in Aube , Japanese Brands , Summer Collections 2008 I’m a big fan of the Aube Frutina Lipglosses that were released last year and the good news is this year they are making a guest starring appearance in Aube’s Early Summer release Collection! My very beautiful mate, Iris, reported on these earlier in the month and I felt myself getting all hyper at the prospect of not only new colors but from what I’m understanding new flavors! BLESS BE the Japanese have heard my prayers and have answered them! Flavored Lipgloss! Hooray! Hooray! I’m one for ranting at the lack of flavor in a majority of gloss brands on Japanese shores so this is exciting! Each gloss is LE and scented in exotic combinations but I’m not entirely sure if they are “flavored” as well! So here’s to hoping right? Orange is orange and rosemary scented, Pink is berry and mint (mmm sounds great), dusky pink is plum and lemongrass, and finally the beige is apple caramal and chamomile (please see Rouge Deluxe for the original information about these releases!). Each gloss is 2100 yen each and well worth the price tag in my opinion. The color selection looks fabulous compared to last year’s glosses. They appear almost frosty this time around however sometimes the swatches aren’t so brilliant so can’t go by that until I actually see them in person. Since I enjoyed these so much I thought I’d combine a mini review here from the glosses I do have from the previous release! I really like these and they definately fall into a favorite category for me. One thing I really like about them is the applicator. The applicator is a sponge but it’s a large sponge and for some reason or another it saturates really well with the product so you get a nice bit of the gloss on it for smoothing onto your lips! I’m not sure if it’s the applicator or the formula but it just smooths on amazingly well for a gloss! I always struggle with sponge applicators as I’m constantly redipping where as with this I only need one dip and I’m good to go! These are a tiny bit on the sheer side so I definately suggest layering them to deepen the color on your lips as one stroke will get you a nice glossy look but not enough color to really pop so a bit of redipping and building the color up will give you an excellent pay off and beautiful look! The texture is not sticky or tacky at all. It feels perfect on and has a pretty good water base because the gloss just slides on beautifully creating a very natural feel on your lips but NOT the type that’s sliding off onto your chin! Sadly, as with almost all Japanese glosses I’ve tried, these lack any taste or flavor. I enjoy flavor in my gloss but this is great if you’re hating that. The color selection last year came in about 12 shades I believe and a few were LE but not all. These new releases will all be LE so that’s a plus! The packaging is definately pleasing as each gloss has tiny crystals in the top! Very pretty! These particular shades being released appear more pigmented! We shall see! Very excited for the collection to hit shops so I can lay my greedy hands on some! Love Aube Frutina? Want these? Tell the Muse! Beauty on a Budget: Terra Eyeshadow Review By Isabella Muse on March 27, 2008 17 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Face of the Day , Hauls , Terra I was tempted again by the evil Beauty on a Budget brands that can be found in my local drugstore….go firgure. My little mate Mandy from Mandy’s Beauty Blog was bragging about Terra eyeshadows in a recent post of mine and of course I got to thinking that I need to recheck these out. The reason I say “recheck” them is because I had previously seen these in my local drugstore and even swatched them but me being the snob I am I skipped and didn’t bother buying any! Of course, when I went back my mentality had changed slightly and I was open to the suggestion that maybe these could be good. Lucky for me I kept that frame of mind because I walked out of the store toting eight shades in a little plastic bag with a goofy smile on my lips over my latest haul. These are great, thanks Mandy! I know many of you piss, moan, and bitch something fierce about baked eyesahdows. I personally don’t mind an occasional baked eyeshadow. They spice up my life a little bit and they are different and interesting however I do agree with some of you to an extent about the lack of pigmentation. These shadows I am about to show you are baked eyeshadows however they are alot different then what you’re used to with your normal variety range of baked eyeshadows! These are entitled Terra Eyeshadows and yes I googled plenty for you but I see nothing about these anywhere. No website, no listing, nada. The back says “Made in Italy” but soon after it displays a Miami address…I dunno. The good news is these are fantastic. The pigmentation, for a baked eyeshadow, is brilliant. They are loaded with color, blend easily, and have just a touch of shimmer that’s not to overkill for my sparkle/shimmer haters out there. The shadow itself is very silky and smooth and it blends very well for a baked eyeshadow as I normally find baked shadows here in the US a bit hard in texture if that makes sense and not as silky as what I’ve tried abroad. Prices vary from shop to shop but they aren’t too expensive at $7.49 USD or so per a pot. I’ve seen them in a few drugstores for different price ranges but no higher then $8.99 USD. For what it’s worth that’s somewhat high for one eyeshadow purchased in a cheesy drugstore in the United States however they are good and you know when I say something is good I sincerely mean that from the bottom of my little heart. The first time I noticed these as I had mentioned early on in this post was when the line had single eyeshadows only. They now have duo eyeshadows as well which I love since the color combinations are flattering and do work well together. The entire line is really tiny it consists of about twelve or so eyeshadows and a few bronzer type blushers and that’s it. As I mentioned I ended up with eight of the eyeshadows total. I’ve seen these in two locations so far. Harmon’s Beauty Store and Duane Reade. As I recall they were cheaper in Harmon’s so hit up there first prior to heading to Duane Reade for the best price. To find them don’t look in the main cosmetic aisle you have to swing yourself around and they are right next to the applicators, eye makeup removers, and cotton swabs and stuff. Right by the accessories you’ll see a tiny little display with these hanging out on it! I did notice something that deserves a mention about these. I had to do some major prepping of my eye prior to applying as I noticed the first time I used one of the duos that it creased terribly. I blame that on my lack of prepping and my rushed application however I did a second look and the same thing happened so when using these you may need to spend a little extra time prepping your eye area well prior to application. My third time trying these I hit the nail on the head and got it right, no creasing and perfect wear and tear all day but I spent some time making sure I had a good surface on my eye prior to applying and my bit of hard work rewarded me with beautiful, eyepopping eyeshadow that lasted all day and into the night! Without further babbling from me a few pictures of the Terra Eyeshadows I picked up! Lime/Lemon Turquoise Pearl Water/Green Emerald Pearl Snow Gold Pearl Beige Pearl Midnight/Ice Purple/Sky My favorite of the bunch is Turquoise Pearl which is a beautiful aqua touched with some lovely blue and Snow Gold Pearl which is a lovely golden cream!

"['QVC Exclusive: Laura Geller ""The Tropics"" Lipstick and Gloss Set By Isabella Muse on March 26, 2008 2 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Laura Geller , Spring Collections 2008 Laura Geller was on QVC a few days ago as any good twisted cosmetic junkie would do I recorded the showing. I was fast forwarding through most of it but I came across this little kit she did and it intrigued me! The pictures actually don’t do the product justice. The lipshade appears on screen to be a very lovely burnt red color and the gloss on top made it into a golden dark peachy shade. It was rather nice on the model that was sporting it. They kept raving on and on about how good it smelled and tasted but no one said exactly what it was smelling and tasting of. I can only assume it’s some tropical taste hence the name!? The packaging also sold me as it’s studded in pink glittery bits. Cutes! The set is available from QVC for $24.25 USD under Item Number A6451. I haven’t ordered it because I’m playing good girl at the moment and saving my little pennies for Summer releases however I am curious and I do have a little bit of a burning lem in my stomach! If you’re familiar with the color PS Kiss this reminds me of that thus the need to purchase it is hard upon me! Want this? Own it already? Just love Laura’s cosmetics? Tell the Muse!

"['Bath & Body Works’ New Fragrance Widget By Isabella Muse on September 1, 2009 2 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Fragrance Anyone try the new Bath & Body Works’ New Fragrance Widget? What I’m a geeky I adore stupid stuff like this. Basically it works like a quiz asking you questions and the likes and than it proceeds to customize the perfect fragrance for you. Check out the deets after the jump and find out which fragrance it picked for me. The application basically allows you to create a customizable fragrance profile in a few seconds and offers you the perfect scent selection that it believes you’ll love. It chooses characteristics that you describe to help you find your ideal scent. After fiddling around with it a few times it recommended me Bath and Body Works Signature Collection Mandarin Mango. Obviously it works as I adore fruity, sweet blends. Mandarin Mango isn’t so much sweet as more fruity, the harsh edge from the mandarin gives it a slightly sour base which dominates much of the blend but the fruity base of mango also provides that juicy, sweet feeling to keep the fragrance light and fresh. Likey. It’s funny as I’d probably past this up for my normal scent at BBW so this totally allows me to try something different that was recommended to me, cheers! You can try the widget (or install it on your blog and the likes) by visiting www.bbwfindyourfragrance.com Stop back tell me what it chooses for you! Curious minds. You may also enjoy...

"['Bath and Body Works Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Delight By Isabella Muse on October 14, 2007 4 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Holiday Collections 2007 , Shower & Bath , Winter Collections 2007 Two new Bath and Body Works Temptation items have popped up on the website! The first of which is entitled Vanilla Ice Cream and it’s not a three in one shower gel this time ? It’s a body spray! This is the first time we are seeing any of the Temptation line in the body spray format. This could be good news for the Temptation line! Reviews on the site are saying that this surprising little body spray isn’t all about Vanilla Ice Cream . It’s is, however, about the entire sundae! Chocolate sauce, ice cream, nuts, cherry, and more await in you in this yummie spray! If that wasn’t enough you can also slather on some of the new Whipped Delight Shimmer Body Mousse to complete the entire decadent desert sensation! Both items are up and available at Bath and Body Works site but I am unsure when they’ll be sold in stores. Keep your eyes peeled I imagine it won’t be long before you’ll see these popping up in stores. Vanilla Ice Cream Body Spray is $8 and Whipped Delight Shimmer Mousse is $12. The Muse wants to spray herself with Vanilla Ice Cream and top it all off with some Whipped Delight! She’ll most definately be ordering both for her very own! You may also enjoy...

"['Pop Eye Cake Review By Isabella Muse on March 25, 2008 5 Comments in Pop I’m on a freaky Pop trip lately! I can’t seem to get enough of it! Today I wanted to review the Pop Eye Cake I got because it’s so awesome and I wants more colors! Now! I was lucky enough to test out the Pop Eye Cake in Bright Pink this week and I created so many looks with it tis ridiculous. It only contains 5 colors but you can do so much with the colors that you end up creating 20 different looks or more with one little compact! Sweet! First of all the packaging is uber cute. It reminds me of Cargo’s packaging as it comes in a cute little tin which is great for knocking around your purse as it won’t spill, break, or open! Each Eye Cake is $19 USD which evens out to less then $4 USD per a color in the tin. These come in 13 or so color combinations so you have plenty of variety when selecting what you want. Bright pinks, blues, golds, you name it and Pop has you covered. The pink is perfect for me because I truly think pink is my most flattering shade. All the colors are somewhat matte aside from one shimmering shade which you can use as an undercoat or overcoat for a bit of sparkle and shimmer! The pinks range from light, dark, and deep. There happened to be a bluish gray color in with my pinks which worked well as a bottom eye liner for one of the looks I created using this but I’m still in high debate how else to incorporate it in with so much pink! Looks you can create range from bold to natural it’s all up to how many colors you use, how heavily you pack on color, and what you’re looking to create. Colors are good quality and pigmented and they blend a nice little treat! Honestly, I’m loving this little guy and want a few more of the colors available! As I get older I find that I lean more towards buying palettes like this to avoid the drama of packing a ton of makeup when I travel! This sincerely simplifies life because the colors just all work well together. Ease of use is sincerely a plus when you’re running around in the morning! I’d say the Pop Eye Cake is Muse Approved for purchase! Check out Pop’s website for other combinations available!

"['When Beauty on a Budget, Goes WRONG!: Prestige Skin Loving Minerals Review By Isabella Muse on April 8, 2008 21 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Prestige Prestige Cosmetics is a low end makeup that’s available in a few drugstores stateside. You may or may not be privy to this line of cosmetics. Recently while purchasing my Milani Wet/Dry Eyeshadow haul I came across the Prestige Skin Loving Minerals display. The display had quads of eyeshadows and a few blushes. I think I was blindsided by all the pretty swirls in the blush because I ended up purchasing one. The packaging was nice enough. The blush came in a pretty simple yet nice clear compact. The cost was pretty nice as well at $6.49 USD. And the blush appeared to be pigmented enough! The bright beautiful pink with swirls of gold really got me excited. But that’s about all the pros of the product because quality is absolute garbage. I can’t believe it’s legal to sell trash like this. The blush is not pigmented at all! It’s silky enough but when you apply it basically appears as if you are using a translucent powder or something! You get NO color at all from the blush! This is when Beauty on a Budget goes terribly wrong! I seriously can’t help but whine that I lost $6.49 plus tax on such a trashy product! Total rant but seriously it was like flushing money down the toilet! Grrr! See? Now you know why I stay away from drugstore cosmetics! A fair warning if you walk into your local drugstore and are wow’ed by the gorgeous display of Prestige Skin Loving Minerals! Don’t buy! Keep away! They may look pretty but they seriously are not worth your hard earned cash! The Muse says don’t buy these! Tagged! I’m It! Random Facts You Didn’t Know About the Muse By Isabella Muse on April 8, 2008 15 Comments in Pieces of Life The beautiful Kia from Yummy411 has tagged the Muse to spill some Random Facts About Me that you may or may not already know! I’ve been tagged before but I failed to come through on it. EEP! Sorry whoever tagged me before! I’m terrible at these little games! Ok so six things you may not know about me. 1. I have two small teacup Chihuahua a la Paris Hilton hehe! They are my kids, my babies. I love them silly! 2. I love Zombies. George Romero is my hero. I collect all sorts of strange films featuring zombies. Stuff you may have never heard of. Budget films, crazy grindhouse movies, etc…anything that features zombies and I’m all over it! 3. I’ve traveled quite a bit! I sincerely love traveling and I’ve done my fair share of it in my 30 years. I go to England at least once a year, I’ve been to Japan, Thailand, All over the Islands, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Holland, Germany, Tons of US States (Illinois, Florida, California, Nevada, Texas, Hawaii, Maine, Louisiana, etc…etc…etc….)…I’m sure I’m missing some! Since I mentioned places I’ve been I should mention places I am dying to go too those would be Egypt, Singapore, Korea, Washington State, Australia, India, etc….etc…! My family used to spend entire Summers in Europe every year and it gave me a great love of being abroad and just enjoying visiting new places! 4. I’m extremely geeky. If you think makeup is my passion you’d be wrong. I’m more of a geek than a makeup lover. I go to Sci/Fi Conventions, Computer Conventions, I’m a trekkie type. I enjoy anything and everything that has to do with the geeky world of science and computers. 5. I am not a makeup artist, I do not work in the makeup or fashion industry, and I do not possess a pro card. I can’t tell you how many times I get asked that ? 6. I have one older sister whom I get on with famously. We are not only sisters but the best of friends as well. She’s actually 12 years older then me but it never feels that way! We are always like two little kids, giggling constantly, etc…! That’s it. And it was kinda hard trying to figure out six things you may not already know about me! My comment box is open! Tell me six things I don’t know about YOU! Visee Spring Collection 2008 Review By Isabella Muse on April 4, 2008 18 Comments in Face of the Day , Japanese Brands , Swatches , Visee Lord I’m sure late with this one! Sorry ’bout that! But it’s here now! The Visee Spring Collection 2008 Review! Excited? Don’t be. It’s disappointing. For those of you lovely girls (or boys!) that are not in the know allow me to briefly explain that Visee is a brand available in Japan and is sub-brand of Kose who makes a ton of fab brands, Visee, being one. These are sadly unavailable in the US ? E6 and E7 Without Flash E6 and E7 Now for the review. I know many readers were highly interested in hearing about the new Spring palettes considering that the previous release of the the Jewel Crush Eyes were such a smashing success and hit! Don’t get me wrong these are beautiful, beautiful editions to the Jewel Crush Eyes line up but why they did them in such similar shades as previous releases is really beyond my feeble little mind. The fact of the matter is that E6 and E7 are practically identical to E2 and E4. It really boggles my mind! The colors are so similar it borders on absurd to bother wasting your money on either! The good news is I wasted my money so you don’t have too. Seriously, you do not need E6 and E7. With that being said allow me to explain the very minor differences between the four palettes. E7 is noticeably comparable to E4. The only difference between the two palettes is the fact that E7 contains a few deeper shades while E4 contains light shades. The main color appears identical to my eye, while the contrast shade is different. E4’s contrast shade is a lilac purple where E7’s shade is a deep gray. The base colors are different completely with E4 sporting a soft lilac and E7 a sparkling white. Finally the liners are a tad different as well with E4 having a purple based brown color and E7 having a smoky purple/black combo. Honestly, once they are on you’re not going to tell much difference between the looks you can create using these! E7 and E4 (Starting from Top Left: Main Base Color, Contrasting Color, Base, and Liner) Without Flash E7 and E4 E7 Created using E7 Moving on to E6 again we have a similar problem with color combinations. E6 is a dead on match for E2. This time the liners are identical colors! The main base shadow is gold in E6 and a softer beige gold in E2. The contrasting shadows are different in E6 is a gold based brown and E2 is more of a copper color with gold. And finally the base shadow shadow in E6 is more of a creamy white gold and E2 is a true gold. Again, same problem as before, you can create basically the same look using either of the two palettes. E6 and E2 (Starting from Top Left: Main Base Color, Contrasting Color, Base, and Liner) E6 Created Using E6 Even though the differences appear major they are in fact very subtle and for me the small changes are not enough to warrant purchasing the newest palettes unless you’re a big addict like me and have the “have to have them all” mentality I seem to possess! I also got the two mascaras that were released with the collection. At the time I was under the impression of how awesome Kose mascaras were but sadly these don’t fall under that “great” category! The mascaras are not worth your money at all in my humblest. They made my lashes spiky as hell! The formula is great, the wand is fantastic, and the colors available are brilliant but that didn’t add up to a great mascara experience for me! I’ve since used both colors I got, which were brown and black, and each time I tested these out for a run I ended up with the strange clumpy spike look! If I’m extra careful I do get some nice volume but I have to apply it really slow which for me is a big no! It’s the AM and I’m rushing no time for slow mascara application! Big boo to these! I didn’t yet dive into getting any of the new metallic loose eyeshadows that were released but that’ll be very soon! As soon as I get them I’ll be reviewing! All in all a rather weak and disappointing Spring Collection for Visee! Let’s hope Summer brings something much better! Love Visee’s Jewel Crush Eye Palettes? Hate this release? Want these? Tell the Muse! mark Pure Eye and Lip Strips By Isabella Muse on April 4, 2008 12 Comments in Avon , Mark I’m an Avon junkie lately. Yea so? And? Can you believe I said it aloud? It’s kinda like going to an AA meeting and admitting that you do indeed have an addiction! This is not your mama’s Avon anymore kids. Seriously lately they have been introducing some seriously cool stuff! Currently I’m really loving the pure eye and lip strips and yes they are sitting very comfortably in my virtual shopping cart awaiting me to hit submit! The colors of the shadows aren’t so wow aspiring but I must say that both lippie palettes look yummie to my eyes and since I’m busy sporting nudes and neutrals lately I’ll go ahead and admit that even the eyeshadows look kinda nice!

About a month ago I finished off my mega size that I had purchased last year and I wandered over to QVC for a re-order and was saddened and shocked to see it was unavailable. Now this mega size is about $40 USD or so after shipping. I hopped into Sephora and had to pay $32 USD for 16oz…..sheesh………..I could get twice the amount for almost the same price! 32oz vs 16oz Anyway! For the Purity lovers grab it while the grabbing is good! Item Number A34737. On to more Philosophy news….. Have you seen these? From Philosophy’s website: you need this product if… your skin is dehydrated and thirsty for replenishment your skin is dull, devitalized, and in need of extreme hydration your skin has lost its firmness and elasticity you want to minimize the appearance of fine lines & wrinkles your skin is stressed due to climate changes, stress, hormones or illness Sounds like I need these as my skin is always thirsty for more moisture! It sounds like a great fix for Winter skin blues! What do you think? I’ve never tried any capsule treatments from Philosophy (they have booster shots available as well in cap form) so I am vaguely curious! Hmmmm!

"['Beauty on a Budget: Terra Eyeshadow Review By Isabella Muse on March 27, 2008 17 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Face of the Day , Hauls , Terra I was tempted again by the evil Beauty on a Budget brands that can be found in my local drugstore….go firgure. My little mate Mandy from Mandy’s Beauty Blog was bragging about Terra eyeshadows in a recent post of mine and of course I got to thinking that I need to recheck these out. The reason I say “recheck” them is because I had previously seen these in my local drugstore and even swatched them but me being the snob I am I skipped and didn’t bother buying any! Of course, when I went back my mentality had changed slightly and I was open to the suggestion that maybe these could be good. Lucky for me I kept that frame of mind because I walked out of the store toting eight shades in a little plastic bag with a goofy smile on my lips over my latest haul. These are great, thanks Mandy! I know many of you piss, moan, and bitch something fierce about baked eyesahdows. I personally don’t mind an occasional baked eyeshadow. They spice up my life a little bit and they are different and interesting however I do agree with some of you to an extent about the lack of pigmentation. These shadows I am about to show you are baked eyeshadows however they are alot different then what you’re used to with your normal variety range of baked eyeshadows! These are entitled Terra Eyeshadows and yes I googled plenty for you but I see nothing about these anywhere. No website, no listing, nada. The back says “Made in Italy” but soon after it displays a Miami address…I dunno. The good news is these are fantastic. The pigmentation, for a baked eyeshadow, is brilliant. They are loaded with color, blend easily, and have just a touch of shimmer that’s not to overkill for my sparkle/shimmer haters out there. The shadow itself is very silky and smooth and it blends very well for a baked eyeshadow as I normally find baked shadows here in the US a bit hard in texture if that makes sense and not as silky as what I’ve tried abroad. Prices vary from shop to shop but they aren’t too expensive at $7.49 USD or so per a pot. I’ve seen them in a few drugstores for different price ranges but no higher then $8.99 USD. For what it’s worth that’s somewhat high for one eyeshadow purchased in a cheesy drugstore in the United States however they are good and you know when I say something is good I sincerely mean that from the bottom of my little heart. The first time I noticed these as I had mentioned early on in this post was when the line had single eyeshadows only. They now have duo eyeshadows as well which I love since the color combinations are flattering and do work well together. The entire line is really tiny it consists of about twelve or so eyeshadows and a few bronzer type blushers and that’s it. As I mentioned I ended up with eight of the eyeshadows total. I’ve seen these in two locations so far. Harmon’s Beauty Store and Duane Reade. As I recall they were cheaper in Harmon’s so hit up there first prior to heading to Duane Reade for the best price. To find them don’t look in the main cosmetic aisle you have to swing yourself around and they are right next to the applicators, eye makeup removers, and cotton swabs and stuff. Right by the accessories you’ll see a tiny little display with these hanging out on it! I did notice something that deserves a mention about these. I had to do some major prepping of my eye prior to applying as I noticed the first time I used one of the duos that it creased terribly. I blame that on my lack of prepping and my rushed application however I did a second look and the same thing happened so when using these you may need to spend a little extra time prepping your eye area well prior to application. My third time trying these I hit the nail on the head and got it right, no creasing and perfect wear and tear all day but I spent some time making sure I had a good surface on my eye prior to applying and my bit of hard work rewarded me with beautiful, eyepopping eyeshadow that lasted all day and into the night! Without further babbling from me a few pictures of the Terra Eyeshadows I picked up! Lime/Lemon Turquoise Pearl Water/Green Emerald Pearl Snow Gold Pearl Beige Pearl Midnight/Ice Purple/Sky My favorite of the bunch is Turquoise Pearl which is a beautiful aqua touched with some lovely blue and Snow Gold Pearl which is a lovely golden cream! All the colors are truly outstanding and the photos don’t do them justice! Terra Eyeshadows are most definately Muse Approved for purchasing! I’m loving these at the moment! Want ’em? Already have ’em? Loving them? Tell the Muse! You may also enjoy... Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolor Review & Swatches Revlon Colorstay 2-in-1 Compact Makeup & Concealer Review & Swatches Hi There!

"['Mario Badescu Silver Powder By Isabella Muse on April 11, 2008 31 Comments in Skincare Silver Powder. What’s it do? Who’s it for? How do I use it? Sounds like something you might find in a jewelry showcase eh? My skin is fairly clear and I doesn’t really give me too much woe. I take super good care of it and that could be the reason that I’m not crying over it at night. I suffer from one main problem that I’ve had for years and nothing really helps it. Blackheads. On my nose. I don’t have a ton of blackheads but I have about two stubborn ones that won’t go anywhere. I’ve tried just about everything even having them professionally extracted only to have them pop back up over and over and over again! Nose strips. Don’t work. Various lotions and potions. Don’t work. Extracting them? Works temporarily but they pop back up like an ugly penny! They bug me really bad. I guess you can’t really see them unless you have a 10X zoom but I know they are there and for me that’s enough! I was busy blabbering about blackheads in my Biore PJ Party post a few weeks ago remember? And a lovely reader and friend, Gezebel , had suggested Silver Powder. Hmm….a solution maybe???? I rushed to Mario Badescu’s site to check this out! I happily ordered it as it’s only $12 bucks USD so what’s the harm right? I also crawled the internet for a coupon so I saved $1.80 USD with a coupon code I found! YAY me! I got this super fast. Within a day it was on my door step! Go Mario Go! Props for awesome shipping time. More props for the awesome freebies my box came with. They included a mini slew of all sorts of skincare wonder that I’ve never tried. I got a Cucumber Tonic Mask, some Enzyme Cleaning Gel, Moisturizer, Cucumber Cleansing Oil and some Eye Cream! Wahooooo for freebies! The Muse likey samples! Anyway about that Silver Powder I mentioned…. Well. The verdict is in and I like it. It didn’t work the 1st time or the 2nd time for that matter. It was however successful at turning my nose a strange pale white color temporarily. However, that 1st and 2nd use did “fade” the blackheads. I know weird but the effect was interesting. I really had to look to see them. So I went from viewing them in my 10X mirror to hauling out the big guns and peering at them with my 12X! Yup sadly those two evil suckers were deeply embedded in my nose. But I wasn’t giving up! Last night I attempted a 3rd run with Silver Powder. It deserves to be mentioned that several people around the internetz mentioned that using silver powder and proceeding to use a nose strip seemed to pick up more blackheads and that’s what I did the first two times without too much success! However, this third run I just applied, waited 10 minutes, and washed off with a wash cloth. And….mmm..pretty successfully this time around! My nose is looking pretty darn good. I do see a tiny bit of one blackhead that’s sorting hanging on but I think I can successfully wash him away with a final run of Silver Powder! So how do you use Silver Powder anyway? Basically Silver Powder is just a white loose powder sorry to disappoint but no silver here. Basically you take a dampened cotton ball and dab it into the loose powder. You proceed to take the cotton ball with the now damp Silver Powder and pat it on your nose (I rubbed it a bit as well). This creates a bit of a mask over your nose (or if you prefer you can of course use it on any clogged pores you have on your face! I only have blackheads on my nose so that’s where I used it!). You live this on for 10 minutes and wash with cold water after the time is up! Some folk like to use a nose strip afterwards as I mentioned above and that works very well but I found just washing it off works just as well! The verdict? The Muse Approves of Mario Badescu Silver Powder! It takes a bit of elbow grease but with a little patience you can happily kiss your Blackheads goodbye plus it’s $12 bucks for a HUGE supply! This stuff will last you a year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cheers to that! Bare Escentuals Buxom Babes Lip Tints By Isabella Muse on April 11, 2008 9 Comments in Bare Escentuals , Summer Collections 2008 Sephora is super busy updating it’s site with new little bits and bobs for Summer. I ran across this kit from Bare Escentuals while browsing around. This particular kit contains four lip plumping lipglosses for $28 USD. First of all I’d like to be the first one to say I find the packaging completely degrading and the name. Seriously this looks like pr0n. Buxom Babes? Bikini clad chicks on the packaging? Who are we trying to sell this to anyway? I’m all for cute packaging but for some reason this deeply disturbs me. Could be because I’m in a bad mood! Sorry but I’ll have to expose you to my ranting about Bare Escentuals pricing again! As you may know from my previous posts I’m quite appalled at the prices of Bare Escentuals kits lately and this particular peeves me. No I don’t want 4 MINI glosses for $28 dollars thanks very much! Lipglosses that in fact suck formula wise anyway! Seriously, have you tried the original Buxom Lips? It stinks. Ok rant over. BE got my vote for NO on this particular kit. Love it? Hate it? Rave or Rant with the Muse! Comment box is open! Battling Dry Skin: Artistry Essentials Moisture Plus Review By Isabella Muse on April 11, 2008 3 Comments in Skincare Don’t ask me why I’m purchasing skincare products from Quixtar/Amway because I really won’t have an answer for you. The good news is even though this particular product I am about to review for you is possibly made by and disturbed by a subdivision of Amway it still really does work. Unreal right? Who would have thought skincare from Amway had the potential for greatness! Gasp! Anyway what am I going on about? I purchased a tiny bottle of Artistry Essentials Moisture Plus from Quixtar.com after reading a review about it on another blog (I’d give credit to that blogger but god knows where I read about it! Sorry ’bout that). The review raved about how great this was for refreshing dry skin and it couldn’t be more right! It’s pretty darn amazing at making my skin sigh in delight! What exactly is it? It’s a moisturizing oil that comes in a tiny bottle with a dropper. You simply take the dropper out and squeeze about 5-10 drops in your hand and pat this gently onto your face. I don’t actually pat. Sounds weird but I give myself a little bit of a facial massage with this rubbing it in nicely. The formula is pretty oily so if you’re skin is oily/combo stay AWAY! If you happen to suffer from dry patchy cheeks or dryness on your forehead this be for you! It virtually cleared up my the dry patchy problem on my cheeks and my forehead is no longer flaking up. Yay! I must warn you if you’re sensitive this may cause a breakout so beware prior to use. I started out with about 2 drops and I instantly experienced a little bit of a breakout but I gradually introduced my face to it and after a while my skin was loving the added moisture this gave to it. This advertises as a product you can use over makeup but they must have been delirious when they wrote that because unless you want to look like a beacher babe tanning with baby oil on Venice beach I’d say don’t attempt applying during the day over your makeup. I use this as PM treatment ONLY and would not attempt it during the day as a touch up nor as an AM treatment simply because it stays oily and wet a little bit before drying down. Unless you like going around with an oily face I’d avoid using it during your AM skincare regime. I’m not using this regularly but only when I feel my skin may need a bit of a pick up and feels a size or two tighter due to the cold weather. At the moment Spring is upon us and Summer to come shortly so I’m doubtful I’ll make much use of this but it’s an excellent treatment for the cold Winter weather months! I’ve been using about 10 drops or so a night after using my regular night cream and I’ve noticed that I wake up with a very beautiful, soft completion! This is .49oz in size and costs $19.50 USD. The price is a bit off for a size so small but the bottle should last a good long time since you need so very little of the product! All and all I’m enjoying this for the days my skin is whining about how it needs a bit more moisture to be on it’s best behavior! Writer’s Block By Isabella Muse on April 10, 2008 22 Comments in Miscellaneous Blogging , Pieces of Life Hey Guys! I’m a bit off my game this week as you may have noticed. I have a ton of new posts up my sleeve but I haven’t typed any of them out as I haven’t really had the will to do so. It’s been a bit of a crummy week to say the very least which could account for my lack of posts and my general “I’m not up for it” attitude. Do forgive me? I’ll be back in writing force soon! I did two new reviews for you though! See below. They aren’t my best but hopefully they’ll tide you over until I’m feel a bit more myself! Cheers! MAC Prep & Prime Review By Isabella Muse on April 10, 2008 46 Comments in MAC , Skincare I had to pick up some MAC lipsticks for a swap a few weeks ago and of course being the junkie I am I couldn’t leave the counter without getting at least one item for myself! What did I end up with? MAC Prep & Prime. Lately I’ve sorta been on the hunt for a good primer. I don’t normally prime prior to foundation aside from the regular toner and moisturizer regime. But after reading some rave reviews about various primers I decided I should incorporate the step into my makeup routine. What I read that turned me onto primers: They make your foundation last longer. They minimize the appearance of pores (I don’t have this problem as my pores are really tiny) but hey that didn’t stop me from wanting to buy a primer! They are a good base for your foundation and it applies easier and smoother when a primer is used. All this sounded like I seriously needed to start using a primer. The promise of long wearing foundation and foundation that applied easier and smoother sounded fantastic! Who else but MAC would have a great primer right? Well… Not really. I’ve been using Prep & Prime for about two weeks now and I seriously haven’t seen much of a difference in my foundation wear and tear. My foundation fails to last through the day sadly and I have to touch up at least twice with powder or a highlighting pen since I begin to look dull around the 4th hour or so of wear. Sadly, MAC Prep & Prime failed the test of making my foundation last longer. Did my foundation go on smoother? No. Not really. It felt about the same going on after using Prep & Prime. I’m not sure what I was expecting from it but I thought maybe it would give my face a sort of wet moisturizing feel that would allow my foundation to glide on flawlessly. This it did not do. The texture is pretty thick and if you look close enough it has tiny particles that pick up and reflect the light but that trick doesn’t apply when it’s on. At least for me it didn’t. Someone had mentioned on MUA that one pump will do it. Well no. I need at least two pumps to do my entire face. It glides on rather smooth and soft in contrast with it’s thick texture. It feels wonderful really however I don’t feel like it’s moisturizing my face but then again that’s not really what it’s supposed to do anyway. All in all it just doesn’t appear to work for me. It doesn’t make my foundation last longer and it doesn’t do a brilliant job of prepping my skin for foundation so basically it’s $22 USD of thick cream that doesn’t do much of anything. Sadly, as much as I love MAC, this one gets a big thumb down! Have you used it? Love it? Hate it? Any recs for a good primer?

"['Dior Addict High Shine Lipstick Review By Isabella Muse on April 15, 2008 13 Comments in Dior , Spring Collections 2008 , Swatches Dior has introduced a new edition to the family with it’s High Shine Lipstick. Dior makes a fine bit of cosmetic that the Muse both uses and collects however their lipstick line hasn’t been something I can say I’ve indulged in much. However, upon hearing about the Addict High Shine Lipstick I thought yes indeed this was very me! Visions of T’estimo lipstick and MAC Slimshines danced through my head and I was thinking how Dior probably created a beautifully moisturizing lipstick in an array of colors! I couldn’t wait to try it! Meh. They could have done a better job with this. I’m relieved I didn’t get crazy and purchase one of every color because it turns out it’s not all that great. The formula needs a bit of work as it advertises a high shine and gloss but I got neither from it. There isn’t much to say really it just feels like a regular old lipstick. I’m not going to lie and say I’m not shocked as I expect far better quality from Dior but this definately disappoints. Most of my disappointment stems from the promise of a beautiful glossy feel and lovely shine. I didn’t get either from this and I can’t help but feel ripped off. It just feels like the regular Dior lipstick. The color selection is vast and the packaging is simple yet pretty but sadly it’s a total bust for me. The Muse suggests saving your money and buying two MAC Slimshines instead as the price of one Dior Addict High Shine Lipstick is $25 USD which isn’t bad if it actually worked but sadly it’s a no go! Boo Dior! The Muse is saddened and disappointed!

Bath and Body Works Hello Sugar Shower Gel and Body Splash Review By Isabella Muse on April 14, 2008 8 Comments in Bath and Body Works , Fragrance , Shower & Bath , Spring Collections 2008 I needed serious retail therapy this weekend. Honestly, I did. I’ve been so upset the past week that my friend Jai decided I needed a day of shopping (as if either of us needs an excuse to shop). So away we went on Saturday afternoon. We stopped at Bath and Body Works not only because I had a thirst to sniff the new Hello Sugar! Collection but also because Jai has a thing with tanning and bronzers and all that crap so he had to peek at the new dial a tan thingy (or whatever it’s called) that BBW has out right now. According to him tan is sexy and his boyfriend think he looks amazing with a tan so I guess that means Jai has to do everything he can to get a sexy glow for his significant other. I say whatever floats your boat but I’ll be in the shade, under a palm tree, thanks very much! It wasn’t difficult to locate Hello Sugar! as it was right up front on a huge display. I was scared that if I picked one bottle up the rest would tumble all over the place since they had them stacked so high. And the verdict is in. The Muse is both delighted and disappointed with Hello Sugar! I picked up the Body Splash and the Three in One Shower Gel to start. First of all I should take note and mention that the Body Spray came in an ultra cute bottle with little faux rock candy dangling from the top. It’s a plastic bottle but it can easily pass for glass! I like it! Very cute and different for Bath and Body Works! I’m a disappointed because this smells nothing like I imagined. I was seeking something fruity with an underlay of sweet for the Summer. I associate sweet and fruity smells with Summer and adjust my fragrance wardrobe according to that. This is fruity but not so much sweet. Turns out this is more of a foody scent. It smells to me like lemon cake or lemon meringue pie. The sugar is there and the lemon is there but it’s somehow been combined with some sort of cake or baked good smell. That’s the bad news….however the good news is even though it’s disappointing that it isn’t fresh and fruity it is a delightfully beautiful scent! The sweet and sour scent of lemon combines wonderfully with the underlay of cake I’m getting and the entire smell transforms into a very light bakery scent. It’s so very difficult to describe but it’s as if I am smelling some sort of lemon tart or pastry. I’m not entirely sure I’m loving the idea of Hello Sugar! for the Summer but it’ll make a beautiful Fall scent or even Winter! Overall I like it. It’s very interesting and different for Bath and Body Works. I’m enjoying the fact that they have dipped their toes into something new and exciting and aren’t keeping with the normal scheme and theme of things! Cheers to Hello Sugar! The Muse enjoys veering off the well walked path on occasion! Hello Sugar! is available now from Bath and Body Works! $12 USD for the Three in One Shower Gel and $12.50 USD for the Body Splash.

"[""Givenchy Perfect Again! Corrector Palette Review By Isabella Muse on April 14, 2008 18 Comments in Givenchy , Spring Collections 2008 I know some folks have been awaiting me to do a post and review on Givenchy’s Spring Collection for this year and I honestly haven’t really been up for it. It failed to excite me this year and I guess that’s why it’s sorta been laying in boxes on my vanity for about 2 months or more now. I just can’t get excited about it as it was sadly such a disappointment. Am I the only one feeling like this could have been so much better? Don’t get me started on the Summer Collection which I’m equally hating by the very way! I apologize for failing to review it but I’ll get on it sooner or later. The good news is today I bring you a review on Givenchy’s Perfect Again! Corrector Palette! This review is a long time coming and I should have done it ages and ages and ages ago when I originally purchased the Spring Collection as this happened to be one of the items that I purchased with it! The was introduced this year with the Spring Collection and is a Limited Edition Palette sadly. I believe the retail cost was $38 USD? and well worth every penny might I add. I love it. When I want to go light for coverage this is what I reach for. If you have heavy duty dark circles or you’re concealing some major baggage this is not something you want to even bother with. However, if you skin behaves well and you like a very natural coverage without feeling heavily made up this is definately something you’ll need and want to have around. Givenchy would have you believe that this thing can cover everything and make you look like amazing. Not the case, sorry. It also happens to advertise it as a blemish, eye, and everything concealer. Again, not the case, or at least not for me. I happen to use this kit exclusively for my eyes and it works perfectly under that area thanks very much. I haven’t tried to remake my face over into perfection with this kit nor will I try because it seriously can’t do that in my humblest opinion however it does a super job of making my eyes happy. The palette contains two concealers. One light concealer and one darker shade which can be mixed or used separately. It also includes a smoother and a highlighter. The smoother is awesome. Sincerely super duper awesome. Givenchy says you can use this to cover up enlarged pores but I use it for smoothing under my eyes and filling in fine lines prior to mixing up the two concealers and applying under my eyes. This my friends gives me a beautiful very natural concealed coverage for my eyes. Perfect for days I’m going without heavy duty eye makeup and just making the rounds around town. Simply beautiful coverage. Truly. The smoother is awesome and if they made this in a single palette I’d buy a few to stock up because it’s just great. It’s white and has the feeling of a primer such as Clarin’s Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch but much lighter. I smooth it carefully under my eyes and it preps my eye area wonderfully for my concealer! My concealer ends up lasting longer and doesn’t cake or crease thanks to this little gem! Please Givenchy might we have a larger size of this amazing stuff?!! The concealers in the palette aren’t anything too exciting and some people might be turned off by the hard texture. They need a bit of warming up prior to use which I’m always a hater on but I will say that they work pretty nicely for when I want a very natural, light coverage. This is equally wonderful for someone who doesn’t have much to conceal or maybe doesn’t even use concealer to begin with! They go on feel almost powdery instead of creamy. Finally the highlighter which is a pinkish lilac color with a tiny bit of shimmer can be used for highlighting your highbrow or cheekbones. I must admit this color was used the least out of the four correctors in the palette. The palette is the typical Givenchy affair that has a tier flip which includes the cream correctors on one level and three brushes on the second level. Mmm….the applicators are somewhat useless to me. They included two sponge applicators with this which seem perfectly silly for using with the palette in my opinion. The third brush is a black sponge with a slanted tip. Ask me what the frack (can you tell I’ve been overdosing on BattleStar lately?) it is and I couldn’t tell you. I’m taking a guess and saying it’s to be used with the smoother cream? Hmmmm mystery unsolved. All in all the palette definately gets the Muse Seal of Approval for purchase however I strongly suggest not purchasing it you have lots to conceal. This will not help in anyway if you have terribly dark circles or baggage going on. I love it and say it’s definately worth checking out for yourself! I haven’t been this excited about a concealer in a long time and this is HG (Holy Grail) material for me! Have it? Love it? Tell me! Beauty on a Budget: Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Sparkling and Luminous Eyeshadow Review By Isabella Muse on April 14, 2008 12 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Swatches , Victoria's Secret Here’s an awesome Beauty on a Budget find for you! Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Sparkling and Luminous Loose Eyeshadows. I picked these up this weekend spontaneously while waiting in line at Victoria’s Secret. I see them ALL the time and Victoria’s Secret pimps them out big time. These things are in little buckets all over the store so seriously sooner or later you’re bound to pick up one or two even if you don’t want to which is just the case for me! I didn’t need, nor want these but somehow, someway they finally ended up in my cart. Shrugs. What can I say? I guess I got tired of seeing them all the time and never trying them! No idea why I bothered purchasing them but honestly I’m actually glad I did because they aren’t so bad! These are $7 USD each which is the most obscene price I ever heard of in my life as they are so tiny! $7? Come on! No way am I dishing out a near $10 bill for these little tiny eyeshadows! But I brought five of them which means I got ’em for $4 USD each! I like that price much better ? They are available at a single price of $7 or as a purchase of 5 for $20 which sounds much better. F0r some odd reason everyone and their mum decided that it was a good idea to be at Victoria’s Secret and the line was fracking out the door. So as I waited impatiently I was busy swatching every color of these shadows on my arm and decided I did indeed need one or two. As I said they are good. First of all they are very light and shimmering. If you love a “not so made up” look these are definately something you might want to consider purchasing. Pigmentation is not too bad and the color is buildable. The powders are light, shimmery, and have a nice bit of sparkle. They are advertised in two finishes one of which is a “high sparkle” finish while the other is a Luminous version. I honestly can’t tell the difference between the two as they both give a nice fair amount of sparkle. Colors range from a few bold colors like greens, purples, and teals to lighter shades like pink, beige, and white. I personally choose mostly light colors as I thought they would be great for Summer for a light makeup look. Not alot of product comes in the little jar but for the price I can’t complain too much. The applicator is awesome in my humble opinion! I wish that Urban Decay had such a great applicator on their new loose pigment shadows. It’s a dense, rounded sponge tip that fits very nice not only in the contour of my eye but right across the lid for easy application! The colors I got were: Glow Nude-A sparkling nude cream color Deja Blue-A deep blue green Goldblinger-A soft creamy gold Miami Ice-A sparkling white Twinkled Pink-A iridescent pink Glow Nude Deja Blue Goldblinger Miami Ice Twinkled Pink All in all these are pretty good quality for the price and the Muse likes them! If you favor a light, natural look or just want an easy, simple eyeshadow application these might be something to consider! Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Sparkling and Luminous Loose Eyeshadows should definately be able to fit into your Beauty Budget! Have these? Love ’em? Wanting to try them? Tell the Muse!

Canmake’s Summer Collection 2008 By Isabella Muse on April 11, 2008 14 Comments in Canmake , Japanese Brands , Summer Collections 2008 Canmake is a drugstore brand available in Japan that’s low in cost and high on the cute scale. I personally love many of the items they put out. Quality is pretty good and the price can’t be beat! And the selection of items is VAST! Canmake’s Summer Collection 2008 is now available on the website and should hit stores soon in Japan (or may already be in stores). It’s not a huge collection but the items released have a bit of an impact as they are new to the Canmake line. The first item that catches my eye straight away are the new eye palettes. This is the first time I’ve seen Canmake do an eye palette like this and it’s quite exciting! The palette is a quad of three shimmer shades (base shadow, eyelid shadow, and contrasting shade) and one liner. It’s a typical Japanese palette setup and has been done and redone but I still want them all! The color selections available are a rose, blue, and brown variation. The price is 680 yen and as the yen is so strong at the moment which is setting it at under the mark of $6.73 USD but for the sake of it you might as well say it evens out to the same cost. If you have access you might consider shopping in Taiwan at this point since it’s cheaper by at least $1 (or more if you’re lucky). The collection also includes four new nail varnish colors available for 300 yen each. These aren’t new just updated colors to the general catalog. It’s a tiny collection of goodies but I think the palettes make a big impact and I’m excited to try them out for myself! Want any of this? Love Canmake? Tell the Muse!

Shu Uemura Rouge Unlimited Crystal Shine Collection Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on April 11, 2008 22 Comments in Shu Uemura , Swatches Don’t you love Shu’s Rouge Unlimited Lipsticks? Pigmented, Amazing Formula, and Beautiful Packaging. I sincerely adore them. Shu’s taken the original Rouge Unlimited and amped it up a bit for the Spring/Summer. We now have Shu Rouge Unlimited Crystal Shine which is simply amazing! I tested out two of these and I’m dying to get my hands on a few more colors as they are truly great! It’s like having a lipstick and a gloss all in one stick. This is a glossy, slick, emollient formula that simply glides onto your lips leaving behind beautiful color and shine! I’m loving the simplicity of a single stick of gloss and lipcolor in one tube. The color is pigmented enough to act as a lipstick while also offering your lips a moisturizing glossy, shimmering effect that’s absolutely stunning. These are perfect for days you want a natural, glossy feel without feeling heavily made up with lipstick. WN254S and BG 950S The two colors I got are BG 950S which is a pretty shimmering beige and the second color was WN 254S which is a shimmering purple wine color but it looks very pink on! WN 254S BG 950S WN 254S BG 950S (Hey, [email protected] @K I’m wearing Visee’s Aqua Shining Eyes! Pretty Right? Click to read my review on Aqua Shining Eyes!) The only thing I can rant about is they only come in 17 Shades. We wants more please! And secondly can we please, please, please have names we can remember? B45644578ST is too difficult to remember! Each Rouge Unlimited Crystal Shine is $23 USD and well worth it as the quality is near perfection for me. I have at least 5 other colors on my wish list at the moment! Shu Uemura Rouge Unlimited Crystal Shine Collection is available now at Shu Uemura’s website! These are most definately Muse Approved! I love the texture, the shine, the glossy feel, and the beautiful color and effect of these! They are well worth purchasing at least one (although you’ll want more once you’ve tried ’em!).

"['MAC Prep & Prime Review By Isabella Muse on April 10, 2008 46 Comments in MAC , Skincare I had to pick up some MAC lipsticks for a swap a few weeks ago and of course being the junkie I am I couldn’t leave the counter without getting at least one item for myself! What did I end up with? MAC Prep & Prime. Lately I’ve sorta been on the hunt for a good primer. I don’t normally prime prior to foundation aside from the regular toner and moisturizer regime. But after reading some rave reviews about various primers I decided I should incorporate the step into my makeup routine. What I read that turned me onto primers: They make your foundation last longer. They minimize the appearance of pores (I don’t have this problem as my pores are really tiny) but hey that didn’t stop me from wanting to buy a primer! They are a good base for your foundation and it applies easier and smoother when a primer is used. All this sounded like I seriously needed to start using a primer. The promise of long wearing foundation and foundation that applied easier and smoother sounded fantastic! Who else but MAC would have a great primer right? Well… Not really. I’ve been using Prep & Prime for about two weeks now and I seriously haven’t seen much of a difference in my foundation wear and tear. My foundation fails to last through the day sadly and I have to touch up at least twice with powder or a highlighting pen since I begin to look dull around the 4th hour or so of wear. Sadly, MAC Prep & Prime failed the test of making my foundation last longer. Did my foundation go on smoother? No. Not really. It felt about the same going on after using Prep & Prime. I’m not sure what I was expecting from it but I thought maybe it would give my face a sort of wet moisturizing feel that would allow my foundation to glide on flawlessly. This it did not do. The texture is pretty thick and if you look close enough it has tiny particles that pick up and reflect the light but that trick doesn’t apply when it’s on. At least for me it didn’t. Someone had mentioned on MUA that one pump will do it. Well no. I need at least two pumps to do my entire face. It glides on rather smooth and soft in contrast with it’s thick texture. It feels wonderful really however I don’t feel like it’s moisturizing my face but then again that’s not really what it’s supposed to do anyway. All in all it just doesn’t appear to work for me. It doesn’t make my foundation last longer and it doesn’t do a brilliant job of prepping my skin for foundation so basically it’s $22 USD of thick cream that doesn’t do much of anything. Sadly, as much as I love MAC, this one gets a big thumb down! Have you used it? Love it? Hate it? Any recs for a good primer? Tell the Muse! You may also enjoy...

"['Battling Dry Skin: Artistry Essentials Moisture Plus Review By Isabella Muse on April 11, 2008 3 Comments in Skincare Don’t ask me why I’m purchasing skincare products from Quixtar/Amway because I really won’t have an answer for you. The good news is even though this particular product I am about to review for you is possibly made by and disturbed by a subdivision of Amway it still really does work. Unreal right? Who would have thought skincare from Amway had the potential for greatness! Gasp! Anyway what am I going on about? I purchased a tiny bottle of Artistry Essentials Moisture Plus from Quixtar.com after reading a review about it on another blog (I’d give credit to that blogger but god knows where I read about it! Sorry ’bout that). The review raved about how great this was for refreshing dry skin and it couldn’t be more right! It’s pretty darn amazing at making my skin sigh in delight! What exactly is it? It’s a moisturizing oil that comes in a tiny bottle with a dropper. You simply take the dropper out and squeeze about 5-10 drops in your hand and pat this gently onto your face. I don’t actually pat. Sounds weird but I give myself a little bit of a facial massage with this rubbing it in nicely. The formula is pretty oily so if you’re skin is oily/combo stay AWAY! If you happen to suffer from dry patchy cheeks or dryness on your forehead this be for you! It virtually cleared up my the dry patchy problem on my cheeks and my forehead is no longer flaking up. Yay! I must warn you if you’re sensitive this may cause a breakout so beware prior to use. I started out with about 2 drops and I instantly experienced a little bit of a breakout but I gradually introduced my face to it and after a while my skin was loving the added moisture this gave to it. This advertises as a product you can use over makeup but they must have been delirious when they wrote that because unless you want to look like a beacher babe tanning with baby oil on Venice beach I’d say don’t attempt applying during the day over your makeup. I use this as PM treatment ONLY and would not attempt it during the day as a touch up nor as an AM treatment simply because it stays oily and wet a little bit before drying down. Unless you like going around with an oily face I’d avoid using it during your AM skincare regime. I’m not using this regularly but only when I feel my skin may need a bit of a pick up and feels a size or two tighter due to the cold weather. At the moment Spring is upon us and Summer to come shortly so I’m doubtful I’ll make much use of this but it’s an excellent treatment for the cold Winter weather months! I’ve been using about 10 drops or so a night after using my regular night cream and I’ve noticed that I wake up with a very beautiful, soft completion! This is .49oz in size and costs $19.50 USD. The price is a bit off for a size so small but the bottle should last a good long time since you need so very little of the product! All and all I’m enjoying this for the days my skin is whining about how it needs a bit more moisture to be on it’s best behavior! You may also enjoy...

"['Mario Badescu Silver Powder By Isabella Muse on April 11, 2008 31 Comments in Skincare Silver Powder. What’s it do? Who’s it for? How do I use it? Sounds like something you might find in a jewelry showcase eh? My skin is fairly clear and I doesn’t really give me too much woe. I take super good care of it and that could be the reason that I’m not crying over it at night. I suffer from one main problem that I’ve had for years and nothing really helps it. Blackheads. On my nose. I don’t have a ton of blackheads but I have about two stubborn ones that won’t go anywhere. I’ve tried just about everything even having them professionally extracted only to have them pop back up over and over and over again! Nose strips. Don’t work. Various lotions and potions. Don’t work. Extracting them? Works temporarily but they pop back up like an ugly penny! They bug me really bad. I guess you can’t really see them unless you have a 10X zoom but I know they are there and for me that’s enough! I was busy blabbering about blackheads in my Biore PJ Party post a few weeks ago remember? And a lovely reader and friend, Gezebel , had suggested Silver Powder. Hmm….a solution maybe???? I rushed to Mario Badescu’s site to check this out! I happily ordered it as it’s only $12 bucks USD so what’s the harm right? I also crawled the internet for a coupon so I saved $1.80 USD with a coupon code I found! YAY me! I got this super fast. Within a day it was on my door step! Go Mario Go! Props for awesome shipping time. More props for the awesome freebies my box came with. They included a mini slew of all sorts of skincare wonder that I’ve never tried. I got a Cucumber Tonic Mask, some Enzyme Cleaning Gel, Moisturizer, Cucumber Cleansing Oil and some Eye Cream! Wahooooo for freebies! The Muse likey samples! Anyway about that Silver Powder I mentioned…. Well. The verdict is in and I like it. It didn’t work the 1st time or the 2nd time for that matter. It was however successful at turning my nose a strange pale white color temporarily. However, that 1st and 2nd use did “fade” the blackheads. I know weird but the effect was interesting. I really had to look to see them. So I went from viewing them in my 10X mirror to hauling out the big guns and peering at them with my 12X! Yup sadly those two evil suckers were deeply embedded in my nose. But I wasn’t giving up! Last night I attempted a 3rd run with Silver Powder. It deserves to be mentioned that several people around the internetz mentioned that using silver powder and proceeding to use a nose strip seemed to pick up more blackheads and that’s what I did the first two times without too much success! However, this third run I just applied, waited 10 minutes, and washed off with a wash cloth. And….mmm..pretty successfully this time around! My nose is looking pretty darn good. I do see a tiny bit of one blackhead that’s sorting hanging on but I think I can successfully wash him away with a final run of Silver Powder! So how do you use Silver Powder anyway? Basically Silver Powder is just a white loose powder sorry to disappoint but no silver here. Basically you take a dampened cotton ball and dab it into the loose powder. You proceed to take the cotton ball with the now damp Silver Powder and pat it on your nose (I rubbed it a bit as well). This creates a bit of a mask over your nose (or if you prefer you can of course use it on any clogged pores you have on your face! I only have blackheads on my nose so that’s where I used it!). You live this on for 10 minutes and wash with cold water after the time is up! Some folk like to use a nose strip afterwards as I mentioned above and that works very well but I found just washing it off works just as well! The verdict? The Muse Approves of Mario Badescu Silver Powder! It takes a bit of elbow grease but with a little patience you can happily kiss your Blackheads goodbye plus it’s $12 bucks for a HUGE supply! This stuff will last you a year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cheers to that! You may also enjoy... Clinique Pop Laquer Lip Colour + Primer Review & Swatches What is Micellar Water?

"['Beauty on a Budget: NYX Mosaic Powder Review By Isabella Muse on April 10, 2008 12 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , NYX Yay for the Muse jumping back on board the Beauty on a Budget bandwagon! This time I’m raving about NYX (kinda, sorta, maybe!). Since it’s Summer it appears that NYX is busy pimping some of their older line up. Which basically means they have cute little pop up displays all over the place that have separate collections of makeup they are whorin’ out to the masses. I’ve run across two displays like this so far. One was the glitter eyeliners and the second was the Mosiac Powders. Both items are old news and nothing really new about ’em but NYX just revamped the display I guess to catch new buyer eyes. They caught my eye recently when I was at Harmon’s drugstore picking some items up for my lovely friend Aya at Irodori. These particular blush powders from NYX looked outstanding so I thought I might as well grab ’em while the grabbing was good. They only cost $5.99 USD so really I couldn’t go bankrupt buying these. Many months ago NYX had contacted me with a discount to do a review on their products and honestly I never got around to actually purchasing anything or doing the review for that matter! Damn the Muse to hell for not getting around to doing these important things! The powders are gorgeous. The packaging is simple yet elegant and quite reminds me of MAC. Why I never purchased NYX prior to this can only be blamed on my snotty nature when it comes to cosmetics. I purchased two colors but there are quite a few color selections available that range from lighter to darker. I got the Pinkish Red and the Orange color. I don’t particularly love either one sadly. The pink goes on way to red and the orange makes my face look very dull. The powder formula is good. Silky, blends well, and lasts long however I think the color combinations are just not working well for me. I’m normally a very big fan of vibrant shades but neither color seems to suit me. The orange color seems way too orange! And the pink color seems to just not pick up enough of the lighter shades in the palette and it grabs up more of the red which causes me to look like a clown! Ugh! Awwww moan! I really wanted to love these! I’m going to keep trying with the pink powder but the orange after swatching is a big no! I think the main problem with these is that fact that they contain five separate shades of color which could be a little too much. I guess it’s a form of graduation but it just doesn’t work so well. When I applied the pink the color went on splotchy and my brush was picking up more of the vibrant red and not mixing correctly with the lighter shades in the powder. I can’t give these too poor a rating simply because they are very pigmented blushes and good quality! However, I just didn’t like them and they didn’t work well for me. Yes, they are nicely pigmented. Yes, the price is more than alright. But they don’t exactly do what I want them too! NYX Mosaic Powders get a big thumbs down from the Muse! Love these? Hate ’em? Tell the Muse! NeoCeuticals Problem Dry Skin Gel Review By Isabella Muse on April 9, 2008 8 Comments in Skincare Tis still a bit Wintery outside my window but Spring is slowly making it’s way across the board! Come the Winter my skin suffers in a major way! Dry, itchy skin on my elbows, knees, and legs! Ugh I hate it so, so much! I’ve tried so many moisturizers to relieve it but nothing really works! I find that my dry skin worsens since I shower twice daily and the hard water in New York rough houses my skin and makes it all chalky and yuck! Which also means I am moisturizing double duty! I was lucky enough to test out some NeoCeutical Dry Skin Gel the past two weeks or so and I must say I’m quite liking it. It’s an interesting little product. It’s basically a cooling gel that softens my rough, dry skin. The tube itself promises to hydrate and exfoliate. The exfloliate part confuses me but it does soften my skin beautifully! The product is slightly sticky and there is a dry down period so don’t expect to slip right into your clothes after using this on say your legs! I found it takes a few minutes to fully sink in and go from wet to dry! I’ve been using it for about 14 days now and I actually did notice that the skin my elbows is much smoother and less rough then when I use my normal moisturizer! This retails for $24 USD for a 4oz tube. The price does slightly make me cringe however you only need a small amount so I see it lasting me for a good few months! This is available now from Ulta.com or Neostrata. If you suffer from the Dry Skin blues in the Winter (or anytime) this might be something you want to check out!

I could be wrong but maybe this new line will be replacing the regular Temptation Collection that we’ve been seeing for the past few years! The new collection is entitled Hello Sugar! and looks very promising. I’m hoping that this smells like a sweetened, fruity, sour combination of lemon and sugar but I’m fearful this will be some sort of Fresh Lemon Sugar dupe (not that I don’t love Fresh Lemon but something different would be lovely) I’m very much in favor of the fruity, sweet version please! The collection includes a three in one shower gel, a body spray, a shimmer body lotion, a body meringue, and a lipgloss. It’s only available in the Hello Sugar! fragrance but I’m hopeful they’ll extend the line to include other scents! I love the Tempation line but I don’t mind seeing something new like this pop up either! Wanna try it? Tell the Muse!

Fasio Glitter Shower Eyes By Isabella Muse on April 8, 2008 8 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Fasio , Japanese Brands Last week I was discussing Fasio with a reader and wanted to do a really brief entry about it. The reason I’m bringing this up is because I wanted to show the Fasio Shower Glitter Eye Palettes off a bit. I don’t personally own them and from what I understand they aren’t so fabulous but they do appear quite interesting and I think I may pick up one or two just for the sake of trying them out for myself. Fasio is a sub-brand of Kose and probably my least favorite brand that Kose puts out. I’m not entirely a fan of the mascara even though it has a cult base of followers that really adore it. I personally find the mascara has way too many fibers and I’m not a lover of fiber mascaras! Anyway this post can veer to the entire line and I want to simply show off the Glitter Shower Eyes that are available from Kose. And here we go: Available Color Selections: As you can see the palette is a typical affair of liner, base, and two contrasting shades of eyeshadow. I’m dead curious about these! Anyone try ’em?

If you think makeup is my passion you’d be wrong. I’m more of a geek than a makeup lover. I go to Sci/Fi Conventions, Computer Conventions, I’m a trekkie type. I enjoy anything and everything that has to do with the geeky world of science and computers. 5. I am not a makeup artist, I do not work in the makeup or fashion industry, and I do not possess a pro card. I can’t tell you how many times I get asked that ? 6. I have one older sister whom I get on with famously. We are not only sisters but the best of friends as well. She’s actually 12 years older then me but it never feels that way! We are always like two little kids, giggling constantly, etc…! That’s it. And it was kinda hard trying to figure out six things you may not already know about me! My comment box is open!

"['When Beauty on a Budget, Goes WRONG!: Prestige Skin Loving Minerals Review By Isabella Muse on April 8, 2008 21 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Prestige Prestige Cosmetics is a low end makeup that’s available in a few drugstores stateside. You may or may not be privy to this line of cosmetics. Recently while purchasing my Milani Wet/Dry Eyeshadow haul I came across the Prestige Skin Loving Minerals display. The display had quads of eyeshadows and a few blushes. I think I was blindsided by all the pretty swirls in the blush because I ended up purchasing one. The packaging was nice enough. The blush came in a pretty simple yet nice clear compact. The cost was pretty nice as well at $6.49 USD. And the blush appeared to be pigmented enough! The bright beautiful pink with swirls of gold really got me excited. But that’s about all the pros of the product because quality is absolute garbage. I can’t believe it’s legal to sell trash like this. The blush is not pigmented at all! It’s silky enough but when you apply it basically appears as if you are using a translucent powder or something! You get NO color at all from the blush! This is when Beauty on a Budget goes terribly wrong! I seriously can’t help but whine that I lost $6.49 plus tax on such a trashy product! Total rant but seriously it was like flushing money down the toilet! Grrr! See? Now you know why I stay away from drugstore cosmetics! A fair warning if you walk into your local drugstore and are wow’ed by the gorgeous display of Prestige Skin Loving Minerals! Don’t buy! Keep away! They may look pretty but they seriously are not worth your hard earned cash! The Muse says don’t buy these! You may also enjoy...

If you’re outside of New York and within the US call the following number: 212-334-4641 to place your order!

"['Fasio Glitter Shower Eyes By Isabella Muse on April 8, 2008 8 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Fasio , Japanese Brands Last week I was discussing Fasio with a reader and wanted to do a really brief entry about it. The reason I’m bringing this up is because I wanted to show the Fasio Shower Glitter Eye Palettes off a bit. I don’t personally own them and from what I understand they aren’t so fabulous but they do appear quite interesting and I think I may pick up one or two just for the sake of trying them out for myself. Fasio is a sub-brand of Kose and probably my least favorite brand that Kose puts out. I’m not entirely a fan of the mascara even though it has a cult base of followers that really adore it. I personally find the mascara has way too many fibers and I’m not a lover of fiber mascaras! Anyway this post can veer to the entire line and I want to simply show off the Glitter Shower Eyes that are available from Kose. And here we go: Available Color Selections: As you can see the palette is a typical affair of liner, base, and two contrasting shades of eyeshadow. I’m dead curious about these! Anyone try ’em?

"['A Guide to Shopping for Japanese Cosmetics By Isabella Muse on April 22, 2008 47 Comments in Japanese Brands , Online Shopping , Tutorials I get a crumb load of questions asking me how to shop for Japanese Cosmetics. Where can I buy Japanese Cosmetics? How much do they cost? Any online shops I can buy them from? Where do you get your Japanese Cosmetics? I was going to do this post a very long time ago but I just never really had the chance and it was long forgotten on the bottom of my draft pile of blog entries that never got posted! I’ve tweaked it a bit and rewrote most of it so here it is in all it’s glory! First of all many Japanese brands are unavailable within the US, UK, and Europe in general. I’ve discussed a few various brands available in a few countries such as Korea, Japan, etc…this particular post will be a guide for purchasing Japanese Cosmetics but in a future post I may cover a few other countries. If you’re purchasing Japanese Cosmetics online you’ll have to educate yourself a bit on prices and also arm yourself with a few tools. My first suggestion is install a Chinese and Japanese Language Pack for your browser so you can view various Japanese Websites and get prices on various items prior to purchasing. Downloading and installing these packs will also unable you to copy the text and paste it into a translation tool which helps when trying to figure out what is going on at certain sites. Click here to download the Japanese Language Pack Click here to download the Chinese Language Pack Note: For viewing Taiwanese, Hong Kong, and a few select Chinese sites you may need to install the Traditional Chinese Language Pack as these countries, cultures, and regions use a traditional, more complex form of character than other sites. I’ve actually found that it doesn’t matter too much which Language Pack you choose however I have all three installed as I find it does make it a tiny bit easier during the tedious translation process! The reason I recommend this is because most online shops charge anywhere from $5 USD all the way up to $12 USD on top of retail prices. Prices are a good deal higher online then if you happened into a drugstore in Japan and purchased the item yourself! I almost always pay retail for my Japanese Cosmetics because I have some sincerely beautiful, wonderful friends that live in Japan and do shopping for me. However, on occasion, I am forced to buy items online. In cases like this I want to be sure that I am getting the best deal possible so I do alot of homework prior to purchasing items. You should also keep in mind that many drugstores in Japan discount various items 25-30% which means the retail prices online do not reflect the discount. Example: T’estimo Palettes are shown on the Kanebo website at the price of $30 USD or so however upon purchasing one in a drugstore in Japan the actually cost would be $20 USD or so due to the drugstore discount. This means it’s an open market for online sellers to charge you $30 and upwards for a palette they paid $20 USD or so for. Currently, the Yen is very, very strong so you might want to Google around a bit and see if you can locate any Taiwanese shops that sell Japanese Cosmetics as the cost is a bit lower. I highly recommend JPmon which is located within Taiwan. I’ve done a “how to order” from JPMon on another tutorial page you can find that article by clicking here and here. You’ll be happy to know that the prices measure up pretty nicely with what you’d see on Japanese sites however not the discount you’d get within a Japanese drugstore as mentioned above! I’ve ordered from JPmon many, many times and I’ve always been very pleased with their services so I highly recommend purchasing from them! If you have a few online friends or friends in general into cosmetics doing a bit of “spree” with friends can cut shipping costs and each of you can split the total cost of shipping which always helps! Another important tool you’ll need is a currency convertor. This is especially helpful for converting Yen to your currency of choice. This is good tool to have when you’re browsing various Japanese websites and looking at prices to see what the original cost of an item is versus what the online shop you’re buying from is charging. I use XE for conversions. It’s not the best convertor in the world but it does an ok job and is off a few cents at most. Click here to bookmark XE. Finally the last tool you’ll need is a translator. This is especially helpful for figuring out what certain items are for, what the details are for an item, etc… Babel Fish does an ok job with translations but definately not word for word as the language is so complex that “literally” translating it into English (or your language of choice) doesn’t always mean you’ll understand exactly what is going on! Click here to bookmark Babel Fish. Babel Fish is especially useful as it translates both simplified and traditional Chinese plus Japanese as well! I don’t use Babel Fish as much as I do a simple add on for Firefox entitled Translator. It works a treat and makes translating full websites a snap! You can download this extension by clicking here ! Not many shops online sell Japanese Cosmetics but there are a few that I’ve used in the past and have had great experiences and success with! Those sites are, as follows: www.adambeauty.com www.bobodave.com www.facial-shop.com www.ichibankao.com www.jpmon.com www.gooddealer.com sh1.yahoo.edyna.com/hijapan (I’m sorry but I do not have a tutorial for ordering from Hi Japan but maybe I’ll do one in the future!) The best possible prices are located at Adam Beauty and JPMon in my humble opinion and Facial Shop also has some incredible deals as well! Other places you might see Japanese Cosmetics from would be E-bay. E-bay has many sellers that sell various Japanese Cosmetics. I find asking for a deal on shipping, asking for lower prices, etc..sometimes works with E-bay sellers. Remember to be courtesy when asking and reasonable. If something is marked as $39.99 USD and they want $9.99 shipping don’t go and ask them to give it to you for $20 with Free Shipping. I think you understand my point? I also find that dealing with the same E-bay Seller over and over again makes the chances of scoring a deal from them easier! Please keep in mind prior to purchasing cosmetics that freshness is important! I find in some cases some online shops do sell older items. This is particular true of BoboDave on occasion and Hi Japan. The good thing about this is that some items, such as LE, are still available from these shops but the bad thing is the product is older. Keep that in mind prior to making your purchase! This is one reason I do not shop at Strawberry.net. Items are awfully old and beyond shelf date! Below is a list of links for various Japanese Brands that I adore (I’m sure I left a few out!): Sofina Visee RMK Opera Majolica Majorca (Also the portal to Shiseido Japan) Maquillage Lunasol Lavshuca LoveClover KATE Kanebo (Main portal site which includes listings for Lavshuca, KATE, Tiffa, Lunasol, Etc…) Canmake Aube Gransenbon Jill Stuart KISS Cosmetics Esprique Precious T’estimo (Gone but not Forgotten) Excel Susie N.Y. Sana (Main Portal Site) I think I pretty much covered everything you need to know about ordering Japanese Cosmetics. If you need any help do comment and I’ll happily help in anyway I can! Good Luck and Happy Shopping! Beauty Secrets: Whitening Your Skin, How To Rid Yourself of Dark Circles, and Other Babblings By Isabella Muse on April 22, 2008 62 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Beauty Secrets Great title right? Whiten your skin? Sounds very strange! You may have read on a few occasions where I mentioned that I use a “secret” whitening agent on my skin prior to foundation. This is in fact a post about what I use to achieve not only a flawless completion but also how I take the shade of my skin down a notch or two or three if I so desire (I normally try to lighten it one shade down as I believe it makes me appear fresher). Those of you from the western side of the world may find this a strange technique and those of you from the eastern side of the world may very well relate to wanting your skin a shade or two lighter then what it already is. But Muse why do you want your skin tone lighter? The Muse does not embrace the idea of being tan or bronze. For myself personally I don’t like my skin as it is. It’s a medium fair and to me it appears very dull. This is not to say that darker skin types aren’t beautiful because they are very gorgeous! The problem is that I don’t like the way I look in a shade of medium. My skin somehow lacks the flawlessness I seek in it’s current state. My sister favors my dad and is a deeper tan color and she works it well but my own skin tone feels dull to me. So what do I do? I take it down a notch or two and make it whiter (or paler whichever way you want to say it!). I think whitening it gives me not only a fresher look but also a good working canvas for my makeup. Colors seem to be brighter on my face, my foundation seems to work better, and I just appear younger and more flawless looking when I take the extra step to whiten my skin. Think of the beautiful Geisha and maiko and the utter elegance of their makeup. Granted we don’t want to appear that white but the beauty of the Geisha’s flawless face can’t be denied. I think Asian woman on a whole are always looking for that extra step to whiten their skin a notch or two which could account for how popular whitening fluids, foundations, etc…are within Japan, China, Etc…. Most of these products do not technically whiten the skin but just offer a bit of shimmer or what I call a candlelight glow. I can’t count how many items are available for purchase that have “whitening” in the title outside of the US. From creams to foundations and powders! And yes the Muse has tried and used them all! The idea and popularity of a pale complexion within the Asian culture is pretty common and woman go to extreme lengths to keep their skin pale. I admit that I do much the same. I am utterly obsessed with staying out of the sun. I look terrible tan. Absolutely terrible. And I go to the extreme myself to keep my skin as pale as humanly possible. I guess I’m babbling a bit here and you’re about ready to hear what I use to whiten my skin. I don’t normally share my secrets but since the Muse loves you so much she’ll tell you exactly how to take your skin tone down a few notches. Since starting Musings and mentioning my “whitening agent” I get at least an e-mail a day asking about it. I know of at least six readers that actually went out and purchased the item that I am about to show you and have had good to great success using it (I hope they’ll comment and let us know how they are doing with it!). Lilac Base. Huh? What’s dat? If you can find a cream base of lilac you can easily take your skin tone down a notch. Blended correctly it’ll look flawless and very natural. I’ve been using the same Lilac Base for Mmmmm about 12 years or so? Maybe a bit more. This may come as a shock but the Lilac cream base I use is from Signature Club A. Those of you here in the US are probably familiar with the line. It’s sold via HSN. The entire collection is pretty much geared towards the mature lady and truly most of the items sold are utter crap but the lilac cream base is freaking outstanding. A really, really long time ago a friend of my mother’s had seen how into cosmetics I was and she had purchased me a kit from Signature Club A. Granted it was super nice of her to do so but at the time I couldn’t help thinking, “what the hell am I going to do with this garbage?” Turns out she did me a rather awesome favor because inside the kit was a color wheel palette which included several face primers ranging from beige, pale blue, lilac, pink, peach, and yellow. I ended up using three of the colors religiously in my everyday routine and to this day I still use them and repurchase them again and again and again. Which colors and how do I use them? Lilac: Used as a pre-foundation base for lightening my skin. Light Blue: Used under my eyes prior to concealer to diminish dark circles COMPLETELY and brighten my eye area 100%! Yellow: Used under my eyes and sometimes on my face to calm any red spots. The lowdown on Lilac: You have to be very, very, very, very careful when using this cream. It’s very pigmented and it reminds me of clown makeup. It’s referred to in some reviews as stage makeup which is very correct. It’s very emollient so it’s great for anyone with dry skin. The potential for clogging your pores with this is a reality so to prevent that be sure to wash your face throughly after use. If you’re prone to acne or your face is suffering from break outs now I’d avoid it as this could potentially make it worst. Is it breathable? Yes. It feels very natural on and it doesn’t feel like you’re wearing a mask of makeup. Lilac Cream Base This is not for using as a foundation. This is not for using on it’s own. This is not for using all over your face. You can’t wear this alone because you’ll look like a ghost. This is most effective when used in conjunction with your normal foundation. You can’t use this all over your face. It’ll make you look awful. The best way to use this is prep and prime with your toner, moisturizer, and primer of choice. Apply the Lilac onto the sides of your nose and slowly blend it outwards. Apply to the sides of your mouth and above your lip area and blend. These are places that shadow on my skin so they are the areas I concentrate on brightening up. Use a little touch of the product to begin and slowly build it up but don’t go overboard. Now apply your foundation and concealer and you’re done. Flawless and ready for your main point makeup! The basics of Blue: Light blue as a concealer could never work could it? Yes, it works perfectly. Tricia Sawyer knows that but failed to come out with a good enough product to perform the job. Signature Club A’s version of the failed Tricia Sawyer Eye Slept is entitled Anchorwoman Blue. It’s been around a whole lot longer than Tricia Sawyer’s version. I’ve been using this for ages and I’ve never found a better product for totally vanishing my dark circles. This is a light baby blue color and I apply it prior to concealer. You can use it alone if you prefer but be sure to blend properly and not to go overboard. It’s easy enough to apply. A few dots, a pat of your fingertip, and you’re done. I normally apply a concealer on top as it gives a more natural look for me. It does wonders for Dark Circles. I swear to you that it will erase any dark circles you may have. The Muse promises this product will change your life. Honest to god. I’ve been using it for over ten years for that reason! What’s Yellow do? The final product I use is a Yellow Cream Base from Signature Club A and this basically conceals redness, blemishes, and other imperfections. I use this mostly as a prep for my upper eye area as it preps my eye area for shadow prior to applying my Primer Potion. I normally use Benefit Lemon Aid but I do reach for for this during the breakout days! All these colors used to be included in a color wheel palette and I’m actually relieved they now sell them individually for a very inexpensive price of $14.50 USD each. You get a brush and a pot of the concealer color of your choice plus shipping which to me is a deal and a half. Strangely enough this post was inspired by the fact that I am running low on all three colors so I had re-order and decided to go ahead and do a post about it! Happily the concealers are now only available in beige, yellow, lilac, and blue where in they used to be combined in a palette with pink and peach as well. I never really used the beige, pink, or the peach so it’s nice that I can now buy the colors I need instead of being forced into buying a palette for a few colors (not that I mind as I’d kill for any of the three colors I mentioned to you). So that’s all folks. My article on how to take your skin tone down a notch, how to rid yourself of dark, icky circles, and how I achieve “false” flawlessness! What are your Beauty Secrets?

The New Atomic Luau Lounge oils are being removed on the 23rd of April so now might be a good time to place an order! It’s rare BPAL does blends like this which are fruity in nature so if you’re seeking a beautifully fruity, summery blend you might want to check these out! I ordered the entire Bar series which included: Blue Fire: A papaya, blueberry, lemongrass, and gin blend! Golden Wave: A tangerine, gin, passion fruit, guava, and tonic blend! Rangoon Riptide: A pineapple, mandarin orange, raspberry, passion fruit and rum blend! Screeching Parrot: A rum, apricot, pineapple, pink lime, and ginger blend! Te Po: A Jamaican Rum, almond, orange, sugar, lime, mint, black cherry blend! Upa Upa: A rum, coconut, pineapple, vanilla blend! They all sound quite yummie and I’m eagerly awaiting their arrival! The Collection ends on April 23rd as I mentioned above so you might want to wander on and grab a few or all! I also ordered several sets from the Stardust series as I haven’t had a chance to try out two of the blends from the collection which are Fairy Wine and Fairy Market. Eager for those two to complete my collection! Anyway a little BPAL babblings for those of you that adore the Lab as much as I do! Clueless about BPAL?

MAC DressCamp First Impressions By Isabella Muse on April 21, 2008 26 Comments in First Impressions , MAC , Swatches I got my MAC DressCamp over the weekend but was too busy to play with it or use any of it! However, I thought I’d post pictures and just a general first impressions of the items for you guys! The Collection is very, very nice! As you probably know from my past posts it sold out rather quickly but I was lucky enough to nab it all! My favorite in the lot was of course the gorgeous palette and the lipglass in She-Gold. I wasn’t loving the lippie in Too Fab or the lipglass in Fashion but I got them anyway since I’m such an addict! The palette is perfection in my personal opinion! The blush is a beautiful bright pink with just the faintest touch of gold shimmer. Strangely enough the blush is actually labeled by MAC as being a Beauty Powder. It appears pigmented enough to work as a blusher but I haven’t yet tried it on so I’m not entirely sure! From swatching I can tell it was nicely pigmented and had a nice bit of shimmer to it! The shadows compliment each other brilliantly as well and it should be easy enough to create a perfect look with all three! I think the gold in this palette quite reminds me of Golden Lemon Pigment. It’s a very true yellow gold and has a beautiful shimmer to it! The other two shades are pretty as well but I think the gold stands out from the rest! Fashion Lipglass and Too Fab Lipstick are virtually the same color which is perfectly fine if you want to add a bit of a glossy top coat to your lipstick. I’m not completely sold on the color as it’s a very loud bubblegum pink that doesn’t particularly suit my skin tone. She-Gold Lipglass is brilliant! I don’t own any gold lipglosses and this will be a perfect addition to my collection as a topcoat for peaches, corals, or even pink lipsticks! It has quite a bit of shimmery gold to it and it compliments the colors of the palette brilliantly! I took a few swatches of the palette, lipglasses, and lipstick but they came out a bit crummy! Sorry I’m still learning good swatch technique! From Left to Right: Fashion Lipglass, She-Gold Lipglass, and Too Fab Lipstick MAC DressCamp Palette Swatches From Left to Right: MAC DressCamp Palette Swatches and MAC DressCamp Lipglass and Lipstick Swatches With Flash Without Flash The Collection is truly unique and very pretty! I’m eager to try them on! FOTD to follow shortly! Were you lucky enough to nab MAC DressCamp? Love it? Want it? Tell the Muse! Lavshuca Summer Collection 2008 By Isabella Muse on April 21, 2008 23 Comments in Japanese Brands , Lavshuca , Summer Collections 2008 Lavshuca has updated it’s website with the Summer Collection! It appears this Summer they are releasing two new palettes similar in style to the Holiday Palettes however these appear far better quality. Each palette seems to hold six eyeshadow shades. These come in two variations a cooler version which include blues, silvers, and greens and a warmer version which include golds, browns, and beiges. Both look simply gorgeous. Although I am missing the normal style of palettes released from Lavshuca I’m really not minding these at all! They are most definately in my cart for purchase when they are released! The Holiday Palettes were made of cardboard and these appear to be made of either plastic or metal (I’d say plastic) which is nice as I found the Holiday Palettes a bit delicate! I’m unsure of the price at this point as Kanebo has not yet updated the catalog with the info but as soon as I know I’ll pass it on to you! I can’t wait to get my hands on these! These are simply beautiful and I’m positive if you’re a Lavshuca fan you’ll want them as much as me! Want ’em? Love ’em? Tell the Muse!

"['Kesalan Patharan Summer Collection 2008: Summer Art Gradation By Isabella Muse on April 29, 2008 9 Comments in Japanese Brands , Kesalan Patharan , Summer Collections 2008 A very tiny Early Summer Collection from Kesalan Patharan includes three new eyeshadow trios for 2,625 yen each. Each trio contains three coordinating gradation colors for eyes or face if you so choose. This is a bit boring for me as Kesalan Patharan has plenty of trios available within the general catalog the only difference being these have a beautiful floral embed. As the price stands I think I can safely skip these. How about you? Love ’em? Need ’em? Tell the Muse! MAC DressCamp FOTD’s By Isabella Muse on April 29, 2008 21 Comments in Face of the Day Hey guys! Good morning, Good Day, Happy Tuesday! I’ve a bit behind on comments, e-mails, and posts for the past few weeks. Forgive me? As requested here are a few looks I created using my MAC DressCamp haul! The palette is pure gold for me as I got at least six looks out of that one tiny palette! Sorry for the picture overload but I really wanted to show you how many cool looks you can get out of the palette and maybe give you some ideas on how to use yours! Here I used Golden Gold Eyeshadow in the crease and Sunny Girl on the lid of my eye. I have She-Gold on my lips under that is a simple lip stain I used. In this look I used the entire palette. I have Trend as a highbrow highlighter, Sunny Girl in the inner corner of my eye, DressCamp Pink Beauty Powder in the middle of my eye, and Golden Gold in the outer v. Too Fab on my lips with Fashion Lipglass on top! I also used the pink beauty powder on my face in this FOTD. This was a very simple look I created using Golden Gold on the outer eye and Sunny Girl on the inner eye and just quickly blending the harsh lines so the colors appear to ease into each other if that makes sense! Again I stained my lips prior to applying She Gold Lipglass! This is my least favorite look of the bunch and I believe it would have come out better if I had used the pink beauty powder on the outer corner of my eyes instead of the bottom lash line! This was simply created by applying Sunny Girl all over my lid and lining my bottom lash line with the pink beauty powder. She Gold again on my lips and stain under it. Pink Beauty Powder on my cheeks with a dash of Joyous Beauty Powder Blush under that! As you can see with a little creativity you can create some truly gorgeous looks with the one palette! I really love this palette and I’m looking forward to using it for some awesome Summer looks! Have the palette? Love it? Tell the Muse!

Last year the Collection was quite lovely as well but I must say almost all of the items released this year are on my wish list! One item in particular that has caught my eye is the new Stila Summer Eyeshadow Palette. Although all the images I’ve seen of it so far are dull I can attest to the fact it is a gorgeous palette as I’ve seen and swatched it in person at Sephora! It’s perfect for Summer wear as it has that beautiful shimmery metallic feel with colors that compliment dewy tanned skin or in the Muse’s case fresh, healthy pale skin! The palette contains six colors and is available for sale now for $40 USD. Another item that caught my eye is the new Kitten Silk Eyeshadow Wash. Even though I am not a fan of cream shadows this intrigues me and has been added to my Wish List. I haven’t yet played with it which makes me wary of an online purchase but it does look promising as Kitten Eyeshadow is such a universally beautiful shadow that compliments any skin tone! Stila’s Kitten Silk Eyeshadow Wash is available now for $22 USD. And finally last but not least is Stila Silk Gloss in Kitten to compliment the eye wash. I’m not sure about this but I will admit to possibly wanting to try it out! All items are available now from both Sephora and Stila directly! Stila has 25% off at the moment with Free Shipping using code STILACANDY which means you can get all three items for $63 USD not bad right? I’m tempted to say the least but I want to wait until I have a chance to swatch both the gloss and the eye wash! The sale is ongoing until May 13th so I have plenty of time to decide! Want these? Have ’em already? Love ’em? Tell the Muse!']",2faab224be5b58bd0aa9aa09f963ce8f5bab969e,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4141,
"['Bare Escentuals Genuine Jade Beauty Duo By Isabella Muse on April 28, 2008 14 Comments in Bare Escentuals , Spring Collections 2008 Bare Escentuals has a new all over face and body powder available for Spring entitled Genuine Jade. This is the 3rd in a series of Body/Face Shimmers they have created lately. I happen to own the first one they created which was the Rose Gossamer Powder. These are actually pretty good however the Jade isn’t particular catching my fancy after I swatched it at Sephora. It’s a golden powder with deep touches of off green. To me it’s not particularly flattering for the face or the body! The price is not really catching my eye either at $39 USD I believe I purchased the original Rose Powder for $28 USD (same kit, size, with the brush!). As you’ve heard me rant in previous posts BE lately has been quite nutty with the price jacks! I think I can safely skip the Genuine Jade Powder and spend my $39 on something else! If you’re wanting this it’s available now from Sephora, Click! Love it? Hate it? Tell the Muse! Dior Summer Cosmetics Collection 2008: Dior Addict Ultra Gloss Reflect By Isabella Muse on April 25, 2008 32 Comments in Dior , First Impressions , Summer Collections 2008 , Swatches Dior’s Summer Collection has been available at Nordies, Lord & Taylor, Macy’s, and a few other select locations for a month or more now (not officially). Sephora is finally updating it’s catalog with the Summer Collection as well. Dior’s Summer Collection is officially being launched in Japan as of April the 25th so I thought to coincide with that I’d post my review of the collection today! The Dior Japan site has been updated to reflect the new collection for a few weeks now however, as always, the US site is still displaying the Spring Collection and being bloody slow about getting the update live (we probably won’t see an update until June or more). As you already know from reading my constant rantings and ravings I am not a sun seeker which means of course this collection holds little appeal for me. The Collection consists of two new colors of High Shine Lipstick, two new colors of the single eyeshadows, two new palettes, and various other bits and bobs. And of course the Pi?ce de R?sistance of the Collection being the Golden Dior Pendant which houses a bronze gold highlighter cream to use on cheeks, face, and lips. Europe and Asia have two color selections for the pendant which are a gold and pink color while here within the US we are only getting the gold color. Unlike the Spring Collection which I over indulged in, the Summer Collection held little appeal and I only ended up getting the three Dior Addict Ultra Glosses from the entire lot of items released. The colors released ended up being very Muse friendly and I am loving the corals, golds, and beiges found in each of the newest glosses. I think these will not only work great in the Summer but well into the Fall! Three colors were released of the Dior Addict Ultra Gloss Reflect so I ended up with all three colors. I’ve always collected the Limited Editions of Addict Gloss but I haven’t done so in a while however with the Spring release I found myself using my LE glosses more and more thus that was part of the reason I picked these up! \\ The gloss formula is very good. Not too sticky, not to tacky but just right. It’s long wearing, holds nice shimmer and shine, and the price isn’t too bad at $24.50 USD per a gloss. I took a few swatches for you so you can compare the various colors. Beige Moire is obviously very clear and sheer but it has a beautiful touch of gold shimmer which looks brilliant over peaches and corals. Beige Lurex is a beautiful bronze chocolate with hints of orange and gold shimmer. And finally Corail Lame is a gorgeous coral that borders an orange with touches of gold shimmer! All three glosses are gorgeous but Beige Lurex and Corail Lame are my two favorites and worth picking up if you want something to pair up with a bronzed look this Summer or in my case a fresh peachy look! Dior Addict Ultra Gloss Reflect is Muse Approved for purchase! I’m enjoying these latest releases and look forward to using them this Summer! Click here to find out why I’m NOT a Sun Seeker!

Bobbi Brown: Customize Your Own Palette By Isabella Muse on April 24, 2008 38 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Summer Collections 2008 If you follow me around Cozy you might have noticed I posted about these on the Bobbi Brown thread! If not you got me babbling about them here on my blog! These are an interesting concept and since my obsession with Bobbi Brown lately you know that I want to try these out but the price makes me cringe slightly! First of all these are completely well thought out as the color selection is vast so it’s not a flash in the pan money making scheme. They actually considered this a while prior to releasing them. I love that they have a nice good array of color. What are they? Basically you’ll be purchasing an empty quad or trio which you can fill with any combination of blushes or eyeshadows of your own personal choice! Items available are shimmer eyeshadows, shimmer blushes, and standard blushes and eyeshadows. The shimmer shadows and blushes are of course something I am highly interested in trying out for myself! At the moment there are at least 30 shades of shadow available. That number is without the shimmer shadows so the choices and variety are fantastic! Price wise is where I am slightly raising my eyebrows. An empty quad or trio is $10 USD…mmm not too bad but nearly twice the amount of a standard MAC quad. Blushes are $22 USD each and Eyeshadows are $20 USD. Break that down with a quad and you’re looking at say over $90 USD for one blush and three eyeshadows. Bobbi I love you, I really love you but I don’t love a $90 palette! Holy cow! If you went the cheaper route and decided on a trio one blush and two eyeshadows would run you over $70 USD! Wow. As much as I am wanting these the price tag is just a tiny bit too high for the Muse! Love ’em, yes. Price Tag, not feeling it at all! Want these? Good deal? Bad deal? Tell the Muse! MAC Dazzleglass By Isabella Muse on April 24, 2008 25 Comments in MAC , Summer Collections 2008 Tis here ladies! MAC Dazzleglass is live and kicking on the MAC website! Click! Each gloss is $16.50 USD which is about $2.50 higher than a normal lipglass. I obviously have too much time on my hands because I noticed that a standard Lipglass is 4.8g/0.17oz and Dazzleglasses are 1.92g/0.06oz. Interesting that they appear bigger but obviously the content inside is not plus the price is higher hmmm! But! I forgive MAC as these look splendid to me! Despite warnings of stickiness and a few poor reviews I’ll be racing out to buy a few of these today! How about you? Want ’em? Love ’em? Not into ’em? Tell the Muse! Cosme Decorte Magie Deco Shadow Brilliance Palette First Impressions By Isabella Muse on April 23, 2008 14 Comments in Cosme Decorte , First Impressions , Hauls , Japanese Brands , Magie Deco I got my very first Cosme Decorte haul a few days ago! This isn’t really a review as of yet just my general impressions of the items. I’ll follow with a review and FOTD shortly. Mmmm……..Not sure what I think of this quite yet. I really love how beautiful the palette is for sure. It’s an array of five colors which includes a beautiful gold sparkling base that I’m loving. The four other colors are two accent colors one deep mustard and one cranberry, one nuance color which is a bubblegum pink color, and finally a shading color which is a dark chocolate brown. The palette is entitled Classy Sexy and if the colors are anything to go by that’s exactly the look you can pull off with this! A beautiful, classy, slightly sexy eye look! I’ve never been tempted to order any of the palettes prior to this as they carry a high price tag of $55 USD or so which seems absurd to say the least, hell even Givenchy and Chanel is $5-$6 cheaper than this! But I did come across a rather large stash of Magie Deco on one of the shops I was discussing in my prior Guide to Japanese Cosmetics Shopping post. I got this from Facial Shop and I ordered the palette for $44.99 USD which is a damn deep discount. I’m not entirely sure how I feel about the palette as of yet. It’s very beautiful but I do feel a slight tinge of disappointment at the price tag. The palette itself is gorgeous. It’s a beautiful shiny pink mirror compact with gold edging that’s very elegant. Inside are the five shadows and two brushes. And still after all this I’m wondering at the price tag! I guess I have to try it to see if it’s really worth it in the long run! I also picked up a Fairy Eyes which is a shimmering cream shadow. This is pretty brilliant. Yes, I normally have a deep dislike for cream shadows but I couldn’t resist one that was so full of sparkle, shimmer, and shine. I got mine in a frosty white and after swatching it I’d say the sparkle and shimmer is just right and I’m looking forward to using this as an all over wash with a beautiful black liner for an understated, yet elegant look! This normally retails for $20 USD or so but I got it from Facial Shop for $17.99 USD! Mind you the prices also include shipping so obviously you can see it’s a super deal! I’ve been wandering around the Cosme Decorte website for ages and I literally drool at the model images and looks created using the products but I fail to have the same wow aspiring feeling I did when I finally got a palette for my own! Maybe the color selection is the problem? I’m unsure! The instruction booklet is available both in Japanese and English which I appreciate greatly. I wish they included an eye chart but I imagine I can get tons of inspiration off the website as they have many great eye charts available to look at! All in all I am liking the items but haven’t yet felt any love for the palette! I’m hoping once I try it out for myself I’ll feel quite differently! Review and FOTD to follow very soon so keep your eyes open! Own any of these palettes? Love ’em? Want to try ’em? Tell the Muse!']",a3e127a4672539ff3fdc1ecaabe76c86582d3922,01a5-42ac-b636,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.musingsofamuse.com/page/4142,

I had originally created a JPmon tutorial for ordering but a few of you had asked me about registering and for the life me I can’t recall how I registered for the site! Duh! But Taryn was kind enough to create a most excellent tutorial to get you all registered up prior to following my tutorial for ordering! So here’s your first step in registering with JPmon! After this you can click here to use my tutorial to help with processing and completing your order! If you’re clueless about JPmon allow me to explain that’s it’s an online shop that sells tons of Japanese and Asian Cosmetic Brands! The prices are decent and not too bad! Airmail shipping costs aren’t fabulous but JPmon has many brands you can’t find in online shops so it’s a great place to stock up on unique and unusual cosmetic items! If you have online (or offline) mates that are into Japanese cosmetics you can do a bit of a group order to save on your shipping costs! Anyway! On with Taryn’s great tutorial (click the images to enlarge): Thanks Taryn! A ton of people are going to be very happy to have this! You may also enjoy...

"['A Guide to Shopping for Japanese Cosmetics By Isabella Muse on April 22, 2008 47 Comments in Japanese Brands , Online Shopping , Tutorials I get a crumb load of questions asking me how to shop for Japanese Cosmetics. Where can I buy Japanese Cosmetics? How much do they cost? Any online shops I can buy them from? Where do you get your Japanese Cosmetics? I was going to do this post a very long time ago but I just never really had the chance and it was long forgotten on the bottom of my draft pile of blog entries that never got posted! I’ve tweaked it a bit and rewrote most of it so here it is in all it’s glory! First of all many Japanese brands are unavailable within the US, UK, and Europe in general. I’ve discussed a few various brands available in a few countries such as Korea, Japan, etc…this particular post will be a guide for purchasing Japanese Cosmetics but in a future post I may cover a few other countries. If you’re purchasing Japanese Cosmetics online you’ll have to educate yourself a bit on prices and also arm yourself with a few tools. My first suggestion is install a Chinese and Japanese Language Pack for your browser so you can view various Japanese Websites and get prices on various items prior to purchasing. Downloading and installing these packs will also unable you to copy the text and paste it into a translation tool which helps when trying to figure out what is going on at certain sites. Click here to download the Japanese Language Pack Click here to download the Chinese Language Pack Note: For viewing Taiwanese, Hong Kong, and a few select Chinese sites you may need to install the Traditional Chinese Language Pack as these countries, cultures, and regions use a traditional, more complex form of character than other sites. I’ve actually found that it doesn’t matter too much which Language Pack you choose however I have all three installed as I find it does make it a tiny bit easier during the tedious translation process! The reason I recommend this is because most online shops charge anywhere from $5 USD all the way up to $12 USD on top of retail prices. Prices are a good deal higher online then if you happened into a drugstore in Japan and purchased the item yourself! I almost always pay retail for my Japanese Cosmetics because I have some sincerely beautiful, wonderful friends that live in Japan and do shopping for me. However, on occasion, I am forced to buy items online. In cases like this I want to be sure that I am getting the best deal possible so I do alot of homework prior to purchasing items. You should also keep in mind that many drugstores in Japan discount various items 25-30% which means the retail prices online do not reflect the discount. Example: T’estimo Palettes are shown on the Kanebo website at the price of $30 USD or so however upon purchasing one in a drugstore in Japan the actually cost would be $20 USD or so due to the drugstore discount. This means it’s an open market for online sellers to charge you $30 and upwards for a palette they paid $20 USD or so for. Currently, the Yen is very, very strong so you might want to Google around a bit and see if you can locate any Taiwanese shops that sell Japanese Cosmetics as the cost is a bit lower. I highly recommend JPmon which is located within Taiwan. I’ve done a “how to order” from JPMon on another tutorial page you can find that article by clicking here and here. You’ll be happy to know that the prices measure up pretty nicely with what you’d see on Japanese sites however not the discount you’d get within a Japanese drugstore as mentioned above! I’ve ordered from JPmon many, many times and I’ve always been very pleased with their services so I highly recommend purchasing from them! If you have a few online friends or friends in general into cosmetics doing a bit of “spree” with friends can cut shipping costs and each of you can split the total cost of shipping which always helps! Another important tool you’ll need is a currency convertor. This is especially helpful for converting Yen to your currency of choice. This is good tool to have when you’re browsing various Japanese websites and looking at prices to see what the original cost of an item is versus what the online shop you’re buying from is charging. I use XE for conversions. It’s not the best convertor in the world but it does an ok job and is off a few cents at most. Click here to bookmark XE. Finally the last tool you’ll need is a translator. This is especially helpful for figuring out what certain items are for, what the details are for an item, etc… Babel Fish does an ok job with translations but definately not word for word as the language is so complex that “literally” translating it into English (or your language of choice) doesn’t always mean you’ll understand exactly what is going on! Click here to bookmark Babel Fish. Babel Fish is especially useful as it translates both simplified and traditional Chinese plus Japanese as well! I don’t use Babel Fish as much as I do a simple add on for Firefox entitled Translator. It works a treat and makes translating full websites a snap! You can download this extension by clicking here ! Not many shops online sell Japanese Cosmetics but there are a few that I’ve used in the past and have had great experiences and success with! Those sites are, as follows: www.adambeauty.com www.bobodave.com www.facial-shop.com www.ichibankao.com www.jpmon.com www.gooddealer.com sh1.yahoo.edyna.com/hijapan (I’m sorry but I do not have a tutorial for ordering from Hi Japan but maybe I’ll do one in the future!) The best possible prices are located at Adam Beauty and JPMon in my humble opinion and Facial Shop also has some incredible deals as well! Other places you might see Japanese Cosmetics from would be E-bay. E-bay has many sellers that sell various Japanese Cosmetics. I find asking for a deal on shipping, asking for lower prices, etc..sometimes works with E-bay sellers. Remember to be courtesy when asking and reasonable. If something is marked as $39.99 USD and they want $9.99 shipping don’t go and ask them to give it to you for $20 with Free Shipping. I think you understand my point? I also find that dealing with the same E-bay Seller over and over again makes the chances of scoring a deal from them easier! Please keep in mind prior to purchasing cosmetics that freshness is important! I find in some cases some online shops do sell older items. This is particular true of BoboDave on occasion and Hi Japan. The good thing about this is that some items, such as LE, are still available from these shops but the bad thing is the product is older. Keep that in mind prior to making your purchase! This is one reason I do not shop at Strawberry.net. Items are awfully old and beyond shelf date! Below is a list of links for various Japanese Brands that I adore (I’m sure I left a few out!): Sofina Visee RMK Opera Majolica Majorca (Also the portal to Shiseido Japan) Maquillage Lunasol Lavshuca LoveClover KATE Kanebo (Main portal site which includes listings for Lavshuca, KATE, Tiffa, Lunasol, Etc…) Canmake Aube Gransenbon Jill Stuart KISS Cosmetics Esprique Precious T’estimo (Gone but not Forgotten) Excel Susie N.Y. Sana (Main Portal Site) I think I pretty much covered everything you need to know about ordering Japanese Cosmetics. If you need any help do comment and I’ll happily help in anyway I can!

"['Fasio Balm Rouge Color Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on December 18, 2014 6 Comments in Asian Brands , Beauty Abroad , Fasio , Japanese Brands , Lip Balm , Lipstick , Makeup Reviews , Swatches Purchased Fasio Balm Rouge Color recently launched in Japan in a range of 12 shades. Fasio is kinda a cheaper drugstore brand I’ve never been a super fan of it but recently, some of their new offerings have really been hits for me and Fasio Balm Rouge is one of those great products. Fasio Balm Rouge is a hybrid lipstick slash lip balm product that provides color, shine, and moisture. Personally for me it feels like more of a tinted lip balm than a lipstick. This comes housed in a simple twisted slim white tube. The packaging is simple, understated, and quite nice and easy to travel with. Fasio Balm Rouge Color Fasio Balm Rouge Color Swatches The formula is fragrance and flavor free and features a balmy texture that has a soft, easy glide on lips. I find the texture slightly soft and melty as I apply with a lightweight balmy feel. For a lip balm type product it’s quite nicely pigmented and provides a nice vibrant red to my lips (the shade I am wearing and swatched in this review is RD430). I wouldn’t call it the most hydrating lip product in the world but it provides nice lightweight hydration through the surprisingly long four hour wear. The color has a nice high sheen finish that looks quite shiny on my lips. All in all Fasio Balm Rouge Color is quite a lovely little product. It’s a really simple yet powerful little tinted lip balm that provides nice shine, color, and light moisture to lips with a rather great wear time. Do like!

"['Fasio Airy Shield UV Screen SPF 50+ Review By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2011 6 Comments in Asian Brands , Beauty Abroad , Fasio , Japanese Brands , Kose , Skincare , SPF , Swatches I always get alot of questions about what my favorite SPF products are. I use several to be honest because, well, I like variety. I imagine it doesn’t do any favors for my skin but I do in fact use a few that I like and I switch on and off between them. If I’m outside for longer periods of time one of favs would be Fasio Airy Shield UV Screen SPF 50+/PA+++. Fasio is a Japanese brand by Kose which is available within Japan and a few other Asian markets. I’m not really a huge fan of Fasio makeup as it’s always disappointing particularly the mascaras but I do enjoy this sunscreen. Let’s take a look! This is a more traditional “milky” SPF that has a watery, runny formula which absorbs fairly easily and doesn’t leave a white cast to my face. The formula leaves behind a semi-matte finish which feels smooth and velvety to the touch. It has a dropper style application which allows product to be easily dispensed and applied. The bottle is fairly small and runs around $9-$10 USD within the Japanese market but can be found online for about $15. I personally like it so much because it wears strong when I am running around in the heat. I find it doesn’t make me oily or greasy and you can literally feel the shield it creates on your face that allows your skin to breath but blocks out harmful sun rays. Granted, I’m not much of a fan of milky SPF products in general as I prefer a more moisturizing formula but this absorbs in a snap and my skin is always the same shade going outside the house as it is coming in so it’s definitely protecting from not only harmful UV rays but also preventing my skin from darkening. A friend of mine who lives in Japan purchased this for me however it’s easily found online. What are your favorite SPF products? You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Submarine Versus Freshwater By Isabella Muse on May 5, 2008 4 Comments in Beauty Babblings , MAC I got plenty of emails this weekend asking after MAC Eyeshadow in Submarine and Freshwater. Here are the comparisons if you’re thinking of purchasing Submarine but already own Freshwater! Freshwater swatches as more of a aqua blue while Submarine is more of a true blue in my opinion! Hope this helps! Origins Friends and Family Discount By Isabella Muse on May 5, 2008 Leave a Comment in Steals and Deals Origins is having a Friends and Family Event with 25% off your total purchase! It ends tomorrow so you might want to stock up now before the sale is over! Enjoy! MAC Naughty Nauticals: First Impressions By Isabella Muse on May 3, 2008 30 Comments in First Impressions , Hauls , MAC , Swatches Shockingly I didn’t rush out to my counter yesterday to purchase MAC’s newest collection, Nauguty Nauticals. I’m unsure whether I should be proud of myself for showing such willpower or maybe just honest and admit that I just got too busy to actually get to the counter! However, today nothing could hold me back, not even Prom ! It appears it’s Prom Night for some schools in my area tonight! Who would have guessed? It’s so bloody early for Prom isn’t it?? Prom Night has caused mayhem at the MAC counter this evening! I was happily doing a little jig at the array of yum that was Naughty Nauticals while patiently waiting for my regular MA to help me with my selections. Even though my mate Jamie was nagging me about having to wait I wouldn’t let anything ruin my first glance at Mutiny! It was love at first sight! I just stepped in from seeing Iron Man and going to dinner with friends (more on Iron Man later) and it’s really late and I’m really tired but I can’t help but blog this now for you guys! MAC’s Naughty Nauticals is a fantastic collection and there are absolutely a few essential items you’ll most definately want to pick up from this! I was very pleased in particular with the pigment selection! A total of four pigments were released with the collection but only three are brand new. Lovely Lily was a previous release so I safely skipped it. If you missed Lovely Lily the last round you’ll definately want to grab a jar as it’s a gorgeous, shimmering Lilac. My absolute favorite pigment of the bunch and the one I highly recommend you grab would be Mutiny (you might need two as this is a brilliant color!). Mutiny is described as sky blue on the MAC site but I beg to differ! It’s much more of a tranquil, light aqua. It reminds me of the ocean in the Caribbean! Simply gorgeous and by far the best of all the pigments in this collection! Bell Bottom Blue has a few folks scratching their heads and wondering if they really need it. It’s a bit of an intimidating color as it’s such a dark, true navy blue but I’d say definately pick it up as it goes wonderfully well with one of the shadows released with the collection and will also compliment well with any Blue Storm shadows you might have hauled! It is dark but it can easily be tamed down! Lastly I got Lark About which I originally thought might be a shimmering white but I’m happy to report it’s more of a dirty white, almost gray with iridescent blue running through it! Lark About is also worth picking up in my humblest as it compliments the other pigments in the collection (aside from Lovely Lily) perfectly and will make a rather good base to tone down Bell Bottom Blue! Lovely Lily Bell-Bottom Blue Lark About Mutiny I was a little stingy when it came to making my lippie and lipgloss selection simply because I was also hauling DazzleGlass today and decided it was best to be a bit caution as I knew I’d be doing a bit of damage with DazzleGlass as well! 4 Lustreglass were released and 4 Lipsticks. I ended up with two of the lipsticks and one Lustreglass. The first lipstick that deserves to be mentioned is Port Red. You might know that I don’t favor reds so well and only ever fell in love with one red from MAC which was released this Holiday entitled Queen’s Sin . I am now officially in lust and love with Port Red. It’s actually a very good dupe to Queen’s Sin so if you missed the color now is your chance to own a pretty nice dupe of it. If you already own Queen’s Sin I’d say pick up Port Red anyway as it has little differences that are actually very pleasing! Queen’s Sin feels to me more like a maroon where as Port Red is a truer, bright red with a metallic sheen! It’s absolutely stunning and will look gorgeous with a blue eye look! The other lipstick I purchased was Party Mate which is an off color pink! For me these were the two best colors in the lot of colors released! Party Mate Port Red Port Red Vs Queen’s Sin I only ended up with one LustreGlass which was Hey, Sailor. I think paired up with Party Mate this will look rather fantastic! It’s a plummy pink that reminds me of some of the Viva Glam releases. This style of pink is always very flattering with my skin tone! The other Lustreglasses were very nice but I was saving myself for DazzleGlass so I only got the one! Hey, Sailor! Sadly, I wasn’t too thrilled with the eyeshadow selection. Meet the Fleet was a matte dark purple that I couldn’t see myself wearing and I know I’d have a bloody hell of a time blending with it and Pandemonium is a repromote so I skipped that! Shore Leave Illegal Cargo Submarine Blue I’m in love with Shore Leave. I’m always on the hunt for a perfect highbrow highlighter and Shore Leave fits the bill perfectly. It’s a frosty cream that will go wonderfully with all the colors in this collection! Submarine is my second favorite shadow from the releases. It’s a clean, off blue color that reminds me of MAC eyeshadow in Freshwater. And finally I picked up Illegal Cargo which is my least favorite of the eyeshadows but I thought it would go well with Lovely Lily. This is a dirty lilac color with traces of gray! The entire collection has some sincerely wonderful items and I’m quite pleased with what I ended up purchasing! MAC did an excellent job with this Color Story! MAC Naughty Nauticals is most definately Muse Approved for purchase! How about you? What did you haul from this collection? Love the pigments? Love the shadows? Tell the Muse!

Etude House Peach Skin Pact & Pore Erasing Peach Base: Detailed Review By Isabella Muse on May 2, 2008 34 Comments in Asian Brands , Etude House , Korean Brands Since using the Etude House Peach Skin Pact and Pore Erasing Peach Base I felt like the two items deserved a revisit and deeper review than the short blurb I posted in my original post. Yesterday morning as you may have previously read I used just the Peach Skin Pact and Pore Erasing Peach Base as my sole foundation routine. I did use a touch of concealer under my eyes but aside from that I only prepped and primed my skin with the base and set it with the powder. To my delight the entire look I created came out very fresh, fun, and natural it also happened to last all day long which is why I felt the two items needed more of a detailed review. I’ll start with the Etude House Pore Erasing Peach Base which everyone was quite excited about in my comment box. You’re right to be excited as it’s a wonderful, brilliant primer and the price is ridiculously inexpensive for such a great product. I had the original idea that this might be like Benefit Erase Paste doubling not only as a primer but also as a concealer. Turns out that’s not the case at all. It’s very difficult to explain the exact texture and formula of this product. It’s a cross between matte and moisturizing. It’s of medium thickness and works well when “warmed” prior to use. I found that working it into the back of my hand and applying to my face seemed to make the blending process a bit easier. When it first touches your face it feels very moisturizing and it quickly blends into the skin and has a similar texture as Smashbox Photofinish Primer however it does not pill like Photofinish does. If you’re unfamiliar with the term “pill” it simply means that the primer “balls” up and rolls off the skin in gross, sort of flaky balls. Photofinish does this for me constantly and it also happens to break me out rather badly. Pore Erasing Peach Base does not do either. No break outs and no pilling as I blend. It simply seeps naturally into the skin creating a smooth, flawless finish to the skin while prepping it for your foundation or in my case the Peach Skin Pact. As I had mentioned in my previous post the primer does carry the scent of peaches which I don’t mind in the least however if you’re sensitive to scents or just don’t enjoy your products scented this might be something you wish to avoid. I don’t have particularly large pores however I can imagine this will do a brilliant job of filling pores while allowing your skin to breath. It feels natural and fresh on and is in no way heavy! If you have oily skin this will be an excellent solution for creating a matte finish. With my first application of the base I did notice that my skin turned a ghostly white but after applying the powder it seemed to settle down well. I didn’t mind so much as I am always looking for ways to whiten up my skin as you already know from reading my previous article on whitening your skin! The Peach Skin Pact is the perfect follow up treatment to the base. After applying the base I simply pat the powder on top to create a beautiful finish to my skin. I can already see that both the base and the powder will become a daily part of my routine in the Summer when I don’t want a ton of foundation laying on my skin! The powder, like the base, carries the scent of peaches. The color is a universally flattering beige with a tiny hint of peach to it. It should work well on cooler skin tones including fair and medium but won’t work well on darker or tanned skin. The powder is very light, airy, and silky. It applies beautifully and blends well. You can happily use it as your sole foundation when paired up with the Pore Erasing Peach Base which is exactly what I did yesterday morning! The good news is I applied my makeup at 5:45 AM in the morning and it lasted, without touch ups, until about 6:00 PM in the evening! It began to fade a bit around 6:30 or so. I was shocked as I’ve never had my makeup last this long! All and all I’m extremely pleased with both products and they are, as of now, most definately holy grail products for me! On a different note I know many of you are wondering where I got the haul and such. I briefly explained to a few commentors that I had got my items from a friend who lives in Korea. I did some research around and I haven’t located a single online shop that sells Etude House cosmetics sadly. However, the good news is I did run across several sellers on E-bay. The best one I came across was GinsengSeafood Beauty HK. She appears to be in China and has a small stash of Etude Cosmetics for sale. Her prices range seems to be about $5 USD on top of retail. If you’re interested you can click here to browse her selection of Etude House. The other option I suggest is checking MUA and seeing if anyone would be willing to do a CP that is located in Korea. Finally I would suggest visiting Facial-Shop as per my recommendation of this online shop in my Guide to Shopping for Japanese Cosmetics . The girl who runs the shop, Vivian, had once offered to have some Etude items but I never took her up on the offer. Maybe visit with her and ask if she has anything available. I hope this helps! Happy Shopping! UPDATE: Thanks to one of my gorgeous readers, Humming, we now have another E-bay Seller. It appears this seller has the entire Peach Collection. Sadly the prices are SUPER jacked up but if your lemming is strong have a click here to gather up the Etude House Peach Collection for yourself! Example: The Pore Base is $34.99 USD and retails for $11 USD. Ouchy! Etude House Spring Collection 2008: Peach Makeup Collection Review By Isabella Muse on May 1, 2008 95 Comments in Asian Brands , Etude House , First Impressions , Hauls , Korean Brands Etude House released a rather interesting Spring Collection this year and of course the Muse couldn’t resist picking up most of it for herself! The Collection consisted of an array of “Peach” Themed items. One item in particular that caught my eye was the Pore Erasing Peach Base. This quite reminded me of Benefit Erase Paste which I didn’t have the best experience with. I guess I’m a glutton for punishment but I decided that I needed to try the Pore Erasing Base because I had convinced myself that it had to be better than Benefit’s version! It’s 11,000 Won for the entire jar that’s under $10 USD! It’s freaking huge at 0.88oz! I tested it this morning and it’s not anything like Erase Paste. It’s a pre-makeup primer through and through and sadly my hope that it would have some concealing benefits were quickly dashed as soon as I got it on my skin. I don’t have large pores however this is perfect for creating a smooth, matte finish on your face prior to foundation and makeup. This carries a beautiful scent of peaches as well. Understandably some girls prefer cosmetics without scent but I don’t mind in the least! Whether this allows my makeup to last longer throughout the day remains to be seen but right now I’m loving this as a pre-foundation prep! The texture is quite like Smashbox Photofinish Primer but I felt like it was a bit more moisturizing and blended easier plus I didn’t get a breakout after using it where as with Smashbox’s primer pimples crop up! I did notice although it wasn’t concealing it did lighten my face up a tad bit and almost made me appear ghost like but after applying the next stage of my makeup that effect was gone thankfully. For the price I think it’s well worth looking into and trying out if you can get your hands on it! The good news is I got a small sample of this with my purchase and I’m giving it away to the first person that comments and is willing to review it for Musings of a Muse. I’d like to hear your thoughts on this so if you’re willing to review it give a yell! The first person who comments I’ll ship it out to and I’ll expect a review back within a week or so explaining if you loved it, hated it, etc…! Sample of Etude House Peach Pore Erasing Base for Review! I also got the Peach Skin Pact which is best used for setting the Pore Erasing Base. The formula is obviously very good for oily skin types and offers very nice matte coverage. Good for touch ups and setting your foundation plus the compact is so bloody cute it’s no great chore to tote this around with you! I’ll make proper use of this come Summer when my skin decides to take a field trip from dry and venture into oily! My entire routine for makeup this morning consisted of using the Etude House Pore Peach Base and setting it with the Peach Skin Pact. I used no other foundation in my makeup process as I wanted to dupe the entire look from the video how to on the Etude House website. I don’t normally use powder as my sole foundation since I feel like I need better coverage plus powder wears off very quickly throughout the day! I’m curious if the base will keep the powder intact all day which is why I’m experimenting going without my normal foundation! If it works I’ll be doing this all Summer long as my makeup feels very light today which will be perfect for Summer! This, like the pore base, carries the sweet scent of peaches which I absolutely adore! I got two of the Peach Cheek Blushers as well which are basically an exact dupe of Lorac’s Cheek Stamp that was released last season. These appear to be very sheer but they are not. They hold a beautiful pigmentation for an item that’s so cheap! The formula is a bit chalky but that’s simply because it’s catering to an Asian skin type that may be oily. The concept and idea of a cheek stamp is of course awesome not only for ease of application but for the cute factor! I’ve personally never tried Lorac’s version so I couldn’t say how good it is but I’m glad I decided to give these a shot. If you’re unfamiliar with the concept I’ll briefly explain. Basically this is a circle sponge that has blusher in the lid of the product. The sponge is saturated with the powder and you can pop it out and “stamp” it onto your cheeks for a pinch of color! Lorac’s Cheek Stamp I ended up purchasing the eyeshadow quad that was used in the Etude video as well. It’s actually not LE and is part of the normal collection but I was so juiced over the look they created using everything that I wanted to try and dupe the entire look thus this palette got tucked into my shopping list! It’s basically a quad of four shimmering shades that are very sheer but can be built up. They have about the same pigmentation as a Majolica Majorca Majolook palette. The shades in this particular palette are white, baby pink, light blue, and yellow. The shadows do have the standard chalky texture most Asian brands sport but I don’t mind as I’m used to this from various Japanese brands. They hold a beautiful shimmer and blend very well! I also got the Peach Beam Blusher which reminds me of a MAC MSF. It has a metallic shimmer finish that’s applies as a highlight but is pigmented enough to act as a blush! The effect is a beautiful glow! If you enjoy tanned skin during the Summer I imagine this will be very fitting for not only highlighting your cheeks but giving you a beautiful peach kissed look! Color Me Nude Lip Concealer also ended up on my shopping list! MAC makes a similar lip concealer but in a pot form. Basically it concealers your lips and primes them for lipstick or gloss. Supposedly when your lips are primed with a concealer your glosses and lipsticks appear more vibrant and bright! As I said MAC’s version comes in a pot and this just seems easier and convenient in stick form! I haven’t yet tried this and will be doing a review of it shortly! Staying on track with dupes Etude House also released Tear Drop Lash which is identical to Givenchy’s Lash Sparkles and Dior’s Lash Pearls. This is basically a wand that distributes little tear drops onto your lashes for a bit of an interesting “teardrop” effect! The applicator appears to be thought out a bit better than both Dior and Givenchy’s version! It’s a flat square plastic applicator with a tiny hole. It works quite well at disturbing the product and applying it right on the tips of the lashes! Very nice effect! I wish I can get a really close up image of my eyes so you can see the effect! Finally I got the Peach Water Gloss which smells amazing and tastes just as good! I used it this morning and I love how well it applies. It’s a bit sheer but the formula is nice and watery which makes it feel very light on the lips and not tacky or sticky on the lips! I got some cool freebies as well which were a cellular phone charm that houses an Etude gloss and a mini toner/lotion set. All and all I’m thrilled to bits with the collection and it cost me under $85 USD for the entire lot of goodies I got. Inexpensive cosmetics that actually work well totally make the Muse’s day! This morning as I mentioned I used almost all the collection to create a beautiful peachy pink look that’s both fresh, fun, and girly! I love how the peach contrasts so beautifully with the pink in my FOTD! I’d normally never pair up peaches and pinks but this came out so well that I’ll be doing so from now on! My attempt to dupe the Etude look as seen on the video!

"['DazzleGlass and Naughty Nauticals FOTD By Isabella Muse on May 6, 2008 20 Comments in Face of the Day Looking rough today. Sorry! Bit tired but really wanted to share a DazzleGlass FOTD! P.S. Click the image for a larger view of the picture so you can see the beauty that is DazzleGlass (and excuse my brows they are a mess and need a pluck *blush*)! What I Used: Eyes Maquillage Mascara MAC Pigment in Lovely Lily MAC Pigment in Lark About MAC Eyeshadow in Illegal Cargo MAC Dual Ended Eye Pencil in Fab Orchid/Dash Lily Lips: MAC DazzleGlass in Date Night Face MAC Pro Blush in Full Fuschia Pop Smokey Rose Palette Review By Isabella Muse on May 6, 2008 5 Comments in Pop I know, I know. You’re probably tired of my babblings about Pop lately but I can’t help myself they have come out with some truly awesome items lately. What started out as a few palettes for the eyes has turned into an entire line up of fantastic palette after palette after palette releases that are such a steal! The newest palette entitled Smokey Rose combines not only a ton of eyeshadows but also gloss and blush this time around! Sweet! The Muse likey a palette with tons of goodies that covers my entire face! The convenience of a do it all palette thrills me to absolute pieces! So, What’s the scoop? What do I get? Let me tell you…….. You get 12 Eyeshadows, 4 Cheek Colors, 2 Lip Colors, and One Dual Ended Brush for $42 USD! That, my dear girls, is a steal in my humblest. You’d pay close to $35 USD anyway for six shadows or so in a palette! This gives you eyeshadows plus cheek colors plus lip colors plus a brush..what more could you possibly want?! Shadow Selection Blush Selection Lip Color Selection If you’re on a bit of a budget this is a great palette as it offers so much variety for a small cost. If you’re a no nonsense type of girl that doesn’t like stashing large quantities of cosmetics this would be for you as it has a healthy selection of goodies stowed away in a cute checkbook style wallet! The shades in the wallet range from darker to medium to lighter. Lighter can be used as a highbrow highlighter or as an all over color wash for prepping the eye area while the darker shades can be used to smoke your eye out or to use as a liner and finally the medium shades can be used on the lid. You can get very creative with the palette and create dozens of looks! The blushes range from bronzey to pink and lighter to darker. You can use the darker shades to contour the face and the brighter colors on your cheek bones! The lip colors included are a deep shade of cranberry stain and a lighter glossier pink. The stain gives the appearance of just bitten lips while the glossier nude pink looks gorgeous on top for a bit of shine! Tips and Trixs for Application: Use any of the 4 darker shades as eyeliners to line and define the shape of your eye! Apply a medium tuned color onto lid and blend into crease to create a gorgeous look! Apply a nude cheek color all over the cheekbone and a pink color on the apples of the cheek only! Stain lips with the cranberry stain and dot pastel pink in the middle of the top and bottom lip for a plumper, fuller lip look! The Muse is loving Pop lately and thinks the newest Smokey Rose Palette is definately gorgeous! The packaging is a gorgeous snap close, faux croc purple wallet with a loop for holding the brush inside. Easy storage! Easy for toting around in your purse! Pop’s Smokey Rose Palette is most definately Muse Approved for purchase! It’s pigmented, it has a large selection of gorgeous goodies, it’s compact, it comes with it’s own brush….yup, it’s definately Muse Approved! It’s Mother’s Day soon maybe grab one for your Mum and yourself while you’re at it! Click to visit Sephora and purchase your Smokey Rose Palette! The Smokey Rose Palette is available exclusively to Sephora and is Limited Edition so grab it while you can! Click here to read my review on Pop’s Day to Play Palette!

Lush Cosmetics Tea Tree Water Review By Isabella Muse on May 6, 2008 9 Comments in Lush , Skincare It’s starting to warm up here in New York. It’s not quite humid yet nor is it sweltering hot but it’s warm enough to make my normally dry skin take on a tinge of oily! My forehead suffers most in the Summer and becomes a fun mirror of shine and oil! Never fear, Lush is here to save the day! When the weather warms up and I know my skin will begin it’s descent into the depths of oily hell I turn to Lush Tea Tree Water to clear up my skin and make it matte and normal once again! I spritz this on in the AM prior to my normal moisturizer and it mops up excess oil and preps my skin for my moisturizer! When I take off my makeup for the night I spritz it on again prior to my night cream! It keeps me oil free for about 5-6 hours depending on how hot it is and how long I’m outside! You can of course tote it around for fresh ups but I wouldn’t recommend using it on a made up face! I never have to worry about this drying out my face the way normal toners do as it’s 100% Alcohol Free which makes it gentle on my skin and not tight feeling after spraying on! If you happen to suffer from acne this is a wonderfully refreshing toner for detoxing your clogged pores and not drying out your skin! I personally use it on my T-Zone during warmer days when oil rears it’s ugly head! The smell is refreshing and it doesn’t sting the way some toners tend too! For me it’s an absolute “must have item” for the long, hot Summer ahead! Good-bye oily skin! Hello, Gorgeous! Lush Tea Tree Water is most definately Muse Approved for purchase! Love Lush?

MAC DazzleGlass First Impressions By Isabella Muse on May 6, 2008 29 Comments in First Impressions , MAC I know people warned me. I know people ranted at me. I know people even bitched at me to stay away from MAC Dazzleglass but sorry guys all your ranting, bitching and warnings went in one ear and out through the other when I was presented with the display of DazzleGlass at the MAC counter. I truly value your opinions and hold them in high esteem but this time I beg to differ with those of you who shouted dismayed warnings about how bad DazzleGlass was. It’s simply awesome. Sorry. But it is. I lurve it. I got myself 6 of the 16 colors and I’ve convinced myself I must have them all (in order to be master of the universe you see)! They are gorgeous glosses! Glittery, Shimmery, Pigmented! What more could a girl want or need in a gloss? The photos you’ll find below are all taken in soft white light, no flash was used so you can see the true colors of the products! Hope this helps when making your selections! Many rantings of sticky and tacky have arose and I’ve decided to make my peace with MAC Lipglass and MAC glosses in general. I’ve realized that since it’s so sticky and tacky it lasts longer on my lips than the everyday average gloss. It doesn’t slide off, it doesn’t smudge, it stays right where I want it for long periods of time minus touch ups! I can’t believe I’m saying this but CHEERS to sticky, tacky gloss! DazzleGlass is no exception to the rule. It’s sticky and it’s tacky but it lasts all freaky day and gives your lips a gorgeous, healthy dose of glitter! I’m a glitter freak so I couldn’t be more excited about this collection! And the colors? Wow! Awesomeness! The colors are insanely pretty. There’s a little something for everyone in this collection but if you’re honest with yourself you’re going to be like me and just want every single color! I get tons of questions about the taste and scent of various MAC lip items and to answer before I get the question, yes it’s vanilla tasting and scented. Not the greatest taste in the world I agree but the color variety and beauty of these forgives the terrible taste. Please MAC can it be minty fresh time now and kick the vanilla out? Thanks the Muse Hearts you! DazzleGlasses appear larger in size but are actually smaller with a bigger price tag. I mentioned this in a prior post but once you see the collection for yourself price and size won’t matter much since you’ll be blinded by the gorgeous array of shimmery glosses on display! I am still shaking myself silly for only walking away from the counter with six of these! I needs more I tell you! I’m quite confused as I read on a few reviews that this had a gritty texture but I haven’t experienced that. The glitter is very finely milled and you can’t feel it at all on your lips so where the feeling of grittiness comes into play is beyond me! I haven’t had a problem with residue glitter either once the gloss has worn off. Once the gloss is gone, chewed off, smudged off, etc…so is the glitter. No residue glitter left over! As I mentioned the color selection is outstanding and these are quite happily pigmented enough to wear on their own or over your favorite lipstain or lipstick! The colors I got were: Glamour O.D.-This is bright pink with hints of coral! Get Rich Quick-This is probably my favorite of the bunch! I’m picturing how great it’ll go with peach blushes! It’s a warm brown that’s very flattering on my skin tone! Spanking Rich-This is a deeper pink with hints of mauve to it. Love Alert-This reminds me of watermelon! It’s a bright pinky red with hints of fuschia! Steppin’ Out-A true pink. Date Night-A purple pink that has a bit of a blue undertone! If you love glitter, if you love shimmer, if you just love glosses DazzleGlass most definately be for you! The Muse gives the MAC DazzleGlass Collection a big seal of approval for purchase! Well done on this one MAC! The Muse likey alot! Stay Tuned for FOTD’s using MAC Dazzleglass! Have these? Love ’em? Want ’em? Absolutely need to have ’em? Tell the Muse!

Bourjois Paris Volume Clubbing Mascara Review By Isabella Muse on May 5, 2008 20 Comments in Bourjois Paris , Summer Collections 2008 I probably should start this review by expressing my deep love for Bourjois Paris mascara. Prior to becoming a total addict and junkie to Japanese Brand Mascaras I was a complete Bourjois Paris fan girl when it came to mascara! Bourjois Paris makes some sincerely great mascaras and I have quite a few in my makeup arsenal that I absolutely adore using daily! I picked up a Bourjois Paris Volume Clubbing Mascara a week or so ago when doing a Sephora order and I should have seen the writing on the wall with this one. I should have reminded myself that lately Bourjois Paris has fallen off the awesome mascara bandwagon. Example: Yes To Volume, No To Clumps how about they reverse the title and say YES To Clumps and No Volume At all! I’m a huge fan of Bourjois Paris Maxi Frange and I was somewhat hopeful that Volume Clubbing Mascara with it’s big chunky applicator brush might be the next awesome deal on the mascara hit list. Awesome, no. Crap, yes. I purchased this rubbish for $17 USD in the color Brun Remix. Since I have only one other brown mascara in my entire mass collection I was thinking how beautifully it would compliment my eyes. The color is very nice. It’s a chocolate brown with a tiny sheen of lighter gold! As I mentioned the brush is big and chunky which I always find great for application however in this case I think both the brush and the formula of the mascara just create one big, nasty mess on your lashes. [email protected] @k kids a hot mess waiting to happen! I curled my lashes prior to use and proceeded to apply. What came out was a clumpy mess of wet mascara. My lashes were literally stuck together in large, wet chunks. It was thee most disgusting look I’ve ever gotten from mascara. This failed to separate my lashes, yes I did get some volume, but forget the volume what about the mess of clumping I had going on here?! It almost felt like I was applying really old mascara to my lashes. Every notice when mascara ages it tends to clump lashes up badly? That would be the case with this mascara. It’s seriously a mess to use, an absolute mess. After spending the next five minutes coming my lashes out and disturbing the product better with my own mascara comb, since the bloody brush was of no use, I decided I’d give it a test drive out for the day. Flaking, smudging, raccoon eye nightmare. Bad, bad idea to go out of the house with this crap on my eyelashes. I came home with flakes of mascara all over my cheeks, dark, runny streaks of mascara under my eyes, and just grossness all around. I am so utterly and completely shocked and disappointed how bad this truly is. Bourjois Paris Volume Clubbing Mascara gets a big fat DON’T BUY from the Muse! Hate it! Big waste of cash! Tried this? Love it? Hating it as much as the Muse! Speak to me! MAC Mutiny Pigment and MAC Pop Blue Eye Pencil: A Marriage Most Wonderful! By Isabella Muse on May 5, 2008 8 Comments in Beauty Babblings , MAC Since MAC Mutiny Pigment is my current obsession I’ve been looking through my collection for various items to pair up with it! Since it’s so beautiful I did decide that it would be best to try it all by itself when I finally get around to doing an FOTD with it! However, while seeking colors to match up with it, right under my nose, happened to be MAC’s Pop Blue/Black Funk Dual Ended Eye Pencil from the Heatherette Collection ! Ahhh a marriage most wonderful! How about you? Loving Mutiny? What are you pairing up with it? Tell the Muse! the Balm: Balms Away Eye Makeup Break-Up Review By Isabella Muse on May 5, 2008 30 Comments in theBalm Here’s an interesting little product you might want to try for yourself, Balms Away Eye Makeup Break-Up from the Balm. You might be wondering why I am recommending you a $19 USD tin of what appears to be Vaseline. I guess in a way this has the same benefits that simple, cheaper Vaseline does however I definately like this much better than your average run of the mill jar of petroleum jelly! What is Balms Away anyway? Basically it’s a very emollient jelly eye makeup remover that’s packed full of Vitamins, Sterols, Lipids, and most importantly moisturizing goodness for your eye area! I normally use Sephora Eye Makeup Remover which runs me about $8 USD. It’s the best remover I’ve come across that takes it all off with a nice low price tag. Lancome’s Bi-Facil is another favorite of mine but at $26 USD I cringe to purchase it! So why shell out $19 USD for this tin? Simply, because it works. For one thing it’s a large tin at 2.2 oz and since you’re only using a very small amount it should last you a while. Secondly, the moisturizing benefits alone really make me happy! My under eye area seriously needs as much moisture as it can get right now and after massaging off my eye makeup with this my eyes feel so very soft and my lashes conditioned. I experience less lash breakage as well since I’m not tugging around with a cotton ball drenched in eye makeup remover. How’s it work? Simple. Take a tiny amount, close your eyes and massage. Wipe clean with a cotton square or some tissue. One swipe should get it all. I choose to rinse with warm water after I swiped it away with cotton. That’s it, Bob’s your Uncle! Eye makeup all gone and fresh, moisturized eyes in it’s place! The texture quite reminds me of Vaseline. It’s a jelly formula that glides onto your eyes easily. That temporary feeling of cloudy eye vision when I’m using an oil based remover is easily avoided with this. It clearly states on the directions to keep your eyes closed when using but I did crack them open a little to locate my cotton squares and after removal I didn’t experience temporary blindness or cloudy vision which totally made my day as I really hate that feeling! I like this. I know it’s rather expensive but I’m on the bandwagon for a repurchase when I’m finished with this tin! It’s fragrance free for those of you who aren’t too keen on scented products! It removes heavy duty eye makeup including waterproof mascara which is a big plus for me! Pros: Removes heavy duty eye makeup including waterproof mascara! Less tugging while removing your makeup! Gentle massaging gets everything off! Less lash breakage! Packed full of goodness for your eye area! Conditions Lashes! Moisturizes your entire eye area while it removes your makeup! Love the retro packaging! Cons: Price is a bit much but worth it in my humblest opinion! All in all I’m rather happy I spontaneously purchased this. I know the price is a bit much but in the long run I’m thinking it’s worth it. Balms Away Eye Makeup Break-Up is most definately Muse Approved for purchase! Tried this? Love it? Want to try it? What are you using to remove your eye makeup? Tell the Muse! Naughty Nauticals FOTD By Isabella Muse on May 5, 2008 44 Comments in Face of the Day FOTD time using MAC Naughty Nauticals ! I heart this collection so much! Lovely Lily went wonderfully well with Submarine Blue! I’d never have thought to pair up the two if it wasn’t for this face chart: Sadly my look didn’t come out as smokey as the MAC look. I wish mine had that grayish/black tint to it that the face chart did but mine came out more true blue. Oh well!

"['Etude House Spring Collection 2008: Peach Makeup Collection Review By Isabella Muse on May 1, 2008 95 Comments in Asian Brands , Etude House , First Impressions , Hauls , Korean Brands Etude House released a rather interesting Spring Collection this year and of course the Muse couldn’t resist picking up most of it for herself! The Collection consisted of an array of “Peach” Themed items. One item in particular that caught my eye was the Pore Erasing Peach Base. This quite reminded me of Benefit Erase Paste which I didn’t have the best experience with. I guess I’m a glutton for punishment but I decided that I needed to try the Pore Erasing Base because I had convinced myself that it had to be better than Benefit’s version! It’s 11,000 Won for the entire jar that’s under $10 USD! It’s freaking huge at 0.88oz! I tested it this morning and it’s not anything like Erase Paste. It’s a pre-makeup primer through and through and sadly my hope that it would have some concealing benefits were quickly dashed as soon as I got it on my skin. I don’t have large pores however this is perfect for creating a smooth, matte finish on your face prior to foundation and makeup. This carries a beautiful scent of peaches as well. Understandably some girls prefer cosmetics without scent but I don’t mind in the least! Whether this allows my makeup to last longer throughout the day remains to be seen but right now I’m loving this as a pre-foundation prep! The texture is quite like Smashbox Photofinish Primer but I felt like it was a bit more moisturizing and blended easier plus I didn’t get a breakout after using it where as with Smashbox’s primer pimples crop up! I did notice although it wasn’t concealing it did lighten my face up a tad bit and almost made me appear ghost like but after applying the next stage of my makeup that effect was gone thankfully. For the price I think it’s well worth looking into and trying out if you can get your hands on it! The good news is I got a small sample of this with my purchase and I’m giving it away to the first person that comments and is willing to review it for Musings of a Muse. I’d like to hear your thoughts on this so if you’re willing to review it give a yell! The first person who comments I’ll ship it out to and I’ll expect a review back within a week or so explaining if you loved it, hated it, etc…! Sample of Etude House Peach Pore Erasing Base for Review! I also got the Peach Skin Pact which is best used for setting the Pore Erasing Base. The formula is obviously very good for oily skin types and offers very nice matte coverage. Good for touch ups and setting your foundation plus the compact is so bloody cute it’s no great chore to tote this around with you! I’ll make proper use of this come Summer when my skin decides to take a field trip from dry and venture into oily! My entire routine for makeup this morning consisted of using the Etude House Pore Peach Base and setting it with the Peach Skin Pact. I used no other foundation in my makeup process as I wanted to dupe the entire look from the video how to on the Etude House website. I don’t normally use powder as my sole foundation since I feel like I need better coverage plus powder wears off very quickly throughout the day! I’m curious if the base will keep the powder intact all day which is why I’m experimenting going without my normal foundation! If it works I’ll be doing this all Summer long as my makeup feels very light today which will be perfect for Summer! This, like the pore base, carries the sweet scent of peaches which I absolutely adore! I got two of the Peach Cheek Blushers as well which are basically an exact dupe of Lorac’s Cheek Stamp that was released last season. These appear to be very sheer but they are not. They hold a beautiful pigmentation for an item that’s so cheap! The formula is a bit chalky but that’s simply because it’s catering to an Asian skin type that may be oily. The concept and idea of a cheek stamp is of course awesome not only for ease of application but for the cute factor! I’ve personally never tried Lorac’s version so I couldn’t say how good it is but I’m glad I decided to give these a shot. If you’re unfamiliar with the concept I’ll briefly explain. Basically this is a circle sponge that has blusher in the lid of the product. The sponge is saturated with the powder and you can pop it out and “stamp” it onto your cheeks for a pinch of color! Lorac’s Cheek Stamp I ended up purchasing the eyeshadow quad that was used in the Etude video as well. It’s actually not LE and is part of the normal collection but I was so juiced over the look they created using everything that I wanted to try and dupe the entire look thus this palette got tucked into my shopping list! It’s basically a quad of four shimmering shades that are very sheer but can be built up. They have about the same pigmentation as a Majolica Majorca Majolook palette. The shades in this particular palette are white, baby pink, light blue, and yellow. The shadows do have the standard chalky texture most Asian brands sport but I don’t mind as I’m used to this from various Japanese brands. They hold a beautiful shimmer and blend very well! I also got the Peach Beam Blusher which reminds me of a MAC MSF. It has a metallic shimmer finish that’s applies as a highlight but is pigmented enough to act as a blush! The effect is a beautiful glow! If you enjoy tanned skin during the Summer I imagine this will be very fitting for not only highlighting your cheeks but giving you a beautiful peach kissed look! Color Me Nude Lip Concealer also ended up on my shopping list! MAC makes a similar lip concealer but in a pot form. Basically it concealers your lips and primes them for lipstick or gloss. Supposedly when your lips are primed with a concealer your glosses and lipsticks appear more vibrant and bright! As I said MAC’s version comes in a pot and this just seems easier and convenient in stick form! I haven’t yet tried this and will be doing a review of it shortly! Staying on track with dupes Etude House also released Tear Drop Lash which is identical to Givenchy’s Lash Sparkles and Dior’s Lash Pearls. This is basically a wand that distributes little tear drops onto your lashes for a bit of an interesting “teardrop” effect! The applicator appears to be thought out a bit better than both Dior and Givenchy’s version! It’s a flat square plastic applicator with a tiny hole. It works quite well at disturbing the product and applying it right on the tips of the lashes! Very nice effect! I wish I can get a really close up image of my eyes so you can see the effect! Finally I got the Peach Water Gloss which smells amazing and tastes just as good! I used it this morning and I love how well it applies. It’s a bit sheer but the formula is nice and watery which makes it feel very light on the lips and not tacky or sticky on the lips! I got some cool freebies as well which were a cellular phone charm that houses an Etude gloss and a mini toner/lotion set. All and all I’m thrilled to bits with the collection and it cost me under $85 USD for the entire lot of goodies I got. Inexpensive cosmetics that actually work well totally make the Muse’s day! This morning as I mentioned I used almost all the collection to create a beautiful peachy pink look that’s both fresh, fun, and girly! I love how the peach contrasts so beautifully with the pink in my FOTD! I’d normally never pair up peaches and pinks but this came out so well that I’ll be doing so from now on! My attempt to dupe the Etude look as seen on the video! What I Used: Eyes Etude House Cute and Sexy Eye Quad KATE Gel Mascara Etude House Tear Drop Lash Face Etude House Pore Erasing Peach Base Etude House Peach Skin Pact Etude House Peach Beam Blusher Etude House Peach Cheek Blusher Lips Etude House Peach Water Gloss The Peach Makeup Collection from Etude House is most definately Muse Approved!

"['Etude House Peach Skin Pact & Pore Erasing Peach Base: Detailed Review By Isabella Muse on May 2, 2008 34 Comments in Asian Brands , Etude House , Korean Brands Since using the Etude House Peach Skin Pact and Pore Erasing Peach Base I felt like the two items deserved a revisit and deeper review than the short blurb I posted in my original post. Yesterday morning as you may have previously read I used just the Peach Skin Pact and Pore Erasing Peach Base as my sole foundation routine. I did use a touch of concealer under my eyes but aside from that I only prepped and primed my skin with the base and set it with the powder. To my delight the entire look I created came out very fresh, fun, and natural it also happened to last all day long which is why I felt the two items needed more of a detailed review. I’ll start with the Etude House Pore Erasing Peach Base which everyone was quite excited about in my comment box. You’re right to be excited as it’s a wonderful, brilliant primer and the price is ridiculously inexpensive for such a great product. I had the original idea that this might be like Benefit Erase Paste doubling not only as a primer but also as a concealer. Turns out that’s not the case at all. It’s very difficult to explain the exact texture and formula of this product. It’s a cross between matte and moisturizing. It’s of medium thickness and works well when “warmed” prior to use. I found that working it into the back of my hand and applying to my face seemed to make the blending process a bit easier. When it first touches your face it feels very moisturizing and it quickly blends into the skin and has a similar texture as Smashbox Photofinish Primer however it does not pill like Photofinish does. If you’re unfamiliar with the term “pill” it simply means that the primer “balls” up and rolls off the skin in gross, sort of flaky balls. Photofinish does this for me constantly and it also happens to break me out rather badly. Pore Erasing Peach Base does not do either. No break outs and no pilling as I blend. It simply seeps naturally into the skin creating a smooth, flawless finish to the skin while prepping it for your foundation or in my case the Peach Skin Pact. As I had mentioned in my previous post the primer does carry the scent of peaches which I don’t mind in the least however if you’re sensitive to scents or just don’t enjoy your products scented this might be something you wish to avoid. I don’t have particularly large pores however I can imagine this will do a brilliant job of filling pores while allowing your skin to breath. It feels natural and fresh on and is in no way heavy! If you have oily skin this will be an excellent solution for creating a matte finish. With my first application of the base I did notice that my skin turned a ghostly white but after applying the powder it seemed to settle down well. I didn’t mind so much as I am always looking for ways to whiten up my skin as you already know from reading my previous article on whitening your skin! The Peach Skin Pact is the perfect follow up treatment to the base. After applying the base I simply pat the powder on top to create a beautiful finish to my skin. I can already see that both the base and the powder will become a daily part of my routine in the Summer when I don’t want a ton of foundation laying on my skin! The powder, like the base, carries the scent of peaches. The color is a universally flattering beige with a tiny hint of peach to it. It should work well on cooler skin tones including fair and medium but won’t work well on darker or tanned skin. The powder is very light, airy, and silky. It applies beautifully and blends well. You can happily use it as your sole foundation when paired up with the Pore Erasing Peach Base which is exactly what I did yesterday morning! The good news is I applied my makeup at 5:45 AM in the morning and it lasted, without touch ups, until about 6:00 PM in the evening! It began to fade a bit around 6:30 or so. I was shocked as I’ve never had my makeup last this long! All and all I’m extremely pleased with both products and they are, as of now, most definately holy grail products for me! On a different note I know many of you are wondering where I got the haul and such. I briefly explained to a few commentors that I had got my items from a friend who lives in Korea. I did some research around and I haven’t located a single online shop that sells Etude House cosmetics sadly. However, the good news is I did run across several sellers on E-bay. The best one I came across was GinsengSeafood Beauty HK. She appears to be in China and has a small stash of Etude Cosmetics for sale. Her prices range seems to be about $5 USD on top of retail. If you’re interested you can click here to browse her selection of Etude House. The other option I suggest is checking MUA and seeing if anyone would be willing to do a CP that is located in Korea. Finally I would suggest visiting Facial-Shop as per my recommendation of this online shop in my Guide to Shopping for Japanese Cosmetics . The girl who runs the shop, Vivian, had once offered to have some Etude items but I never took her up on the offer. Maybe visit with her and ask if she has anything available. I hope this helps! Happy Shopping! UPDATE: Thanks to one of my gorgeous readers, Humming, we now have another E-bay Seller. It appears this seller has the entire Peach Collection. Sadly the prices are SUPER jacked up but if your lemming is strong have a click here to gather up the Etude House Peach Collection for yourself! Example: The Pore Base is $34.99 USD and retails for $11 USD. Ouchy! You may also enjoy...

"['The Best Japanese SPF and Sunscreens By Isabella Muse on May 18, 2015 35 Comments in Asian Brands , Beauty Abroad , Biore , Fab Favs , Skincare , SPF , Swatches Affiliate Link Purchased I wanted to compile a rather small list of the best Japanese SPF and Sunscreens that I’ve personally used and loved for many a fine year. I’ve used a lot of Japanese sunscreens over the years but three featured in this post are ones I come to back to again and again and again because I love how well they perform, how great they look and feel under makeup, and how fabulous the formula is. Unfortunately, the US market hasn’t quite caught up to the Japanese one when it comes to creating lightweight, easy to absorb SPF formulas. I truly believe the Japanese excel at this which is one of the reason I purchase sunscreen products from Japan. They also happen to be affordable picks as well! Let’s take a look! Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ This is by far one of my favorite gel based SPF sunscreens! This is actually promoted to “apply like water” and can be used on both your face and body. The texture is that of a gel and absorbs into skin so easily without leaving behind a heavy, sticky feel. There is not pastiness or chalky finish with this product and it leaves skin feeling quite hydrated. It’s unfortunately not waterproof nor a particularly good choice if you prefer a more matte SPF. It was actually discontinued last year but recently became available again in new packaging and reformulated to meet Japanese SPF standards plus, as pictured on the left, it now comes in a limited rose fragrance formula (the original has a subtle citrus scent). Biore UV AQUA Rich Watery Mousse SPF 50+ PA++++ This is actually just as lovely as the Watery Essence formula (although I like the Watery Essence a bit better) with a mousse-like texture that absorbs equally easily into the skin and features hyaluronic acid that adds moisture and helps retain it. The texture is interesting in the fact it has a whipped up mousse formula that quickly breaks down and turns watery as you apply it on skin. It’s very light and leaves my skin nicely hydrated. It’s unfortunately not waterproof but absorbs easily into skin. Kanebo Allie Extra UV Gel Mineral Moist N SPF SPF 50+ PA++++ Allie’s Gel Mineral Moist is actually one of the formula I use the most often! This absorbs SO easily it’s like a lightweight moisturizer! The gel texture was newly formulated and acts to bond to the skin making it perfect for warm weather as it resists water, sweat, and sebum allowing it to remain on your skin for a longer amount of time offering better protection. Swatch Above: Watery Essence, Watery Mousse, Mineral Moist These are just some of the many great SPF and Sunscreen formulas that can be found in Japan. The main reason I love Japanese SPF formulas is the fact they absorb so easily and feel like I’m applying moisturizer versus SPF. Here in the US many SPFs are formulated with a very heavy texture that don’t absorb easily. Sometimes you’re forced to wait several minutes to apply your makeup as well! Not the case with Japanese formulas! They tend to apply easily, absorb easily, and allow for instant makeup application. These are a few that top my “Best of” list but there are literally dozens and dozens of others that are equally great! You can shop these and others from Ebay.com seller AlphabeautyUK.

"['Biore UV Aqua Rich Whitening Watery Cream SPF 50+ Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on July 5, 2012 6 Comments in Asian Brands , Beauty Abroad , Biore , Drugstore Makeup Brands , Japanese Brands , Skincare , SPF , Swatches I’ve turned quite a few of you on to the joys of Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery SPF 50+. I love that stuff. Totally my HG (holy grail) SPF of choice. I recently purchased the new Biore UV Aqua Rich Whitening Watery Cream SPF 50+ on a whim to try out. Take a look! Biore UV Aqua Rich Whitening Watery Cream SPF 50+ isn’t as great as the original Aqua Watery Mousse so I do recommend purchasing and trying that before indulging in this version. This is a strong SPF 50+ PA+++ sunscreen with UV filters that include zinc oxide, octinoxate, and titanium dioxide. I purchased it thinking it would act as a whitening base or even as a treatment for dark spots but actually it does neither. At first application skin does have a white cast but this dissipates as the product absorbs. It has a thicker consistency than Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Mousse and more of a creamy-like base. It feels a bit on the greasy side at first application but absorbs easily enough. It leaves a bit of shine behind as well but again, this disappears quickly as the product dries down so you’re left with a soft, smooth, nicely hydrated finish which is long term due to hyaluronic acid in the formula. The product has a citrus scent which I find pleasant and subtle enough that it goes away after application. As with any Japanese SPF it proves far more easier to apply, blend out, and use under makeup than ANYTHING else you’d find on the US market. I liked it well enough however, I do think Watery Mousse has a far superior formula as it seems to absorb quicker and leaves behind a lot less shine at first application. Facts is facts though the formula is an excellent SPF all around and protects skin with a solid SPF 50 in a formula so lightweight that you won’t even realize you have SPF on at all. Loves it! I purchased mine at on E-bay from AlpaBeautyUK for fairly close to Japanese retail sans any drugstore discounts. Lover of the Watery Mousse? Tried this version? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"['Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen SPF 50 Review By Isabella Muse on August 23, 2011 12 Comments in Asian Brands , Beauty Abroad , Japanese Brands , Shiseido , Skincare , SPF , Swatches Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen SPF 50 a necessary evil in my SPF life. If I can, I will avoid milky-type SPF products as I simply don’t like that formula however I will admit some of them I do embrace because they offer superior protection. That’s the case with Anessa. Anessa is a popular range of SPF products and is sub-brand of Shiseido which is available in Japan and a few select Asian countries. It’s terribly crummy that the only Shiseido we really experience here in the US is what we found at our high end counter as Shiseido offers a very WIDE array of various products in Asian countries. Let’s take a look at Anessa and see what it’s such a popular SPF product in Asia. Jump! A popular SPF product available exclusively in Japan. I normally prefer a creamy SPF as my skin is dry and I feel these sink in easier and wear more comfortably however milky type SPF products tend to offer the best waterproof coverage on longer, hotter days that’s when I reach for my Anessa. Anessa is a staple product for really warm, humid, hot days in New York. If you live in incredibly hot climate and you spend alot of time outdoors you NEED this. The formula is a milky type SPF which simply means it resembles milk. It’s pure white, has a runny consistency, and is virtually fragrance free. Anessa tops most milky type products I’ve tried as it has a high resistance to water and sweat. You can swim in it, sweat in it, slay dragons in it, and it’ll pretty much stay in place and keep you protected all day. If I plan on a day outside all I need to do is apply this once as it lasts throughout the day for me and keeps my skin from tanning while protecting it. Although milky white in color it absorbs easily and does not leave behind a white, pale cast on your face. It does start out a little greasy/oily feeling but it dries down to a smooth, matte finish and somehow, someway prolongs foundation wear. I normally feel dry after using milky formulas but I’ve never had an issue with Anessa products. They make a wide range of formulas one of which is a whitening version if that’s something that interests you. For those living in hotter climates or anyone who spends alot of time outside, Anessa is the ideal SPF that wears long while keeping skin protected from harmful sun rays as well as from burning or tanning! No bad here unless you aren’t really a fan of milky SPF products. Those who are stuck up in warm, humid environments year round. Those who are outside alot or all day for work or play purposes. Those needing a waterproof SPF for beach or pool wearin’! Those who don’t want to have to touch up their SPF during the day but want it to wear long, strong, and hard. Those who burn easily. Those who tan easily. Those who don’t really love milky consistency SPF products but prefer more moisturizing ones. Those uninterested in online shopping, airmail, etc…(if you live in a heavily populated Asian community you might wanna check local stores for these products however they aren’t locally sold so online shopping might be necessary). If I have to trust my face with someone on a burning hot day, Anessa is my girl. This one never fails to keep me protected all day long! I don’t love the consistency or the greasy feel of the product prior to dry down but I will admit it creates a perfect shield against the sun and my skin and keeps me from tanning easily plus of course, it protects my skin from harmful sun rays thus keeping me from aging as well! VERY Muse Approved for purchase! An essential item for battling the Summer heat and sun! You can check out Anessa’s range at www.shiseido.co.jp/anessa You may also enjoy...

"['Shu Uemura Whitefficient UV Under Base Brightening Mousse SPF 30 PA+++ Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on August 7, 2012 4 Comments in Asian Brands , Beauty Abroad , Facial Primer , Japanese Brands , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Shu Uemura , Skincare , SPF , Swatches Shu Uemura Whitefficient UV Under Base Brightening Mousse was recently released in Japan. We haven’t seen this one here in the US but fans of Shu’s original UV Mousse will be quite familiar with this one. The original Shu Uemura Whitefficient UV Under Base Mousse offered SPF 30 and came in a soft, mousse formula that absorbed easily. I don’t think they actually carry it anymore in the US but don’t quote me, it’s been a while since I explored Shu’s master line. Shu Uemura Whitefficient UV Under Base Brightening Mousse simply adds the benefits of whitening to the mix. So if you’re looking to brighten, whiten, or ease dullness on your face it might be one you’d select over the original UV base. Take a look! This comes in a aerosol-like can which you can shake to dispense the mousse. The texture and consistency of the base is much like any hair mousse. It’s light, fluffy, and absorbs easily into skin. It has a cool almost wet feel upon application and doesn’t leave skin feeling sticky or tacky after application. I think the idea of applying mousse anything to our faces could be deemed a bit odd but no worries this applies easily. Supposedly the mousse acts as a prep to blur the appearance of pores but I don’t have larger pores so I can’t say if this works or not, I’m leaning towards saying no. The real reason it interested me was it aids in improving the translucency of skin. I combat dullness daily and this offers a way to get brighter skin while easing dullness. It’s supposed to reduce freckles and dark spots with Vitamin C when used daily but I’ve been using it for several weeks and haven’t notice any lightening of my dark spots. The pink purple-ish shade will work best on those with yellow under tones as it reverses the appearance of that yellow and lends skin more of a brighter finish. It also contains an SPF 30 to protect skin and protect it from future damage and aging. It has a super light feel so it really isn’t uncomfortable in the least for wear under foundation. I personally wouldn’t wear it with out foundation or BB Cream because the brightening effect is a bit pasty for use on its own. The brightening/whitening effect is only during wear and doesn’t actually whiten skin. Applying too much can create a white cast so be aware should you try it and use a little bit. If you experience dullness, want whiter, brighter skin and desire SPF coverage in your base this delivers beautifully on all three. I really liked this one and felt like it was an excellent pick for those wanting whiter skin temporarily but didn’t want to commit to something that would whiten permanently. If you’re like me and you have duller skin that needs brightening up this is a perfect pick for easing that dullness. Likey! Muse Approved for purchase. I got mine directly from Japan but AlphabeautyUK as well as Cosme-De.com carry this for close to retail. Sadly, Shu US does not carry it. You may also enjoy...

"['Kao Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery BB Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 10, 2013 10 Comments in Asian Brands , Beauty Abroad , Biore , Japanese Brands , Skincare , SPF , Spring Collections 2013 Purchased Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery BB was released earlier this February for Spring 2013 in Japan. This is Kao’s latest formula of their popular UV Aqua Rich Watery which I absolutely adore. This protects with an SPF 50 PA+++ like the original but this new version is tinted to brighten skin up, ease dullness, and even out skin tone. Take a look! Kao Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery BB is the same great consistency as the original though this time around it isn’t a whipped texture but more of a gel which absorbs easily into skin leaving it delicately hydrated with a subtle citrus scent. It’s one my favorite sunscreens due to the watery texture which applies easily onto skin without leaving behind any odd film on skin. All SPF formulas should have such a great formula like this. This contains a skin tone correcting powder that promises to brighten, ease dullness, and even out skin tone. The shade is a peachy beige color which actually applies fairly transparent but does leave a white cast to skin which in turn results in the brightening effect. Outside of this I didn’t actually see much of a tint from it. The original version doesn’t leave a pasty look behind so really all this does is lend a whitish finish to skin but doesn’t necessarily provide color or color correcting benefits. I do like the gel-like consistency of this version and felt like it absorbed even a little bit better than the original if that’s possible. If you already use and love the original no reason to switch things up for this version. I liked the general idea of a tinted sunscreen that would brighten up skin but it didn’t really have a long term effect that could replace BB Cream, CC Cream, or foundation products. Anyone use the original? How about this new version? Do share! Sasa.com sells much of the Kao Biore Collection. You may also enjoy...

"['the Balm: Balms Away Eye Makeup Break-Up Review By Isabella Muse on May 5, 2008 30 Comments in theBalm Here’s an interesting little product you might want to try for yourself, Balms Away Eye Makeup Break-Up from the Balm. You might be wondering why I am recommending you a $19 USD tin of what appears to be Vaseline. I guess in a way this has the same benefits that simple, cheaper Vaseline does however I definately like this much better than your average run of the mill jar of petroleum jelly! What is Balms Away anyway? Basically it’s a very emollient jelly eye makeup remover that’s packed full of Vitamins, Sterols, Lipids, and most importantly moisturizing goodness for your eye area! I normally use Sephora Eye Makeup Remover which runs me about $8 USD. It’s the best remover I’ve come across that takes it all off with a nice low price tag. Lancome’s Bi-Facil is another favorite of mine but at $26 USD I cringe to purchase it! So why shell out $19 USD for this tin? Simply, because it works. For one thing it’s a large tin at 2.2 oz and since you’re only using a very small amount it should last you a while. Secondly, the moisturizing benefits alone really make me happy! My under eye area seriously needs as much moisture as it can get right now and after massaging off my eye makeup with this my eyes feel so very soft and my lashes conditioned. I experience less lash breakage as well since I’m not tugging around with a cotton ball drenched in eye makeup remover. How’s it work? Simple. Take a tiny amount, close your eyes and massage. Wipe clean with a cotton square or some tissue. One swipe should get it all. I choose to rinse with warm water after I swiped it away with cotton. That’s it, Bob’s your Uncle! Eye makeup all gone and fresh, moisturized eyes in it’s place! The texture quite reminds me of Vaseline. It’s a jelly formula that glides onto your eyes easily. That temporary feeling of cloudy eye vision when I’m using an oil based remover is easily avoided with this. It clearly states on the directions to keep your eyes closed when using but I did crack them open a little to locate my cotton squares and after removal I didn’t experience temporary blindness or cloudy vision which totally made my day as I really hate that feeling! I like this. I know it’s rather expensive but I’m on the bandwagon for a repurchase when I’m finished with this tin! It’s fragrance free for those of you who aren’t too keen on scented products! It removes heavy duty eye makeup including waterproof mascara which is a big plus for me! Pros: Removes heavy duty eye makeup including waterproof mascara! Less tugging while removing your makeup! Gentle massaging gets everything off! Less lash breakage! Packed full of goodness for your eye area! Conditions Lashes! Moisturizes your entire eye area while it removes your makeup! Love the retro packaging! Cons: Price is a bit much but worth it in my humblest opinion! All in all I’m rather happy I spontaneously purchased this. I know the price is a bit much but in the long run I’m thinking it’s worth it. Balms Away Eye Makeup Break-Up is most definately Muse Approved for purchase! Tried this? Love it? Want to try it? What are you using to remove your eye makeup? Tell the Muse!

"['the Balm Powder to the People Brush Review By Isabella Muse on August 30, 2012 18 Comments in Beauty Tools , Fall Collections 2012 , Muse Approved , theBalm the Balm Powder to the People is a new range of Pro Series Brushes that the brand has created and launched for Fall 2012. Considering the Balm never really had a brush set before this could prove exciting! I’ve been following them for a long time now and I only ever remember them having a kabuki so I was excited about this launch. Have a look! This a cruelty-free line of brushes made from a mix of ox, boar, and goat, and synthetic hairs and fibers. The collection consists of five full size brushes ranging in prices from $29.50 to $24.50. Each of the handles of the brushes has a whimsical print featuring the brush’s name. They are kinda a fun, funky looking brush but don’t let the “cute” handles and look fool you, they actually pack quality behind all that whimsy! Brushes Include: the Balm Powder to the People Powder Brush $29.50 the Balm Blend a Hand Tapered Foundation Brush $26.50 the Balm Give Crease a Chance All-Over Eyeshadow Brush/Eye Blending Brush $26.50 the Balm Eye Believe Double-sided Eyebrow/Eyeliner Brush $24.50 the Balm Crease, Love, and Happiness Smudger Brush/Tapered Crease Brush $24.50 The brushes have soft bristles with a nice density so the bristles aren’t flopping around during application. I’ve been using them for about two weeks now and they pretty much live a happy shed-free existence. I have to say I’m at a point I can’t live without the Give Crease a Chance and Crease, Love and Happiness. Both of these are incredible brushes. I like how the blending brush sides are just a little smaller than crease/blending brushes I already own from brands like MAC. This smaller head makes it easier for me to blend into the crease without causing a big mess or going to high up my eye area. Both of these brushes have become instant hits with me. What I don’t like? It’s great getting two brushes in one but I dislike the storage on these. I typically store in old vintage jars and bottles on my vanity and having a dual sided brush makes it hard to store in those jars without bending or smooshing the bristles. But no problem, I just lay them flat in a drawer. I think these might be overlooked by some due to the price tag. Some folks quiver at the idea of dishing out over $20 for a makeup brush. But believe me, you need the right tools to apply your make so I really don’t see a problem with the price overall. You’re going to spend that on a MAC brush anyway and you only get one brush, at least with the Balm’s selection most of these have two sides to enjoy! Likey! Muse Approval for Give Crease a Chance and Crease, Love and Happiness, really loved these two brushes and I imagine they’ll become a staple part of my daily makeup regime. the Balm Powder to the People Brush Collection is available now at www.thebalm.com You may also enjoy...

"['the Balm Time Balm Concealer Review By Isabella Muse on March 18, 2009 7 Comments in theBalm You know the Muse, she’s terribly addicted to concealers. I got many requests asking me to please review the Balm Time Balm Concealer for a while plus I got many recommendations from lovely readers who told me how great it was. I decided it was about time that I try it out for myself to see if all the excitement that surrounds this particular concealer was living up with the Muse’s expectations. It’s good. It’s not great and it’s not my holy grail concealer of choice but it’s not bad. the Balm Time Balm Concealer comes housed in a rather tiny little clear jar that’s about the size of what you’d get a pigment sample in. Although the packaging is tiny it houses plenty of concealer that should last well over a year. Also included is a tiny, circle sponge that blends the concealer in place. Few fun facts about the concealer…. It’s not a moisturizing concealer in any way, shape, or form. If you’re older this is probably not one of the first concealers you’ll want to be reaching for simply because it takes a tiny bit of work to get it in place and blended in thus being older you aren’t going to want to do all that rubbing around the eye area so much (or even if you’re younger for that matter). The product is pigmented enough to hide up plenty of woes such as dark circles, puffy eyes, and fine lines. Although the concealer is more of “harder” texture than what I’d prefer it does cover up amazingly well. I think the key to getting it blended correctly is using the small sponge it comes with. I twirl my finger in the top and dab a few spots under my eyes and proceed to pat on with the sponge. It seems to give a nice airbrushed look by applying this way but I do have to be careful with prepping correctly otherwise it creases and cakes terribly. Coverage is good and the concealer performs pretty well all day without a touch up in between. I think if you prefer, for lack of a better word, a more dense concealer this would be something to consider. The texture is not creamy nor can it be compared to Benefit Boi-ing’s formula which also has a slightly “hard-like” texture. The feel of the product holds it’s own in the concealer department. Overall, it a good concealer but I have doubts I’d repurchase if I ran out as I prefer a more moisturizing concealer. This would be a great one for those who prefer this style of texture in their concealers. Personally, at my age, I’m all about moisturizing concealers. This was nice and quite good but not on my to buy again list. Anyone love it? Tell the Muse!

"['the Balm Time Balm Face Primer Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on March 28, 2011 12 Comments in Facial Primer , Swatches , theBalm the Balm released its Time Balm Face Primer a few months ago. It’s the first primer from the brand and features a vitamin rich formula packed with Vitamins A, C, and E plus anti-inflammatories that help sooth stressed out skin. I’ve been playing around with it the past week or so. Let’s have a look! A velvety face primer to blur fine lines and keep foundation wearing long. I don’t typically like silicone/velvety finish primers as they make me feel all kinds of itchy and irritated however the Balm Time Balm Face Primer was surprisingly lightweight and comfortable to wear. The formula is a typical silicone primer which has a velvety smooth finish however the formula feels considerably lightweight compared to other primers of its kind. It doesn’t cause me to feel like a hundred ants are running under my skin, doesn’t irritate me or make me itchy. The lighter formula is a major plus particularly if you’ve always wanted to use a silicone primer but had the same issues I described above. You’re also getting alot more bang for your buck here as other brands offer 1 oz sizes for $38 or more and the Balm gives you 1 oz for $30. If you’re oily you’ll get a nice smooth finish from this that will mattify your skin and create a powdery finish for your makeup. I’m personally dry and thankfully it applied very smoothly without pilling (rolling off in tiny balls). For the most part the primer will fill smaller pores and finer lines while creating a good base for foundation to adhere to and lock onto so you’ll be looking at extended wear time on your foundation. My normal foundation wear time is about four hours for regular bases and about six to eight with a BB Cream. When using Time Balm Face Primer I can add anywhere form two to three hours wear time. Of course, it is still very cold out so not sure how this will perform in warmer weather. Nothing bad here! Those with oily skin in need of a mattifying primer. Those who want more for less (many other primers range from $38 and upward at this size). Those with finer lines and smaller pores in need of a primer to blur these minor imperfections. Those wanting to extend the wear time of their foundation! Those who want to use a silicone face primer but fear it’ll irritated their skin (the lighter formula wears very comfortably!). Those used to or who prefer a thicker, heavier primer (this is considerably lighter compared to similar primers of its kind). I liked this alot which is saying something considering my poor track record with silicone primers. This wore very comfortably and extended my foundation and BB Cream life by a few extra hours. The price tag is quite nice as well ranging from $8 to $10 less than other brands. Overall, the Balm Time Balm Face Primer is a rather great little primer. Loves it! Anyone try?

"['Yes To Coconut Ultra Hydrating Overnight Eye Balm Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on January 28, 2016 17 Comments in Drugstore Makeup Brands , Eye Cream , Muse Approved , Skincare , Yes to Carrots Affiliate Link PR Sample Yes To Coconut Ultra Hydrating Overnight Eye Balm ($15.99) is a new Ulta exclusive eye cream or eye balm that launched with the Yes to Coconuts Spring 2016 Collection . I have to say the newest Yes to Coconut Collection additions are a very pleasant selection of products for drier skin girls and guys like myself. Of course, I got really excited when I saw they would be launching an eye balm plus it is loaded with fantastic moisturizing ingredients like shea butter and argan oil. Here’s a look! Yes To Coconut Ultra Hydrating Overnight Eye Balm will be available in a 0.5 pump jar for $15.99 (or cheaper if it pops on sale) exclusively at Ulta and Ulta.com. Hopefully at some point they’ll launch it at other locations but as of now Ulta is the spot to grab this one. I love this stuff for one reason, it doesn’t promise me the world. It’s a one trick pony that clearly states it what it is meant for that being moisture nothing more, nothing less. The brand doesn’t spend a whole bunch of time bending your ear with promises to depuff your puffy eyes, erase your dark circles, eliminate your fine lines, etc…etc… None of that. They simply tell you this is an “indulgent” treatment with moisturizing ingredients. Thank you Yes to Coconuts for being so honest. Their theory and mentality, just like my own, is to treat your finer lines and wrinkles with moisture. Lots and lots of moisture. This contains virgin coconut oil, shea butter, and argan oil. It has a whipped light fluffy consistency that absorbs in a snap under eyes. I think balm could potentially be misleading as at first I thought this was some sort of eye stick. After opening it I realized it was in a pump and in that case I thought maybe it was thicker. Yanno balm!? So I thought thick, creamy. Nope, it’s very light and fluffy and that’s fine by me as it absorbed in a snap. I wouldn’t say it was heavily moisturizing for a night eye cream but it still softens, smooths, and hydrates the under eye very, very nicely. I’ve taken to use it as a day eye cream because it wears well under concealer and provides just the right amount of moisture so my finer lines look a heck of a lot better. All in all Yes To Coconut Ultra Hydrating Overnight Eye Balm excels at what it was developed for, moisture! This is a lightweight, lightly moisturizing eye cream that should work great for those with normal to moderately dry eyes. Personally I have pretty dry eyes but I like using a lighter eye cream in the day versus the heavier ones I prefer in the evening. Although this formula is marketed as a nightly eye cream I like it as a nice, light daily eye cream. For sensitive users it does have a soft coconut milk smell. As I said I love the brand markets it for one thing and one thing only and it works great at what it was formulated to do! Good stuff.

"['Kao Biore Aqua Rich Watery BB Launches in Japan By Isabella Muse on February 26, 2013 15 Comments in Asian Brands , Beauty Abroad , Biore , Drugstore Makeup Brands , Japanese Brands , Spring Collections 2013 I’m happy to report Kao has launched their next generation Aqua Rich Watery product in the form of a BB Cream. Biore Aqua Rich Watery BB contains the same great formula as the original Aqua Rich Watery SPF 50 which has a mousse-like texture and a moisturizing finish but also now acts as BB Cream for giving skin a brighter appearance on application. I love the idea of it still containing a generous SPF 50 as well as being tinted to even out skin tone and to act as a tinted moisturizer of sorts. Even if it doesn’t provide the same great benefits as a regular BB Cream I’m still interested in trying it out as I use and love the original sunscreen only version. This retails for $7-$10 in Japan so expect to pay $14.99 and upwards when it reaches online shops. I’ll be reviewing it shortly. If you tried it feel free to share your thoughts!

"['the Balm Nude Dude Eyeshadow Palette Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on October 2, 2014 24 Comments in Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Fall Collections 2014 , Holiday Collections 2014 , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Swatches , theBalm Affiliate Link PR Sample the Balm Nude Dude Eyeshadow Palette Volume 2 is a new permanent eyeshadow palette that the Balm has introduced for Fall/Holiday 2014 that contains 12 shades of shadow, a brush, and a full size the Balm Body Builder Mascara. Yes, this is kinda a Nude’Tude Eyeshadow Palette Volume 2 of sorts! I think everyone gets terribly excited when the Balm launches a new eyeshadow palette! For myself, I know I was very excited about the Balm Nude Due Eyeshadow Palette because it housed a ton of pretty natural shades but also because I can grab it up easily at Kohl’s! Don’t worry it’ll be available on the Balm’s website shortly and but as of now it’s available at kohls.com and will pop up in store soon as well! I sure do miss the Balm at Sephora but I’m every so delighted they are available at Kohl’s now! Sometimes it’s nice being able to grab your fav brand in store versus waiting for an online shipment ya know? The original palette had featured a pin up girl design which also follows through on the front of the new palette however, inside, you’ll find some pin up guys! You’re either going to find the palette completely cute or completely tacky. Personally, for me, it’s a little of both. My mind is that of a 13 year old boy so I had that moment of giggles erupting when I saw the pictures of the “dudes” inside! My girl side was all “awwww such cute packaging” but my inner boy side was like, “there are near naked people on this palette!”. There’s a generously sized mirror inside the palette as well as a dual ended shadow and liner brush. I thought the liner side of the brush very handy but the shadow brush was a little too small for all over lid use. The palette is made from a sturdy cardboard and features a magnetic closure. The original palette featured some very pretty shades of gold, taupe, and neutral browns with a good deal of shimmer. The new palette has a wide range of natural shades along with some sultry richer browns in a mix of matte and shimmer formulas. At a glance the shades looked chalky but they actually apply and swatch beautifully although they are quite powdery and crumble easily. Colors are nicely pigmented with a velvety texture and the mattes have a very silky, soft, easy to blend texture. There’s a lot more variety in terms of color here as you’re getting some basic nude shades but there are also stand out shades like a soft rosy matte, a pretty golden purple, and even a beautifully reddish brown. All the colors performed solidly! There isn’t one shade here that had me thinking, “Oh this is dry” or “Oh this is chalky!”. The texture is very soft, very easy to blend, and quite pigmented. The only issue that might be a problem for some is the softer texture translates into a good deal of powdery dust up when a brush or sponge is swiped across the surface of the shadows. Aside from this all of the colors were beautifully formulated. the Balm Nude Dude Eyeshadow Palette the Balm Nude Dude Eyeshadow Palette the Balm Nude Dude Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Faithful, Fearless, Fabulous, Flawless) the Balm Nude Dude Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Flirty, Firm, Fit, Fietsy) the Balm Nude Dude Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Fine, Funny, Friendly, Fierce) Of course, if you’re a color lover you might not love the Balm Nude Dude Eyeshadow Palette! Or perhaps you felt happy enough with the Nude’Tude Eyeshadow Palette’s shade selection but were hoping for a follow up that included more color this time around! I’m personally happy with these shades as they are wonderfully rich colors for Fall looks and will easily work for daily work looks! But if you’re wanting lots of color, this isn’t the palette for you sadly! (Wearing Funny and Fearless) (Wearing Flirty and Feisty) All in all the Balm Nude Dude Eyeshadow Palette was quite lovely. the Balm rarely disappoints and I’m positive this palette is going to win a ton of hearts and fans!

"['the Balm Put a Lid On It Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on February 1, 2013 36 Comments in Eye Primer , Makeup Reviews , Spring Collections 2013 , Swatches , theBalm For its few venture into the eyeshadow primer world the Balm done good with their new Put a Lid On It Primer ($18, 0.4oz). This little primer took a second to grow on me but now I’m pretty sure I love it. Fond fans of Too Faced Shadow Insurance will love this one. Take a peek! So I don’t like Too Faced Shadow Insurance. I’m waiting for everyone to boo me and throw tomatoes at me for saying that. Sorry, I just get this greasy separated feeling from it….I like the density of Urban Decay Primer Potion much better or at least I did until they changed the formula. Now the Balm Put a Lid On It ventures into the realms of Too Faced’s own primer a little bit but it doesn’t have the separation issue to contend with, PHEW! YES! This is a thick almost vaseline-like texture with a creamy, hydrating feel. Not exactly what you want from an eyeshadow primer right? No worries, although it slips and slides around your lid as you apply it has a smooth, satiny dry down that’s almost matte-like in finish for shadows to adhere too. Surprised? Me too. The creamy texture is highly misleading. It has a slight silicone feel as I apply but the dry down is where the magic happens. Although I was uncomfortable applying it on my lids I’m fine with it after it sets. It only takes 5 or so seconds for it to completely set and get ready for shadow. The product has a knack for wrapping my entire lid in a weightless film so my shadow isn’t actually touching my skin but merely laying on top of the second “skin” created by the primer. This basically leads to a smooth, crease-free shadow wear all day. With this in place I can get anywhere from 8 to 12 hours of crease-free eyeshadow wear. Now…take note…I think it works best with powders as I tried it with creams and only experienced about six hours of wear before I saw some creasing action. If you’re a powder user and have issues with shadows fading, creasing, and happen to be a fan of Too Faced Shadow Insurance, I think you’ll get on just fine with the Balm’s new Put a Lid On It Eyelid Primer. Nice stuff! It’ll be available this month from thebalm.com A few folks probably already got it as it was available as a special preview from Bircbox . If you tried it, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

"['Mally Beauty Evercolor Shadow Extender Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 12, 2012 14 Comments in Eye Primer , Makeup Reviews , Mally Beauty , Muse Approved , Swatches Mally Evercolor Eyeshadow Extender Primer had me quite curious when I saw it pop up on QVC recently. I sound like a broken record but I’ve been trying to find a shadow primer as good as my beloved Urban Decay Primer Potion which isn’t as great as it once was. The formula changed dramatically since they introduced the tube packaging and I haven’t been able to get the greatest hold ever after that. Recently Make Up For Ever Eye Primer crossed my path and I’m loving it but I’m always up for something new and exciting which is why I decided I’d give Evercolor Eyeshadow Extender a try. What could it hurt? Well, it changed my life. Like blew my mind. You NEED it. At a glance this looked like one of those shadow base slash primers that brighten eyes up and can be worn alone. But actually, it’s completely transparent so it is indeed for shadow priming only. At $26 for 0.25 oz I was a little scared of the price because hey, I pay $20 for Primer Potion and that’s 0.37oz in size. But I assure you, it is worth the extra money particularly if you have oily lids. Mally is fond of calling her makeup bulletproof and let me tell you, Evercolor Eyeshadow Extender is indeed bulletproof. Nothing is getting passed this. It will hold eyeshadows, loose pigments and minerals, and cream shadow for 24 hour straight if that’s what you need. This stuff is amazing. The formula is a lightweight beige that applies transparently. The texture is somewhat similiar to Primer Potion or even Make Up For Ever’s Primer but it has a certain tackiness to it. Don’t worry, the tack isn’t a bother at all and the primer blends perfectly well on lids. The glue-like feel of it mattifies the eye amazingly. It’s as if you’re coating your lid and completely sealing off the area and creating a waterproof “skin” for shadow to adhere to. I had my sister try a little of it since she has super oily lids (mine are drier) and she was absolutely astounded with how well it mattified them. I don’t have oily lids but even I can feel how it seals moisture off the area and creates a perfect base for powder. Needless to say it wears strong and long and allows shades to remain crease-free and fade proof until you’re ready to remove them. Overall, it’ll set you back a little bit more than you might be used to paying for your regular primer of choice but to me it was well worth it. I hate to say it but this is taking the place of my MUFE Primer immediately. I think I’ve finally found my HG (holy grail) Eyeshadow Primer again. I won’t be without this one. LOVES it! You NEED it. Obviously Muse Approved for purchase. Tried it? Do share! You can get it at QVC.com You may also enjoy...

"['Coastal Scents Step One Eye Primer Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on November 12, 2013 13 Comments in Coastal Scents , Eye Primer , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Swatches , Winter Collections 2013 Coastal Scents Step One Eye Primer ($9.95) is a new eyeshadow primer that recently launched. Since Urban Decay changed the packaging on Primer Potion I’ve been trying a variety of eyeshadow primers like Make Up For Ever Eye Primer and NYX HD High Definition Eyeshadow Base . I’ve liked plenty of them but I have to admit none really are as great as the original Urban Decay Primer Potion formula. Coastal Scents Step One Eye Primer had me curious and I was a bit worried when I saw the tube formula. It seems tubes are an open invitation for eyeshadow primers to separate and become oily….I’m talking to you Too Faced Shadow Insurance and Urban Decay Primer Potion. So I gave it a whirl and… I loved it. I really didn’t expect to like this but Coastal Scents seems to have mastered with Urban Decay couldn’t. They tubed their shadow primer and it freaking worked. Thank the makeup gods! Coastal Scents Step One Eye Primer has a creamy yet denser formula that blends seamlessly on lids. The texture isn’t slippery nor does it squeeze out of the tube in an oily, separated mix. The slightly dense yet creamy texture applies to a semi-matte finish on lids and allows for a thin second-skin like layer on lids for shadows to adhere to. Shadows stick to it like glue so it not only prevents them from fading, creasing, or losing their intensity but it also makes an excellent base to give your shadows a more intense finish. I honestly didn’t expect to love this but I was very happy with the results. It keeps my shadows well long and strong and the texture is sport on for what I wanted and expected from UDPP! If you have issues with UDPP or TFSI you’ll likely adore this formula! It’s available now at www.coastalscents.com. Muse Approved. Tried it? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"['Mally Eye Brightening Long-Wear Shadow Base Duo Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on February 7, 2011 4 Comments in Concealer , Eye Primer , Mally Beauty , Spring Collections 2011 , Swatches I absolutely adored the idea behind the Mally Eye Brightening Long-Wear Shadow Base Duo when I saw her present it on QVC. The concept of the product allows for a long wearing base to be worn as a primer for shadows with a pearl finish or to be worn alone to brighten the area up plus an eye brighten which had a matte finish to be worn under your eye to brighten the eye area up. Basically Mally combined the two products in one compact and allows each product to perform two great functions. It seemed ideal to me as I’m always looking for a great base outside of my beloved Benefit Love Aid to use as both an eyeshadow primer or just worn alone plus something to brighten my eye area. Who doesn’t want wide awake, fatigue-less eyes? This compact sounded like the ultimate solution! Here are my thoughts! A dual compact that houses an eyeshadow primer and brightener! I LOVE the idea of this product and really enjoy the packaging. Part of its appeal is the packaging as it houses not one product but two. I like the idea of having commonly used products in one place and this is exactly how the product is designed as one side has your eye brightener and the other your eye primer. Perfect! The eye brighten is a gorgeous formula and pretty much can be easily used as a concealer if you so choose as I felt like it was an identical formula to Mally’s Cancellation Concealer that I already own and love. Formula is pigmented, blends easily, and brightens the eye up without any doubt. I do feel that using concealer as well as this isn’t necessary as I can easily use this as my concealer however if I need extra coverage I can do a light coverage with my normal concealer and pat a bit of this on top for extra brightening power. This is a matte finish but don’t let that sway you into believing that it might be drying or powder-like as that’s simply not the case. Formula is emollient and blends easily under my dry eyes. Now I loved the idea of the shadow base/primer as I thought I’d make proper use out of it for my eyeshadows plus use it in place of Benefit Lemon Aid to brighten my lid. I thought this would prove ideal for days I wanted to go without shadow and just indulge in a nude eye lid. However…. Formula isn’t as forgiving on the base sadly as it has a pearl finish which creases rather badly when worn alone or under eyeshadows plus it has a certain knack for aging my eyes rather than simply leaving behind a nice, nude lid. I blame the pearl finish as it’s not my most flattering finish and comes across a tad frosty and shimmery. Far be it from me to say something is TOO shimmery as I adore my sparkle but this just doesn’t do much for my lids! Sadly, it’s only available in a light and dark finish. Light should do well on fair and medium fair skin but dark may be limited to olive or tanned skin, nothing darker I don’t believe. Anyone looking for a lid brightener and primer all in one (two products, one compact, perfect for travelin’). Anyone with dark circles, tired eyes, or fine lines (the brightening cream will do wonders with these areas). Those seeking a good shadow base to prevent creasing and fading (this is great for use with pigments as it’ll prevent falls outs plus it gives shadows a little extra pop but for fading and creasing it doesn’t do the trick as my shadows began to crease and slide around within an hour of use). Like I said I loved the concept of the product but it failed to work in some aspects. I actually ended up returning it as I thought merely using one side was a bit wasteful as I can’t see myself using the shadow base and since the other side was so much like a concealer I already own, well, needless to say it seemed a bit of a waste overall. In theory it sounds great but it fails to work so well at keeping my shadow locked into place and even without shadow it doesn’t do any wonders worn on its own. Wanted to love it but just didn’t make the cut sadly. Anyone try? Love? Leave? Share it. Available from QVC. You may also enjoy...

"['Mally Cancellation Concealer Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on May 28, 2014 12 Comments in Concealer , Makeup Reviews , Mally Beauty , Swatches Purchased It seems like too long ago I purchased the Mally Cancellation Concealer System! This kit used to come with a single concealer and a transparent pressed silica powder to set the concealer as well as a dual ended brush for application. Recently I noticed the new Mally Cancellation Concealer Palette on QVC.com and realized she revamped the original set quite nicely. Now the concealer and powder is housed in a single palette where as before it came with two single compacts. I know that most folks hate the idea of powders and cream in one place but I actually felt like this made the compact more travel friendly and I honestly didn’t feel like I was getting powder into the cream concealer at all when using it so I think I’m quite cool with the new packaging! It still comes with the same great double ended brush as well! Let’s check it out! If anything at all the Mally Cancellation Concealer most reminds me of Bobbi Brown’s Creamy Concealer Kit but the formula is in no way a dupe just the designs are very much the same. Not only has the packaging changed on the concealer but also the powder included. She did away with the silica powder and replaced it with a light buttery yellow powder. If you have dark circles the combination of the concealer and powder will help to diffuse them. I loved the texture of the concealer back in the day and I still love it. It’s a lighter, emollient concealer that blends easily under my drier eyes with a hydrating, creamy texture. It seems to run a touch sheerer compared to the original formula because as I recall I was terribly impressed with the awesome pigment of the original but this version seems to be a little thinner and a little less pigmented. No worries though as it does great diffusing the look of my dark circles, brightening my under eye area up, and creating a nice, flawless finish under my eyes. The formula wears strong for me without creasing or fading easily. I get about six hours of wear if I don’t set it with powder and about eight when I do. Mally Cancellation Concealer Swatches (Medium) The powder is lovely as well but I wish it was a touch silkier. I thought the powder’s consistency was a bit chalky and as I applied it seemed to want to creep into my finer lines. Thankfully it doesn’t age my eyes but I thought it was a touch difficult to work with. Thankfully Mally includes a dual ended brush which has a bushier blending brush on one end to use with the powder and a flat head concealer brush on the other. The bushier blending bush is ideal for buffing the powder on under eyes. I remember hailing the original system but I think there’s been a bit of a revamp here that’s not limited to the packaging. It’s still a great product but there are a few hiccups to contend with during use and some might be disappointed that the concealer runs sheerer compared to the older version! Would I recommend trying it? Sure! It’s a great concealing system regardless of the few problems it has ? Available now at qvc.com. Own it? Do share your thoughts! You may also enjoy...

"['Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Palette Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on December 10, 2015 5 Comments in Coastal Scents , Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Holiday Collections 2015 , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Swatches PR Sample The Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Eyeshadow Palette ($19.95) is a new eyeshadow palette launching tomorrow (12/11) that contains 20 smoky eyeshadow shades. This is the fourth Coastal Scents Revealed Eyeshadow Palette to launch so if you have the other three I figure you’re going to want the fourth for your collection right? ? Personally I try my hardest to skip out on smoky, darker eyeshadow shades to be honest because my eyes are aging now and I feel like darker colors accentuate dryness, finer lines, etc….but I actually loved the color line up in this palette and thought the shades were wearable. And of course, the Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Palette is kinda a cheaper dupe up of the recently released Urban Decay Naked Smoky Eyeshadow Palette. Let’s take a look! The Urban Decay Naked Smoky Eyeshadow Palette will set you back $54 and holds 12 smoky eyeshadow shades. Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Palette is $19.95 and holds 20 smoky shades so this is a nice little budget option for those not wanting to dish out close to $60 bucks for Urban Decay’s version. I wouldn’t say this is a dupe of UD because the formulas are vastly different but if you’re not willing to spend $54 on Naked Smoky yet you want a variety of smoky eyeshadow shades you’ll be quite happy with the Revealed Smoky Palette. This comes housed in a slim line sturdy cardboard palette. I love these palettes because they store really easily and although it doesn’t have a good closure it still manages to travel friendly as well plus I’m not feeling badly if it does break during travel since it didn’t cost me a kidney. I have to say that the Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Palette is my favorite of all four of the Revealed Palettes. Why? The eyeshadows in this palette aren’t nearly as frosty as shades from past palettes in this range. I’m not saying there aren’t a few metallic, frostier shades in this palette because there are but they are very few and most of the shades are creamy with gorgeous color pay off and a smooth, soft formula that applies and blends easily. The palette is actually filled with a selection of finishes that include mattes, metallics, shimmers, and satins. The lighter matte shades are soft and silky where as the darker shades are a LITTLE patchy but nothing that a little primer doesn’t help along. The metallics are soft and creamy-like in consistency with some fall out but they apply beautifully although they do tend to look a little frosty so blend well to avoid this. The satins and shimmers are also creamy and velvety in consistency with an easy to apply and blend formula that looks amazing. These shades pack plenty of pigment for those wanting drama. I used a taupe metallic shade on my eyes along with a matte taupe to accent in my look below and I thought it applied easily and looked very nice. Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Palette Swatches Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Palette Swatches Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Palette Swatches Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Palette Swatches Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Palette Swatches The palette isn’t completely about traditional smoky shades. It’s actually filled with a good deal of blacks, silvers, and taupes which for me is the quintessential smoky eye look. But you also get browns, golds, plums, navys, and other shades to create a variety of other non-traditional smoky eye looks. Personally I really like the variations of taupe in this palette! Taupe is a lot easier to wear for me in a smoky look versus black. All in all the Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Eyeshadow Palette has a little something for everyone who’s shopping on a beauty budget this year. It’s a nice round up of eyeshadows with a beautiful texture that will create many gorgeous looks. Coastal Scents often has sales as well so you’ll likely be able to snag this on sale at some point and grab and even better deal. But if you can’t wait the Coastal Scents Revealed Smoky Palette arrives tomorrow at coastalscents.com. Will you be purchasing it? You may also enjoy...

"['Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer Kit Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on March 9, 2011 38 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Concealer , Spring Collections 2011 , Swatches Have you seen Bobbi’s new concealer video? Check it out at www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/learn I love how Bobbi makes everything look so incredibly easy! The new Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer Kit is a new breed of Bobbi’s popular concealer. The formula is improved and not only conceals your under eye woes but also maintains your skin’s moisture levels so your concealer always looks fresh. Here are my thoughts on her new concealer! A creamy concealer and setting powder duo! I started out my concealer life hating Bobbi’s concealer. I purchased one of her palettes and felt like it creased rather badly and that the formula was a tad too heavy. I tossed it aside. And suddenly it got a new lean on life when I tried it again. The more you use her concealer, the more you’ll appreciate it and that’s what happened to me. At first it feels a little too thick, a little too creamy, a little too heavy…but you have to use it a few times to understand how the formula works. The Creamy Concealer Kit pretty much mimics any concealer you’d find at your local Bobbi Brown counter. It’s thick, it’s emollient, it’s extra creamy, and it’s pigmented. The formula is ideal for those with very dark circles and those who suffer from drier under eyes. It pretty much conceals all my woes without issues. I admit I cheat on it alot but I’ve always come back to it and love it because it simply works. Part of the appeal of the Creamy Concealer Kit is the size and the setting powder included. I ended up purchasing the shade Sand which includes a yellow based pressed powder, kinda like Skin Food Salmon Powder that I love so much. The size of the palette is kinda fun as it looks like a small contact lenses holder. It’s $32 for .21 oz compared to the normal concealers/correctors at $22 for the same price but you have to take into consideration the fact you’re also getting powder with the compact. I loved the powder. It’s a pressed version of Skin Food’s Salmon Powder to me. The yellow base does a great job of neutralizing dark circles and setting the concealer for all day wear, literally, seriously, Bobbi’s concealer goes no where when it’s set correctly. It wears long and strong all day long. If you have serious darkness, finer lines, puffiness, or you’re eyes are just looking very tried, Bobbi Brown’s Creamy Concealer Kit is for you! Sadly, the kit is a bit messy. I never had any problems with my concealer palette which also has powder but the smaller size of this palette makes for a mess when combing cream and powder in one place. The powder kicks up a fair bit of dust which ends up in the powder and becomes messy. The palettes features a mirror which I appreciate but I have no place to go with excess concealer. There isn’t any rim on the well to remove excess from my brush nor can I wipe it on the inner lid of the palette (which I prob would have done if the mirror wasn’t there). Since the concealer is extra creamy I prefer having some place to blend it into my brush and a rim of some sort would be ideal for that. Needless to say after two uses the palette is already starting to become messy. Those with dark circles in need of a pigmented concealer to cover them. Those in need of hydrating concealer. Those who need a heavier concealer for concealing it all! Those who desire a lightweight concealer. Those who do not have major problems under their eyes. Those who aren’t interested in having their powder and cream products in one very small space. Although packaging has some quirks I’m still happy with this purchase overall. Prior to this a pressed powder has never been available from Bobbi Brown directly or at least not to my knowledge. I’ve only been privy to the powder in a concealer palette that I’ve purchased twice from QVC. I don’t mind loose powder for setting but I find the pressed is easier use. Overall, if you’re still searching for your HG concealer still, this might be one to check out. Raves from me! Muse Approved for purchase! You may also enjoy...

"['Urban Decay Naked Smoky Eyeshadow Palette Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 3, 2015 50 Comments in Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Fall Collections 2015 , Makeup Reviews , Swatches , Urban Decay Affiliate Link PR Sample The Urban Decay Naked Smoky Eyeshadow Palette ($54) launches on July 8th with 12 delicious shades of Urban Decay Eyeshadow in smoky, sultry shades. Nine of the Urban Decay Naked Smoky Palette shades are brand new colors so there’s lots of delicious newness packed into this palette. Naked Smoky Eyeshadow Palette is definitely a new twist on an old cult favorite. Considering we’ve had over three different variations of the Urban Decay Naked Palette I’d say it was about time for a change up so here we are with twelve smoky shades. Take a look! The Urban Decay Naked Smoky Eyeshadow Palette brings not only new shades to the table but also plenty of new packaging as well. The palette is a hard heavy plastic design with gunmetal printing and a smoky screen layer on the top with a full size mirror inside. The palette has a tortoiseshell look and feel that quite reminds me of the Bobbi Brown Tortoise Shell Eye Palette that launched a few years back but the main difference being Urban Decay uses a soft smoky taupe coloring for their compact. Also in a change up you’ll find a how to get the look guide inside the box which features tips and tricks for creating a smoky eye as well as four get the look guides with step by step instructions for color placement to create a smoky eye look (look guides include the Iconic UD Smoky Eye, Smoky Reality Star, Smoky Cat, and Everyday Smoky). You also get a double ended crease brush which has a fine point on one side and a blending brush on the other. I, for one, prefer the brush over the 24/7 Glide On Pencil because I feel like I have a lot of eyeliners already and the brush is just handier in my humblest. It has soft brushes and the blending brush seems to have longer bristles than the one we typically get with Naked Palettes. It’s a solid, good quality brush and if you’re traveling with this palette it’s likely all you need for application. This palette isn’t a traditional smoky eye one to me as it isn’t really dominated by silvers, grays, or blacks which for me are shades that create the quintessential smoked eye in my opinion. It has those shades but it also has warm bronzes, rich browns, taupes, and other colors that can be used to create smoky taupe eye looks, smoky brown ones, and of course, the traditional black smoky eye look. You get a range of matte and satin finishes as well as sparkles Shades include: New shades: Smolder Deep plum-taupe (New) Password Cool taupe matte (New) Whiskey Rich brown matte (New) Slanted Light metallic gray (New) Dagger Medium charcoal with micro-shimmer (New) Combust Soft pink-taupe (New) Thirteen Light beige satin (New) High Champagne shimmer with micro-glitter (New) Dirtysweet Medium bronze (New) Repromted Shades: Radar Metallic taupe with iridescent micro-glitter (Vice 2) Armor Metallic silver-taupe with tonal sparkle (Vice) Black Market Jet black satin (Vice) Urban Decay Naked Smoky Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Smolder, Slanted, Dagger, Black Market) Urban Decay Naked Smoky Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (High, DirtySweet, Radar, and Armor) Urban Decay Naked Smoky Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Thirteen, Password, Whiskey, Combust) The formula feels a little different to me than Naked 1, Naked 2, and Naked 3. The texture on the shadows is a little denser and not as velvety. I also felt the shades were thinner in consistency and considerably less metallic than the past Naked Palette range. Don’t be scared, this is all a good thing as I like this texture since it feels like the shades have a lot less fall out and aren’t as frosty on my eyes. As much as I love the Naked Palettes I find some of the shades are really heavy with a metallic finish that looks frosty on my eyes and lord knows frosty and I do not get along well. I like the thinner, lighter texture on these colors. No chunky glitter here either aside from Armor which did have a fair bit of silver glitter which had a tendency to fall all over my face. Aside from this color none of the other shades had fall out issues. I found the mattes silky but Smolder was a little patchy for me. All in all the shades were easy to apply, easy to blend, and had excellent pigmentation. The Urban Decay Naked range is a much loved cult favorite but it was getting a little repetitive. The Urban Decay Naked Smoky breaths new life into the collection and gives us a way to get gorgeous smoky, sultry eye looks! This palette will become a must have for those who adore smoky eye looks. It’s an easy to use palette filled with gorgeous Urban Decay Eyeshadows and well worth a purchase when it launches because who doesn’t want to sport a smoky eye from time to time during an evening out? The Urban Decay Naked Smoky Eyeshadow Palettes arrives at urbandecay.com on July 8th at July 12th at Ulta.com and on July 16th at Ulta Stores. I don’t have an exact Sephora or Sephora.com date but hopefully around the same time as Ulta’s launch and later on at Macy’s and beauty.com.

The Coastal Scents Revealed Palette is actually the best beauty budget pick up for those really strapped for cash because it combines the greatness of Urban Decay Naked 1 and Naked 2 into one great palette. It’s packed with 20 natural eyeshadows shades in a range of matte, metallic, frost, shimmer, and satin finish shades that range in color from the most basic of beige to the most rocking of taupes. If you can’t create a fabulous nude look with this incredible palette you’re doing something wrong. And even today, at its regular price of $19.99 it still packs awesome into a fabulously low cost. This one you NEED. Housed in a slim line case without a mirror the Coastal Scents Revealed Eyeshadow Palette is a friendly to store, easy to travel with palette that’s packed with twenty eyeshadow choices. I didn’t compare any of the colors to my Urban Decay Naked 1 or Naked 2 Palettes but at a glance you can easily pick quite a few shades here that are easily duped in both palettes so it is kinda like having a combination of Naked 1 and Naked 2 in one spot. A majority of the shades are beautifully textured with a super velvety, buttery consistency that blends easily onto lids with great pigmentation. I was duly impressed with the texture on these eyeshadows as they wear well without creasing or fading and have absolutely no chunky fall out of huge chunks of glitter or shimmer. The mattes are a touch dry and not as silky as I would like but still very workable with a little TLC. I didn’t like the frosts at all but that’s just a preference as I’m not keen on a frosty finish. On the upside I’m thankful there aren’t many frosts to contend with here anyway. The palette packs just about everything you could want or need in a natural palette. There’s matte beiges shades to highlight with, there’s metallic bronzes and browns, and tons of taupes, even black for a more smoky eye look as well as barks, golden browns, and coppers. It pretty much covers a wide range of colors in a small space. This is one of those palettes you can easily travel with and not carry your entire makeup collection with you because you feel you left something behind! There’s twenty shades of eyeshadow here that you’ll likely make use of across the board, daily especially if you’re a girl or guy who loves browns, naturals, bronzes, etc….! Obviously as per my discussion above the formula is beautiful for a palette for this price point! I wouldn’t say it is spot on to Urban Decay’s formula, Urban Decay does have a creamier more intensely pigmented eyeshadow, but there’s not a lot to complain about here either and the shadow formula is on par with single shadows you’d get from NYX Cosmetics, Stila, or even MAC. Overall, the Coastal Scents Revealed Palette packs a punch into my beauty budget world! This is a must have palette for anyone who loves natural shades with a formula that rocks. Well done Coastal Scents! I look forward to seeing more eyeshadow palettes like this one. Muse Approved. Available now at www.coastalscents.com . Own it? Do share your thoughts on it!

"['Urban Decay Naked 3 Eyeshadow Palette Available Soon By Isabella Muse on November 12, 2013 49 Comments in Spring Collections 2014 , Urban Decay It’s coming! The Urban Decay Naked 3 Eyeshadow Palette and you can be the first to know when it does launch. I’ll have a review and swatches live shortly but….see some details below! We’ve spent a LOT of time getting Naked the past few years. We’ve done bronzy and taupey neutrals, but we realized there was a whole spectrum of gorgeous, flushed pinks we hadn’t explored yet. Rose-based hues look great on every skin tone. With 12 new shades, it’s hard to choose favorites, but we predict that Buzz (the pinkest of all the shades) will be a fan favorite. We’re also partial to Nooner (a stunning pinky-brown matte) and Dust (a pale metallic pink shimmer with amazing iridescent glitter), which can be worn on the lids or used as a highlighter. And for an edgy, smoky liner, there’s the aptly named Blackheart—a super dimensional black matte flecked with red glitter. The Urban Decay Naked palette revolutionized neutrals forever—and went on to become one of the best-selling palettes EVER. When fans demanded more, Naked2 delivered. Even now, three years after the frenzy first started, the requests for “MORE Naked palettes!” keep coming. Finally, the wait is over. Urban Decay launches Naked3, featuring 12 TOTALLY NEW (and insanely beautiful!) rose-hued neutrals. Our previous Naked palettes have always included new shades, but this is the first time we’ve done a Naked palette with 12 never-before-seen shades that aren’t available anywhere else. Choose from every finish imaginable: ultra-smooth mattes, gorgeous pearls and glimmering metallics. From the palest, shimmery pink to deep, warm black, these neutrals will make you want to get Naked all over again. Naked 3 comes in an art-school-inspired tin case (reminiscent of the Naked2 palette)—in a gorgeous rose-gold color that hints at the shades inside. Embossed on top with a big “Naked3” and cool facets that beg to be touched, this case is sure to inspire lots of jealous stares. Each Eyeshadow features our Pigment Infusion System™, the proprietary blend of ingredients that gives every shade its velvety texture, rich color, serious staying power and blendability. Naked3 also includes a NEW double-ended Good Karma Shadow and Blending Brush AND an Eyeshadow Primer Potion sampler with resealable samples of all four formulas (original, Sin, Eden and NEW anti-aging). Each sample holds about a week’s worth of primer! Shades: Strange Pale neutral pink matte-satin Dust Pale metallic pink shimmer with iridescent micro-glitter Burnout Light pinky-peach satin Limit Light dusty rose matte Buzz Metallic rose shimmer with silver micro-glitter Trick Light metallic pinky-copper shimmer with tonal micro-sparkle Nooner Medium pinky-brown matte Liar Medium metallic mauve shimmer Factory Pinky-brown satin Mugshot Metallic taupe shimmer with slight pink shift Darkside Deep taupe-mauve satin Blackheart Smoky black matte with rosy red micro-sparkle The Urban Decay Naked 3 Eyeshadow Palette ($52) will be available later this month from urbandecay.com and at Sephora, Ulta, and Macys stores and online in December.

"['Urban Decay Naked 2 Palette Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on December 6, 2011 71 Comments in Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Palettes , Spring Collections 2012 , Swatches People are getting Naked everywhere around the world for the Holiday Season. As for me, I say there’s no place like home for the Holidays so I’m getting Naked at home, right in front of my Christmas Tree. Where are you getting Naked? My dog wanted to get Naked but I proceeded to take out the camera and instead he was absolutely terrified of getting Naked on film as you can see from his bugged out eyes. Oh well! Some folks were born to be Naked, others not so much…! Submit your Naked photos to Urban Decay by Facebookin’ them and Tweetin’ ’em and show the world where you’re getting Naked. Jump! As you know Urban Decay Naked 2 launched last week. What an incredible launch! With 5,000 palettes to go around it sold out in the blink of an eye and today when it came back in stock again it was gone as quick as the Flash. Is it any wonder considering the popularity and cult following that the original Naked Palette garnered? You either love nude, natural shades or you don’t but I’m going to throw it out there and say that most everyone enjoys a lovely selection of nudes and this palette of course, brings exactly that to the table. This time around Urban Decay packages not only 12 shades of fantastic traditional browns, bronzes, nudes, and naturals but also some outstanding taupes and grieges. Some people have dubbed it a “cooler” version of the original Naked but for me it’s all about warm, rich hues of gorgeous. The 24/7 Eyeliner that was originally launched with Naked has been replaced as you know with a brush and Naked 2 also includes a brush but it’s dual sided this time around. I find the brush extra helpful and I’m pretty much all stocked up on 24/7 Liners so the addition of the brush makes this one truly travel friendly and worthy. One side has a nice blending brush and the other a flat head which can double up as a liner brush and a regular shadow brush for packing color onto lid. Further change is on the horizon here with a new snap close tin compact that the shadows and brush come housed in. The original Naked Palette came in a velvet lined box. Pretty yes, practical no as it was a bit of a lint magnet or at least that was the case for me plus it did have a magnetic closure but didn’t prove as travel safe for me as Naked 2 does. This new compact snaps tightly closed and will take a jostle or two in your tote without worries about it flipping open and breaking the contents inside. I love the new packaging but it does take a little jiggle and wiggle to get it open, for some reason it proves an ickle tricky to get open if you have shorter nails like mine. But that rant aside I love this new packaging as it proves way sturdier. You also have a long, full size mirror for application on the go if that’s your bag baby! Mmm I’ll be doing a shade comparison in another post which includes shades from Naked 2 and the old Naked Palette however for now I will say, yes, sure some of the shades look very similar but I think the shades in the original palette are a tad richer and warmer versus the present palette where the shades are warm but not as rich and vibrant, a bit more subdued, lighter if you will but no worries, definitely pigmented to the max. Naked and Naked 2 only share one of the same shades which is Half Baked outside of that this palette contains five exclusive shades and 6 other general catalog shades not included in the original palette. So indeed they may look similar but they are in fact an entirely new shade selection outside of the one common shade they share. Shades Include: Foxy (matte beige) Haled Baked (copper shimmer brown) Booty Call (iridescent peachy beige) Chopper (copper shimmer) Tease (matte light brown) Snakebite (dark, rich golden chocolate brown) Suspect (light brown) Pistol (gray, taupe-y brown) Verve (taupe-y gray) YDK (red copper shimmer) Busted (dark chocolate brown) Blackout (deep true black matte) The value here is the fact that you are hauling 12 full size shadows in a single palette for $50. It’s extremely rare for any brand to include full size anything in a palette so this is a true value considering a single shade of shadow from any brand will set you back $18-$25 and up depending on who you purchase from. Should you want to buy a full size pot of each of these shadows from Urban Decay you’d be spending over $200 and this palette includes a mini gloss (you get a mini Lip Junkie Gloss in Naked with the palette see my review of these glosses by clicking here ) plus a dual sided brush AND your 12 shadows for $50. Of course, I need not get into a major discussion about the eyeshadow formula considering I’ve reviewed Urban Decay Eyeshadows a plenty on Musings but I will say they have incredible pigmentation, blend easily, and have a beautiful, flawless wear. I had a few hiccups with the matte shades in the palette but me and matte, we don’t get along no matter who’s making ’em. I’m sure it’s boiling down to do you really need Naked 2 if you already own the original Naked Palette? I’d like to think so. It’s an outstanding selection of color at a very small price. I don’t think the shades are necessarily dupes to what you might already have in the original palette, each shade has it’s own special characteristic and you’ll easily find something to love about them particularly if you are partial to nude, natural shades of color. These colors are a little less vibrant, a little less rich, and a little less warmer than the original but they still all pack a mighty punch and will create some outstanding looks. I think the palette is not only a value but a very nice line up of colors. I’d suggest hauling it if you love colors like these or just generally like Urban Decay’s shadow formula. This is also an incredible introduction to the brand so if you’ve never tried anything from their line before this is a perfect place to start. I’m wearing Snakebite, Foxy, and Suspect in my look below. I gotta slap a Muse Approval on this one, it just deserves it. Loves. It’s not available now but you can sign up to be alerted as soon as it restocks by visiting UrbanDecay.com I’ll be doing comparisons shortly of the two palettes, stay tuned! Did you haul? What did you love about? What didn’t you like about it? Didn’t haul it? Why? Do share! P.S. Did you get your tree up yet? Send me a pic and I’ll share them in our next Open Thread Day! Deal?

"['Urban Decay Naked Palette Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 25, 2010 107 Comments in Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Fall Collections 2010 , Swatches , Urban Decay Going naked, natural, and nude for Fall is far from what you’d expect. Yes, well, nude, natural shades, such a bore right? But you know damn well that Urban Decay does nothing boring and the new Urban Decay Naked Palette takes nudes to the very next level so you’ll experience all those boring shades of color in an exciting new light! Check it after the jump! 12, count them, 12 FULL size (yes, full size) eyeshadows from Urban Decay packaged in a slick, velvet, slim line palette with a dual side 24/7 Eyeliner in two shades and a mini Urban Decay Primer Potion. Everything you need to go naked this Fall and damn naked has never been so beautiful! I dunno how they did it but Urban Decay has packed 12 full size eyeshadows in their new Naked Palette. That’s $204 (without tax) worth of makeup for $44! This palette could prove to be one of Fall 2010’s shining stars. Packed to the brim with warm shades of bronze, rich shades of chocolate, and even exotic shades of black and gray, you’ll have just about everything you need for creating a super sophisticated look for the season. Some Urban Decay Eyeshadows prove difficult to pull off at work, yes, I know, you really want to sport Flipside at the office but your boss prob won’t appreciate the joys of teal shadow. No problem, every single shade in the Naked Palette is incredibly subtle yet dramatic and perfect for your office work day. Although some of the shades have a shimmer finish they still apply like a liquid metal (such as Half Baked and Smog) and once blended out you’ll end up with a flattering, subtle dash of color on lids. The palette contains 7 older shades and 5 brand new ones. You’ll get: General Catalog Shades: Gunmetal (gray with silver sparkle) Half Baked (bronze) Naked (matte buff nude) Sidecar (cocoa with golden sparkle) Sin (champagne shimmer) Smog (coppery chocolate bronze) Toasted (rich copper) Exclusive Shades: Buck (matte nutmeg) Creep (onyx with golden sparkle) Darkhorse (bronze with golden finish) Hustle (plum bronze satin) Virgin (satin chamois) I have to say that Virgin is the shade that really rocked my world. It makes an excellent base, high brow highlighter, or all over color wash with one of the other shades added into the crease. I hope they release this as a single because it’s truly an outstanding shade. The shades graduate in color so you can literally create 100’s of looks using this and still have ideas for more, particularly if you’re super creative with application. They all sport the typical UD formula with super pigmentation and simple, buttery smooth blending. None of the shades have heavier hardcore sparkle so fall out is minimal. Although I have some of the shades in the palette, I’m actually excited about owning them all in one place. My logic is that they look so great together and I’m more likely to create combos using the palette rather than puzzle over my singles and wonder what goes with what. This takes the guest work out of creating a look and you can easily look over the palette and right away get any number of ideas. Along with the palette you’ll get a mini size Urban Decay Primer Potion and a newly designed double sided 24/7 Eyeliner. You get Zero (black) and a new shade Whiskey (brown) The packaging is superb and one of Urban Decay’s more luxe designs. Some folks aren’t keen on the Book of Shadow designs so this is quite fitting for anyone who wants more of a mature, sophisticated packaging. The palette is a long slim design with a velvety finish and a gold lame emblem. Very stylish, very different for Urban Decay and very fitting as the colors are all very “grown up” and the palette design mimics that. You do have to be extra careful with the palette design since it’s velvet and collects lint easily! I guess some will rant about the reappearance of Zero but it’s fitting to have a black liner in the palette. Lovers of Urban Decay makeup who have wanted a sophisticated, work safe look! Those who simply adore nudes and naturals. Anyone seeking ALOT for a less (12 full sizes shades for $44) What’s NOT to like here? Can’t think of anything at the moment! Overall, the value of the palette, the presentation, packaging, and price makes the Urban Decay Naked Palette a solid choice for Fall. I’m impressed. Gorgeous. Only had time for one look today but will try to do more next week! (Eyes: Virgin, All Over Color Wash Smog, Lid and Crease Half Baked, Dabbed on Lid Lips: Urban Decay Naked Lip Junkie Lipgloss ) I think YOU NEED IT! Muse Approved for purchase!

"['Urban Decay Naked Ultimate Basics Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on August 25, 2016 31 Comments in Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Holiday Collections 2016 , Makeup Reviews , Swatches , Urban Decay Affiliate Link PR Sample Oh yes, I am quite excited about the Urban Decay Naked Ultimate Basics Eyeshadow Palette that’s an all new selection of all matte, naked eyeshadow shades. The Naked Ultimate Basics Palette arrives at us this September along with the rest of the Urban Decay Holiday 2016 Collection. I know, I can’t believe we’re talking Holiday either but I think the good news about this particular palette is it contains a selection of shades that transcend any one season. It’s packed to the gills with shades you’ll likely use daily for work friendly looks or even sultry evening looks when a little eyeliner and a few layers of mascara are applied. Take the jump for my review and swatches. The Urban Decay Naked Ultimate Basics Palette arrives in plastic rose gold compact with a burst design that displays Urban Decay’s logo. Inside you’ll find a very generously sized mirror along with a double-ended brush for application. One side of the brush has a soft, densely packed eyeshadow brush you can use to layer eyeshadow on lids and the other side holds a shorter bristled smaller head which doubles up as either an eyeliner brush or can be used to soft diffuse shadow on your lower or upper lash line. Some people might miss the fact that this includes a blending side but I didn’t mind much so, don’t forget to BYOBB (bring your own blending brush). I like the packaging a lot as I’m particular to the customary “naked” shade that Urban Decay uses in their Naked Collection products. It’s a cross between a rose gold and a rose beige gold that’s very pretty! Someone needs to create a sparkly eyeshadow in this shade. The palette is light, travel-friendly, and should store easily enough as it is a little bit smaller than your average CD case. It holds a total of 12 eyeshadows which are 0.04 oz in size each. Shades: Blow (Light Nude Demi-Matte) Nude (Soft Pink Nude Matte) Commando (Light Taupe Brown Matte) Tempted (Pale Brown Matte) Instinct (Medium Pink Taupe Matte) Lethal (Reddish Brown Matte) Pre-Game (Pale Yellow Matte) Extra Bitter (Burnt Orange Matte) Faith (Medium Warm Brown Matte) Lockout (Rich Neutral Brown Matte) Magnet (Smoky Gray Matte) Blackjack (Warm Black Matte) Urban Decay Naked Ultimate Basics Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Blow, Nudie, Commando, Tempted) Urban Decay Naked Ultimate Basics Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Faith, Lockout, Magnet, Blackjack) Urban Decay Naked Ultimate Basics Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Instinct, Lethal, Pre-Game, Extra Bitter) I think it’s debating whether this palette has an assortment of brand new shades. Every single shade is brand new and exclusive to this palette according to Urban Decay but if you own Naked Basics, Naked Basics 2, and an assortment of the other Naked Palettes you’re bound to come across shades that look alike. According to their press statement the shades are “completely different from the shades in Naked Basics and Naked2 Basics”. I agree with that but they are variations of shades we’ve seen before and in some cases people might feel they are look a lot alike once applied on lids. So, it may or may not be a deal breaker for you when heading in for a purchase. This palette contains a selection of both warm and cooler nudes. Some shades are going to play particularly nicely with darker skin tones and may come across a bit chalky or pasty. For example, Blow, Nude, Commando, Tempted, and Pre-Game, are just a few shades that come across as being a little too sheer for darker skin tones. I don’t think the shades are universally flattering to all skin tones but should fit in well with fair to medium tones. Darker tones might struggle a little some of the lighter shades. I happen to fit into the medium fair zone myself so many of the shades worked for me but some of the lighter ones we’re best used as highlighters or transitional colors. One thing I did take note of was the fact that this palette was a bit deeper and richer in the shade selection range. I think Naked Basics 1 and 2 were very light and sheerer shades where as Naked Ultimate Basics touches on deeper shades of brown, orange, plum, and even purple. One of the fantastic things about the palette is there’s a good deal of variety here to create simple neutral eye looks, natural smokier ones, and even a plummy pink smoked out eye. It seems like a basic and simple range of colors but in reality Urban Decay has given you a selection of shades that are very . Like many of Urban Decay’s matte shades these are dense without a ton of powdery kick up. Although dense the formula blends very well and looks smooth and even on lids. I personally like silkier mattes that are a bit softer in texture but I actually use my Basics Palettes quite often and never have issues blending or creating looks with the denser shadow range. One thing to note is they swatch very sheer and look very dry on my wrist but they actually apply considerably better. For those curious where this is made, it says that the palette is made in the USA and the brush is made in China. It’s weird but I’ve come to appreciate mattes as I’ve gotten older and the Urban Decay Naked Ultimate Basics Palette has a nice range of shades I can see myself using daily to create looks. It’s a palette that’s perfectly work friendly but can certainly be used to create sultry evening looks as well. If you’re a matte lover I think picking it up will prove a no brainer. Wearing Blow, Faith, and Lockout on Eyes The Urban Decay Naked Ultimate Basics Palette arrives this September at Sephora, Sephora.com , Ulta, Ulta.com , and urbandecay.com. Will you be indulging?

"['Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette Review By Isabella Muse on October 19, 2016 13 Comments in Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Holiday Collections 2016 , Makeup Reviews , Swatches , Urban Decay Affiliate PR Sample Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette ($58) is a new, limited edition palette featuring 21 gorgeous, rainbow shades of eyeshadow which is launching October 26th at Sephora.com and Ulta.com . Earlier this Fall, Urban Decay launched their all matte Ultimate Basics Eyeshadow Palette for the Holiday 2016 season and it was delightful but not exactly a pick up if you love bold, dramatic eye looks. Let’s face it, Urban Decay’s signature shade line up is known for dramatic, bold hues of color but the last few years they’ve taken to concentrating very, very hard on their Naked Collection of products and have released many, many different nude, neutral eyeshadow palettes. In some cases, I feel like a majority of their releases are nude, neutral palettes with a few “fun” colorful palettes mixed in. Some people were surprised to see the arrival of the Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette but I wasn’t. Urban Decay follows a pretty standard marketing plan when launching seasonal collections and that typically involves a big collection launch followed by a “surprise” palette of some sort a few weeks later. That’s where this colorful palette came into play. So, if the Ultimate Basics Eyeshadow Palette was a disappoint to you, I’m positive the rainbow hued shades of the Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette will have you jumping up and down in joy. Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette is a follow up to the Urban Decay Urban Spectrum Palette that launched last year but that palette featured more jewel tones where as Full Spectrum is most definitely about rainbow ones. The packaging is very similar to last year’s version but where as before the entire lid was removable now the lid is attached which is fine by me as I tend to drop things when they aren’t attached. This also has a very generously sized mirror inside and a dual-sided eyeshadow brush. I always find the brushes that Urban Decay puts in these palettes very good quality. I’m actually always relieved they include a brush versus another Zero Eyeliner as I have a slew of them already! The outside of the compact features a colorful rainbow jeweled Urban Decay raised emblem against a lined black backdrop. As with much of Urban Decay’s packaging, this is beautifully presented and gives a little hint about the contents inside! The palette is made in the USA for those interested. They designed this palette for folks that might be a little color challenged. If you find yourself opening an eyeshadow palette and scratching your head in confusion of which shades pair up well together you’ll be relieved to know you won’t be doing that with this. Urban Decay arranged all the shades in colorful matching trios to take the guess work out of creating a look. The top, middle, and bottom shades of each row are meant to be used together in a single complimentary look. Of course, you can mix, match, and use shades in any way you want but if you’re a bit color challenged this will be helpful when creating your look. The palette contains a total of 21 shades, 18 of which are brand new with returning shades Alchemy from Vice 3 as well as Hatter and Metamorphosis from the Alice Through The Looking Glass Palette . If makeup artistry is something you excel out this is an eyeshadow palette that will happily live in your stash as there are tons of shades here to create very elaborate looks. I love makeup, I wear makeup, I like to dabble and play with it, but I’m not creative enough to create elaborate looks with a palette like this. It could be a bit challenging for the average makeup user. The palette is filled with a range of different finishes including mattes, shimmer, and glitters. I think the palette’s formula is testimony to Urban Decay’s evolution. The quality simply isn’t what it used to be. For example, we all know that Urban Decay glitter shades are laced with micro-glitter. The shade Iced in this palette does in fact have glitter but the shadow formula is crumbly and flakier. This is the case with some of the other shimmers as well like Goldmine. Sadly, the soft, buttery texture that Urban Decay is known for isn’t quite here. These shades are drier with some shades being patchier during application. A good creamy base, a sponge eyeshadow applicator, and a good, dense blending brush go a long way at making these shades work. I can’t be alone wondering what exactly changed with the Urban Decay formula. Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Warning, Seize, Jones) Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Midnight Blaze, Calavera, Goldmine) Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Hundred, Hatter, Mean) Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Minx, Blindsided, Metamorphosis) Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Alchemy, Gossip, Paranoia) Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Platonic, Iced, Bump_ Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Delirious, Sketch, Faded) This isn’t to say there aren’t some nice shades here. The mattes are very pigmented but I found myself wishing they were a little more softer in texture which allow for better application and blending. Some of the softer satins were the winners such as Warning, Hundred, and Mean. Shades like Alchemy and Midnight Blaze looked incredibly pigmented in the pan but had a patchier application and needed building to look good. For my look above I’m a bit pasty! Haha! Sorry about that but I used my concealer AFTER applying eyeshadow which is something I don’t typically do. I typically apply concealer first and do my eye makeup later. I reversed application this time around as the blue had a bit of clean up after and concealer seemed logical. For this look I used Minx, Blindsided, and Metamorphosis. The Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette has a lot on offer but it is a palette filled with shades you’ll have to work with in order to see the best results. This isn’t the Urban Decay Eyeshadow I fell in love with over ten years ago. The texture is a bit stiffer and drier than the normal range of single eyeshadows and needs a good cream base and a bit of TLC during application to get the perfect finish. The Urban Decay Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette arrives October 26th at Ulta.com and Sephora.com as well as at urbandecay.com. Save You may also enjoy...

"['Urban Decay Glinda Palette Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on January 30, 2013 60 Comments in Eye Palettes , Eyeliner , Eyeshadow , Lip Pencil , Palettes , Spring Collections 2013 , Swatches , Urban Decay Ahh the Glinda Palette! Glinda is one of two new Urban Decay Oz inspired palettes that the brand recently launched in collaboration with the Disney film, Oz the Great and Powerful. I recently reviewed the Theodora Palette for you and must say she’s more my speed. I love the Glinda palette but she’s a more lighter variation which will work well on paler skin tones or those with fairer hair and eyes. Take a look! I must admit visually Glinda is the more appealing palette to my eyes. As much as I love nudes there is something so very pretty and delicate about Glinda’s shades. I don’t like to limit anyone from wearing any shades…I’m not the type of person that believes certain shades are meant for certain skin types but in this instance I felt like Theodora was the better option for me as Glinda’s paler more pastel colors just drown me out a bit. Le sigh! On the upside, there are some gorgeous colors here that are an absolute treat to behold. This is a $49 palette and includes six full size shadows two of which are split down the middle as a duo of sorts. I mentioned in the Theodora review that I felt these new duo eyeshadows might be a little preview to what Urban Decay will do for Summer 2013. What do you think? Shades: Tornado (vibrant deep purple shimmer) Aura (iridescent white with blue shift/Iridescent white with red shift) Magic (pinkish purple with a golden shimmer), Illusion (pale peach satin) Oz (gold with gold glitter/silver with silver glitter) South (warm pale gray shimmer with silver micro-glitter) Glinda Super Saturated High Gloss Lip Color (light sheer nude) Rockstar 24/7 Glide-on Eye Pencil (deep eggplant) Although not nearly as large as the pop up palettes that Urban Decay has released in the past there is still a value to be had here as the value is well over $100. I find the Build Your Own Palette interface refreshing as it travels easily and allows you to customize your colors by popping in other eyeshadows or buying six new ones after you’ve used the shades it came with. Urban Decay has always had a very pleasing eyeshadow formula. It’s been one of my favorite formulas since I started getting into mid-range and higher end makeup and that’s going back over 10 years ago. The newly revamped formula is even nicer than ever with a creamy, velvety texture that’s extremely saturated with pigment, easy to blend, and simply stunning all around. Unlike Theodora I had issues with some of Glinda’s shades as there was a SLEW of micro glitter in some of these colors. It’s fall out city and gets just about everywhere…face, cheeks, eyes, even my neck! Thankfully all the shades aren’t like this but the worst offender is Oz. Oz and Magic Tornado, Illusion, South Aura I had a hard time getting Glinda’s more nude look as you see on Michelle in the promo images. I used Magic on my lid and Tornado in my crease with Auru as a highlighter of sorts. My look is messy and muddy unfortunately, I just had a hard time working with the lighter colors but that’s my skills, nothing to do with the formula. You also get a Super Saturated High Gloss Lip Color in Glinda which is a rather lovely MLBB rosy beige shade. This isn’t as pigmented as Theodora’s pencil and has a little less glossiness for the finish and a tad more dryness. And finally Rockstar 24/7 Eyeliner is also included with the palette. This has a creamy texture like all 24/7 Eyeliners with a buttery formula that applies without skipping or tugging. Overall, Glinda didn’t work for me color wise but her quality is there as well as her value. The main issue here is a bit of micro glitter fall out joy you’ll have to deal with but outside of that the overall palette has some beautiful colors that don’t look particularly great on me but will definitely be suitable for someone else I’m sure! I guess it’s a official I’m more a Theodora! What about you? The Urban Decay Oz Palettes are available now at Sephora.com, Ulta.com, and UrbanDecay.com You may also enjoy...

"['Urban Decay Lip Junkie Lipgloss Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 25, 2010 47 Comments in Fall Collections 2010 , Lipgloss , Swatches , Urban Decay Later today you’ll hopefully be able to purchase the new Urban Decay Lip Junkie Lipglosses! Until they go on sale at UD, here’s a look at the new gloss that should tempt and tease you into creating a wish list full of the great shades coming out! Jump! A brand new lipgloss from Urban Decay in 11 shades with a mint flavor that contains Maxi Lip, a collagen boosting ingredient that moisturizers and plumps lips over time. Definitely need to rave the packaging first. The glosses come in a squeeze tube with a thin slanted applicator but the key feature that makes gives them an extra edge and a chic feel are the caps. Each gloss sports a stained glass style metallic cap a la the Urban Decay Limited Edition Lipstick Cap released for Holiday 2008. Although the tube of the gloss isn’t anything particularly special, it’s the cap that sets the wheels in motion for giving the gloss a goth-y chic feel so you’ll feel quite proud to whip these out of your purse for touch ups. There are 11 shades total each in different finishes and coverage. The formula isn’t as thin as Pocket Rockets nor as thick as XXX Shine but lays somewhere in the middle of the two. It’s very lightweight, comfortable and virtually weightless with a cool, minty flavor that users will find very pleasant if they weren’t too keen on the Pocket Rocket creme brulee flavor. Like many plumping glosses they have a very slight, subtle sting but nothing dramatic or overly much for sensitive types. The glosses don’t actually plump right away but using daily for a month supposedly boosts lip collagen 40%. Can’t say if that’s working yet as I’ve only tried them for a day or so now. Shades range in pigmentation but can be easily layered for more pop and color payoff. The glosses give a full, shiny look that wears comfortably without being sticky or tacky. Shades available are Crush (Urban Decay calls this a sheer coral but too me it hot neon pink) Jilted (Urban Decay calls this one hot pink with blue but for me it leans more towards purple with blue) Heavy (Shimmering Nude) Runaway (Shimmering Coral) Red Light (Candy Apple Red) Peroxide (Pale Nude Pink) Perversion (Sheer Sparkling Grape) Love Junkie (Urban Decay calls this Deep but sheer Win to me it leans towards being a goth-y black purple) Naked (Pink Nude) Wallflower (Medium Nude) Midnight Cowboy (Shimmering Beige) Some shades won’t work for everyone so be aware when picking. Colors like Perversion are club colors that aren’t for everyday use, or at least in my world they aren’t hehe. Anyone who wants a buildable lipgloss that wears comfortably. Anyone that likes super slick packaging (this has you covered). Anyone who wants a gloss that wears well on its own or paired up with lipstick or stain! Anyone who likes shades with edge (plenty of edgy colors here) Anyone sensitive to flavored gloss (these have a nice kick of mint). I really liked these and find they are a refreshing change from the Pocket Rockets and XXX Shine. Urban Decay doesn’t have a ton of gloss options so I’m happy to have these added to the general catalog. I can’t pull off all the shades as some have a fair bit of edge but shades like Red Light, Runway, Naked, Crush, Midnight Cowboy, and Jilted are gorgeous additions to my lipgloss wardrobe and very wearable. The packaging is a large part of the appeal as well since I’m a sucker for cool packaging and these definitely bring it to the table. I’m quite curious if the Maxi Lip ingredient really works so we’ll see in a month if my lips are any fuller haha! At $19, you can’t really go wrong picking up a shade or two. I think you’ll find at least one or two to love. Loves ’em! Available shortly from www.urbandecay.com What do you think?

"['Stila On the Red Carpet Palette And The Winner Is Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on March 20, 2013 7 Comments in Eye Palettes , Eyeliner , Eyeshadow , Makeup Reviews , Palettes , Spring Collections 2013 , Stila , Swatches Stila has two new On the Red Carpet Palettes featuring six eyeshadows, highlighter, blush, and a Smudge Stick that’s available exclusively at QVC. And The Winner Is…is the warmer of the two palettes and has a nice array of beautiful nudes and naturals. Take a peek! Ok, don’t get mad, it does contain Kitten Highlighter…essentially this is not really a highlighter, it’s kinda the eyeshadow disguised as a highlighter. It’s been released in prior palettes has a very heavy, vevet-y texture with a ton of glittery frostiness. It’s pretty but it’s not something I’d suggest for your face. As much as I love Kitten as an eyeshadow I think it proves too much as a highlighting powder. Now that being I said…this is a nice little palette that features some very pretty nudes. You get: Eyeshadows Leading Lady (matte creamy beige) Nominee (matte beige) Breakout Role (matte mid-tone brown) Acceptance Speech (shimmery golden bronze) A-List (shimmery copper) Honor (shimmery rosy pink) Highlighter Kitten Convertible Color Lillium (dusky pink) Smudge Stick Lionfish (bronze brown) Possibly the nicest thing about the palette is the combination of both matte and shimmer shades. Although not exactly like Stila’s full size formulas these do come a close second in texture and formula. The shimmers have a soft, buttery feel with a velvet-like finish that apply and blend easily. The mattes I was a little worried would be dry but these are silky and soft with a sheerer yet pretty finish. Nominee, Breakout Role, Leading Lady Honor, A-List, Acceptance Speech Kitten and Lillum Lionfish The inside of the palette features a mirror and a how to get the look guide as well as each shadow being labeled where you should put it (ie: lid, base, liner) so it’s pretty foolproof to apply, shade, and contrast the colors, blending them out to a picture perfect finish. The Convertible Color can be used on both lips and cheeks. I realize cream and powder products in a single palette is messy however, they have a clear film inside you can use to cover the cream blusher as you work with the powders. The full size Smudge Stick is a generous extra in this set! I’ve always been a fond fan of Stila’s Smudge Stick and Lionfish is one my favorite shades. This is a creamy eyeliner that smudges easily and has a fairly long wear on my drier eyes. Overall, the Stila On the Red Carpet Palette in And the Winner Is includes some very pretty nude shades that will work well into Spring and Summer!

"['Urban Decay Shattered Face Case Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on September 10, 2013 13 Comments in Blush , Eyeliner , Eyeshadow , Fall Collections 2013 , Highlighter , Lip Pencil , Makeup Reviews , Palettes , Swatches , Urban Decay PR Sample The Urban Decay Shattered Face Case ($44) is one of two new Face Case Palettes that Urban Decay is launching with their Holiday 2013 Collection. Aptly named Face Case this contains everything you need for lips, eyes, and cheeks in a two tier palette that travels easily or stores away in your desk drawer or at your boyfriend’s for a quick face look on the go. Take a look! Urban Decay Shattered Face Case is probably the more wicked of the two palettes as the other Face Case, entitled Anarchy, has cooler more innocent shades of color. These are available for a limited time so if you wants ’em best to get to grabbing ’em up. Each palette contains new and exclusive shades with travel friendly favs as well as full size products that you can easily stash in a bag or elsewhere for quick makeup looks in a flash. Shattered is actually the exception to the rule as ALL the products inside are exclusive and brand new to the palette. The evolution the Urban Decay Face Case has gone through finally comes to a real hard edge with the Shattered Palette. This reeks Urban Decay all over with its edgy packaging. The Shattered Face Case features a shattered glass design and a purple UD logo. It’s a two tier case which houses eyeshadows/liner/and lip color on top and the bottom compartment contains all your face essentials. I love that Urban Decay thought it would be such a good idea to not only include a mirror on the top portion of the compact but also one on the bottom! Each palette contains five eyeshadows all of which are 0.03 oz in size (generously sized considering full size singles are 0.05 oz) as well as a mini 247 Glide On Eye Pencil, a full Size Super Saturated High Gloss Lip Color Pencil, as well as two blushes and a highlighter. The blushes are a cherry on top considering Urban Decay doesn’t really have a selection of powder blushes available (hopefully that’ll change for Spring 2014?). Here’s the complete deets of what you get: Eyeshadow: Nameless (medium gray brown satin) (exclusive) Remix (rich purple shimmer with tonal micro glitter) (exclusive) Shakedown (rich brown gunmetal satin) (exclusive) Minor Sin (champagne pink satin) (exclusive) Bleach (yellow beige matte) (exclusive) Blush: Overexposed (dusty rose) (exclusive) Temper (soft baby pink) (exclusive) Highlighter: Glint (soft pink champagne shimmer) (exclusive) Lips: Full Size Urban Decay Super Saturated High Gloss Lip Color in Lovechild (cool pink cream) Eyes: Urban Decay Travel Size 24/7 Glide On Eye Pencil in Zero (black cream) I could have skipped on Zero! I have too many…I would have preferred Perversion as I use it daily and no matter how many I have I definitely can make use of another one since it is my favorite black eyeliner. I think folks will automatically jump on Lovechild as some sort of dupe for Glinda but the colors are quite different with Lovechild less dusky. The eyeshadows in the Urban Decay Shattered Face Case don’t speak to me in all honesty. It’s going to be a little bit of a hard sell with Urban Decay Vice 2 being in your face at the moment as that includes a few similar shades (not dupes) and there’s twenty of ’em at $15 more than this face palette. It’s all about travel here though so if you want a little palette to carry around with you or to leave at your boyfriend’s that’s where this would grab you as a have. The colors here are more of a sultry, smoky purple look. I didn’t really love them because at this point in my life my eyes can’t take such darker shades without aging me further or making my day circles more prominent. However, those who sport smoky looks daily you have essential colors here to create your look! Bleach, Minor Sin, Shakedown, Remix, Nameless The blush I’m a little on the fence about. They seems like something that got added in as an after thought. The blushes are nicely pigmented, smooth, silky, blend quite easily but don’t seem like something Urban Decay would create. It’s odd but that’s what I got out of them but facts is facts Urban Decay doesn’t exactly have a huge blush range so this is a cherry on top of an already nice looking cake. The highlighter is a soft pink champagne with a velvety almost creamy texture. This indeed feels like an Urban Decay formula to me. It adds just a touch of a glow to cheeks and can be easily be used alone for a natural finish on bare skin. Glint (highlighter), Overexposed, Temper Overall, the Urban Decay Shattered Face Case is an brilliant little idea. My main issue stems from the fact that Urban Decay released Vice 2 at the same time as this little guy so people are going to look at it and think, “Damn I’d rather get the Vice 2”. You’ll have to remind yourself the draw here is you’re getting ALL the essentials for a look where as with Vice 2 you’re only getting shadows. Shattered brings edge with its cooler packaging and in theory I adore the idea but I’d have picked different colors for myself….maybe a nude palette with brown and gold and coral blush and a nude lip look for me…! The Urban Decay Shattered Face Case launches today at urbandecay.com and will be available shortly at Sephora, Ulta, Macys, sephora.com, ulta.com, and beauty.com Will you grab it up?

"['E.L.F. Ursula Look Book Palette Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on September 19, 2013 16 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Drugstore Makeup Brands , E.L.F , Eye Primer , Eyeliner , Eyeshadow , Fall Collections 2013 , Lip Pencil , Lipgloss , Makeup Reviews , Palettes , Swatches , This is Halloween Purchased The E.L.F. Ursula Look Book Palette ($9.99) is part of the new E.L.F. Cosmetics Disney Villains Collection that will be available exclusively at Walgreens for Fall/Halloween 2013. Last year E.L.F. did these Disney Villains Palettes but Ursula was not a character included in the collection so she’s the newest of the bunch. Let’s take a look! The E.L.F. Ursula Look Book Palette is made up of more cooler shades especially when you’re comparing it to others in this collection like the Cruella Palette. I mentioned in my review of Cruella’s Palette that last year the books contained eight eyeshadows, shadow primer, a liner pencil, liquid eyeliner, a cheek/lip pencil, and false lashes. The eyeshadow was built into the actual palette last year which made it considerably more messy but this year it is removable. This comes in a white flip open cardboard book style compact. It isn’t great for travel but the design is quite nice. It features a watercolor-like print of Ursula on the cover and on the inside flaps there’s instructions for creating a day and night look. I think the design of the palette is what you’re paying into as you aren’t getting a ton of makeup and could possibly get more for your ten dollars and full size products should you shop E.L.F. directly. However, I personally think the palettes are fun collector’s pieces and Disney fans and makeup junkies will likely get a kick out of them. You get: Shadow Palette with shades Coral, Sea Witch, Shell, Kiss the Girl, Triton, Bewitched E.L.F. Liquid Liner E.L.F. Eyeshadow Brush E.L.F. Eyeliner Pencil (mini) E.L.F. Eyeshadow Primer (mini) E.L.F. Lip Color Gloss (mini) E.L.F. Lengthening and Defining Mascara (deluxe size) This year the palettes only have six shades of shadow where as last year you got eight. They also did away with the horrible cheek and lip pencil and replaced it with a lipgloss. All the items included are from the Essential Collection which I find has more misses than hits. I prefer the Studio line of products myself. I actually didn’t really like anything from the palette and that includes the shadow palette. Where as the Cruella Palette had very unusable shades of shadow with a fairly nice formula I felt Ursula’s version was lacking. These comes with a few matte shades which applied chalky and patchy! Some of the other shades had a nice velvety texture but the mattes killed some of the experience for me. These shades are also cooler and didn’t feel they were flattering on my tired eyes. That’s just a personal preference though as some folks will love shades like this. Kiss the Girl, Triton, Bewitched Coral, Sea Witch, Bewitched I’ve never really liked the E.L.F. Shadow Primer as it doesn’t feel like it does much for maintaining the wear of my shadow and it ends up creasing within a four hour period. The eye pencil is horrible as it is drier and tugs like crazy and the dense point is harsh on eyes. The mascara is ok as well but not really something I loved. It creates fairly ok length but separates my lashes a bit too much. The liquid liner applies flawlessly but I find it peels off as the day progresses. The brush is very nice with dense yet soft bristles they don’t shed. I also enjoyed the gloss included which isn’t sticky and gives lips a subtle kiss of color with shine. Eyeliner Pencil, Lip Color in Ursula, Liquid Liner, Eyeshadow Primer The E.L.F. Ursula Look Book Palette isn’t going to top the Sephora Ariel Palette that’s for sure….! If you’re a fond of cooler shades and don’t mind a few hiccups with matte shades you might love this. I think the palettes speak more to me as a collector than as a makeup user though!

"['Urban Decay Anarchy Face Case Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on September 10, 2013 29 Comments in Blush , Eyeliner , Eyeshadow , Highlighter , Holiday Collections 2013 , Makeup Reviews , Palettes , Swatches , Urban Decay PR Sample The Urban Decay Anarchy Face Case ($44) is the second all in one face palette that Urban Decay is releasing with their Holiday 2013 Collection. This little two tier palette contains products for eyes, lips, and cheeks in a small size that makes it nifty for traveling or stashing away at your boyfriend’s apartment or in your desk drawer for quickie looks on the go. Let’s take a look! The Urban Decay Anarchy Face Case is probably the more innocent of the two face palettes that Urban Decay is launching. Where as the Shattered Palette includes sultry, smoky looks the Anarchy Face Case is all about crisp, cooler shades that kinda remind me of the MAC Glitter and Ice Collection . This indeed reminds me of the cool icy feel of Winter and the Holidays! The palette is available for a limited time so if you are interested don’t hesitate as Urban Decay is legendary for selling out of palettes quickly lately! Where as the Shattered Palette contains all exclusive and new shades the Anarchy combines some new and some old. It’s a two tier design with a rather wicked baroque inspired design with a silver UD logo and an off white casing. The case has a certain Marie Antoinette vibe. The two tier design includes two mirrors located at the top and bottom portion of the palette. Five shadows are housed in the top compartment along with a mini 247 Glide On Eyeliner and Full Size Super Saturated High Gloss Lip Color where as the bottom contains two blushes and a highlighter. Shadows are 0.03 oz in size versus the single shades that Urban Decay sells which are 0.05 oz. Here’s what you get: Eyeshadow: Redemption (deep gunmetal satin) Fray (warm mauve matte) Vaporize (deep metallic gray taupe shimmer) Provocateur (light metallic mauve shimmer with multidimensional micro glitter) Revolt (bright metallic silver shimmer with silver micro glitter) Blush: Fetish (mauve pink) Quickie (bright pink) Highlighter: Craze (pale gold shimmer) Lips: Full Size Urban Decay Super Saturated High Gloss Lip Color in Scandal (bright metallic raspberry shimmer) Eyes: Urban Decay Travel Size 24/7 Glide On Eye Pencil in Perversion (blackest black) Looks like my wish for Perversion is granted. Where as the Shattered Face Case contains Zero they went ahead and included Perversion with this Face Case! It’s my personal HG (holy grail) black eyeliner and no girl or guy in my opinion should be without it. The Super Saturated High Gloss Lip Color Pencil in Scandal looks like it would have been better suited with the smoky shades included with the Shattered Face Case! This is a vibrant bright metallic fuchsia shimmer. These shadows are definitely more user friendly for me than the ones in Shattered simply because they are lighter colors. The theme is more of a crisp, cool Wintery look with silver, mauve, and taupe creating a Wintery Wonderland eye look. Be warmed though Revolt and Provocateur have a bit of fall out woe to contend with but the high metallic finish might just be worth the hassle of application. These shades have an almost cream texture in the form of a powder! Revolt, Redemption, Fray, Vaporize, Provocateur I’m still a little on the fence with the blush portions of the Face Cases as they just don’t seem like a typical Urban Decay formula. They blend easily enough, have a high pigmented finish, and have a silky feel. I will say that Fetish is lovely color that quite reminds me of NARS Outlaw. The highlighter portion is a pale golden shimmer. Craze (highlighter), Quickie, Fetish Overall, the Urban Decay Anarcy Face Case is going to have a little healthy competition with the Vice 2 Palette releasing at the same time. You’ll just have to remind yourself are you looking for more eyeshadows? Or are you looking for a complete face kit for your eyes, lips, and cheeks. Of course, you do get a bit more for $15 more with the Vice 2 Palette but the Face Cases offer more variety of products. If you’re looking for a crisp, cool look for the Holidays this brings it.

"['Urban Decay Streak Naked Flushed Palette Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on July 9, 2014 14 Comments in Blush , Bronzer , Highlighter , Makeup Reviews , Palettes , Summer Collections 2014 , Swatches , Urban Decay PR Sample Urban Decay Streak Naked Flushed Palette is one of three new shades of permanent Urban Decay Naked Flush Palettes that Urban Decay released for Summer 2014 . Like the original Naked Flushed Palette, Streak features a bronzer, blush, and highlighter shade. Let’s take a look! Some folks didn’t love the original Urban Decay Naked Flushed Palette but I actually did! It’s a rarity for me to like anything with a highlighter and bronzer because I make more use of blush than bronzer and highlighter but I do like this style of palette a lot because it brings together a nice assortment of facial powders in one slim, easy to travel with, easy to store compact! Urban Decay Streak Naked Flushed Palette Urban Decay Streak Naked Flushed Palette Swatches Urban Decay Streak Naked Flushed Palette is a nice assortment for those with fair to medium fair skin as the bronzer can double up as a contouring powder of sorts. I find the texture varies in these palettes as the highlighter is typically soft and velvety where as the bronzer and blush is dense, slightly dry, but still silky and easy to blend onto cheeks. The texture of the bronzer and blush isn’t exactly finely milled but as I still find it a smooth, blendable experience none the less with fairly natural pigment that isn’t overwhelming which is surprising as Urban Decay does like its pigment! I think the bronzer portion is a softer tan which is so doable for me. The texture is very soft and quite smooth with a certain silkiness although it does have a dense layer at first but that brushes away with use. The color is very doable as it adds warmth but not orange to skin. It also adds richness to blush should you wish to use it over your face blush! The highlighter portion of the compact is a golden peach. It’s a bit frosty but can be blended into a soft sheen on cheeks and face. It does kinda catch on drier areas of my face so spend some extra time blending it out. You can never over blend right? Blending out will soften the effects and you’ll have a smoother finish. The blush is the most dense here and has a matte finish. I thought it was dry but it blends out quite well on my skin and looks smooth and even never patchy for such a drier blush! Overall, Urban Decay Streak Naked Flushed Palette is a “safe” play for paler or fairer skin types that want a workable selection of not too pigmented bronzer, blush, and highlighter. Don’t be discouraged by “not to pigmented” because these powders do have excellent color pay off but they just look more natural and less harsh than some bronzers, blushes, and highlighters. For folks like me, that dislike bronzer, this is a perfect way to add warmth, color, and a hint of sparkle to your cheeks and face! Urban Decay Streak Naked Flushed Palette (Blush Only) Urban Decay Streak Naked Flushed Palette (A light dusting of bronzer to begin, blush on top, and highlighter blended right onto the apples of my cheeks!)

"['NARS Outlaw Blush Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on August 21, 2012 13 Comments in Blush , Fall Collections 2012 , Makeup Reviews , Nars So yeah, NARS Outlaw Blush ($28) disappeared off the face of the earth before I could haul it. As you know NARS Blush in Outlaw was available as part of the general catalog for quite a while. When it disappeared I’m unsure. I just know that I never technically indulged in the shade and why that is, is quite the mystery. Sadly, I can’t compare the formula of yesteryear to today’s current formula but I will say I like Outlaw as a color but the formula is a little bit meh. Take a look! You tell me what you think! NARS Outlaw makes a reappearance for Fall 2012 and might just become part of the standard collection once again as NARS doesn’t notate it as a LE shade in their Fall line up. The color is a warm, deep shade of clay berry red with a golden shimmer. Don’t get nervous the golden shimmer isn’t as prominent as the one you’d find in Orgasm or Super Orgasm . This sparkle is way more refined and subtle. The color has elements of rose, raspberry, red, and burnt bronze to me. It’s a complex shade which I absolutely love since it’s quite unique. On the downside the color does run a bit drier or at least my sample did. It appears quite pigmented in the compact but it doesn’t technically commute to your brush. It lacks the “dust up” of a typical NARS Blush so a little building is required on my part to get the best color pay off. The dryness does cause an issue with patchy application for me so I end up looking a little clown-y if I’m not spending extra time and patience to dab the color on just right. If you do pick this up, I’d suggest a bushy brush for application. This sheers out nicely and creates an even layer of color with a smoother finish. I typically like using a flat almost dome-like Bobbi Brown Blush to apply my blushes but in this case I had to reach for my MAC 134 to avoid patchy application issues. The overall texture isn’t the greatest I’ve run across from NARS but the color is truly special and creates a nice glow on cheeks. I’m unsure if you need to run out and purchase it though since there are so many other NAR’s blushes with far superior formulas. Who wants to spend near $30 on a blush that has applies patch and has a dry formula? Available now at NARS counters. Do you own Outlaw? Did you have these issues with the old version? How about the new? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Glitter & Ice Collection Photos, Info, Thoughts By Isabella Muse on September 28, 2011 12 Comments in Holiday Collections 2011 , MAC I’ve been busy posting up MAC Glitter and Ice info for you which I hope you’ve enjoyed! Here’s a break down of the collections: MAC Glitter and Ice for Holiday 2011 Color Collection MAC Glitter and Ice Dazzlespheres MAC Glitter and Ice Ice Delights MAC Glitter and Ice Ice Eyeshadow Palettes There’s alot to be digested from MAC this holiday season. Truth of the matter is that MAC Holiday lost some of its magic for me…I’ve become so disenchanted with their Holiday Collections that I can honestly say that I don’t even remember what they did last year…. As a MAC fan girl, that’s saying something about how inexpressive the collections have been for me the last few years. I think MAC Glitter and Ice definitely brings back some of that old beauty junkie excitement in me. I see alot of things that I’ll personally be picking up. Needless to say the collection seems even bigger and better than any Holiday I’ve celebrated with MAC, don’t you think so? I think the Dazzlespheres stand out as a revamp for MAC. Lipglasses and piggies are great but it’s nice to see a fresh new take on our favorite Holiday Sets and the Dazzlespheres bring together Dazzleglass, Creamsheens, and Crushed Metal Pigments to keep things new and exciting. The new eyeshadow palettes are a nice, new design with some very pretty shades although I do see a shade or two that MAC likes to revisit quite often here…Black Tied, I’m talkin’ to you! The imagery isn’t quite what I expected. With Johnny Weir heading up the collection I expected fabulously glitzy perhaps in a showgirl kinda way…but MAC took it to their level and gave us a spacey, Sci-Fi bling theme…It’s somewhat like Neo Sci Fi in the Winter instead of the Summer eh? Overall, MAC Glitter and Ice looks like it’ll be an enchanting collection and should renew fans faith in MAC. I’m calling a likey on this one. What do you think so far? Anything you’ll be hauling? I look forward to your thoughts on MAC Glitter and Ice and of course, most important of all, your excitement! You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Glitter and Ice Collection Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on October 27, 2011 26 Comments in Eyeliner , Eyeshadow , Holiday Collections 2011 , Lipgloss , Lipstick , MAC , Swatches Well….MAC Glitter and Ice Collection proves interesting, that much it gets from me. I got a few pieces today in the mail and here are my thoughts so far. Makeup is about expression. There’s nothing like turning yourself from ordinary to extraordinary with a little eyeliner and mascara. And of course, most important makeup colors, finishes, products, etc…are all about what you like and what you enjoy using. But in my opinion and perhaps yours too, you might find some of the pieces in the MAC Glitter and Ice Collection not quite wearable. I love MAC for pushing the letter, refusing to conform to the norm, and just being unique and original (that part can be debated at times) but sometimes I question their mentality with certain shades and products particularly ones released with Glitter and Ice. The name is both misleading and fitting. You have alot of cool, frosty shades here full of sparkle and shimmer. Mmm, yes fitting for the Holidays, fitting for the Winter season…but they also add in a Sci-Fi edge to the colors and products that isn’t particularly fitting the season. No one loves sci-fi more than me but I’m not rocking it for Christmas and I doubt you will be either. A good example of poor color choices here would be the MAC Lipstick in Eloquent Air which is a white silver shade. If you love it, I applaud you and appreciate your creativity if you can rock it. However, it seems such a unusual shade that quite possibly won’t sell well. Anyone with me here? I draw out disappointment when I see shades like this because it simply feels too surreal for me to even attempt using. MAC Glitter and Ice has alot these strange little shades but Eloquent Air does prove the worst offender. Outside of that, the other pieces in the collection I tried out do run rather cool and aren’t fitting for my particularly skin color but those who enjoy such shades will find great ways to rock out. One thing that deserves a yay is the mirror box packaging. It definitely feels edge-y Christmas to me. The white tubes of the makeup definitely keep things crisp and clean. Items I tried…. MAC Glitter and Ice Technakohls From what I’ve seen from these I’d say go ahead and haul. MAC’s Technakohl’s have always been a solid eyeliner. My only beef with these is they lack a sharpener but outside of that the formula is creamy, has a great glide, smudges easily, and wears well on my waterline. Going for Gold: This is a festive shimmering gold shade, a little brassy. Smooth Manoeurve: This is a nice, solid black with pearl. Both colors I tried are worth grabbing up but aren’t unique if you already own a black or gold eyeliner. MAC Glitter and Ice Paint Pots I’m excited about the Paint Pots in this release and of course, the formula has always been a good, solid performing product that works great as an all over color wash or as a base for powders, pigments, and other loose media. Morning Frost: This one is a shimmering champagne taupe. I’m not one for taupes but I like the shade very much particularly the twinkle and shimmer it has! It actually proved my favorite product in this lot of samples. MAC Glitter and Ice Lipsticks I haven’t seen the other shades in the collection yet but I’ve already expressed my dislike of Eloquent Air above. Let’s hope the other shades aren’t as unwearable. Eloquent Air: A bit of a ridiculous shade of sheer white silver that isn’t impossible to wear but probably will feel like it is or at least I think so. Such Flare!: This one is a true red matte shade. I can’t personally wear this one but it is a very festive red and fitting for the Holiday season! MAC Glitter and Ice Dazzleglass Dazzleglass is always a great formula as far as I am concerned. It’s sparkly, has a long wear time, and a fabulous brush applicator for layering! Love Alert: Feels a little Valentine’s Day to me but the shade is a raspberry red that can easily be spiced up with deeper lipstick for a festive holiday pout! She-Zam: This is a sheer silver with silver and red reflection. I think the silver and red shimmer make this unique and different. It can be worn alone but I think the color makes a rather good companion with a lipstick. MAC Glitter and Ice Mineralize Eyeshadow I’m quite a fan of these shadows for the most part but I think MAC has overdone them in recent years plus sometimes the formula can veer into the realms of either being too frosty or too shimmery but baked shadow lovers can probably get on board regardless. Frozen Blue: MAC says this is a mix of both silver and blue but I honestly get pure metallic silver from this one when swatched and applied. It does have a certain iciness which could be from the blue veining but outside of that you won’t catch alot of blue in the mix. Winterized: This is a dirty purple with siwlrs of silver, white, pink, and indigo. Sadly, all of the extra colors turns the shade into a blackish gray. Overall, MAC Glitter and Ice proves just ok for me so far. I’m not sure I’m getting too excited about the other shades in the collection after trying these pieces. It’s a mix of both repetitive shades versus ones that are unwearable or at least that’s the case for me. Packaging does get props as it not only works the Sci-Fi angle but also feels very Holiday-ish with the mirrored boxed and white tubes, jars, etc…not traditional Holiday mind you but definitely edge-y Holiday fun but the shade selection is far from the same feeling! After seeing these photos and swatches what do you think of MAC Glitter and Ice? What’s on your list to haul? Do share! I’m looking forward to your thoughts on this collection! You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Dazzlesphere Smoky Blue Ornament Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on October 27, 2011 12 Comments in Eyeshadow , Holiday Collections 2011 , MAC , Swatches Look into my MAC Dazzlesphere and I’ll tell you your future. Your future says you’ll want to haul MAC Glitter and Ice soon, oh, it also says you won’t win the lotto in this life. K, sorry, bye! Ha… Let’s take a look at the MAC Dazzlesphere Smoky Blue Ornament and find out if you need it! MAC loves their Crushed Metallic Pigments and they went all out with them this year as their Dazzlesphere Collection includes a few color sets of these fine piggies. This either disappoints you terribly because you hate the chunkier, flakier formula of the Crushed Metallic Pigments and were oh so hoping for regular Pigment Sets. Or it excites you because you love them. The Dazzlephere Collection for Holiday 2011 is a selection of “ornamental” mirrored globes which include sets of pigments, nail lacquers, and lipglasses. Again, as I said in a few of my prior reviews of the MAC Holiday 2011 Collection, I’m feeling like the packaging is trying too hard. MAC probably wanted an edge-y Christmas look but for me it comes across gaudy and overkill. If you’re a packaging hoarder who chooses to store his or her makeup in the boxes they come in you’ll find the Dazzlespheres will kill your storage as they are a little bigger than my fist and just awkward to store. Putting aside the odd shape and size of each sphere, I’ll go ahead and say they are a tad on the gaudy side and will easily crack if you drop them. This is of course my personal taste opinion as some people may think they are stunning. The sphere I got to try out is the MAC Dazzlesphere Smoky Blue Ornament which includes a selection of four stackable MAC Crushed Metallic Pigments. I generally like the Crushed Metallic Pigment formula and you probably don’t need to be reminded about how pigmented these are and how a little goes a long way. The only downside to the product is the fall out is absurd and you’ll have a mess to contend with during application but outside of that they create some pretty dramatic looks. These particularly shades in the smoky blue kit seemed to be extra chunky and messy. Sadly, the smoky blue shades aren’t colors I’d choose for myself or at least not anymore as they are a bit too strong and my aging eyes will look all kinds of tired with these in place. However, for those who enjoy these shades, this is, indeed, the selection for you. You get: White as Snow: A pure white shimmering snow shade. Silver Sleet: A metallic gunmetal gray silver. Wintersky: A grayish black shimmer. Dark Moon: A pure navy blue. At $32.50 I do think this is a nice little collection of pigments as you’re getting quite a ton of product for your dollar here that will last you for literally ages due to the saturated color of each product. Overall, the MAC Dazzlesphere Collection will probably have some hits and misses. I think they’ll make rather fabulous little gifts for friends and collectors will enjoy the contents however the packaging…well..I find it a little out there. I’m now left with a sphere that I don’t know what to do with. What do you think of the Dazzlespheres? Love the packaging? Leave it? Share! You may also enjoy...

"['MAC 286 Duo Fibre Blending Brush Review By Isabella Muse on July 6, 2012 21 Comments in Beauty Tools , MAC , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Summer Collections 2012 , You Need This To my knowledge MAC released their 286 Duo Fibre Blending Brush in a Holiday 2011 Brush Bag set . Does anyone know if it was released prior to that? I remember it came in one of the bag sets and I fell instantly in love with it. I was happy to be able to get a full size of the brush when it was repromoted this month with the Heavenly Creature Collection. You NEED it. This is a soft bristled fibre brush for blending color. It’s bristles are longer and thinner than my favorite 224 brush. I find the brush offers the ability to sheer color out and offers more control when applying darker shades of shadow. MAC recommends it in conjunction with MAC Mineralize Eye Shadow but I personally feel that this brush with that medium is just a fail. The bristles are floppier which leads to more fall out when using Mineralize Shadow plus the shadows are already sheer so this brush doesn’t build color well. I personally like it for crease work and applying darker shades as it sheers out color and allows better contrast overall. Overall, the MAC 286 Duo Fibre Blending Brush is an excellent brush for more intricate blending. I feel like it’s an ideal pick for darker shades of color that you want to contrast with. Loves it.

It’s kinda a cool design, although a bit impractical for travel. Let’s take a look! After swatching this little guy I had to remind myself I was, indeed, playing with MAC Makeup. Ugh. The formula on these shadows is really subpar. MAC will launch these with their Ice Parade Collection for Holiday 2011 and each will include six shades of eyeshadow in three different color variations of Warm, Cool, and Sultry. The compact is pure white and features a raised dome “snow globe” that contains a dose of bright, sparkling silver glitter. Shake it and the glitter resembles falling silver sparkly snow! It’s a novel compact but it’s a bit impractical for travel and storage purposes since the raised design won’t stack easily. Shadows are 1 gram each and you get six for $38 versus a regular size shadow at 1.5 gram at $15. Break it down and do all the interesting math and the variety and price tag evens out and proves a decent value. Quality on the shadows was just meh for me. Some were chalky, some were flaky, some sheer…it evened out to a mismatch of stinky formulas that I wasn’t particularly thrilled with. Snowball: Sheer, frosty white. Howzat: Pale satin lavender. Warm & Smoky: Mid-range purple. Idol Eyes: Matte black Illegal Cargo: Slate gray Set to Dance: Dark royal matte blue. If you generally like blues some of the cooler shades here may please you but I find the formula is a mix of both good and bad but for the most part…sad to say…it’s alot of bad rather than good. I’ve said it more times than I can count but lately MAC’s formula feels so very foreign to me and not the quality it once was. I’ll be purchasing the Warm Palette in this collection shortly and have hopes it’ll prove better than the Cool. Anyone try this shade selection or any of the others yet? Thoughts? Share them!

"['Reader Review: Bobbi Brown Black Ruby Sparkle Palette By Isabella Muse on October 4, 2011 3 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Holiday Collections 2011 , Reader Reviews , Swatches My reader Nora got her hands on the Bobbi Brown Black Ruby Sparkle Palette and she was excited to share the news with not only me but all of you as well. So here’s a brief peek, review, and swatches of the new Bobbi Brown Black Ruby Sparkle Palette for Holiday 2011 brought to you by Nora. Check it out! I would say this is a lovely addition for any makeup lover (because of the beautiful appearance of the compact) and an even lovelier addition for any Bobbi Brown Sparkle eyeshadow fan. As with her other sparkle shadows, I can’t recommend highly enough to forgo using a brush and to use your finger instead. If you truly want to see the glitter and color of the base, use your fingers. The brush this palette comes with isn’t terrible, but is pretty similar to most palette brushes, i.e. small and not great. The colors themselves, I would say, all have a pink undertone to them. I noticed this most when I swatched the white color – I expected a frosty white but it has a pink sheen to it in the light. Lovely! Like the sparkle version of MAC’s Pink Opal pigment. The pink is a soft, baby pink. The third color is hard to describe. It’s…can I say a mauve-taupe? It’s a slightly-dark maybe brown-ish color with a definite mauve tone to it. Think MAC’s Quarry eyeshadow, perhaps a smidge darker, and you get the idea. And the darkest is a beautiful dark burgundy color. I tried all the colors on right after the FedEx man came. ? They didn’t last all day, but I hadn’t used my trusty UDPP, either. But I will note even with creasing due to lack of good layering, the lasting pigments remained. That is to say, when I took my makeup off, my lids were still noticeably light, my crease was darker, and my outer corners were still noticeably defined. I could see some people wanting to use a dark base under this; this would truly amplify the colors and their respective glitters. I’m definitely trying that in the near future! A light base for day would be amazing, too. (I’m a fan of NYX’s jumbo pencils, so Milk or Black Bean would be great.) In short, the palette is a beauty to behold. As you can see from the picture, the outer packaging, I think, is quite chic. Any fan of sparkly shadows or of pink- or berry-toned palettes will love this. Any Bobbi Brown sparkle eyeshadow fan will (obviously) especially love this. As with her other sparkle shadows, people who don’t like using their fingers or a sponge applicator to apply product probably won’t care for these. But in my opinion, a great holiday present! Sounds great! I can’t wait to try it myself! Thanks so much Nora. Are you planning to grab this one from Bobbi Brown Holiday 2011? You may also enjoy...

"['Bobbi Brown Long Wear Cream Shadow Nude Beach Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 11, 2012 68 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Eyeshadow , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Summer Collections 2012 , Swatches , You Need This Occasionally Bobbi releases an incredible Long Wear Cream Eyeshadow I can’t live without, Navajo happens to be one and most recently I’m gonna say I can’t live without Long Wear Cream Shadow in Nude Beach. Nude Beach is available for a limited time with Bobbi’s Summer 2012 Miami Collection and prior to even bothering to read this review I highly suggest snagging it. It’s just one of those shades you’ll reach for daily. You NEED it. Bobbi Brown Long-Wear Cream Shadow has always been a great formula for me. It applies and blends easily, wears and plays strong through a full day, and has an incredibly flattering finish that brightens up my eyes and makes them look lively no matter the shade I use. Nude Beach is one of those essential shades you’ll want to own for minimal or natural makeup looks. This is an iridescent beige with a very fine pearl sparkle. The shade is close to the color of flesh so it has the ability to meld on lids like a second skin creating a brighter, fresher look to your eyes (as if you had 12 hours of sleep when in reality you only had 6). I love nude beiges like this as they successfully complete a natural look with a little mascara, blush, and gloss. It’s really no nonsense makeup at its best. The shade just pairs up well with anything you want to throw at it while remaining quietly in the background but prominent enough that people will ask, “What are you wearing on your eyes?” Overall, Nude Beach takes the “nude” look and brings it together for an elegant, classy, and minimal look with absolutely no fuss. This is classic makeup at its best. Everyone should own a shade like this. Muse Approved for purchase. You NEED this one in your arsenal. P.S. Did I mention it makes an incredible base for eyeshadow, loose pigments, and minerals too? Available now at Bobbi Brown counters or online at BobbiBrown.com You may also enjoy...

"['Bobbi Brown Long Wear Cream Shadow Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on May 2, 2012 12 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Eyeshadow , Spring Collections 2012 , Swatches Bobbi’s released five new shades of Long Wear Cream Shadow with her new Long Wear Collection. Is your makeup bag feeling lonely after adding these and her new eyeliners to your stash? There’s something to be said about cream eyeshadow that locks on and wears without creasing all darn day. Take a peek! Bobbi Brown Long Wear Cream Shadow isn’t a new product but it gets its own special release this Spring courtesy Bobbi’s new Lonely Makeup Bag campaign. Several new shades have been added to the general catalog and a new focus on these extra long wearing cream eyeshadows comes into play. These come in little glass jars with screw tops. It deserves to be mentioned they have a great formula in terms of expiration. I’ve had some a year and they still have a freshly purchased creamy finish that hasn’t harden or dried out over time. The formula has a certain denseness to it but still manages to have a creamy, easy to blend formula. I typically suggest fingers for application when it comes to cream shadows as they blend easier this way but in the case of these I actually recommend using some sort of flat top brush to get into place. A swipe across eyes will lend beautiful color but I suggest building for great intensity and drama. The joy of the product is most definitely the wear. Without primer I can get a six hour wear from these before they show minor creasing. I find they have a mattifying finish that doesn’t dry down too quickly and gives you just the right amount of time to blend or build. Color with primer does have a better intensity and wear time showing at least a 10-12 period without creasing and/or fading. Smoky Topaz and Berry Noir Berry Noir Smoky Topaz Surprisingly the formula seems ideal for oily lids but you might want to prep a fair bit before hand as my best friend proclaims they crease on him very easily. My drier lids don’t have an issue and I can get through my day without a hiccup. As far as cream shadows go they are some of the nicer ones I’ve tried. The formula is very smooth and applies easily plus color pay off is excellent. I also like the fact the shades are very “grown up” as Bobbi doesn’t really offer a catalog of bright shades but concentrates on more neutrals and naturals to flatter older, aging eyes. Berry Noir Overall, if you’re looking for something with a long wear in a creamy eyeshadow formula these prove a solid pick! Have you used Bobbi Brown Long Wear Cream Shadow? Like them? Not so much?

"['Bobbi Brown Black Ruby Sparkle Eye Palette Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on November 16, 2011 24 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Holiday Collections 2011 , Swatches Sparkle Shadow, my favorite Bobbi shadow of all time. It’s sparkly, it’s shimmery, it’s oh so gorgeous for the Holidays. The formula has undergone some slight changes since they originally introduced it as I feel like it’s thicker and packed a bit better but overall, it’s still as super as it ever way but it does take a special kind of person to love on it as if you’re not a shimmer girl, this one isn’t for you! But if you are a founding member of the sparkle club… Well jump ahead! The Bobbi Brown Black Ruby Sparkle Eye Palette features four shades of Sparkle Eye Shadow. As I mentioned above I feel like the texture of Sparkle Eye Shadow feels an ickle different as it’s packed a bit better in the compact versus the more flakier, loosely packed pigment feel it used to have. This is, of course, a good thing since you’re not seeing alot of kick up when you swipe a brush or applicator across it. I find the colors prove a little more pigmented too although for the most part you have to keep in mind Sparkle Shadows are pretty sheer. I find the best application method for this formula is over a solid base, I recommend Bobbi Brown Long Wear Cream Eyeshadow in Navajo . Also avoid using a brush but embrace the use of a sponge applicator which will build color easily and offer an easy way to pat the shadows into place to avoid fall out. Fall out, yes you’ll see a good deal of fall out here so have a little patience and care during applicator to avoid a mess. The shades you get are: Pink Rose (soft, delicate shade of almost lilac pink…this one is a bit on the sheerer side of the fence and works best applied all over the lid with Black Ruby worked into the outer v to contrast) Crushed Silver (this is a crystal white which is also very sheer but works best as an overcoat over the other shades for added sparkle as on its own it very light and barely noticeable on lids) Black Ruby (this is a blackened shade plum and the most dramatic shade here. I think it pairs up rather nicely with Pink Rose and offers the perfect contrast to the lighter shade) Onyx (this is a pewter which is a lovely shade for a smoky look. It’s the shade I have on my eyes below) The Ruby Sparkle Eye Palette does have a little bit of a misleading name as I expected a red shade and possibly some black…there’s something amazingly gorgeous about a sparkling red and black together don’t you agree? But this leans towards the more smoky, mysterious color aspect. Overall, it has fall out and it takes a little TLC to get these applied correctly but I think the palette is stunning but of course, I’m a bit bias since I adore this shadow formula. Did you indulge? What did you think of the Black Ruby Sparkle Eye Palette? Loved? Left? Do share! Available now at BobbiBrown.com and Bobbi Brown counters. You may also enjoy...

"['Bobbi Brown Shimmering Fragrance Oil Review By Isabella Muse on May 4, 2012 9 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Fragrance , Fragrance Reviews , Summer Collections 2012 I love sparkle, shimmer, and glitter in all my beauty except my fragrance but the Bobbi Brown Shimmering Fragrance Oil released with the new Miami Summer 2012 Collection might just change my mind. Scented with Bobbi’s popular Beach fragrance this little sparkling oil is a treat for legs and arms in the warmer weather. I wasn’t sure I was going to like this as I’m the type of person that applies fragrance oils in my bathroom and proceeds to slip and fall on my butt because it makes the floor all slippery. If you read Musings daily you know my beef with Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Double Mist. I was also a little wary of the sparkle…I’m a self confessed lover of shimmer but I don’t really love it in my fragrances or on my body, etc… But this isn’t bad at all. The sparkle factor is very refined and it gives just a touch of sheen in the right light. You can apply it on your arms and legs or on the traditional pulse points. If you want to be daring, a little touch in your hair is nice too! The lightweight texture of the oil is hydrating and quite refreshingly without being terribly oily or greasy….! My drier skin was begging for more but the fragrance prevented me from going overboard. This smells like Bobbi Brown Beach which really captures the element of Summer, the ocean, and a day at the beach completely. It has those sun tanned, aquatic notes that are reminiscent of a day spent out in the warm Summer sun. Likey! A sparkling, hydrating fragrance mist for Summer? Yes, please. Where can I sign up?

"['Bobbi Brown Miami Treatment Lip Shine Review and Swatches By Isabella Muse on May 9, 2012 16 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Lipstick , Summer Collections 2012 , Swatches Not a lot has changed since I originally reviewed Bobbi Brown Treatment Lip Shine . They still remain a fine favorite of mine for slick, shiny lip color in a flash and hey, add SPF 15 to the mix with a formula that offers long term moisturization and you have a fan for life. Let’s check out the four limited edition shades released with the Bobbi Brown Summer 2012 Collection. Splicing together a gloss, a lipstick, and a little bit of a lip balm together and you’ll get yourself a Bobbi Brown Treatment Lip Shine. With the shiny finish of a gloss, the pigment of a lipstick, and the hydrating properties of a lip balm this little lip treatment brings it all and offers sun protection too! The weightless formula is a soft shiny lipstick that plays doubles duty as a balm that offers moisturizing properties from both Cocoa and Shea Butter as well as Jojoba, Apricot Kernel, and Avocado oils. Peptides are also laced in to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles which creates a smoother, fuller lip look. Swatched from left to right: Sunset Beach, Peach Sorbet, Pink Seashell, Orchid Pink I went into my original review assuming Treatment Lip Shines would be very subtle, sheer, and lightweight. I came out of the review surprised how much pigment they packed however in the case of the limited edition shades released for Summer these colors do run on the more subtle side and have a more nude finish than some of the other colors in the general catalog. If you like a nude, natural lip look you’ll want to explore these colors but if you want something a bit more popping I’d suggest checking out colors that are part of the standard collection. One of the things to love here is the slick, easy glide of the lip treatment across lips. They apply like butter and have a shiny finish that’s very flattering. Orchid Pink Sunset Beach Pink Seashell Peach Sorbet Overall, Bobbi Brown Treatment Lip Shine offer an easy way to get a hint of color, plenty of shine, plus sun protection all in one. The joy here is the hydration throughout the wear so if you have issues with dry lips or lip products that suck moisture out of your lips you’ll be quite happy with how these provide moisture and lock it in throughout the wear. Do check out the limited edition shades. Peach Sorbet and Sunset Beach are lovely and favs from this release. Muse Approved. Tried ’em? Love them? Do share!

"['Bobbi Brown Shimmer Cheek Glow Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on May 3, 2012 4 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Highlighter , Summer Collections 2012 , Swatches Bobbi Brown Shimmer Cheek Glow in Gold is one of two new shades of highlighting powder available with the new Bobbi Brown Miami Summer 2012 Collection. Scratch that…it’s not technically powder. Well wow, isn’t this interesting? Shimmer Cheek Glow is a brand new highlighter from Bobbi available in gold and pink variations. Upon first viewing the product in promo images I assumed it was a solid shade of sparkly highlighter a la Bobbi’s popular ShimmerBrick compacts. Upon actually getting the product…well, things got interesting fast. This isn’t the typical Shimmerbrick variety of highlighter here, it’s something new and unique. This a powder/gel hybrid so you’re getting the smooth, silky texture of a gel with the finish of a sparkling powder. Estee Lauder has something similiar available in the form of their Pure Color Illuminating Powder Gelée but Bobbi has a far lighter texture that feels fluffy, almost mousse-like. Ok, so hold off if you’re as heavy handed as me. This one is a pure sparkle finish. There isn’t a ton of powder going on here and really it’s somewhat like applying a fine, silky shimmer on cheeks and face. The spongy texture of the gel allows for finger application so you can get a precise, discoball-free glow as your fingers allow you to apply lightly versus a brush which might pick up a little too much sparkling joy. I don’t relish the idea of finger application as dipping in and out of the compact with my fingers isn’t exactly hygienic. However, this is the best application method in my humblest. If you must use a brush I suggest a fibre one of some sort or a fan as this will lightly dust on the sparkle without over doing things. If I had to compare the formula to something I’d likely nod at Bobbi’s Sparkle Eyeshadows. This isn’t as flaky or as loosely packed as her Sparkle Shadow but it does have that glowing finish and that smooth, slippery slide of that formula. You can apply on cheeks and face but it also applies beautifully on eyes as well for a wash of bright buttery gold. Overall, this is a unique little product and dare I say fabulous! I love me some sparkle but I do find highlighting powders with shimmer a bit of a challenge. This soft, velvety yet smooth, almost creamy gel allows for pretty precise application without looking over done. I imagine some folks will have reservations about applying gold sparkle on their face but I find this has a nice little twinkling glow that looks lovely!

"['Bobbi Brown Lilac Rose Shimmer Brick Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on March 13, 2013 16 Comments in Bobbi Brown , Highlighter , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Spring Collections 2013 , Swatches I admit I didn’t think I needed the new Bobbi Brown Lilac Rose Shimmer Brick. This from a girl who has like 15 Shimmer Bricks…seriously, do I really need another one? But…Bobbi Brown Shimmer Bricks are that type of product that you feel the need to collect them all! Another reason I didn’t feel I needed the Lilac Rose Shimmer Brick was I wasn’t so sure how shades of lilac and rose in a Shimmer Brick would be on my skin tone….! Take a look! Turns out YOU need the Lilac Rose Shimmer Brick! Outside of the Wild Rose Shimmer Brick , Lilac Rose is possibly my fav color to date! This is actually completely wearable…looking at promo images it appeared more lilac than pink but it’s actually a very flattering array of pinks that will brighten up your face and chase away Winter with pops of Spring pink! The five bars of pearlescent shimmer contain graduating shades of bright pink, golden pink, and icy pink pearl pigments mixed with a smidge of lilac pink create a perfect flush of shimmery glow on my cheeks. If you’re fairer of skin you’ll find it’ll work as a nice shade of glowing blush and if you’re darker you’ll be rewarded with a cooler pink gold glow. Shimmer Bricks can be used on your face as well as a color wash on your lids. The formula has a smooth, silky texture with a shimmery finish. I typically use a kabuki and buff into my skin if I want to use it as a blush. As a highlighter I use a fan brush to apply on my cheek bones and on my eyes I sweep on with a sponge tip applicator (sponge applicators prevent shimmery fall out on cheeks!). Don’t let Lilac Rose escape you, she’s a bit of a sleeper at a glance but once you use her you’ll be quite pleased with the pretty flush of pink shimmer she adds to your cheeks! For my look below I used it all over my cheeks as a blusher. Loves this! Muse Approved. Available at www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com and all Bobbi Brown counters. Own it? Planning to pick it up?

"['Estee Lauder Pure Color Illuminating Powder Gelee Review, Photos, Swatches By Isabella Muse on July 28, 2011 33 Comments in Estee Lauder , Fall Collections 2011 , Highlighter , Swatches You know that one makeup item that you tell (or maybe your friends and family are daring enough to tell you) yourself you shouldn’t be wearing? For me it’s highlighter…I’ve actually come to terms with telling myself, “No, you can’t wear shimmery highlighter.” Yay me! I’m so happy when I give myself a good talking to and I listen. I can’t really take advantage of highlighters because I have a round face and wearing them just makes things look even rounder. Not a good look. However, I collect ’em like the crazy beauty junkie I am. I have zillions of pretty powders that I don’t really use because if you notice, most of ’em, almost always, have shimmer. Of course, Estee Lauder Pure Color Illuminating Powder Gelée pops up as part of their Fall 2011 Collection and my hands begin to sweat because I really need “da shimmery” powder. Lucky enough I got one to show you today! Check it! Estee Lauder calls this a “tribrid” system of liquid, powder, and gel. It’s name and appearance could be slightly misleading as although it looks like a gel and although Estee Lauder calls it one for the most part it feels very much like a powder. Many highlighting or special powders from brands such as Estee Lauder tend to have an overspray which is dusted off to reveal a less than shimmery powder beneath. In the case of Pure Color Illuminating Powder Gelée you’re getting straight shimmering powder right through. The formula is a soft touch powder with a reptile or snake-like appearance, design, and texture. It’s both soft and dense at the same time. The powder blends easily and can be used in any number of places such as face, eyes, cheeks, etc…It comes with a larger sponge for application. I find the sponge a joy to work with as it picks up just the right amount of product to distribute where and when you need it. The powder itself looks like a shimmering champagne beige shade but it reflects various shades of gold…rose, peach, straight gold..it really depends on the lighting. The color has a strong gold color which reflects multiply shades. Interesting enough…feel free to call me crazy…but the powder seems to renew itself. I swiped it this morning and applied on my lids. I noticed that where I swiped was noticeable however after opening it later in the day the placed I swatched seemed to have renewed itself and it seemed like I didn’t even stroke a brush across it. I tried this again and again after about 10 minutes the molecules of the powder seem to move back together and reform to the design…weird…but true. As I mentioned above I do have to avoid application on my face so I wore this on my eyes today as you can see in my photos below. Estee Lauder Pure Color Illuminating Powder Gelée is $40 and probably should be hauled as soon as possible. The collection officially launches in August but many counters already have it out. I think this will probably sell out fairly fast. If you’re a highlighter or fancy powder collection, you’ll want Estee Lauder Pure Color Illuminating Powder Gelée for your own! Very Muse Approved for purchase. Simply a stunning piece of makeup that can be used in a multitude of ways. The Estee Lauder Modern Mercury Collection will also be available online in August at www.esteelauder.com Own it already? Share your thoughts! Wanting it? Let me know all about it! P.S.

"['Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess Summer Glow Multi-Palette Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on April 13, 2016 19 Comments in Blush , Bronzer , Estee Lauder , Highlighter , Makeup Reviews , Palettes , Spring Collections 2016 , Swatches Affiliate Link PR Sample The Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess Summer Glow Multi-Palette ($50) is part of the traditional Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess Collection for Spring 2016. I always look forward to Estee Lauder’s Sun Goddess releases not only because it means Summer is on the way but also because I’m such a big fan of the fragrance they release every year and also because some of the makeup offerings in this classic, traditional collection are quite good. Most years, you’ll find the collection not only sports older offerings from past collections. But you can also expect something new and entirely different to pop up. That would be the case with the Bronze Goddess Summer Glow Multi-Palette! I think everyone expected the Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess Summer Glow Multi-Palette would be like the Pure Color Illuminating Powder Gelée due to the promo images. However, this is actually a completely powder palette and nothing at all like the popular Gelee formula. The palette comes housed in a gold compact that features three shades of color. I’ve heard a lot of different descriptions for the powder one of which would be it can be used on face, cheeks, and eyes. Personally, I only used it on my face and cheeks but I can see some of these shades acting as an eyeshadow easily. The shades consist of a bronzer, highlighter, and a blush. Both the blush and bronzer have a sheer, dense formula with a super smooth, soft surface. I was a little worried about this texture as I felt for sure that I wouldn’t be able to pick up color using a brush. Turns out, the density of the powder is actually great for those of us with heavier hands as the powder blends out flawlessly on my cheek bones and I had no issues with overdoing the shade as it isn’t super, boldly pigmented. You can get a nice, even, smooth, soft finish using both the bronzer and blush no matter if you have uneven skin texture or visible pores because it has a really flawless second-skin finish. Both shades are sheerer but it doesn’t stop them from looking very, very natural and soft on my complexion. I have drier skin myself so I’m always worried about my blush or foundation looking cakey or dry. This formula just melds with my skin and lays down a very smooth layer of color that looks and feels natural. I used the bronzer to add a little shape around my face and the blush on my cheeks with a little dab of the highlighter at the top of my cheekbones. The highlighter is quite smooth as well with a pretty, subtle sparkle that adds natural light and radiance to my cheeks without appearing too frosty or shimmery. If you have a heavier hand and you’re looking for flattering shades of blush, bronzer, and highlighter that bring natural color and light to your face I think you’ll really enjoy the Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess Summer Glow Multi-Palette. This palette surprised me because I was a little worried about the density of the powders but it turned into a lovely way to get a fresh, Spring look!

I normally love Estee Lauder Fall but I’m not sure Modern Mercury is quite me. Tom Pecheux’s, Estee Lauder’s Creative Director, was inspired by creative reflections found in modern architecture and how buildings never look the same color because they are flecting what is around them. His idea is that wearing the same makeup should never end up looking the same way. An interesting concept to say the least. Let’s take a look! Estee Lauder Pure Color Illuminating Powder Gelée $40 A new “tribrid” system of liquid, powder and gel revolutionizes makeup application and wear with the new Pure Color Illuminating Powder Gelée. This first-of-a-kind, “multi-powder” formula creates a theatrical blur of shimmer on the skin when applied dry and a fierce flush of color when applied wet. The unique suspension of golden pigments and pearls float on top of the skin, resulting in a truly unique sensorial experience for skin. The futuristic powder is flexible and uses a luminosity boosting complex that makes the complexion appear perfectly smooth, sexy and glowing with a polished finish.

I think I thought maybe they’d have a semi-matte pigmented formula. Turns out they are SO much more. Launched in 13 shades for $25 each these pencils don’t come cheap but I believe me you NEED at least one but don’t blame me if you can’t stop at a single shade. Right out of the box these bad boys produce full color coverage on application. A single swipe yields excellent pigmentation with a creamy super lightweight formula. They glide across lips in a thin layer with a moisturizing feel and a high sheen finish. No tugging to get color into place, no patchy finish either, just smooth gorgeous color! Golshan Het Loo Isola Bella Het Loo, Isola Bella, Golshan I dunno what I expected from these but I didn’t expect such a thin, lightweight, pigmented color pencil! Smooth, super, moisturizing, NARS successfully combines the color pay off of a full coverage lipstick and the texture of a very lightweight balm into these pencils. Best part? You can line and fill lips with the pencil so it multitasks too! NARS packed these with hyaluronic acid, collagen prepeptides and vitamin E to moisturize lips and give them a fuller appearance. These wear a good four hours on my lips and when they fade they leave behind a nice staining effect. There are literally dozens of lip pencils on the market at the moment particularly ones with lighter more natural finishes. However, the NARS Satin Lip Pencil amps the trend up with a saturated color rich formula that’s as light as a feather and provides an easy travel friendly way to apply!

Since filling the Estee Lauder Creative Makeup Director position, Tom Pecheux has taken the brand, in my opinion, to the next level. It’s ok, you can admit it, you probably feel like Estee Lauder leans more towards your grandmother’s style makeup right? Hey, I’m there with you. Estee Lauder definitely has a mature audience and hasn’t really ventured past that for many years. With Tom Pecheux filling the creative director chair at Estee Lauder the brand has started to have a more universal appeal. Collections and colors are becoming more and more interesting and with time I imagine and patience plus more releases like we’ve been seeing as of late, Estee Lauder will not longer be associated with your great aunts and grandmothers. This proves true with a very interesting limited edition collection Estee Lauder Pure Color Extravagant Collection by Tom Pecheux that releases with the Estee Lauder Holiday Collection 2010 this year. Jump! As you can see from the right side of the stock image Estee Lauder keeps its roots in the realm of a more subdued natural, nude look however on the left side is festive selection of glistening metallics in vivid shades of red and berry. If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably been searching for that perfect shade of red eye shadow your entire life. The red shade in this palette looks gorgeous but I’ll need to inspect and explore a little more when it launches. I sadly do not have prices, a release date, or product info but as soon as I know, I’ll post. For now feel free to blather on about how you feel about this release!

"['Estee Lauder Pure Color Five Color EyeShadow Palette Extravagant Gold Review, Swatches Estee Lauder Pure Color Long Lasting Lipstick Extravagant Berry and Red Review, Swatches By Isabella Muse on October 21, 2010 18 Comments in Estee Lauder , Eye Palettes , Eyeshadow , Holiday Collections 2010 , Lipgloss , Lipstick , Swatches , Winter Collections 2010 The Estee Lauder Pure Color Extravagant by Creative Makeup Director Tom Pecheux proves that Estee Lauder is not your grandmother’s cosmetic company. This collection features some key pieces that will surely become must have items as soon as you see them for yourself particularly if you love cosmetics that give a timeless beauty option. I’m more than thrilled about this exciting Holiday release because it truly brings elegant makeup to the table. If your a fond fan of brands such as Givenchy, Guerlain, etc…but aren’t a fan of the higher price tags, this collection is something you should take into consideration for your Holiday looks! Jump! Now if you like a more bolder look that leans towards vibrant shades you might wanna skip out here as this definitely doesn’t concentrate on bold in the eye department. Estee Lauder Pure Color Five Color EyeShadow Palette in Extravagant Gold can definitely be deemed subdued and mature for those who enjoy brands such as Urban Decay and Too Faced. I know, I relate, I love those brands too however I have no problems embracing a more natural, fresher, mature look as of late. Perhaps I’m getting old. This palette is a timeless piece that you’ll reach for daily if you work in an office environment or if you’re just one for playing it safe with your makeup. I absolutely loved it and it comes with my recommendation for purchase. The shades are all very pigmented, blend beautifully, and create an exceptional look. Now they aren’t really traditionally festive shades for the Holidays but they are beautiful none the less. The palette houses a soft cream beige, a dirty gold, a coppery brown, a lighter brown, and a taupe brown liner. I used the lighter brown and cream in my look below and you’ll understand why I went with these shades. I imagine someone with alot more creativity then myself could easily create a look using all five shades however I personally think the palette will create two solid looks or various others by contrasting the various shades. Now as I mentioned above I went with a more subdued look with my shades of shadow because of the lip look I embraced. Two new shades of Estee Lauder Pure Color Long Lasting Lipstick Extravagant Berry and Extravagant Red were also introduced with this Holiday Collection. Now where as the palette is very fresh and light, the lipsticks are outrageous, bold, and gorgeous. For my look below I used Extravagant Berry topped with Extravagant Plum Gloss. The lipsticks are coated in a festive gold shimmer which surrounds the outer base but no worries they apply sans shimmer and and have a beautiful creamy finish. Pigmentation is surreal on these. They are probably the most pigmented lipsticks in my stash to date. Berry leans towards being a warmer maroon red where as Red leans towards having a coral-like base with a bit of red. Both shades are very warm and needless to say very, very bold, vibrant, and pretty. Along with the lipsticks three limited edition shades of Estee Lauder Pure Color Lip Gloss have released. I tried out Exvatragent Plum which pairs up wonderfully with the Berry Lipstick. The shade is a plummy, reddish shimmer that looks great on its own but definitely lends sizzle to lipsticks. Pure Color Lip Gloss is one of my favorite lipglosses at the moment so I do urge you to read my full review here. Tom Pecheux proves again to me what an asset he is to Estee Lauder with this collection. It isn’t traditionally Holiday to me but regardless it is a beautiful selection that will create some very elegant looks for the season. This has quickly become a fast favorite of mine this year and I do believe it’s well worth a check out. I’m Muse Approving it for purchase since I was so incredibly impressed with the offerings. The Estee Lauder Pure Color Extravagant Collection for Holiday 2010 proves a gorgeous selection. Do check it out. The collection is available now at www.esteelauder.com and counters.

"['NARS Pierre Hardy Boys Don’t Cry Blush Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 6, 2013 10 Comments in Blush , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Nars , Spring Collections 2013 , Swatches , You Need This PR Sample NARS Boys Don’t Cry High Blush is the second limited edition blush that released with the Pierre Hardy NARS Collection that launched earlier this Spring. Yesterday, I reviewed Rotonde for you which I absolutely adored by the very way. If anything Boys Don’t Cry Blush is just as stunning as Rotonde if not better! Take a peek! NARS went all out with these and made them near triple the size of the standard 0.16 size. They are whooping 0.45 oz in size for $41 each. Honestly, I question whether I need a blush this size since I’m a beauty junkie and I have a ton of blush to get through. So really, do I need this much blush? The answer is yes. With colors this unique you simply do not want to be without them especially when they are LE. NARS pitches this as pink grapefruit but it leans towards being more of a reddish coral. It has a matte finish with a gold design over spray. I navigate towards shimmer blushes myself and avoid mattes but I can’t say I have a single issue with this formula. It isn’t dry and has a smooth, finely milled texture which you can use lightly for a sheer finish or build up to a very bold, vibrant popping finish. It’ll work on a wide range of skin tones as it is heavily pigmented but be careful if you have natural redness in your cheeks as the red in the blush does dominate the blush. I use a fan brush and I can get a very cool shade of corally red on my cheeks this way. It wears hours on in, keeping its vibrancy through the wear! I think both shades surprised me because with this much pigment and a matte finish I expected they would blend poorly or apply patchy. But they are an absolute joy to use and apply. They blend perfectly each and every time giving a flawless flush on cheeks! Absolutely love both shades and dub them an absolute must have. They are available for a limited time so I urge you to haul before they disappear. Anyone own this one? Do share! Available now on counters or at narscosmetics.com You may also enjoy...

"['NARS Soulshine Cheek Palette Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on August 13, 2013 10 Comments in Blush , Fall Collections 2013 , Makeup Reviews , Nars , Swatches Purchased NARS Soulshine Cheek Palette is one of two new blush cheek palettes introduced by NARS for the Fall 2013 season. These monster cheek palettes aren’t new as NARS recently introduced them with the Pierre Hardy Collection . Both these shades, Rotonde and Boy’s Don’t Cry , were an instant hit for me and made my Muse Approval list. I just thought they were stunning! NARS Soulshine Cheek Palette does not disappoint and is just as gorgeous. Take a look! NARS Soulshine Blush Palette is $41 and weights in at 0.42 oz in size which makes it three times the size of a normal NARS Blush which is 0.16 oz and $29. When you’re thinking about the extra $12 you’re spending remember what a great value you’re getting here with a blush this size! NARS Soulshine contains three blocks of color in a mosaic-like design with the a NARS gold logo. The gold on the NARS logo is an over spray which disappears with the first use of the blush. I think it’s easiest to use the blush by swirling them together but the palette is large enough that you can wriggle around the shades should you attempt using them individually. This has a soft finely milled texture but they do kick up a good deal of powder when I swirl a blush in them but doesn’t mean the formula is chalky as I find the blush very silky to the touch. They blend very easily but be sure to tap off excess as you’ll likely pick up quite a good bit even with a lighter hand and this results in clowny cheeks so tap and build slowly. I feel like they took all my favorite blushes like Oasis, Orgasm, Deep Throat, etc…and combined it into a single palette. The overall color you’ll get when wearing the shades together is a golden reddish coral. This is the darker of the two shades that NARS released in the cheek palette so it should work for warmer skin tones wonderfully but fairer tones might wish to go with the lighter palette entitled Realm of Senses. Overall, I though Soulshine was gorgeous. As a long time fan of NARS blushes there isn’t anything not to love here. Muse Approved. Both NARS Cheek Palettes are available exclusively at Sephora and Sephora.com Anyone grab either shade? Or both? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"['NARS Persia Eyeshadow Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on February 20, 2013 20 Comments in Eyeshadow , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Nars , Spring Collections 2013 , Swatches I feel like Emily the Strange this morning wearing NARS Persia Single Eyeshadow. It creates that sunken in goth girl eye look. I used it with a bit of brown as the shade is too intense to be worn alone. Even though, if it was up to me, I’d probably wear it all over my lid and happily go around with bright tangerine lids. Shrug, I’ve worn weirder shades in the past I’m sure. Love bright shades of orange? You need this! Is it burnt orange? Is it tangerine? Or as NARS calls it paprika. NARS Persia Eyeshadow ($24) is described as matte paprika or as I like to call it, a matte burnt orange. This was launched with NARS Spring 2013 Collection . It’s bold, it’s vibrant, and it’s all kinds of incredible. I don’t typically like matte shades of shadow and never made any secret of that but this is a gorgeous shade with an equally easy to use formula which made me realize, “Hey, I don’t mind you being a matte! You’re still cool with me”. I definitely get rusty burnt orange from the shade with hints of red. It can be worn alone, sheered out, all over lids if you dare. I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing you just have to be careful you aren’t as heavy handed as I am as the shade is concentrated with a good deal of pigment so sheering it is key for all over lid use. I combined it with a brown eyeshadow but black works as well as it mutes the shades and contrasts nicely. I think it flatters brown eyes quite well and will work well on those with medium, tan, or darker skin tones. It’s quite soft and silky but kicks up a fair bit of powder when a brush is applied to it. But unlike mattes I’m used to it isn’t dry nor is it chalky. It blends like an absolute dream. If all mattes were this amazing I’d be a complete convert. It wears very well even without primer for a solid 12 hours. I wore it through a long, hard Saturday without a hiccup. Today I’m wearing it over some primer and I’m sure it’ll get me straight through the day without a problem. Overall, Persia is definitely one to add to your stash if you enjoy unique shades of orange. If you’re feeling daring you could probably easily use it as a blush as well. The less is more philosophy definitely comes into effect with this shade but I promise the results are amazing! Do love. Get it now at NARS counters or online at narscosmetics.com Muse Approved!

"['NARS Realm of the Senses Cheek Palette Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on August 15, 2013 3 Comments in Blush , Fall Collections 2013 , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Nars , Swatches Purchased I have to say when I tried NARS Soulshine Cheek Palette I thought for sure I wouldn’t like NARS Realm of the Senses Cheek Palette. The NARS Realm of the Senses Cheek Palette isn’t as rich as Soulshine, it looks lighter even chalky somehow, and I thought perhaps a bit dense and drier. Boy was I wrong! Now it’s hard to say if I love Soulshine more or Realm of the Senses. Screw it. Buy them both! I should have known I’d love them as I adored Boys Don’t Cry and Rotonde , the two original Cheek Palettes from NARS that launched earlier this year. This is a super size blush and contains a whooping 0.42 oz of blush for $41. I discussed it a few times before but this is nearly three times the size of a regular NARS Blush which only has 0.16 oz of product. You might want to take that into consideration when trying to digest the $41 price tag. NARS Cheek Palettes are fairly new and right now there are four of them total but I can honestly see myself buying them again and again and again even at this size which are a little overwhelming for a beauty junkie with more blushes than she knows what to do with. You can use the shades in the palette swirled together, which I prefer, or the wells are large enough to wriggle around them and use the colors individually if you like. Like Soulshine, Realm of the Senses has a soft, silky, finely milled texture that kicks up a fair bit of powder when you brush through it. It blends so dreamy on cheeks and has an ease of application that’s really something to talk about. I love how easily this applies and how natural it looks on my cheeks with a soft glowing finish. There is an over spray on the blush but this is merely an accent and does not run through the product so you can swipe it away easily and it won’t give your face or cheeks a disco ball effect. NARS Blush is one of my favorite formulas but I admit the texture and formula isn’t consistent across many of the shades. I think the NARS Cheek Palette Blushes are considerably a nicer and consistent formula that’s been perfect each time I tried it thus far. The shade I like most in this palette is the golden peach that quite reminds me of a more pigmented shade of NARS Orgasm. Other accenting shades include a subtle golden beige and a plum reddish brown. Combining them I get a golden pink peach on my cheeks. This shade selection is best suited for fairer, medium fair skin types so I’d recommend Soulshine for a deeper skin tone. Overall, Realm of the Senses is well worth a pick up! It, like Soulshine, is an incredible blush formula with wonderful pigment and a beautiful finish on cheeks. Muse Approved for this one! It’s available now exclusively at Sephora and Sephora.com I’m looking to the Holidays in the hopes NARS does more of these WONDERFUL cheek palettes! Tried ’em? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"['NARS Pierre Hardy Rotonde Blush Palette Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 5, 2013 13 Comments in Blush , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Nars , Summer Collections 2013 , Swatches , You Need This PR Sample Props to you if you’ve been able to resist the Pierre Hardy for NARS Blush Palettes ! Rotonde is one of two blush shades that are available for a limited time which Pierre Hardy collaborated with NARS to create. This super size blush palette is a stunning shade of tiger lily orange and an absolute MUST have for the NARS Blush junkies out there. And hey, if you NEVER used or purchased a NARS Blush before now is a good time to start. Weighting in at 0.45 oz the NARS Pierre Hardy Rotonde Blush Palette is $41 nearly three times the size of the normal 0.16 NARS Blush at $29. Being obsessed with blushes I can’t help but think ahead to NARS Fall 2013 in the hopes they’ll introduce more electrifying shades of blush in this style of packaging. Who needs this much blush though? Well, the point is when you have such a unique gorgeous color like this you’ll WANT to hoard it away and own more of it. This is a bolder medium orange with a matte finish that has a gold over spray. I typically avoid oranges as they make my duller skin even more dull but Rotonde is simply stunning to say the least. The joy of the product is although pigmented you can wear it sheerer or bolder in a few swipes of your brush (I went sheerer for my look in this post). The color is true to pan and should work across a wide range of skin tones just use a lighter touch if you’re fairer and a heavier one if you’re darker. For a matte blush the texture is super soft, silky, and very, very easy to apply. I’ve run across a drier NARS Blush or two in my day but I do so promise this texture is a joy to apply and use and it looks perfect with every single application. And did I mention the incredible wear time? It just wears and wears and wears! I can get a solid twelve hours out of it and it looks as intense as the first time I applied. The sadness it this is available for a limited time but as I said there’s still NARS Fall 2013 to look forward and maybe some new and exciting shades in the future like this!? One can hope! It’s available now on counters or at www.narscosmetics.com You absolutely NEED it. Own it? Do share your thoughts! You may also enjoy...

"['Pierre Hardy for NARS Blushes By Isabella Muse on April 17, 2013 30 Comments in Nars , Summer Collections 2013 So yeah, that picture above is PRETTY much how I felt and probably looked when these new Pierre Hardy for NARS Blushes in Boy’s Don’t Cry and Rotonde popped into my inbox. There was snarling, grabby hands, possible drool, and a whole lot of “MINE! MINE! ALL MINE!” These are stunning, I have a funny feeling you might NEED them. Beginning May 1st at narscosmetics.com the Pierre Hardy for NARS Collection will be launching and with that collection these two ridiculously, incredibly, OMG orgasm inducing blushes will be available. Update: These are AVAILABLE NOW online. Twice the size of a normal NARS Blushes these over sized beauties are gorgeous to say the least. I haven’t tried them but man, am I looking forward to it. Boy’s Don’t Cry is a stunning pink grape and Rotonde is bright tiger lily orange. I swoon so hard right now. Rotonde Boy’s Don’t Cry Each one is $41 but don’t let the price scare you because as I said they are larger than the average every day NARS Blush. They have a shimmery overspray which has prevented me from actually swatching them yet as I just want to gaze at the pretty for a while longer before ruining it with a brush. Le sigh. I have a feeling these are going to be special. More goodness, a review, and swatches coming soon on these very special blushes. Will you be hauling them when they launch? P.S. Injustice Gods Among Us…thoughts? I braved the Flushing traffic to head to my friend Angel’s game store to pick this up yesterday (bad idea, omg traffic, but killer ramen) and I’m kinda not sure how I feel about it yet. I do know that playing it kept me up way past the call of bed and now I feel like utter crap this morning. Someone hand me a cup a tea and a blanket I’ll be under my desk napping if you need me!

"['NARS Nordstrom’s Best Cheek Palette for Fall 2016 By Isabella Muse on July 14, 2016 11 Comments in Fall Collections 2016 , Nars Affiliate Link Here’s one you won’t find anywhere else but at Nordstrom! The new NARS Nordstrom’s Best Cheek Palette for Fall 2016 gets an early release today during the 2016 Nordstrom Anniversary Sale. It’s a weird thing because the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale tends to have “beauty exclusives” but most end up being sold everywhere else as we get closer to Fall. So much for being exclusive right? But I will promise you that the NARS Nordstrom’s Best Cheek Palette ($65) will be one you can’t find anywhere else. But the sad news would be it fills with shades most NARS addicts probably already own like Orgasm, Deep Threat, and Laguna. But the good news? It’s a great introductory palette for those who don’t have a ton of NARS blushes currently in their stash! You get: Blush in Orgasm Blush in Deep Throat Blush in Luster Blush in Desire Highlighting Blush in Albatross Bronzing Powder in Laguna I’m not ordering it. I already sadly have much of what is in it. I was tempted that’s for sure! My mentality was it would be great to travel with but I see some other items I want more than this! If you have a Nordie’s card you can pre-book and order the palette in stores and pick it up next week! Or grab it at Nordstrom.com. You may also enjoy...

"['NARS Audacious Lipstick Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on August 15, 2014 18 Comments in Fall Collections 2014 , Lipstick , Makeup Reviews , Nars , Swatches PR Sample Affilate Link The NARS Audacious Lipstick Collection is getting a HUGE launch for Fall 2014 in a variety of colors and there is even an NARS Audacious Lipstick Vault that’s available that pairs up nail colors with this new lipstick formula. At $32, the new NARS Audacious Lipstick toes the line into the realms of higher end makeup. I’ve always personally considered NARS a cross between a mid and high end brand myself but $32 per lipstick def enters the realms of higher end. Needless to say they are well worth every single penny as this formula is pretty darn incredible. I have quite a few NARS Lipsticks but the Audacious formula does trump anything I’ve seen from NARS Lipstick in the past. Housed in a metal square barrel with a magnetic cap the packaging of this lipstick is simple, understated, yet terribly chic and modern. The formula is richly pigmented with an excellent color pay off on the first layer. It’s thinner in consistency with a slippery no tug application. It feels very moisturizing with a lightly glossy finish and a lightweight formula. The wear is very good at around five hours however, I notice during application and during wear these like to creep around my lip line and mouth. NARS recently introduced an updated Velvet Lip Liner formula so you might wish to indulge in a few shades to keep this formula from running around your face. I have drier lips so I was fairly impressed with the smooth finish on these. They do not accentuate the natural lines in lips nor do they catch on flakier areas. The formula is simply put, amazing. It’s really a luxurious lipstick with pleasant, comfortable, and long wear on lips. I didn’t detect any fragrance or flavor either for those sensitive to such. NARS Audacious Lipstick (Audrey) NARS Audacious Lipstick (Olivia) NARS Audacious Lipstick Swatches (Audrey and Olivia) The migrating issue is a little frustrating but clear transparent lip liner (or colored if you’re a fan) will keep things right on target. And who knows it could be isolated issue that I’m experiencing! Needless to say I was very impressed overall! These pack everything you could want in a lipstick formula. Glossiness, moisture, pigment, and long wear, what more could a girl or guy want in their lipstick? NARS The Audacious Lipsticks will be available at NARS Boutiques and narscosmetics.com as well as exclusive shades available at barneys.com and Barney’s New York counters as of September 1st.

Taking things one step further some very special products from NARS will bring out many a true hearted NARS fan. Take a look at the NARS Hanamichi Kabuki Eyeshadow Palette and NARS Kudoki Kabuki Lip Set and dare not to drool! NARS Hanamichi Kabuki Eyeshadow Palette $65 NARS interprets the dramatic Kabuki eye with a modern and magnificent palette of high-impact, richly saturated hues for highlighting, shading and lining the eye.

Now NARS Fall Collection 2010 is one to look out for. Releasing July 15th, this is an array of gorgeous shades that’s sure to please NARS fans far and wide. Check it! NARS Douceur Blush $26 Sweet, gentle, delicate. NARS Douceur Blush: A soft pink-brown hue that lightly imparts a honeyed brown kiss of innocence on cheeks. Unique to the Fall 2010 collection, the powder is lightly etched with the NARS logo. NARS Daphne Eyeshadow $23 Style icon. Designer. Model. Heiress of haute couture. Named after Daphne Guinness herself—François Nars’ inimitable muse—this hypnotizing matte, deep-violet single eyeshadow exudes excitement. Apply liberally across the lid up to the brow, blending outward. Head-turning. NARS Mangrove Eyeshadow (Limited Edition) $23 The magnificence of this tropical tree, captured in the softest, mellow yellow laced with lime. Richly pigmented and crease-resistant, use this single eyeshadow to highlight the inner corner of the eye, as a bright base shade for the lid or to diffuse a deeper shade by sweeping it into the bridge. NARS Coconut Grove Eyeshadow $23 Grooving in the Grove—Miami’s magical neighborhood on Biscayne Bay—has attracted musicians, artists, and writers for decades. Dense, dramatic, and daring, this dark chocolate-cum-taupe confection increases depth on the lid and doubles as a lash liner when used wet. NARS Rouge Basque Lipstick (Limited Edition) $24 Inspired by the inside cover of a book from the famed French countryside, François Nars envisioned the quintessential red from the Basque region. The result is lipstick with a luminous satin finish. It is as deeply pigmented as the region’s history and as bold as the wine for which the area is known. Pair with NARS pencils, or apply with a NARS lip brush. NARS Strawberry Fields Lip Gloss (Limited Edition) $24 Imagine juicy, mouthwatering strawberries, just picked. Then delight in the serious, yet sexy shine of this bright pink confection. Worn alone or over NARS lip products, the gloss’ Vitamin-E enriched formula seals in moisture. Lips feel supple and hydrated. NARS Palladium Soft Touch Shadow Pencil (Limited Edition) $24 Once the NYC hot-spot, characterized by glamour, glitz, and decadence. This sparkling turquoise soft touch shadow pencil rocks with all the vibrancy and sex appeal of its namesake. Layer it with other NARS eye products—or go it alone— to line, accent, highlight or illuminate unforgettable eyes. NARS Tzarine Eyeshadow Duo $32 Love, sex and power. Russia’s empresses had it all. Inspired by royalty, the eyeshadow duo pairs the majesty of platinum gold infused with silver reflections with a bold, steel grey. Swipe and shadow along the upper lid or smudge along the lower. Positively regal. Rajasthan Eyeshadow Duo (Limited Edition) $32 Sacred temples and scorching deserts. Bengalese tigers and Bagaru prints. India’s largest state fascinates and tantalizes. Like its namesake, the Rajasthan Eyeshadow duo is an exotic palette, playing glazed almond against cool charcoal. Worn solo, blended or layered, the look signals drama. Ok, let’s see, virtual wish list, I want the duos, I want the gloss, I want the blush….yes, I shall be broke. Everything looks delicious. Hopefully they look as gorgeous in person…well maybe I should hope not, I’d be richer for it if they weren’t. What do you think? Anything appealing? You may also enjoy...

"[""Lush the Kiss Lip Gloss Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on February 7, 2013 14 Comments in Lipgloss , Lush , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Spring Collections 2013 , Swatches , Valentine's Day Collections Lush’s first ever lip gloss for Valentine’s Day makes my lips pucker in delight. Lush the Kiss Lip Gloss was recently launched with their Valentine’s Day 2013 Collection and I was a little skeptical about trying it. Typically Lush lip balms are very dense…as much as I love the brand I haven’t loved a single one of their lip balms. Le sigh! The Kiss I was skeptical of but also very interested as it wasn’t called a balm but a lip gloss! Wow…this is the first potted lip gloss in known history. Is it good? Hells yes. If your OCD good nature can get over having to apply it with your fingers you’ll be a-ok to grab it. Yeah, the tin design makes it difficult to travel with as seriously who wants to dip their nasty fingers into a lipgloss and apply on the road? Not I! However…. If you can get past all that Lush has successfully created a lovely little gloss for lips. The texture resembles softened taffy and is a pale shade of pink. The pink does transfer to lips at first and comes across rather deathly mod on my lips, not a good look. But what starts out as a thick, odd shade of pink on my lips quickly morphs as it warms up. The thicker texture goes glossy, the pink dissipates and becomes clearer, and you’re left with soft, smooth, shiny lips all ready for kissing. Real almond and mandarin flavoring give this a sweet yet foody taste with shea and cupuacu butters to keep lips hydrated through the wear. It’s a winner! Loves this stuff. It almost feels like a lip oil of sorts so my cracked, flaky lips are soaking in all this extra moisture and loving. Don’t like the packaging but love the gloss. Excellent job Lush! Now recreate all your past balms with this new formula and I would be a very happy Muse. Get it at www.lushusa.com Tried it? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"[""Celebrate Valentine’s Day with the Kiko Lip Me Lots Collection By Isabella Muse on January 22, 2018 12 Comments in Kiko , Spring Collections 2018 , Valentine's Day Collections Affiliate Kiko Lips Me Lots for Valentine’s Day 2018 arrives and brings with it the return of Lip Me Lots Lipstick which is a darling heart shaped lipstick design a la the new Guerlain KissKiss LoveLove Lipstick and Holika Holika Heartfull Glossy Lipstick. Kiko always has something darling up their sleeves for Valentine’s Day. I’m one of those people that isn’t really into V-Day (do we really need one day to say we love each other?! We should be doing that everyday!) but I flip out over all the decorations, chocolates, and of course, beauty and makeup that launches around this time of the year. Not a lot of brands really focus on V-Day so, it always seems extra special when someone does do a product or collection launched themed around the Holiday. One of the things I’m loving from this collection this year is the new Kiko Lip Me Lots Blush ($15). This is available in a single shade and has a sweet vanilla fragrance with a satiny finish. Last year they launched the Kiko Love Elixir Face Powder but I’m liking the looks of the new blush a lot. But it does look sheer but hopefully I’m wrong! There’s also a matching Kiko Lip Me Lots Face Highlighter ($15) is a fine golden sheen shade that matches up with the blush! Last year, we got Endless Love Lipstick with had a glossy sheen and this year the formula is revised and called Lip Me Lots Lipstick ($10) which is matte in finish sadly. But knowing Kiko it’s a comfortable matte as the brand is legendary for creating some fantastic lipstick formulas. They launched these in six shades with a very affordable ten dollar price tag. Other lip products include a new Kiko Lip Me Lots Ph Lip Enhancer ($11) which is a sheer personalized lip balm that changes color upon contact with lips for a natural, personalized shade that contains a glossy sheen finish. For a little fun they also have a new Lip Me Lots Eyeliner and Stamp Tattoo ($11) which might be a little silly if it weren’t for the fact it is dual-ended so it contains a black liquid liner on one side and a heart stamp tattoo on the other than be used on your face or body. And finally it wouldn’t be a Kiko Collection without cute accessories! This Lip Me Lots Kabuki Brush ($16) has a bright red metallic handle which is heart-shaped and can be used to buff powder, blush, or highlighter into your face! Cute collection right?

"['NYC New York Color Lovatics by Demi Lip & Cheek Tint Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on July 13, 2016 12 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Blush , Cheek Stain , Drugstore Makeup Brands , Makeup Reviews , N.Y.C. New York Color Cosmetics , Summer Collections 2016 , Swatches Affiliate Link Purchased I’m likely in the minority but I’m loving on the new NYC New York Color Lovatics by Demi Lip & Cheek Tint ($3.57). NYC New York Color Lovatics by Demi Lip & Cheek Tint is a new liquid cheek and lips stain part of new collaborated makeup collection between Demi Lovato amd NYC New York Color Cosmetics that’s available in three shade selections. If you like products like Benefit Benetint you’re bound to enjoy this formula. Although I do know many people hate on Benetint because it proves so difficult to apply and blend without looking blotchy. I think I was personally loving on Benetint because it was of the few products of its kind over ten years ago when I originally tried it. Nowadays, there are far superior formulas around so Benetint isn’t one I reach for often. NYC New York Color Lovatics by Demi Lip & Cheek Tint is the same concept at a cheaper price and in a wider range of shades with an easier to blend formula. Take a look! NYC New York Color Lovatics by Demi Lip & Cheek Tint is available in a tiny chubby, glass bottle with an attached brush for application and weights in at 0.27 oz in size. It looks pretty much like a nail polish and can easily be confused with one. I never understood why brands felt the need to packaging cheek stain in a glass bottle. I think it screams danger! Speaking from experience, if you drop this on a hard floor it’s going to shatter pretty easily. I heard a lot of mixed reviews about these and most weren’t favorable. Heck, some of you even told me you didn’t like these! I can see why since they are bright and quite pigmented. Not everyone is going to want to run around with pink cheeks. Personally, I loved two out of the four shades I purchased. They make for really easy, simple, natural looks on a warm Summer day. I brought them with me on vacation and they were pretty much all I used on my cheeks in the day because they had such incredibly strong wear on super humid days! They are pretty much a standard liquid cheek stain that you can simply brush on with the applicator and blend out with fingers. The formula sets fairly fast so, once you dot it on you’ll want to work quickly to blend it out. I honestly had no issues with application myself even if they set mighty fast. It was a simple three dot and blend process that took all of 5 seconds to apply. I didn’t feel they had a ruddy or blotchy appearance but some of the shades are quite bright so a little goes a very long way. I think they provide better pigment on my face versus my lips where the color pay off proved a little sheerer and a lot less longer wearing. Speaking of which, they aren’t going anywhere until you remove them! Oily, dry, combo, doesn’t matter your skin type these are budge, sweat, and waterproof. They fade a little tiny bit over the course of a 12 to 14 hour day but it is not noticeable in the least. Hell, you could probably sleep in them and wake up with blush still on. Apply a little fluid foundation, concealer, curling my lashes, and a dash of this is what I call natural Summer makeup. It gives my cheeks a burst of reddish pink color. Although it deserves to be mentioned many of the shades look the same on cheeks which means you don’t have to haul all four of ’em! NYC New York Color Lovatics by Demi Lip & Cheek Tint (Cheeky Pink, Cheeky Red, Cheeky Strawberry, Cheeky Berry) The shades range from really bright to sheer in color pay off. The two best shades for me were Cheeky Pink and Cheeky Berry. I felt like Cheeky Red and Cheeky Strawberry barely showed up on my skin even after much layering. On lips, they are all pretty sheer. NYC New York Color Lovatics by Demi Lip & Cheek Tint (Cheeky Berry) NYC New York Color Lovatics by Demi Lip & Cheek Tint (Cheeky Pink) I don’t think everyone will like the NYC New York Color Lovatics by Demi Lip & Cheek Tint formula as it is a very bright stain that might appear a bit ruddy on those with a lot of redness in their cheeks or face. However, I thought it was lovely stuff and it’ll be particularly nice on tanned skin tones. If you like quick and go makeup this is a great one to indulge it!

"[""Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Radiant Blush Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on July 12, 2011 19 Comments in Beauty on a Budget , Blush , Swatches , Victoria's Secret Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Radiant Blush is a new goodie that launched recently in the every evolving Beauty Rush Collection. I kinda squealed a little upon seeing them at VS as I really enjoy the Beauty Rush Collection and just think it’s rather fun for makeup junkies like myself to see new bits and bobs pop up to keep things fresh and lively. The latest launch is three shades of powder blush for $7 each or the typical 4 for $20 mix and match. Let’s take a peek at some of the blushes I hauled! A new powder blush from the Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Collection. I’m always slightly frustrated that I feel the need to dish out $20 each time I purchase Beauty Rush products as I really want to make them cheaper than they already are ($7 each just seems to expensive for some odd reason or another). But I didn’t mind so much in this case since they had these new blushes and some new glosses too! Broken down to $5 each these are a rather fab little budget pick or if you just indulge in one at $7 you’re still coming away with a rather nice steal depending on how frugal you are (see my above whine). Each blush comes in a square plastic compact with a faux mirror border. The packaging is no nonsense, stores easily, and travels well. I like the packaging as the squares tuck into my makeup collection without taking up alot of space yet still manage to be large enough for my blush brush to come away with plenty of color. The formula is surprisingly silky and smooth. The blush is a finely milled powder with a nice pop of color that can be applied sheer and builds easily up for better color pay off. Although they swatch a bit chalky they still manage to blend easily while looking very natural and pretty. These are available in three shades, I purchased two of the three. The colors I got were Flutter which is a cool shade of pink and Fresh Love a warmer coral peach. I haven’t it yet seen in person but I was thinking Fresh Love looked alot like the new Stila Custom Color Blush in Coral. I don’t have a single bad thing to say about these aside from the fact that I’d like to see a wider selection of colors! Anyone looking for a budget blush that can handle a sheer application or can be built up for a more popping finish. Anyone looking for a blush that blends easily with a nice formula that won’t cost a ton of money. Anyone on a budget seeking a nice blush ($7 for one or mix and match any 4 for $20). Those seeking a larger selection and variety of colors (with only three shades to choose from, colors are limited). I loved these. They are probably the best thing to come along from the Beauty Rush Collection in a while! At $7 I wouldn’t call them budget but if you break them down to the $5 price tag by taking advantage of the 4 for $20 you are getting a nice little steal. The formula offers a nice buildability plus they blend dreamy. If you’re up for a little beauty budgeting and in need of a blush that won’t break the bank but you don’t mind a smaller color range to choose from you might want to check these out. I likey!

This is a bit of a Valentine’s Day Collection with a bit of Spring I guess thrown in… One of the interesting things about VS Makeup Collections lately is the fact they actually release less product but release more color selections. Each of the eye quads and blushes in this particular collection has four or more shades….interesting eh? So if before you were damning the makeup Gods for not having your shade in a collection at VS, take it back, you’ll now find a wider shade selection available. Go on, strike up a little Duran Duran for this collection, I won’t tell anyone and hell I’ll even sing along! Is it weird I wanna lick beads of sweat from Simon’s sweat brow? Plus I wanna be the one to feed him dribbles of water from a nasty, sweaty rag! Get that kid out of the way, q the Muse! RawRrrrr! Check it!

The Muse is thinking it’s sweet…. Jump! Happy days when new Beauty Rush comes a knocking at my door. I was quite delighted with this release from VS as it contains a Cherry scent! OMG! How adore anything that has a tinge of cherry to it. Disappointingly, Victoria’s Secret fails to get it right yet again with the release of three new Beauty Rush Double Mists. Why, o, why do they keep doing these? I really don’t like the feel of these fragrances and much rather a body spray of some sort le sigh. I’ll have to cope as I like the sounds of the fragrances. Available for 3 for $25 in the following scents: Cupquake Berry Smooch Cherry Bomb Praise jebus they are also releasing Victoria’s Secret U R Sweet Body 3-In-1 Wash for Shower, Bubble Bath & Hair in the same scents! I’m pretty happy ’bout this development as they normally skip over the body washes which I happen to adore, so happy days. At least I can get my cherry fix with the body washes and possibly skip those evil double mists. Also available are Victoria’s Secret Kiss & Tell Body Glow Moisture Cream and Kiss & Tell Body Drink Lotion. All the items are available in the same scents as the double mists and are mix and match at the same price of 3 for $25. Whatcha think? I’m leaning towards those bloody double mists and definitely the body washes. I have a gift certificate in my pocket to burn might as well snap them up. Yay? Nay? Share it! You may also enjoy...

"[""Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Crazy for Love Red Berries and Wild Petals Body Mist Review, Photos By Isabella Muse on February 14, 2011 4 Comments in Fragrance , Fragrance Reviews , Spring Collections 2011 , Valentine's Day Collections , Victoria's Secret I really love Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Body Sprays however I do not like the greasy double mist formula. We’ve been through that before eh? But it’s a great introduction to the new Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Crazy for Love Body Mist. Crazy for Love is NOT a Double Mist. In my experience with the Beauty Rush range this has only been done once before with the Pool Party Collection . They REALLY need to do it more in my opinion! Let’s jump ahead for a peek at Crazy for Love. Depending how you look at it Crazy for Love can be a great or disappointing experience. Props for the formula which isn’t the typical greasy double mist but merely a body mist. Formula isn’t too strong or long wearing so layering is key here when possible. The disappointing fact would be it’s kind of a typical Victoria’s Secret scent and doesn’t have anything unique about it. The fragrance contains juicy, succulent, overly sweet red berries as the dominate note. If you like the Beauty Rush Double Mist in Juiced Berry this pretty much smells quite the same which is why the scent could prove disappointing. Lighter notes of soft, un-nameable florals are included in with the berries but honestly for the most part you’re going to get a heavy duty, tooth ache inducing sweet berryiness and perhaps if you’re nose is extra sensitive you’ll be able to pick up the floral ones. I liked the scent since I adore sweet fragrances however I didn’t feel it was unique enough to rave really hard about it. One thing I love is the Body Mist formula, I have wishes, hopes, and dreams that Victoria’s Secret will start introducing more of their Beauty Rush Collection in this formula. Anyone try this? Love? Leave? Do share it! You may also enjoy...

Yes, you read that right, Victoria’s Secret Love Spell Perfume! I can’t believe it. I died a little bit when I saw this sitting on a display at my local store and was just about ready to stock up on ten bottles less it disappear suddenly. Can you believe it? I absolutely adore the Love Spell fragrance. Although it contains notes of cherry blossom and juicy peach one would never know. It’s just one of those fragrances that you can never really pick any one note from it. It’s one of thee ultimate sweet fruity floral blends around and has such a gorgeous little twang to it. They have the fragrance available in a body mist already and of course, an EDT but I can’t say that the EDT has ever had a stronger staying power than the mist itself with my body chemistry. This is one reason I was excited about an EDP because maybe, just maybe it would have longevity. And indeed, it does! This has excellent staying powder and a strong linger! Absolutely love this formulation! If you’re a fan of Love Spell I’d say you NEED it. It feels like I’ve been waiting my entire life for Love Spell to be introduced in a perfume formula.

Lemonita (Sweet, Tart Lemon), Coolada (Tropical Coconut Blend), and Frostea (Cool, Crisp, Fresh Brewed Ice Tea). These were quite the surprise for me as I thought they were the typical Beauty Rush Double Mists but oh no they aren’t! They happen to be regular body sprays! I’m quite excited about this as I do find that the double mists are a tad oily and the scent doesn’t linger as long as I’d like. I’m excited to try these out. I snagged all three of ’em for 3 for $25 USD! Review coming shortly! The scents also come in a Body Chiller Glimmer Cream (shimmering body cream) and Body Drink Lotion. I’m always terribly excited about new makeup collections from Victoria’s Secret so when I seen the brand new bits they released with the Pool Party Collection I got quite hyped! Check it: Victoria’s Secret Limited Edition Pool Party Cheek and Lip Pop (3 for $15 or 6 or $20) available in three shades, Splash, Pop, and Cooler. Also available are Victoria’s Secret Limited Edition Pool Party Lip Butter with SPF 15 (3 for $15 or 6 for $20) available in three flavors to match up with the release of the body mists. And finally for your tips and toes four shades of Victoria’s Secret Limited Edition Pool Party Nail Paint (3 for $15 or 6 for $20) in four shades! All bright neon shades that are sure to please those who like a bit of loud with their Summer nail look. I picked up quite a few of the items above so I’ll be reviewing them all for you shortly.

A new scent for this gingerbread man with notes of jasmine, neroli and rosewood create a sensual fragrance! Lush Cosmetics Magic Mushroom Bubble Bar Magic Mushroom has two distinct scents. In the red cap, there’s the nostalgic fragrance of our Yummy Yummy Yummy shower gel (sniff); and in the white bit, we’ve used our signature creamy vanilla scent. Together, it blends to give you bubbles that smell like a bowl of fresh strawberries covered in cream. There won’t be mushroom for anyone else in your life – or bath – when you’ve got one. Lush Cosmetics It’s Raining Men Shower Gel Get soaking wet and lather up just like the Weather Girls first commanded back in the disco days. Only this time, you’re armed with one f the best shower gels you can buy. It’s Raining Men is made with lotus flowers to soothe your winter-ravaged bodies and moisturizing, cleansing British honey from Wales. Long ago, on a forum far, far away Lush UK offered Honey I Washed the Kids scented Shower Gel. They bring it back for a limited time under the new name of It’s Raining Men! Fans of HIWTK Soap will adore this! Believe me it’s spot on for the soap as I had the shower gel from a forum party. Lush Cosmetics The Frog Prince Bath Bomb Another magical creation by Michelle, The Frog Prince is an extremely handsome and regal frog with a pair of vibrantly red and kissable lips. Give him a quick peck, drop him in the tub and wait for your prince to come. Notes of jasmine, neroli and rosewood! These are all available from www.lush.co.uk but no worries I’m positive Lush US will get them soon too! Loves? Leaves? Do share your great joy of Lush! You may also enjoy...

"[""Lush It’s Raining Men Shower Gel Review By Isabella Muse on January 17, 2011 41 Comments in Lush , Shower & Bath , Shower Gel , Spring Collections 2011 , Valentine's Day Collections Lush Cosmetics will be releasing it’s Valentine’s Day Collection later this week online. Word on the street is some of it is already in stores. UK’ers can take advantage of it both in shops and online. I went ahead and ordered some essentials from the UK and grabbed two bottles of the new Lush It’s Raining Men Shower Gel, couldn’t resist. I have tried it before when it was released as a forum special item and it was called Honey Hugs. Check it! When Honey Hugs was launched it was a translucent shade gold however It’s Raining Men is a milky beige shade. That’s about the only difference between the two gels and of course, the name change. One thing you have to keep in mind about this scent is it kinda smells off in the bottle. At first sniff it smells somewhat sour and overpoweringly jasmine-like. Jasmine comes across as a strong note sniffing from the bottle and can really give one a nauseating feel. However, the real joy is using it on your hair or in your shower as it’s pure honey and jasmine combined that creates that beautiful foody-like scent. I always get some sort of caramel vanilla thing going on with this. If you aren’t in the know the shower gel basically smells spot on like Honey I Washed the Kids, Ma Bar, Honey Bee Bath Bomb, etc….. Like I said a sniffle from the bottle probably won’t win this any attention but bring it home with you, later up your hair and body, and prepare to fall deeply in love. Don’t forget to stock up on plenty of bottles as once it’s gone, it’s gone and we can only hope to see it again next year. This is the first time Lush is releasing this as an off forum purchase so snatch it up as soon as possible. Delicious! Muse Approved for purchase! Have you purchased it yet? Love it? Plotting a haul?

"[""Victoria’s Secret Beauty of Brazil Very Sexy Makeup Collection By Isabella Muse on March 12, 2009 8 Comments in Fragrance , Summer Collections 2009 , Victoria's Secret Spicy hot is the order of business for the new Victoria’s Secret Beauty of Brazil Collection. Rich hues of bronzer, shimmering shades of shadow, and slippery sexy lips should break you from Spring to Summer in a flash! Jump ahead for the full details! I’m always delighted by any and every Victoria’s Secret Very Sexy Makeup Collection that pops up. I’ve always been terribly pleased with all the releases and the quality of the Limited Edition items so but of course the new Victoria’s Secret Beauty of Brazil Collection completely appeals to this Muse. Although I’m not much of a bronze fan I can’t help but feel a sense of excitement upon viewing all these new goodies. The collection is inspired by the rich hues and scents of Brazil, think tropical heat, warm sandy beaches, and plenty of shimmering shades. Releasing with the collection are some beautiful point makeup items such as a bronzer, eye palettes, glosses, and even a fragrance! The Victoria’s Secret Beauty of Brazil Silky Bronzer Powder is available in two shades for Light to Medium skin tones and Medium to Dark. The bronzer is housed in a zebra printed compact with a large brush for buffing color on. The compact is $24 USD which is a reasonable price and quite in keeping with the normal price tag on Victoria’s Secret LE items. Also releasing are two Victoria’s Secret Beauty of Brazil Radiant Shimmer Eye Palettes for $24 USD each. The two shade selections available are entitled Amazon RainForest and Rio De Janerio. I’m partial to the lighter shimmering golds, beiges, and browns in the rain forest palette. The Rio De Janerio palette contains more popping shades of blue, purple, and brown. Each palette has four strips of shimmering eye shadow that can be worn wet or dry for a more dramatic, tropical look! Victoria’s Secret Beauty of Brazil Lip Gloss is available in three shade selections for $15 USD. In an interesting twist this new gloss comes in a squeeze tube where as Victoria’s Secret normally prefers housing it’s LE glosses in a square tube with a brush or sponge applicator so this is an interesting packaging choice for them. The shades all look like semi-sheer shades that range from peach to berry, the formula also has an SPF of 15. And finally to complete your steamy, tropical look you can spray yourself with the new Victoria’s Secret Very Sexy Now Eau de Parfum. This new version of Very Sexy is a colorful blend of exotic fruits like papaya and creamy coconut with a blend or orchid to spice things up! I’m really loving this collection and I’m adding it to my Summer wish list! I’ll be picking it up as soon as I see it in store so I can review for you. At least one of the eye palettes, possibly a bronzer, and all the glosses are getting added on this Muse’s list! How about you? Loving this new collection? Feeling all that heat? Tell the Muse!

"[""Victoria’s Secret Pool Party Nail Paint Swatch and Review By Isabella Muse on May 26, 2009 Leave a Comment in Hand and Nails , Summer Collections 2009 , Victoria's Secret The Muse is boldly going where no Muse has gone before. To the land of nail polish….yes it happens occasionally, the Muse ventures outside her comfort zone and takes on exciting new cosmetics like nail polish. Remember kids, the Muse knows nothing about nail polish, isn’t an expert of any kind, and is only doing this post for a little fun. Click ahead to check out Victoria’s Secret Limited Edition Pool Party Nail Paint. I swear I’m having nightmares someone is going to ask me some techy nail polish question like what finish this is or something equally important and I won’t know how to answer. I’m truly a n00b when it comes to polish (be gentle) so I really can’t review this proper for you however I did want to show you this funky fun shade from the Victoria’s Secret Pool Party Collection I was telling you about last week! There are a total of four shades available and the one I’m sportin’ today is called Clemenshine. The other shades I didn’t haul but this particular color did appeal for whatever reason so I just snagged it with the rest of my treasures as it seemed such a fun, funky shade for Summer. It’s a bright, true orange so indeed it fairly shouts Summer! These are 3 for $15 which you can mix and match with other items in the collection so I guess not too badly priced? I’m not sure how much does polish cost anyway? I don’t normally buy polish aside from a few select Chanel shades and when I have my weekly pedi I get whatever is hanging out on the rack or I steal something from my sis. If you’re looking for bold, neon shades this Summer, I’d check these out as they seem quite fresh and fun for the warmer weather. Hope my first official nail post wasn’t too bad, wink!

"[""Victoria’s Secret Summer Collection 2009: Victoria’s Secret Pool Party Body Chiller Mist Review By Isabella Muse on May 19, 2009 Leave a Comment in Fragrance , Summer Collections 2009 , Victoria's Secret The Muse was babbling to you yesterday about the Victoria’s Secret Pool Party Collection . Quite an exciting little collection of goodies to get hyped over to say the least. Today I’ll be bringing you a review of the brand new Victoria’s Secret Pool Party Body Chiller Mists! Gotta love ’em for a burst of refreshing Summer scent! Check ’em out after the jump! Victoria’s Secret Pool Party Body Chiller Mists are available in three brand new, limited edition scents for $12 USD each or 3 for $25. The scents are Lemonita, Coolada, and Frostea. The bottles are shaped just like the Victoria’s Secret Double Mist Body Sprays which lead me to believe these were double mists but they are actually body mists. As I mentioned in my original post about these I was quite happy to see they were body mists. I find body mists are easier to apply and the scent lingers a tad longer than the double mists. The double mists are quite nice but they apply a tad oily plus the scent just gets sucked into my skin and fails to last all day. I was hopeful these might last a while longer. As predicted they do last a fair bit longer than the double mists formula but within a very few hours time you’ll need a refresher but none the less they do last out considerably well when compared to double mists. Out of the three Lemonita is my favorite. It’s a cool, tart, refreshing lemon scent. It’s rare to come across lemon scents that are true in body and this just hits the right notes. If your a fan of lemons you’re sure to love this. Frostea is a delightfully sweet, fresh brewed ice tea scent and Coolada is a Pina Colada blend that’s heavy on the coconut! All three are unique, fun blends for Summer. Even though they fail to linger long I still love them and think they are worth picking up. The scents have Summer fun written all over them and the burst of scent they do provide really gets me in the mood for warm weather! Likey! Muse Approving these for purchase. I think they are worthy of a pick up! Anyone try yet? Loves it? Leaves it? Tell the Muse! You may also enjoy...

Victoria’s Secret Pink Me Up Collection is a extension of color cosmetics that have been introduced and modeled after the Pink Bath and Body and Fragrance Collection. The Muse questions if this collection will be a yay or nay with the VS makeup lovers out there as it does have a certain girlish almost child-like look about it…but hey who knows right? Jump ahead for the deets! Here’s the deets on what’s being released. Victoria’s Secret Pink Me Up Polish Available in six shades for 3 for $15 ($7 Each) Includes a vibrant shade of polish with sparkling crystals inside the cap for application on nails or toes. Victoria’s Secret Pink Me Up So Soft Lip Pot Available in eight shades for 3 for $15 ($7 Each) A smooth, soft balm flavored like a smoothie with just a hint of color! Victoria’s Secret Pink Me Up Chubby Eye Crayon Available in eight shades for 3 for $15 ($7 Each) Jumbo sized pencils that can be used to line or shade eyes. Victoria’s Secret Pink me Up Glossy Globe Lip Gloss Available in eight shades for 3 for $15 ($7 Each) Twist to reveal two shades of sparkling, shimmering lip gloss. All in all the collection does have a certain juvenile look for me. I’m the queen of kawaii but this could prove a bit too much even for this Muse. Considering the amount of shades released with each product I’m picturing these will be around for the long haul but who knows they could be destined for the clearance bin shortly as well. Sadly, if you’re not up for shelling out $15 bucks which breaks down each product to $5 each than you’ll have to pay full retail of $7 each. Honestly, the better deal with be just to haul three. I do like the looks of the soft lip balm but aside from that everything else is just a tad too cutesy for me. What do you think? Yay or Nay? Share it! You may also enjoy...

Maybe they are just in denial that the season is over and in honor of it still being Summer over at Victoria’s Secret they decided to bring us a tropical coconut collection to make us yearn for those long, humid days. Could be anything but the Muse chooses to believe that someone screwed up and didn’t tell them it’s Fall. It’s ok though, I can still so get excited about coconut. Jump for it! I actually smelled some of this on a recent foray into VS and I have to say I’m a tiny teeny bit disappointed as they all smell like coconut. But Muse, you just said it was the I Love Coconut Collection….yes, yes…I know but they have three new scents mixed with coconut so each in turn should have a strong base of coconut and a follow up note that’s in the blend. Sadly, the notes all just mix together and you get a dominant note of coconut with little twists of something more. Those little twists weren’t unique enough to make me splurge. Unusual for sure since I have a bit of a pokemon collect ’em all disease when it comes to new releases from Victoria’s Secret. The collection consists of three new Beauty Rush categories in two new scents. It’s a release of a Beauty Rush Drink Lotion, Beauty Rush Double Mist Body Spray, and Beauty Rush Glimmer Swirl Lotion. The scents available are Coconutty which is a blend of vanilla and coconut and Cocoberry which is a blend of coconut and berries. I could probably see myself hauling both even thought hey aren’t particularly special scent wise if they had released them in regular body sprays. Sadly, the formula is the Double Mist which I’m not particularly partial to since it feels a tad oily on my skin. All in all if you’re a Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush fan you may want to stop in for a sniff and re-live Summer with a blend of tropical coconut. Anyone smell ’em yet? Hauling? Tell the Muse!

"[""Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Double Balmstick and Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Glossy Shinestick By Isabella Muse on September 16, 2009 4 Comments in Beauty Babblings , Fall Collections 2009 , Victoria's Secret More news on the Victoria’s Secret cosmetic front with the introduction of two new Beauty Rush items.? You know they place those bins of Beauty Rush products at the registers for a reason.? They are meant to tempt and tease you into dropping $10 or $15 more bucks when you weren’t planning on it.?? Two new Victoria’s Secret Beauty items are coming at you in those evil bins and each looks quite interesting to this Muse. The first is the Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Glossy Shinestick priced at 2 for $12 or 5 for $20 (Mix and Match with other Beauty Rush bits).?? This little lip treat is available in six shades and promises a glossy pout with a hint of color.? Count me curious and wanting to haul, let’s just hope it doesn’t turn out to be glorified chapstick. Next up is the new Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Double Balmstick also available in six shades for the same price as the Glossy Shinestick.? This one is a peppermint balm for lips with a soothing aloe center.? This interests me the least as I’d prefer a bit of tint and gloss to my lips and not up for a splurging on a balm. What’s the good word? Think you might haul either? Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Cosmetic have been known to be a yay for me so I’m thinking two of those Glossy Shinesticks might end up in my cart.

"[""Christian Siriano Victoria’s Secret Cosmetic Collection By Isabella Muse on August 10, 2009 Leave a Comment in Fall Collections 2009 , Victoria's Secret Christian Siriano is a busy bee this Fall season. Upcoming is his Payless Shoe Collection , I know right? Christian and Payless? Plus the brand new Christian Siriano Victoria’s Secret Cosmetic Collection is now available online and in store. Busy, busy boy! I headed in store to play around with the collection for myself because the Muse is all nosy and she needed to know how “fierce” this beauty collection was. Click ahead for a peep at my initial thoughts! This isn’t a massive collection but it does have a few pieces that are quite good. I will say it does surprise me that Christian is busy creating makeup collections but hey cool he’s putting himself out there. I’m unsure if this is LE but it does deserve to be mentioned that most special edition cosmetics collections from Victoria’s Secret are always quite good quality and I’m normally one for jumping on board to purchase. This time around I did skip as I wasn’t too particularly wow’ed by the offerings. Here’s a few pics I took with my phone camera: The packaging is quite nice as each item is featured in in a gold compact with the brush, kohl, and gloss having a golden theme as well. It’s all very elegant looking. First off the Christian Siriano Silky Eye Shadow are actually the same texture and formula of the brand new revamped line of Victoria’s Secret Silky Eyeshadow. The shadow colors in Christian’s collection are all brand new shades aside from one which would be Gilded Fierce. This shade is available in both the VS makeup line and his line. So technically you’re paying a little bit more for packaging and new shades that are already pretty much offered from VS. These shadows are $12 where as the general catalog shades are $10. Aside from the shadows the other item that did capture my interest was the Christian Siriano Kajal Eye Liner ($12). This is available in one shade, Eclipse, which is pretty much black. The liner is quite a chunky size and perfect for creating a smudged, smoky effect. Now the items that didn’t really tickle my interest were the Christian Siriano Bronzer/Highlighter Trio and the Christian Siriano All-Over Bronzing Powder Brush. Although both are reasonably priced at $16 and $18 I wasn’t really feeling bronze for Fall in all honesty. Even though I suspect Fall will rush in with a bit of an Indian Summer this year I still fail to feel the love for using bronzer in September through the rest of Fall. And finally the Christian Siriano Lip Gloss ($12) is available in three shades. This too didn’t capture my interest as I wasn’t too into the shades. Shades range from a pale beige, nude pink, and red. Overall, the collection is fairly inexpensive and rather fun if you’re a big fan of Chrisitan Siriano. As for me I wasn’t particularly inclined to pick up anything from the collection for myself and instead ended up with three shadows from the brand new, revamped Victoria’s Secret Makeup Collection. Dare I say the collection is a tiny bit boring perhaps? I’m not sure why I found it so unappealing but I ended up coming away with a sad sigh and a shrug. Sorry Christian, you’re fierce darling but your makeup collection didn’t sit well with this Muse. What do you think? Loves it? Leaves it? Heading out right now to buy it? Tell the Muse! The collection is available now at www.victoriassecret.com and in store. They have some videos of the look and Christian speaking about the collection on VS’s site. You may also enjoy...

"[""Yay or Nay: Victoria’s Secret Cosmetics By Isabella Muse on April 22, 2009 Leave a Comment in Victoria's Secret , Yay or Nay The Muse is for the most part a supporting fan of Victoria’s Secret Cosmetics. She’s wondering what you think of their cosmetic line up? Is Victoria’s Secret a Yay or Nay for you? Find out what I think after the jump! I generally like almost all of the Limited Edition Collections that Victoria’s Secret puts out. Most of the regular catalog items aren’t particularly wonderful but they seem to go the extra mile with LE products. Most LE items are pretty special packaging wise and quality wise. Which is why I always pick up the LE items. So my answer? Yay and Nay for this Muse! Nay on the regular boring line up…not so great packaging wise, not really pigmented enough to oh and ah over, and just nothing special to get hyped about. A bit expensive too for the quality you get. Yay on the LE items! Def special! Color payoff is normally quite good, packaging is unique and pretty, and quality is generally quite good. How about you? Yay or Nay or both? Tell the Muse!

I feel like I’m digging around in gold when I start looking through and I proceed to convince myself that the 5 for $20 price tag is SUCH a STEAL! Ahhh the sad life of a makeup junkie.

Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Sparkle Liner (Six Shades) Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Lipstick (Six Shades) Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Eyeshadow Duo (Six Shades) Prices are marked at the normal 2 for $12 or 5 for $20 (forcing you to go with the five because the two option always sounds so expensive). This is a first lipstick release from the line, I’m looking forward to checking those out. The liners do look like a possible pass as they are probably hard but you never know! Shadows prove uneventful for me however some will be happy of a range without shimmer, glitter, or a metallic-like finish which Beauty Rush have all embraced in past releases. What do you think?

"[""Ding, Dong The Victoria’s Secret Double Mists are Dead Make Room for the New Beauty Rush Fragrance Mists! By Isabella Muse on May 24, 2011 8 Comments in Fragrance , New in Beauty , Summer Collections 2011 , Victoria's Secret Ding, Dong the Double Mists are Dead! w00t! I do believe that Victoria’s Secret has seen the evil error of Double Mists and has discontinued them! Thank you Jebus! I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spritzed myself with a Double Mist and proceeded to do a full split in my washroom because it made the floor so incredibly slippery! Danger, danger, danger! I’ve never been a fan of the Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Double Mist formula since it always came across so incredibly greasy and oily to me and I’ve proceeded to rant about it in most every post I’ve done about them! But…I continue to buy them since the scents are sweet, fruity, and fun! I’m happy to report it looks like Victoria’s Secret finally realized how many of us weren’t happy with the formula because they have launched a brand new selection of Beauty Rush Fragrance Mists sans the “double”. The new formula is a lightweight fragrance mist (best to layer here as the scents don’t linger very long) available in seven fragrances. I hope these new mists will simply overtake the Double Mist formula because as of now VS only has one Double Mist scent listed on their site…. Yay! I picked them up at Victoria’s Secret recently but just a word of warning they do LOOK like Double Mists as the bottles are two toned but the actual formula is that of a regular fragrance mist so don’t mistakenly pass them by thinking they haven’t changed! Just wanted to share the word as I know many of you dislike the Double Mist formula as much as I do. Happy Days! You may also enjoy...

"[""Beauty News: Victoria’s Secret Debuts New Makeup Collection By Isabella Muse on July 27, 2009 Leave a Comment in Beauty News , Victoria's Secret Call me a beauty junkie but I can’t help but be excited about the new line of Victoria’s Secret Makeup coming out in August. Most every Victoria’s Secret you’ve walked into lately probably has the same sign up as seen below. Most of the line was hit with a 50-75% off sale during the semi-annual and in some cases even before that. This big discount was to make room for the new line do out in stores August. Of course, much of it will probably be the regular line up of blushes, shadows, and lip products however the excitement for me would be the reinvention of the packaging. This is the second time that Victoria’s Secret is revamping it’s packaging. I admit that I long since missed the silver and pink standard from yesteryear and was never fully on board with the newer, chic black packaging. Out with the black and in with the new, this Muse hopes it’s a good one. What do you think the new packaging will look like? What do you want it to look like?

"['Yay or Nay: Demeter Fragrance Library By Isabella Muse on February 24, 2009 Leave a Comment in Demeter , Fragrance , Yay or Nay Demeter Fragrance Library is a vast un-ending array of unique fragrances that are sure to please just about everyone but are they a Yay or a Nay? Jump ahead to tell me your version of the story! Tricky, tricky, tricky is the question today! It’s so difficult for the Muse to figure out if she’s on the yay team or the nay team when it comes to Demeter Fragrance Library. One of the perks of Demeter is the ridiculous amount of unique blends available and how much product they put out over the course of the year. Tons and tons of LE blends are added daily some of which are borderline strange, unique, and terribly fun! Think Playdoh, Lobster, and Dirt for example! As fun and fabulous Demeter is one minor problem plagues the brand which would be the linger of each EDT. The scents are all extremely fun but some suffer from a rather short burst of fragrance that lasts an hour if you’re lucky or less if you’re not so lucky. Sadly, it seems the amount of “toilette” that goes into each fragrance versus the amount of perfume oil is a pretty high ratio which means little to no scent time. My skin happens to suck these up at a crazy speed so within 30 minutes at most I’m having to reapply. However, the good news is that some are mighty strong, the Muse just wishes they all were. So the question remains are they a Yay or a Nay? I can’t help but say I’m on the Yay team for these as the variety outweighs the formula in this case and I do so adore quirky perfumes plus they aren’t terribly expensive that spraying yourself every hour on the hour won’t hurt the bank too much. Yup, it’s a firm yay for me! I loves ’em! Can’t help myself! How about you? Demeter Fragrance Library in your Yay book? Or Nay!? Tell the Muse! You may also enjoy...

"[""Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush Colorshine Gloss Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on August 3, 2011 Leave a Comment in Lipgloss , Swatches , Victoria's Secret Sometimes you find a little piece of awesome in the Victoria’s Secret Beauty Rush bins and sometimes a little bit of rubbish. It’s a toss up, kinda like winning the lotto! Victoria’s Secret Colorshine Gloss is a new launch of lipglosses to the Beauty Rush Collection in five shades. Any good? Possibly lotto win? Let’s check ’em out! A new flavored lipgloss from Victoria’s Secret. Props to Victoria’s Secret for remembering how much we love the little things in life such as lipglosses that are available not only in several shades but flavors too! Each shade of their new Colorshine Gloss features a different flavor and shade. Nifty eh? The glosses all have a shimmery finish with a thinner, runny consistency. They don’t have a ton of shine nor are they terribly pigmented but they have a comfortable, lightweight wear. I picked up two shades which were Big Apple (a reddish coral shimmer) and Wonder Melon (a mauve rose shimmer), each tastes like its namesake. Sadly, the gloss formula is really thin and it fails to wear well. You’d be lucky if it lasted for 30 minutes at most. I also find the lack of pigmentation and shiny finish quite disappointing as well! Those who prefer a very minimal gloss look. Those wanting shine and pigment from their glosses. Those wanting a long wearing formula. Overall, I wouldn’t bother picking these up as the formula sadly falls into the miss category (no beauty lotto here kids). I find the formula isn’t anything special to warrant a purchase and the really short wear time makes them even more of a miss. Sadly, Colorshine Gloss falls flat in the Beauty Rush realms, you win some, you lose some…this one I lost. Anyone try? Love? Share it! Available now at Victoria’s Secret. You may also enjoy...

Check below for some of the crazy blends the Muse wonders about (who buys this stuff anyway?). You’d be lying if you said you never ate paste or sniffed glue. I remember in second grade we’d eat the craft paste our art teacher had in big jumbo size tubs. I also recall sniffing glue because it smelled so good, not for the buzz….honest! Re-live your youth with Demeter Glue! I’m not partial to the delightful scent of Play-Doh but Demeter obviously thinks some people are! Turpentine? Holy cow that’s some serious high! I love seafood, who doesn’t? But my love does not extend to smelling like it. Thanks but no thanks. Embalming fluid comes to mind….is that macabre? I believe you’ll need a bit of Dirt with that Funeral Home! What? It’s the next logical step I’m told. I can get on board with the scent of crayons! Who didn’t love the smell of a freshly opened pack of crayolas? That was what loved smelled like when I was five year’s old! I think it’s safe to say they pretty much got it all covered.

K, thanks girl! Yeah well I haven’t a clue WTH is happening in this video. Take a look! I honestly don’t love this video for a few reasons. I always think Taylor’s makeup is all wrong, I am, of course, no expert but her eyes are just overly, overly done and I can’t really wrap my head around Little J all grown up into hardcore, take Blair down, rocker chick extraordinaire….I dunno I’m not feeling it at all!? Honestly? I bet the video would rock me a little harder if someone went in and just gave her a softer eye look. I bet I’d even rave the video if she had better eye makeup! John? Makeup Team? Bueller? Anyone? Can we get softer eye makeup? Consider yourself memo’ed on this! Secondly, it’s a fragrance commercial right? So why does it feel like a whole lot of seventeen year old sexy time? I can definitely get on board with the Beckham’s doing the deed in an elevator but can’t really stomach the flashes of Taylor with her legs rather too widely spread and the lingerie…..she is seventeen but I just feel she looks so much younger.

"['Katy Perry Mad Love Perfume Review By Isabella Muse on July 20, 2016 14 Comments in Celebs , Fall Collections 2016 , Fragrance , Fragrance Reviews , Muse Approved Affiliate Link PR Sample I’m delighted to share with you a review of the new Katy Perry Mad Love Perfume . So, why am I so excited about Mad Love? I shouldn’t be considering I have such a passionate love/hate relationship with celebrity fragrances. Some I love, most I hate. In 2014, Katy added a little fragrance to her growing empire of perfumes called Mad Potion and I have to admit to easily and quickly falling in love with it. The funky bottle, the gorgeous gourmand vanilla fragrance, the ability to layer it with other fragrances, it was just an instant hit for me. I admit I was a little skeptical about the launch of the new Mad Love Fragrance. Hey, I did in fact love the original but I had doubts about a follow up because typically sequels aren’t as good as the original am I right? Also, I find that when brand’s launch a new fragrance under the same namesake it typically means they smell almost identical to the original fragrance with minor note variations. For example, take the Armani Rose Si , it smells pretty much like the original Armani Si in my opinion. I had worries that Mad Love would just be a variation of Mad Potion. Turns out I had very little to worry about. Mad Love is absolutely nothing like the original Mad Potion! But there was still the matter of would it be as good as the original? Yes, yes! It is as good as the original! Not only is Mad Love completely different but also adorably sweet and perfect for layering with the original should you please. Unlike the original fragrance this focuses on sweet, juicy notes. If you like fun, sweet fruity florals you’ll adore this. And if you don’t? Tame it down and add a little Mad Potion to the mix to create a warm envelope of vanilla around the sweet melody of Mad Love! Speaking of complete opposites, even the bottle is incredibly different from the loud, bright purple bottle of the original. Although shaped the same, Mad Love comes in cute, flirty little pale pink bottle that has a white marble ball shaped stopper. It reminds me of Valentine’s Day as the pink combined with the heart accents just give off that vibe. This fragrance starts with a fruity opening of Lady Apple Sorbet followed by juicy, sweet strawberries and a hint of tart pink grapefruit! The initial mist reminds me of fruit cocktail in a heavy syrup. As it settles, soft notes of peony and jasmine come through and finally at the drown down you’ll get a warming skin musk and hints of sandalwood. The fruitiness remains at the dry down but the musk and sandalwood tame the initial sweetness. I couldn’t help but think of canned pears when I wore this. It smells like peeled pears in syrup as it settles down on my skin and there’s a little twangy note in the background. It’s a very cute fragrance but it also has a certain sexiness to it as well. This wears best on clothes versus skin as it does wear away fairly fast with my body chemistry. I like misting it on my clothes to get the best wear since my drier skin sucks it up in a three hour period. Mist it on your clothes and you’ll get lovely little lingering wisps of it throughout the day. Since Mad Potion is such a great layering fragrance I almost instantly got excited about mixing Mad Love with Mad Potion. They work incredibly well together. Mad Love alone is sweet, syrupy joy alone but when you combine it with Mad Potion it becomes a sexy fruity vanilla blend. There has to be some irony here since Mad Potion reminds me of something cooked up in a mad scientist’s lab so, it’s quite fitting you can cocktail and blend the two fragrances to create a new, unique blend. Like Mad Potion, Mad Love isn’t going to be for everyone. I think you have to be young at heart and enjoy a playful sweet fragrance to enjoy it. Many people I recommended Mad Potion to were surprised how much they liked it. I have a feel Mad Love will be the same! Don’t write it off until you tried! Many celebrity fragrances are a rehash of the same exact thing over and over again but I can honestly say if there’s another “Mad” fragrance in the works down the line from Katy, I’ll be first in like to purchase as both Mad Potion and Mad Love have made this perfume lover a very happy girl! Mad Love gets a Muse Approval. I’m looking forwarding to see what Katy has up her sleeve next! Katy Perry Mad Love is available exclusively at Kohl’s and kohls.com. You may also enjoy...

"['Purr by Katy Perry Fragrance By Isabella Muse on October 28, 2010 40 Comments in Celebs , Fragrance Well, I gotta admit, I love Katy Perry. Could be she’s guilty by association to Russell Brand which is why I love her so much but I’m thinking it’s just her overall look. She reminds me so much of a pin up girl and I have a super, soft, mushy spot for pin up girls! Fact of the matter is I am terribly excited about the new Purr by Katy Perry Fragrance. Yes, this is one celeb fragrance that’s topping my wishy list. Jump! The bottle is just all kinds of crazy cute. I’m not a cat person but this is just so chic and funky. Lovin’ the look! Next up the notes of peach nectar, apple, and Bulgarian Rose are calling to me. Purr promises to be playful yet sophisticated. I think I need it. What do you think? You may also enjoy...

"['Giving Katy Perry Mad Potion Perfume A Raving Review By Isabella Muse on August 4, 2015 14 Comments in Celebs , Fall Collections 2015 , Fragrance , Fragrance Reviews , Muse Approved Purchased I thought today I’d give Katy Perry Mad Potion Perfume a raving review today because I love this new Eau de Parfum! Mad Potion is a very different fragrance for Katy Perry and I think it might surprise many users especially if you own some of the star’s past scents as she is know for creating fruity floral creations but Mad Potion takes on vanilla in a very fun, funky way! Take a look! Katy Perry isn’t a newbie to the fragrance world as the star has several fragrances under her belt and the new Mad Love Perfume joins her fragrance empire for the Fall 2015 season. This is toted as a “sexy vanilla” with vanilla orchid, peony, and apple musk with a heart of bourbon vanilla with a mix of soft musk and jasmine petals. According to the description it’s more of an oriental blend with vanilla, musk, and amber. This one comes housed in a round bottle featuring a purple juice with glittery ball topper. The bottle is cute and different from the girlish bottles Katy’s fragrances are known for. Blame it on the purple but it feels a little Halloween-ish to me as I can totally see it in a witch’s kitchen with “eye of newt” stamped on it or something. Personally, it blows everything it says it smells like out of the water in my humblest opinion. It starts out as pure sugary musk, kinda car air refresher on some levels but as it warms up you’ll find the most dominate note is bourbon vanilla and boy is that vanilla creamy, warm, and delicious. There’s some background note that I can’t identify that adds a little tiny bit of fruitiness almost like apricot but vanilla, vanilla, vanilla dominates here so most other notes are pushed way to the back of the fragrance. You know what? I’m fine by that as I like Katy’s twist on vanilla because it smells off and let’s just go there and say it’s kinda mad….! It’s not your typical gourmand but the pure sweetness of the musk and vanilla combination does make it lean in that direction. I don’t think Mad Potion is going to be a hit for everyone but for me…there’s something I really love about this fragrance. It kinda reminds me of a trip to the candy store! I think one of the best things about this fragrance is its ability to layer and play nicely with other fragrances. If you wear it with another fruity fragrance it’ll add creaminess and warmth to that fragrance. It’s just a really great scent to cocktail and funny enough the name is very fitting in that case as you can play a bit of a mad scientist with it by cocktailing and combining it with other fragrances and seeing what ne creation you can create. Although there’s no need because all its own it smells perfect as far as I’m concerned. It reminds me most of Yves Rocher Vanilla Eau de Toilette so if you know what smells like you might get some idea of what Mad Potion smells like. It smells youthful but the warmth of the vanilla also gives it a rather sexy, comforting finish that’s delicious in a “I wanna lick my arm!” kinda way. This wears best on clothes versus skin in my experience. My drier skin sucks it up so I need a touch up within three hours. However, sprayed on both my clothes and my skin I can get a nice seven hour linger with a lovely little throw that will have people asking, “What are you wearing?!” I purchased a 1 oz bottle of it as I wasn’t sure how I’d feel since I was purchasing it blindly online but I’ll be sure to grab the larger bottle as this one I really like! Katy Perry Mad Potion Perfume is available at Kohl’s and I purchased mine at kohls.com. Smelled it? Do share your thoughts! You may also enjoy...

I dunno what it is but I always love minty fresh scents when Christmas comes to town! Maybe it’s the candy canes or the cold winter air that gets me all hyped over mint? Who knows! How about…chocolate and mint? Now that’s a marriage most divine! Since the Muse doesn’t mind in the least smelling edible she finds that Demeter Pick Me Up Spray in Junior Mints does the trick to get her in a festive mood! A bit of creamy mint and a whole lot of chocolaty goodness combined creates a cooling, minty fragrance that’s dominated with deep notes of chocolate….indeed it smells good enough to eat!

"['Beauty Most Unusual: Eau de Bacon Has Finally Arrived! By Isabella Muse on April 12, 2011 10 Comments in Beauty Most Unusual , Fragrance We seem to have a love of bacon around these parts. Bacon lip balm, bacon soap, etc…. What I believe was missing was the perfect Eau de Bacon fragrance. That sexy, sizzling scent of fat! Now you can have it! A company called Fargginay, Inc. lays claim to one of the first bacon fragrances I’ve been privy to. The story goes that John Fargginay, a Parisian butcher (wow, he was French! This is one classy fragrance!) discovered the ability to dramatically elevate his customers’ mood with a secret recipe that blended 11 popular essential oils with the essence of, yes, you guessed it, bacon! Sounds kinda Pavlov’s dog-like! The story goes on to say that film stars & heads of state would frequent his shop to procure the magical elixir. Betcha the likes of Paris Hilton would buy into all that bacon! Now it’s not all bacon………. The brand makes two types of bacon fragrances with are Bacon Classic (a spicy maple scent) and Bacon Gold (a lighter fragrance with lemon, because sizzling fat and lemon go so well together you see?). Essentially the bottom note of the fragrance is bacon so it’s hidden in “just the right place” according to Fargginay, Inc. with other essential oils, flowers and herbs. Actually I could have gotten on board with the bacon but mix in lemon, herbs, and 11 herbs and spices and I start to sweat…..No likey? Would you Eau de Bacon perfume? Heck, your man might love it and devour you whole! Available from www.fargginay.com because yes, this is all true, I can’t make this stuff up and yes, April Fools Day is so overz!

"['Beauty Most Unusual: Edible Perfume Because Smelling Beautiful from the Inside Out is Important! By Isabella Muse on May 16, 2011 12 Comments in Beauty Most Unusual , Fragrance I admit it, I’m addicted to fine fragrances. Scent has the power to awaken the most wonderful feelings and memories. A spritz here and there can evoke feelings of happiness, cheer, and even excitement. But did you ever think that maybe the traditional application methods such as a spritzing or misting would be replaced by consuming your fragrance? Yes, like literally eating it. Beauty Most Unusual? Possibly! At some point in your fragrance life you have probably unintentionally misted perfume into your mouth or too close to your face allowing you to not only smell your scent but taste it too. Not a pleasant experience is it? Dunno ’bout you but it makes me gag when I’ve done this in the past. However, Alpi Deo Perfume Candy claims that their product called Deo Perfume Candy will not only sweeten your mouth but your body too. Therefore allowing you to “eat” your fragrance. The company claims that once you’ve eaten the candy that your skin will emit rose oil components contained within the candy. The ingredient used is called geraniol and has already been distributed in chewing gum products in Japan that the company manufactures which also produce a body fragrancing effect. The company totes this as a great solution for those who are sensitive to fragranced products as you won’t have to actually apply anything on your skin for use therefore avoiding sensitivity issues. The product has launched in Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Hungary but no word when we’ll actually be able to experience Edible Perfume here but hey it’s an tempting idea to head to counter and be asked, “Would you like that scent in an EDP, EDT, or a EDC (Edible Candy)?” What do you think? Willing to eat your fragrance? Beauty Most Unusual? Personally, I’d rather stick to misting it on! source You may also enjoy...

"['Demeter Little Twin Stars Cologne Spray Review, Photos By Isabella Muse on December 6, 2010 15 Comments in Demeter , Fragrance , Fragrance Reviews I dunno about you but I really like tart citrusy scents like lemon, orange, and grapefruit. You know those ones that make you suck your lips in like a goldfish. I do not however associate such scents with Sanrio characters like Little Twin Stars though. As you know Demeter recently introduced scents for a few of our fav Sanrio characters such as Hello Kitty and My Melody. Little Twins Tart scent is a tart grapefruit…. Let’s check her out! Oh this is a terrible fail at least for me eep! I’m happy to have it to be honest to complete the set, yes, I’m a bit diseased like that but in the long run it really isn’t a scent I’d probably reach for daily. I do think Demeter had the potential to really make these special and so far I’m a little meh on what I have experienced. Demeter promises a mix of exotic and unusual citrus fruits. The exotic, unusual citrus fruits just comes across as bitter, bitter grapefruit. Nothing sweet here just hardcore bitter grapefruit, quite tart but not so much so that it sweetens the note. I like grapefruit and I’m not averse to smelling like it however this comes across as a very bitter blend and doesn’t do the characters of Kiki and Lala any justice. If you like grapefruit, you MIGHT like it but personally I thought it was very unflattering. No likey! I look forward to trying out the other fragrance in the range. Have you tried Demeter’s Little Twin Stars? What did you think? Do share! Little Twin Stars and the rest of the Sanrio Fragrances is available from www.demeterfragrance.com You may also enjoy...

"[""Makeup & Beauty To Buy for Yourself This Valentine’s Day By Isabella Muse on February 8, 2016 9 Comments in Clean , Fragrance , Gift Ideas , Lancome , Maison Martin Margiela Replica , Valentine's Day Collections Affiliate Link You can’t always depend on your boy or your girl to pick out the perfect Valentine’s Day gift. If you have wonderful girlfriend chances are she might be a bit more considerate with gifting than those of you with boyfriends, because, you know, sometimes boys are a little clueless when it comes to makeup and beauty (I mean just look at all the “My Boyfriend does my makeup” youTube videos!). Not that all boys are, I’ve known some considerate ones but some are so very clueless about makeup and beauty it’ll make you wince. In that case here a few makeup and beauty gifts to buy for yourself this Valentine’s Day! Fragrance seems one of the more popular Valentine’s Day gift offerings and considering Spring is here soon you’ll find a lot of new scents to choose from. Here are a few that I think would make great gifts to spoil yourself with! Replica By the Fireplace If you’re a fan of Bath & Body Works Marshmallow Fireside you’ll likely love this warm smoky blend. A warm, inviting, rich vanilla accord note combined with pink pepper, clove, chesnust, and balsam to create a rather toasty, smoky blend of toasted marshmallows. This one will remind you of a cold Winter’s night curled up by the fireside with your loved one. An absolute must and keeper for those who like unique fragrances. Urban Outfitters Gourmand Fragrance in Macaron Rose Rose gets a kick of sugary, candied Turkish delight in this sweet, floral gourmand fragrance! Urban Outfitters Adorn Fragrances in Tiger Eye If unique fragrances are your thing you’ll love this warm, comforting blend of sandalwood, moss, and suede. Molinard Eau De Parfum in Vanille Molinard’s blend of vanilla and heliotrope is positively dreamy for those who love rich, snuggle-y vanilla blends! By Rosie Jane Eau De Parfum in Leila Lou A few year’s ago Leila Lou was available in roll on perfume only but it has since been released in a spray mist. This blend is very, very unique and has notes of fresh cut grass with the sweetness of pear. This is truly a gorgeous fruity floral that has excellent wear and sillage. Clean Reserve Six Piece Travel Spray Layering Collection This set sold out when it originally launched but it is now available again! It includes six generously sizes samples of the newest Clean Reserve Fragrances each of which delivers has gorgeous, clean notes. Where them separately or combine two or three to create a unique fragrance all your own! For those into beauty gadgetry, here’s a great gift pick! Sigma Dry’N Shape Tower Eye or Face/Eye I can’t think of a better gift for myself! This tower gives you a space to drip dry your brushes after a cleaning. Just clean your brushes, snap them onto the tower, and let them air dry. I can’t tell you how convenient this is as typically I have to line my entire bathroom floor with towels when I do a big clean of all my brushes and lay the brushes on the towels. And for any makeup lover new lipsticks and mascara should make for a perfect little V-Day giftee! Clinique Pop Glaze Sheer Lip Color & Primer ( Review and Swatches ) is my new go to lip color courtesy the moist, shiny layer of color they provide! Available in purple and gold the new Lancome Hypnôse Chromatics Mascara Top Coat adds a pop of metallic color atop your favorite mascara and makes for great gift for those wanting a little new makeup!

"['$20 and Under Perfume Sampler Sets Worth Hauling! By Isabella Muse on January 16, 2017 6 Comments in Atelier , Clean , Fragrance , Histoires De Parfums Oddly enough there are a good deal of new perfume sampler sets popping up at Sephora.com and all of them are $20 or under. Gotta love that right? I say odd because typically you’ll see these sets start to pop up around Christmas. I think perhaps we’re seeing a flow of them now due to the fact that Valentine’s Day is around the corner. I’ve gotten some really interesting Valentine’s Day gifts in my time but I don’t think I ever had anyone gift me fragrance for the Holiday. But beauty brands tend to push it for the holiday for some reason or another. The good news is you don’t technically have to wait for a boy or a girl to gift you these sets. They are quite inexpensive and well worth picking up and gifting yourself! This is a great way to try some nice fragrances on a budget. Histories de Parfums The Discovery Collection $20 I have last year’s Histories de Parfumes Discovery Set and I thought it was a fantastic purchase. This new set is just as wonderful! At $20 bucks you get 10 x 0.07 oz mist bottles that include some of the brand’s best scents including the newest one, Not a Blue Bottle , which is a delightfully warm amber scent that I adore. Scents include: Not A Blue Bottle 1828 1725 1740 1804 1826 1899 1969 Ambre 114 Nior Patchouli Eight & Bob Discovery Set $18 Eight & Bob recently launched at Sephora.com much to my delight as it means that Sephora is becoming more and more serious about niche house fragrances. If you have the time I highly suggest googling Albert Fouquet and JFK for the delight tale about the name of this brand and how it came to be. It’s a very cute story! This particular set includes four of Albert Fouquet’s private collection. Eight & Bob is essential a men’s fragrance brand but I find their scents are quite unisex and well worth exploring. You get: Andrea Cap d’Antibes Egypt Mémoires De Mustique Atelier Cologne Perfume Palette $18 Bring a touch of the Spring into your gloomy Winter with this Atelier sampler. I always find Atelier fragrances refreshing with a touch of zing! This inexpensive set brings together 8 x 0.07 mists of some of Atelier’s most popular blends like Vanille Insensée! You get: Orange Sanguine Clémentine California Rose Anonyme Vanille Insensée Santal Carmin Oud Saphir Sud Magnolia Cèdre Atlas Tocca The Passport Collection $18 Eight (0.05 oz mists) of Tocca’s beloved floral fragrances comes housed in this gorgeous collection which allows you to become addicted to some of Tocca’s best loved scents! Includes: Florence Simone Cleopatra Colette Stella Emelia Giulietta Juliette Has a Gun Wardrobe Discovery Kit $18 Much to my delight Juliette Has a Gun has updated their sample set to include their newest fragrance, Mmmm , as well as 7 other fragrances from their collection! Includes: Not a Perfume Mmmm Miss Charming Gentlewoman Lady Vengeance Another Oud Anyway Mad Madame Etat Libre d’Orange Eau de Parfum Discovery Set $19 Seven of Etat Libre d’Orange’s fragrance comes housed in this cute little tin including the refreshing, light, and addicting Like This scent, a personal favorite of mine! Includes: Dangerous Complicity Fat Electrician Remarkable People Like This Jasmine et Cigarette Putain des Palaces Clean Reserve Rollerball Layering Collection $18 This selection of Clean Reserve Rollarballs is a perfect way to layer and cocktail different scents to create something entire unique! You get: Sueded Oud Blonde Rose Reserve Blend Warm Cotton Amber Saffron Reserve Blend Rain All of these new fragrance sets are available at sephora.com. What are you currently wearing and loving?

Cat Beauty , Korean Brands , L.A. Girl , Lipstick Queen , Lorac , Maison Martin Margiela Replica , Neutrogena , Palladio I can’t believe March is here with Easter soon on the way. February 2016 wasn’t a huge month for makeup and beauty since January we saw many of the latest and greatest Spring 2016 releases. I suspect so they drugstores will start launching new collections for late Spring and Summer 2016. But for now things are a little slower in the beauty world which makes for a perfect time to go over some February 2016 Makeup and Beauty Hits and Misses! Etude House Berry Delicious Strawberry Eau de Perfume Etude House’s new Berry Delicious Spring 2016 is as adorable and there are some keepers from this collection. But take my advice and avoid this one! It’s too juvenile, too overly sweet, and just not as strawberry-like as I was hoping for! Skip it! Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream Amazing stuff for us drier skin ladies and lads but way over hyped and way over priced. Save your money for something else! Or at least until the brand comes to their senses and lowers the price. L.A. Girl Beauty Brick Eyeshadow Collection A ton of hype surrounds this little palette but mine got tossed into the makeup graveyard ! Flaky, dry, and less than pigment eyeshadows make for an awful Palladio Butter Me Up! Sheer Color Balm Draggy, dense, and actually kinda painful to apply these lip balms are far from buttery! Clinique Pep-Start Eye Cream Creamy, moisturizing, and quite lovely for drier eyes Clinique’s new Pep-Start Eye Cream has the starts of a beautiful formula but everything else it promises like reducing puffiness and brightening my eyes up, well, that so does disappoint. Essence Blush Up! Powder Blush $4 bucks scores you this beautifully pigmented, silky, and long wearing blush! What’s not to love? Lipstick Queen Seven Deadly Sins Lip Gloss Pigmented, creamy, and gorgeous shades makeup this lovely lipgloss hybrid! You need to try out at least one shade but I promise it won’t be your last! Clean Reserve Fragrance Collection Possibly the best $22 I spent last month! This set contains sample sizes of ALL the new Clean Reserve Fragrance Collection and boy are they keepers! Such a great way to try ’em all out! Replica By The Fireplace Yeah, it’s Spring but don’t miss out on Replica’s warm, toasty new fragrance that reminds me of Bath and Body Works Fireside Marshmallow! Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Aging Perfector Sheer, brightening coverage makes Healthy Skin Anti-Aging Perfector an ideal Spring lightweight foundation! Lorac Color Source Buildable Blush Soft, silky, easy to blend, I think I need all the shades of the new Color Source Buildable Blush from Lorac! J Cat Beauty Wonder Lip Paint A mere $5 bucks will score you this super pigmented lip paint that’s pretty much a dupe of OCC Lip Tar! You may also enjoy...

"['10 Fragrance Sets to Buy During the Sephora Sale By Isabella Muse on November 4, 2016 9 Comments in Clean , Fragrance , Gift Ideas , Holiday Collections 2016 , Pinrose , Tocca Affiliate I readily admit I’m quite obsessed with fragrance and there are just simply to many great perfume and fragrance gift sets this Holiday to tempt me. How do you decide on just one? Here are 10 fragrance sets to buy during the sale, seriously, you need these. Turn on your JavaScript to view content One of my favorite sets this season was the Pinrose Rollerball Wardrobe Gift Set which is $60 and includes 10 Pinrose Rollerballs. I’ve played with Pinrose at Nordstrom and I have a few favorites like Glided Fox but many of them seem uneventful to me. But I purchased this set because I wanted to be able to layer the fragrances and see if I end up liking them a little more. Pinrose highly encourages cocktailing, mixing, and matching their scents and this set has plenty of options to do just that. I’m betting they even include a menu card that includes some cocktail options in the box. When mine arrives I’ll let you know! One new option from Juilette Has a Gun arrived today which is a gift set featuring 3.3 oz of the Not a Perfume scent as well as a travel bullet size spray ! I love this set but the better option is to spend $18 on the Juliette Has a Gun Discovery Kit. I love this niche brand but it doesn’t quite work with my body chemistry and the scents don’t last long on me which is why I always direct everyone to their sampler set to see if you have better wear and longevity. I can’t recommend the Aerin Eau de Parfum Fragrance Coffret enough but don’t say I didn’t warn you that these scents are addicting. I got a Aerin Matchbox Gift Set ( Review ) last year and ended up splurging on the larger sizes of Aerin Evening Rose and In Ikat Jasmine because they quickly became favs of mine! Above you’ll find some of the other great holiday fragrance sets I recommend grabbing up. These are great values and may just introduce you to a new, unique, and beautiful scent. Happy Shopping!

"['Clinique Pop Glaze Sheer Lip Colour + Primer Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on January 25, 2016 12 Comments in Clinique , Lipstick , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Spring Collections 2016 , Swatches Clinique Pop Glaze Sheer Lip Colour + Primer ($18) is a new lipstick formula that launched last Spring 2016 in a variety of gorgeous shades. This formula promises weightless bold yet see-through color with a smoothing primer that allows a wear of eight hours. Let’s take a peek! I considering Clinique Pop Glaze Sheer Lip Colour + Prime one of the brand’s more “fun” product releases. If you notice since the introduction of Chubby Balm, Clinique has been kinda sorta releasing more and more cuter makeup products. For example, Clinique Pop Glaze Sheer Lip Colour + Primer is a cutely packaged lipstick that features a playful twist on Clinique’s typical silver lipstick tube. This little lippie comes housed in chubby square tube that has a silver top and a colorful bottom that mimics the shade inside. This formula is supposed to be weightless formula with a bold yet sheer pay off and a smoothing primer that allows the color to apply and look smooth on lips as well as keep it wearing for up to eight hours. These are also promoted as having a modern-velvet finish. I only tried a single shade and I had a fantastic experience with it but it wasn’t quite eight hours of wear but I did get very comfortable, lightly hydrating wear from this little guy! My lips are severely dry at the moment. Like chunky, flaky grossness going on here! But with every single application even on these dry lips I got a really smooth finish that didn’t accentuate drier areas. I had no issues with color falling into my natural lip lines either. It was a smooth, easy glide here all around. The formula has a creamy balminess that hugs lips in a very light layer of moisture with a slight sheen finish. I wouldn’t say this was rich color pay off but it does have a nice almost opaque finish. The formula is very lightweight, thin, and comfortable to wear. As I said it applies without tugging and has a nice smooth finish. I didn’t quite get eight hours out of this shade though it was more like five. During that wear I didn’t have problems with the color fading nor did it migrate or feather plus it remained very lightly moisturizing. For sensitive users, you’ll be happy Although Clinique Pop Glaze Sheer Lip Colour + Primer doesn’t quite live up to all of its claims, it still remains a very nice lipstick formula that apples nicely and wears comfortably! Clinique Pop Lip Colour + Primer are available now on counters or at clinique.com , NeimanMarcus.com , and Macys.com and it should be available shortly at Sephora.com. You may also enjoy...

"[""Stila Make Me Blush By Isabella Muse on January 17, 2011 26 Comments in New in Beauty , Spring Collections 2011 , Stila , Valentine's Day Collections , You Need This Heart’s seem to be trending at the moment as Stila comes up close on the heels of the Physicians Formula Happy Booster Collection with it’s own heart blush. This one, you’re going to NEED! Take a look! As soon as I seen it last week I placed an order. The $14 price tag is very appealing considering that Physicians Formula is the same price and a drugstore brand some of you might wish to indulge in Stila’s version considering it’s higher end at the same price. This is a multi-colored blush inspired by V-Day Conversation Heart candies! The top layer is sprayed with the gold shine for visual and once dusted off with brush you are left with all over glow pressed powder that will add hints of pinks and corals to cheeks. If the promo image is anything to get excited about, I’d say this was a keeper! I ordered it around Tuesday and it will be arriving shortly, review to follow!

"[""Stila Make Me Blush Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on January 27, 2011 49 Comments in Blush , Spring Collections 2011 , Stila , Swatches , Valentine's Day Collections , You Need This As far as I’m concerned Stila Make Me Blush is the hottest and cheapest product of the season! At $14 this sweet little blush has it all. Think cute heart design, think inexpensive price tag, think pigmented formula, think brilliance on a stick. Yup, this blusher has it all! Plus I’m hearing tales of sell outs on both Sephora and Stila’s website eep! Since writing about it a week or so ago it’s since disappeared but no worries, it’s back in stock now! I feel a Muse Approved coming on! Check it! A multi-color blush inspired by Valentine’s Day Conversation Hearts. Stila dubs this a subtle blush that can be built up, I call it crazy pigmented upon contact. Whoa! Missed out on MAC Stereo Rose ? Snag yourself some Stila Make Me Blush and you’ll be a happy girl indeed. Without a doubt you’re looking at some intense color pay off here so have a light hand and if your skin leans towards the realms of olive, tan, or darker, well you too, can glow beautiful with this one! The packaging is darling with cute conversation hearts decorating the powder. The design runs fairly deep and it seems like it’ll last through a few swipes. It comes in a round black plastic package which isn’t particularly glamorous but you’ll be blinded by the powder too much to take notice. It does contain a healthy golden overspray with interlocking hearts that feature gold, bright orange-y coral, and graduating shades of medium and paler peach. First swipe, be aware, the overspray creates an INTENSE metallic finish on cheeks which isn’t necessarily pretty so you may want to dab off the gold prior to using the powder. I mistakenly tapped my brush into the blush and proceeded to pick up way too much gold, swirled it on my cheeks, and noticed that Bozo the Clown was staring back at me when I looked in the mirror. Ha! So be careful during application! Even after the overspray is gone you’ll notice that the powder is heavily pigmented so tap the blush gently and remove excess by tapping against your wrist. Proceed to tap onto your cheeks gently for the best results because it is easy to over do it. (With over spray) (Without over spray) The finish starts off metallic thanks to the gold and goes through a bit of a shimmer phase however after a few uses I imagine you’ll get more of a velvety look sans the shimmer, metallic, and sparkle. The shade quite reminds me of Stereo Rose but with way more pop, way more sizzle, and way more vibrancy. As of now I’m calling it one of the most pigmented blushes in my stash and believe me I have ALOT of blushes around these parts so that’s saying something. I feel like purchasing a back up at this price as it’s a mere $14 and something that will literally last ages thanks to the pigmented formula which you need very little of for a glowing look. It’s really special and really unique in my opinion and just quite stunning overall. The finish comes across a vibrant shade of orange-y coral and just glows on my cheeks. Very fair skin might experience a few issues with application since the color is really bold. I suggest trying a bushier brush for application and tap gently onto your skin for the lightest of finishes! Anyone who loves bold, vibrant shades of blush! Those look look fabulous in warm shades of orange, coral, and peach! Those with olive or darker skin tones (this will pop on darker skin). Those who adore cute packaging! Those who aren’t keen on terribly bold blusher! Those with fairer skin (be aware as this is VERY pigmented and can easily be over done). Anyone with a heavy hand (gently does the trick so if you have a heavy hand be careful during application). This is turning into one of my favorite purchases of the Spring season. It was quite a surprise and too gorgeous not to indulge in. The shade is very me as I love coral shades of blush. If you’re wanting you can easily multitask the blush as an eyeshadow as well! The shade has a wicked bold finish that’s sure to please those who like to make a statement with their makeup! For me it’s a no brainer must have. Absolutely lovely and very Muse Approved for purchase! YOU need this! Now! Get it at www.Sephora.com and www.stilacosmetics.com Tried it? Your thoughts? Share ’em! You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Stereo Rose Review and Swatches: Do You Need Stereo Rose? By Isabella Muse on July 8, 2010 97 Comments in Highlighter , MAC , Swatches , You Need This MAC Stereo Rose. An urban legend, a myth, whispered about but never actually seen in person or for a retail price….sold for $100’s of dollars on E-bay (and will continue to be sold for that price…) this is one MAC Mineralize Skinfinish you NEED, if you can find it! Jump! Call me an idiot but I didn’t think that Stereo Rose would be nearly as crazy as finding MAC Marine Life . I was positive there would be 100’s of 1000’s of Stereo Rose just sitting happily at my MAC counter waiting for me to pick it up. Ummm no. This morning on it’s release I realized quickly that Stereo Rose waits for no one. I failed to order online and it SOLD out within a flash everywhere including Nordies which has a backorder of 7/30…yeah dream on, prob never see it. I called my regular MAC Store and was told it was GONE, fine, outta here, hasta la vista sucka. I proceeded to call MAC Pro and other counters and bribed them to hold one for me but most said nope, sorry, come in and get it. MAC Pro in particularly wasn’t so helpful when I called, gee thanks guys. But after numerous failed attempts the kind folk over at Macy’s (Thanks Mo, Mo, love you) saved me one and my sister went to pick it up this morning. Twitter was a whirl with Stereo Rose postings today and I got all paranoid that maybe I needed another one so I called Macy’s again and asked in a timid whisper, “Mo, anymore?” to which I got a reply, “Yup, two!” so off I went to Macy’s and picked one back up for myself and one for Enkore . SCORE! Three in a day? What are the odds? What are the chances? The makeup gods love me. Did you get yours? I sure hope so because it was worth the wait and the hype in my opinion. I love Petticoat as you know but Stereo Rose can easily become a favorite. It’s quite pigmented, very smooth in finish sans chunky glitter and shimmery, and impacts a gorgeous warm, coral peach glow on cheeks. In some cases the shade almost looks orange-y peach. It can easily be used as a blush, highlighter, or hell go wild, use it as a shadow. I really like it and think it lives up to its crazy hype. I’m quite happy I got the chance to grab it. Did you haul it? If not, I highly suggest calling around, don’t wait for tomorrow, do it now, as it’s soon to become an urban legend once again. Discuss? I hope all of you on the hunt today located it and are enjoying it now! You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Me Over! Lipstick & Lipglass Review, Swatches, Photos By Isabella Muse on August 8, 2011 20 Comments in Fall Collections 2011 , Lipgloss , Lipstick , MAC , Swatches , You Need This I rarely consider backing up shades since my stash is large and it’s absurd to buy duplicate products but two shades from the upcoming MAC Me Over! Collection has me rethinking the cardinal rule of never buying the same color twice. Jump! Color me surprised that I absolutely adore MAC Lipglass in Curvaceous which is a light grey pink. This is a milky gloss which I normally dislike in a major way but the color turns the perfect shade of nude pink on my lips giving me the MLBB (my lips but better) experience. The shade reminds me in some ways like Urban Decay Naked but it has more grey to it. It’s really quite gorgeous. Another color I am absolutely obsessed with it is Oh, Oh, Oh Lipstick. This is another sneaky little color that looks oddly coppery in the tube but applies with a natural pop of fabulous crushed berry with hints of bronze. The color is very unique and different on my lips. I think I need back ups of both. Be sure to check out both when MAC Me Over! released on August 25th, 2011. I’m dubbing them as you NEED these shades. Great job here MAC! You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Tropical Taboo Mineralize Skinfinish Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 27, 2013 6 Comments in Highlighter , MAC , Makeup Reviews , Summer Collections 2013 , Swatches PR Sample Adored and Lust are two of five MAC Mineralize Skinfinish that launched with the MAC Tropical Taboo Collection today! You already know I’m quite obsessed with MAC MSF even though they are sometimes a pain to work with. They just produce that perfect glow and sometimes are pigmented enough to work as a blush (those are the shades I REALLY adore, Stereo Rose I’m talking to YOU!). Are you a fond Mineralize Skinfinish fan? If so I’m sure you’re excited about this release! MAC Tropical Taboo Mineralize Skinfinish ($30) in Adored and Lust are two shades I recently got my hands on. Out of the two shades Lust is the deeper but it still worked as a highlighter more than a blush unfortunately but still it has a gorgeous glow that will make you soon forget about using it as a blush! Adored and Lust MAC dubs Adored a coral with light beige pearl and that’s about right. I wish it had more of the pretty coral versus the beige but the beige does dominate. Although it will vary from Skinfinish to Skinfinish as the veining on each is sometimes quite unique so you might just find one with a little more coral. MAC should consider this fresher, lighter coral as a blush shade as it is truly stunning. The beige prevents the coral from really becoming the star here unfortunately so you get more of a softer light glow on cheeks. It isn’t terribly shimmery and doesn’t contain huge chunks of glitter. The finish has a more refined sheen on my cheeks and relies more on the play of light off my face than any real hardcore shimmer found in the powder itself. Speaking of powder the texture does run a bit powdery but still blends easily onto cheeks and isn’t dry or chalky. Lust is paler pink with hints of cranberry. It’s slightly frosty but has a metallic finish on my face that has a pretty glint in the sun. This shade looks deep enough to be worn as a blush but unfortunately applies more subtly than it looks. It doesn’t contain hardcore glitter or sparkle either as sometimes MSF are terribly guilty of having chunky glittery pieces in them. The formula is also a tad powdery but not dry or chalky in the least. It has a very silky, smooth feel and applies fairly easily on cheek bones. I really like this shade paired up with one of the pink shades of the Josie Argan Blush I recently reviewed for you. A little of Josie’s blush and a little Lust on top gives my cheeks a pretty pink glow! I think MAC Mineralize Skinfinish are an intimidating product for some. I know I’m not a master at highlighting my face well. Too much and you’ll look a little too glow-y and potentially shimmery. Too little and you won’t feel like you can see the product on your skin. I find using some sort of fibre or fan brush aids well in application and you won’t over due things either as the bristles are light and floppy and won’t pick up as much product as a normal blush brush or bushier brush would. I am slightly disappointed that this newest round of MSF don’t really work for me as a blush. I have to admit I love when the shades work as a blush but that’s ok they still produce a fine glow on my skin! Although not a huge highlighter fan I must admit to having a deep love affair with MAC Mineral Skinfinishes so I do suggest stopping on counter to view these!

What’d you haul? Share it. Curious minds! And most important of all who got their hands on MAC Marine Life , hello how hard it is to find thee?! My MAC said they only got 15 pieces in, WTH? Dude! I’m foreseeing $200 Evil-bay purchases in all our futures. As for me I’ve been MAC To The Beach again recently and hauled a few items I missed out on during my initial test time! Jump for it! Gosh I thought I was going to set myself up for bankruptcy but it looks like my first round up of MAC To the Beach had all the goodies I could possibly want! This time around I only hauled two shades, a lipglass, and an extra MAC 131 ( Already have one and you should too ! Bestest brush evers!). I ended up hauling Sand & Sun Eyeshadow because I thought it would look rather smart with MAC Firecracker. This is a sheer matte beige peach. Honestly, nothing you need to tell your friends about but something you might consider picking up to pair up with crazier shades like Firecracker. I also got MAC Humid Eyeshadow which I didn’t need but I’m compulsive and wanted the cute packaging. This is a hunter, forest-y green which should be taken into consideration if you don’t already own it as you can create a smoking look on brown eyes using it. And finally I got MAC Lipglass Flurry of Fun which is a subtle orange with plenty of iridescent shimmer. This looks smashing with a little peach stain under it. Needless to say I did haul an extra MAC 131 as I simply adore this brush (link with babblings is enclosed in this post, read all about my lust for MAC 131!). It’s a rather fab little brush worthy of a haul imho! And that’s it…. I guess my main test out of MAC To The Beach contained all the essentials I needed. I did want the beach bag badly but I refrained because it was simply too big and I don’t do beaches, I’m a pool girl. Something about seaweed, sand, like ew…. How about you? What did you get? What did you skip? Or maybe you ignored MAC To the Beach altogether? GASP! Share! You may also enjoy...

In some ways it lasted for ages and in others it feels like it flew by. Did you enjoy your Summer so far? Do anything special? As Summer draws to a close, I’ll be reviewing the last of the Summer items I have stashed away and start to concentrate more on Fall and Holiday 2010. It’s quite an exciting time as I simply adore Holiday Collections! Until we get deeper into Fall and Holiday we might as well enjoy the last days of Summer the best we can right? Here are some great posts from Summer 2010 that you may have missed! NARS Skin Smoothing Face Prep released this Summer and it wasn’t exactly what I had hoped it would be. Some people loved it, alot of people hated it, and I gotta admit mine fell deep into the Makeup Graveyard ! MAC’s Marine Life Powder is still sitting untouched in my beauty vault, right next to Stereo Rose. It was Summer’s must have item and a hot commodity at MAC counters who got as little as five compacts in stock! Beauty junkies who scored it, struck gold, literally! I had my Summer crush on the new Stila Raspberry Lip and Cheek Lip Stain ! Hard Candy had a really late Spring release, that turned more into a Summer one for me and one thing that happened to be a must have item was the new Hard Candy Moon Glow , loved it! Too Faced Lip Insurance Lip Primer turned into a solid gold beauty product as it held my gloss on tight all day long! The Bath and Body Works Summer Vanillas are still haunting stores after an early Summer release and all these months later! Lancome took me right to the Riviera with their Summer 2010 Collection! I was almost a cave dweller with Gloss Fluo De Chanel Brilliant Lip Shine as my guiding light! The Target Look Book for Spring and Summer 2010 enthralled many of us! Make Up For Ever Aqua Creams made a major splash with many of us! I’m still not sure which I loved more this Summer, Lorac’s Hollywood Hot List ….. Or Lorac’s Little Black Palette ….! Wet n Wild ColorIcon Collection was the bestest beauty budget purchase evers! I loved it so much I decided to convince everyone they NEEDED the DuWop Flight Stick ! Avon’s Sunset Glow Bronzer wasn’t only beautiful, it was an affordable Summer makeup find as well! Essence Surfer Babe Collection hit Ulta as the first limited edition collection from the brand within the US and boy are we so hopeful it won’t be the last! Urban Decay Urban Defense defended my Summer skin against the sun and made it look super flawless! Too bad Stila’s Pro Artist Palette was such a snore! I hit the Beach Club with Bobbi Brown! Maybelline created some sizzling Salsa Sun Lipsticks ! These are just some of the happenings on Musings this Summer. Check the archives for more! Happy readin’!

This liquid touch of sun is a liquid shimmering, luminous highlighter. It comes in a tiny puffy paint-like bottle with a needle nose dropper. Holler if you remember puffy paint! You can use Lustre Drops in any number of ways including directly from the bottle tapped gently on skin to highlight your cheek bones, bridge of your nose, or highbrow area. Or mix them with your foundation to create a luminous finish! Or you can give use them as a base for powder eyeshadow or as a glossy color wash on eyes. Don’t limit yourself, multitask this shiz to death I says.

"['MAC Tropical Taboo Mineralize Blush Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 27, 2013 6 Comments in Blush , MAC , Makeup Reviews , Summer Collections 2013 , Swatches PR Sample Simmer is one of three new blushes that launched today with the MAC Tropical Taboo Collection. This a rather stunning little combination of golden peach and red that earns its name from its rather pigmented, sizzling pop of color it adds to my cheeks. Take a look! MAC Tropical Taboo Mineralize Blush in Simmer is intense so have your delicate, light hand at the ready for application. I find it gives me ruddy cheeks if I apply too much so I’d avoid the shade if you have natural redness in your cheeks. It’s a bit dense but still very silky and doesn’t contain a heaping amount of chunky glitter or shimmer. It has a more refined shimmer that produces a rather pretty glow on cheeks. I think the nice part about the peach is it lightens and sheers out the red shade and makes it more wearable. The effect is a pretty coral flush on cheeks. It should work fabulously well on tanned or darker skin types however, if you’re paler you might wish to avoid as the color is quite pigmented and bright. I typically like shades like this but Simmer didn’t really impress me all that much. On the upside the formula is excellent with great pigment and a long wear of over six hours. I would recommend as a possible pick up for darker skin tones but not necessarily a must have for fairer skin. Is it on your Tropical Taboo wish list? Do share! You may also enjoy...

"['Josie Maran Coconut Watercolor Cheek Gelee Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 18, 2013 38 Comments in Blush , Josie Maran , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Summer Collections 2013 , Swatches I wasn’t completely sold on Josie Maran Coconut Watercolor Cheek Gelee Blush when I was testing it. But the more I tested this little gel blush the more I started to love it. These are an interesting formula that’s one part gel, one part stain, and all glowing color. I thought they might be a product similar to Korres Cheek Butter which I disliked due to the dewy finish but actually they turned into something FAR, far bettter. Take a peek! Coral Oasis, Poppy Paradise, Pink Escape Josie Maran Coconut Watercolor Cheek Gelee ($22) are available in six shade selections and possibly one of the best Summer blush purchases I’ve made lately. Each blush comes in a tiny 0.18 oz pot and really they do indeed look like jelly! Don’t let the appearance deceive you as they do not have a jelly texture and they are quite firm to the touch. In my photos below they did bleed a little as they were delivered on a rather hot day but no worries they didn’t melt or go soft. They market these as fourteen hours of color and hydration as the blush is made up of 50% coconut water and Vitamin E rich argan oil. I gotta say for something that contains so much moisture I didn’t feel like they were dewy or watery or really hydrating at all. This doesn’t mean they didn’t apply and blend easily but the entire “moisture packed” formula just wasn’t exactly doing it for me. They do not smell like coconut if you were wondering. They are actually fragrance-free and do not have any flavor as I did indeed try them on lips as well but I dislike them on lips so stick to cheek application imho! Outside of that the product is simply amazing. They apply very easily by merely dipping a finger in and blending out on cheeks. Color is so natural you’d swear you were blushing or that this was your natural glow. They look more like a stain once you apply and the finish is smooth and perfect. The color doesn’t adhere to drier areas or accentuate pores. It feels like I’m applying cheek stain really. You can’t over do these in the least as the color is natural no matter how much you apply. They feel very refreshing and cool as well. Coral Oasis Pink Escape Poppy Paradise Now the color is incredible as it lasts as long as a stain would. You can get a solid twelve hours wear from these in cooler or warmer more humid weather. I even took a swim and the color remained completely strong without fading or wearing away. Needless to say these get a big Muse Approval from me. Natural color with a solid, firm gel texture which applies and wears like a cheek stain is a plus for me! I will say I disliked that they stained my fingers during application but aside from that it’s all goodness! Love these. They are available now at Sephora and Sephora.com Try one, try them all, I know you’re going to love ’em! You may also enjoy...

"['Josie Maran Argan Infinity Lip And Cheek Creamy Oil Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on April 22, 2014 30 Comments in Blush , Josie Maran , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Summer Collections 2014 , Swatches Purchased Affilate Link If you only have money to buy one single makeup item this Summer please make it be the Josie Maran Argan Infinity Lip And Cheek Creamy Oil because truly this is a must have Summer blush. You NEED it! Last year, Josie introduced her Josie Maran Coconut Watercolor Cheek Gelee so I didn’t expect a new blush product this year in all honesty. Josie Maran Argan Infinity Lip And Cheek Creamy Oil is my opinion is way better than the Coconut Watercolor Cheek Gelees! I’m unsure if oily skin users will love these or those who dislike dewy blushes in general as they are a creamy oil product much like the Josie Maran Argan Infinity Cream Intensive Creamy Oil I recently reviewed. They simply took that formula and they tinted it so if you disliked that formula you might not love these blushes. Typically I dislike dewy blushes myself but these have such a radiant, healthy look on my cheeks I can’t deny that I fell hard for them! These are available in six shades and I absolutely need ALL the colors. You can multitask with these so they can be used on lips and cheeks. Plus the fact they come in a squeeze tube so you aren’t grossed out to use them on both your cheeks and your lips. I’m kinda grossed out by stick blushes with a multitasking formula as I dislike using them on my lips and proceeding to use them on my face. I do not however, mind a cool squeeze tube! They have a sweet orange taste and fragrance that’s very pleasant as well. Josie Maran Argan Infinity Lip And Cheek Creamy Oil Swatches (Endless Guava) Josie Maran Argan Infinity Lip And Cheek Creamy Oil Swatches (Timeless Coral) If you have drier, flakier skin you’ll love how moisturizing these! They don’t feel greasy to me and leave behind a touch of a dewy glow on cheeks with healthy, very, very natural color. The formula is a creamy gel consistency much like a vaseline product however, they are petroleum-free! They absorb easily into my skin and blend out super simply. They do have a slightly gritty feel when I use them on my lips…it feels like I’m applying a sugar scrub! But they do have a smooth, even finish on lips with a nice shine. I find they wear a solid eight hours on my drier skin without fading. They build easily as well for more pop but I do like the initial sheerness of the product which gives them a very natural look. I find they wear away faster on my lips and I can only get about an hour in before the initial glossiness fades and a brief stain is left behind for another hour after. Well, I can’t rave Josie Maran Argan Infinity Lip And Cheek Creamy Oil! I’ve tried a ton of blushes this Spring but I must admit these are my favorite of all of them. Josie Maran Endless Guava Argan Infinity Lip And Cheek Creamy Oil on Cheeks and Lips Josie Maran Timeless Coral Argan Infinity Lip And Cheek Creamy Oil on Lips Josie Maran Timeless Coral Argan Infinity Lip And Cheek Creamy Oil on Cheeks YOU must try them!

"['Korres Cheek Butter Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on April 17, 2012 18 Comments in Blush , Korres Natural Products , Summer Collections 2012 , Swatches Korres is releasing three shades of Cheek Butter shortly. Although I’ve never thought about it, I think somewhere in my subconscious I’ve always wished for some sort of cream blush from Korres. Wish no further, granted! These are incredibly cute. I got my hands on one recently and just got all girlishly excited about the cute little pot. Although flatter and more compact in style the pot reminds of the Korres Lip Butters. So cute, so portable, and a whooping 0.21 oz in size. Sadly, the pot does say they are good for six months. I’m a little skeptical if anyone can make a dent in this much blush in as little as six months. Not sure if the formula will become unstable or dry after that period as I’ve only had the pot a few days but just thought I’d mention it anyway. I think this is particular cause for alarm if you’re a typical beauty junkie that has hundreds of blushes to get through. The formula, although I imagine some of you are kinda wishing it was, isn’t like a Korres Lip Butter. It balm-y in nature, dense to the touch, and has an emollient, hydrating texture. Dry skin will soak it up as the formula glides on very nicely but the dense nature of the balm does make it a little difficult to build up and a little tugging is involved to get it situated on your skin. I find it applies sheer at a swipe or two and will get more intense around the fifth or so layer. The good news is no matter how many layers you apply it does remain fairly lightweight and never looks overly done. It gives cheeks and face a glow and a very natural flush of color. The shade I tried was Philia Rose which is a beige, dusky rose. It should suit most skin tones but might prove a little too sheer for super dark complexions. I didn’t love that it gave my cheeks a bouncy, dewy finish. It kinda looks like like I’m sweating or having an oily moment. I’m not sure how the finish will work for oily skin but perhaps with better blending it might prove more natural but I will say I blended the hay out of it and it still had a fairly dewy, tacky finish. This wasn’t necessarily unpleasant just not the finish I was after. Overall, Korres Cheek Butters are quite darling. At this point I’m not really sure if I love them or not. I’m a little on the fence about the finish but I can’t deny they are a cute little creamy balm type blush that gives cheeks a very natural flush of color. They could prove an ideal pick to add to your Summer wardrobe. This one I can’t recommend as I feel like they are something you have to try yourself and decide if they are a love or not. (That’s five layers of blush on my cheeks) They’ll be available for $25 each shortly at Sephora, Sephora.com, and www.korresusa.com You may also enjoy...

"['MAC Hibiscus Kiss Powder Blush Duo Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 20, 2013 2 Comments in Blush , Bronzer , MAC , Makeup Reviews , Summer Collections 2013 , Swatches PR Sample MAC Hibiscus Kiss Powder Blush Duo ($26) MAC Hibiscus Kiss Powder Blush Duo is a new split design bronzer and blush introduced with the Riri Hearts MAC Summer Collection . Bronzer is always a challenge for me so I love the idea of a split design that also happens to contain blush! It just makes the bronzer portion all the easier to wear. I do think MAC made a slight error with this design though…! This includes a rather stunning coral blush but unfortunately it makes up a tiny silver of the compact. An even amount of blush versus bronzer would have made for a very happy girl here MAC. On that note, if they should ever introduce this coral in merely a blush I would indeed, also, be very happy. Hibiscus Kiss Bronzer is a rather lighter tan neutral matte bronzer with a smaller silver of a cooler coral blush as MAC deems it. I do think the blush portion is what makes this a unique duo as that shade is truly stunning. I felt like the powders had a very dense almost dry texture but you actually have swipe across the powder a few times just to work it up and that will reveal a more silkier powder under that stiffer layer. It blends a little patchy…I swirled a brush in both shades and dabbed gently on cheek bones I def had a little clown cheek drama going on even with a delicate touch. So you have to get just the right brush here to blend out to a flawless finish! I’d suggest a bushier blush brush. It produces a healthy glow on my cheeks but I can’t say that the gorgeous coral adds anything to the end look! I wanted to apply the bronzer first and dab the blush on top but that was challenging to do because the blush is such a small portion. I think they really ruined the product by not making it equally halved. It is printed with Riri’s signature and a tiny scribble-y heart which doesn’t wear away quickly with use. I’d like to recommend purchasing it but unless you’re a huge Rhianna fan I’m unsure if you actually need it. The coral is a unique shade but the bronzer portion is a tad too lighter tan for my skin tone. And as I expressed above I dislike the duo wasn’t equally halved. Sigh.

"['MAC Ripe for Love Blush Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on May 1, 2013 10 Comments in Blush , MAC , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Summer Collections 2013 , Swatches PR Sample MAC Ripe for Love Blush is one of two new blushes that launched with the MAC Temperature Rising Summer 2013 Collection . If nothing at all the blushes in this collection are stunning and well worth picking up. I haven’t personally tried the other shade release (a sizzling berry shade) but I surely will be purchasing it as soon as it launches. Let’s take a peek at Ripe for Love. MAC calls it a mid-tone peach…god that’s awfully understated. This is more of a vibrant coral with plenty of orange and a satin finish. The shade should be most suitable for those with warmer undertones due to the boldness of the color but a sheer wash on fairer skin creates a beautiful peach glow. It’s a drier texture but blends and applies perfectly on my skin. I was a little scared it would go patchy but the texture is perfection can be worn sheered out (as pictured on my cheeks below, my photo DOES not do the shade justice) or built up very easily for a more vibrant finish. I love that the color is so true to pan. What you see is what you get on cheeks here. It should be an excellent color that will work for darker skin as well since it is quite pigmented and a heavy handed will be a beautiful pop of color on cheeks. The color wore on me all day as well so it has a great long wear. I’d HIGHLY recommend grabbing it. I have a funny feeling it’ll sell out fast as the color is stunning. It’ll be available May 23rd, 2013 at your fav MAC Counters and I imagine it’ll get an earlier release online at maccosmetics.com so check the week before the launch. You may also enjoy...

"['MAC All About Orange Blush Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on May 31, 2013 25 Comments in Blush , MAC , Makeup Reviews , Summer Collections 2013 , Swatches PR Sample MAC All About Orange is an upcoming Summer Collection featuring three shades of orange blush and a range of lipsticks, nail polishes, glosses, and more celebrating, you guessed it, ORANGE! I got one of the blush shades, Royal Sunset , in my possession at the moment and hope to grab up the other shades shortly. Let’s have a look! MAC Royal Sunset Blush ($21) is a sleeper. You’ll likely go to your MAC counter, swatch it, and possibly write it off as chalky or perhaps too pastel or maybe not dark enough…! Stop. Royal Sunset had excellent color payoff that builds and layers beautifully. It’s a shade you can’t ever go wrong with! It’s a satin finish that blends easily onto my cheeks leaving behind a softer, cooler peach. It actually should work well for a range of skin tones even those in the darker medium range as it is so incredibly easy to build up! I think the texture runs a little chalky at first but once a brush is swatched into the pot you’ll find it has a smoother, silkier feel. It looks a bit on the matte side to me as it contains absolutely no shimmer or sparkle and the satin finish doesn’t produce that typical glow I get. However, it doesn’t cling to drier areas on my face and looks very natural on my cheeks! It might appear a snore to some but MAC Royal Sunset Blush shouldn’t be missed. It’s quite a nice shade. And hey, if you love peaches it will be a no brainer to pick up! It’ll be available June 6th on counters and online at maccosmetics.com You may also enjoy...

"['Avon Fiji Paradise All Over Face Powder Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on June 19, 2013 9 Comments in Avon , Blush , Bronzer , Makeup Reviews , Muse Approved , Summer Collections 2013 , Swatches Purchased The new Avon Fiji Paradise All Over Face Powder makes applying your blush and bronzer a snap. This ombre shaded blush adds a touch of a sunny glow to cheeks and face with a fine shimmery finish that’s quite lovely. I remember when Avon introduced a series of graduating ombre blushes from Jill Dempsey many moons ago. I loved those blushes so when I recently noticed the Avon Fiji Paradise All Over Face Powder launched I instantly wanted to check it out. Take a look! Avon Fiji Paradise All Over Face Powder ($7.99) is a soft sunset face powder slash blush slash bronzer. The powder is a soft delicate sunset peach that graduates into a softer shimmering tan bronzer. It’s kinda like having the benefit of your blush and bronzer in a single powder. Don’t let the bronzer part worry you especially if you’re like me and not a huge fan of them as it applies as a softer glowing peach. This has a subtle shimmer that gives cheeks a touch of sheen but not a full on sparkle mess so no worries. The texture is soft, silky, and very easy to blend. Wear time varies but it seems to fade at around hour four for me in warmer or cooler weather. In comes in a clear black compact that features a hibiscus print on the front just like the eyeshadow palette I reviewed from the same collection earlier this morning! If you’re looking for a pretty sunlit island glow the Avon Fiji Paradise All Over Face Powder is worth a pick up! It’s available online at Avon’s website. Muse Approved. You may also enjoy...

"['MAC RiRi Woo Lipstick Launching in May By Isabella Muse on April 30, 2013 12 Comments in MAC , Summer Collections 2013 RiRi Hearts ? MAC Lipstick so get ready for MAC RiRi Woo Lipstick launching this May! Rihanna herself took MAC’s cult classic Ruby Wood Lipstick and remixed it to create the new RiRi Woo Lipstick, a cool matte shade of red! Take a look! Available exclusively online Riri Woo Lipstick ($15) is a retake on MAC’s popular cult classic red lipstick in Ruby Woo. This new matte cool shade of red will be available as of May 2nd, 2013 online at www.maccosmetics.com. The shade will also be available at the Barclays Center MAC Pop-Up Store for concert ticket holders. I personally can’t wear the original shade of Ruby Woo so I’m curious if RiRi Woo adds a little more warmth to the red therefore making it more wearable for yours truly. I look forward to trying this! What do you think? You may also enjoy...

"['MAC RiRi Woo Lipstick Review & Swatches By Isabella Muse on May 8, 2013 30 Comments in Lipstick , MAC , Makeup Reviews , Swatches PR Sample I know MAC RiRi Woo Lipstick is sold out online but don’t panic it’ll be back in June which is why I decided review and swatch it. I promise I’m not teasing you with this review! MAC RiRi Woo Lipstick is a remix of MAC’s classic, cult favorite shade Ruby Woo by Rihanna herself. Take a peek! MAC RiRi Woo Lipstick ($15) is a matte cool red. I was actually hoping that RiRi Woo would be less cooler than Ruby Woo as I can wear warmer reds easily but not so much cooler ones. Unfortunately, from my experience it appears RiRi Woo is basically identical to Ruby Woo just what a slightly different finish. I think it’s more of a fan thing than an actual beauty junkie thing. Another words if you love Rihanna it’s probably something you’ll want to own. But if you’re a more logical beauty junkie that wanted a unique shade of red, well, you won’t need it because if you already own Ruby Woo it seems senseless to bother unless you really want the matte finish of RiRi Woo. I personally don’t like matte finishes and this feels particularly dry to me. It migrates all over the damn place and tugs during application and looks uneven on my lips due to this. I feel like Ronald Mcdonald with it on to be honest…I just don’t do shades of red like this very well. The only special thing about it is Rihanna’s signature is wrapped around the lipstick itself but MAC’s standard black packaging stays the same here. It’s $15 and will relaunch again shortly if you are lemming. Is it on your list? You may also enjoy...
