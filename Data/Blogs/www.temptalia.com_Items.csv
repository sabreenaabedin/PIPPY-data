"['Pure Oxygen Skincare: Karin Herzog Vita-A-Kombi 1 Review Reviews Jun 01, 2008 June 01, 2008 Karin Herzog Vita-A-Kombi 1 ($52.00) is a product that boasts 1% of pure oxygen and Vitamin A, which is a patented combination by Dr. Herzog. This cream is meant to be used both morning and night, and it does a whole slew of things. It promotes healing, increases cell regeneration, minimizes pores, detoxifies, hydrates, diminishes lines and wrinkles, and desensitizes sensitive skin. I was using increased amounts of acne medications, and predictably, they made my skin more sensitive. There were few creams that I could use without feeling like my face was on fire. Vita-A-Kombi 1 was one of them, and even better, it can be used both morning and night. It is a fairly thick cream, and it does take some time (5 to 10 minutes) to sink into your skin. It is best applied with a light layer all over the face, but without rubbing it too much into the skin; instead, just let it absorb naturally. My skin looked refreshed, and it felt so soft. My only complaint was that every time I used this, my boyfriend told me I smelled like old lady. So I ended up wearing this mostly at night, rather than day, because I didn’t want people thinking I smelled like “old lady.” Otherwise, the results were right in line with what I expected, and my skin was happy to use it for a few weeks! The Karin Herzog line was the first to stabilize and deliver pure oxygen in cream form. The brand manufacturers their products in Switzerland, doesn’t conduct animal testing, and products are hypo-allergenic.

"['Ask Temptalia – Question & Answer Session #9 Features Sep 23, 2007 September 23, 2007 Thanks for all the questions! Keep sending them in to [email protected] . If you have a time-sensitive question, please let me know so I can try and answer it on time. If you didn’t see your question, check for it in the next Ask Temptalia post. Keep on sending them in! Q: I’ve heard makeup artists talk about undertones. Usually, they are knowledgeable enough that they can look at someone and immediately know their undertones. Is this an innate talent or is this something that I can learn? I’ve searched online but cannot find what I’m looking for. I want to be good at matching skin tones, complementing colors and their combinations. Is there anything you recommend? A: You can figure out your undertones by looking at the underside of your forearm (the paler part that doesn’t see the sun so often, ha!). If you have cool undertones, your skin will be slightly rosy or darker olive/brown. If you have warm undertones, your skin will be yellower or more golden. If you have a yellow cast to your skin, this means you have warmer skin than cool. If you have a blue cast to your skin, this means you have cooler skin than warm. Q: Here are all the eyeliners I have used that still smear after an hour or so: Bobbi Brown Gel Eyeliner, Makeup Forever Eyeliner, NYC Waterproof eyeliner, Maybelilne Waterproof Eyeliner, & Urban Decay 24/7. MAC fluidline -works the best out of all but still smears a little. I am trying to find something in pencil form since I do my make up in the car. I was thinking about the MAC Feline kohl liner but are those really waterproof? A: Wow, that’s a long list of trial and error! I don’t know anything in pencil form that’s really going to do that for you right now. The longest lasting formulas tend to be liquid, unfortunately. Point Black liquidlast will be your best bet, because the liquidlast formula has the most amazing staying power (I swatched some on my hand 2 days ago, still 100% there despite lots of handwashing). MAC’s kohl powers are not waterproof or smudgeproof, so while I love ’em, they’re not going to fit your needs.  Q: I have purchase some Mac brushes but I need help in how to best use each one. Please, I’m desperate to learn and how to learn from an expert … you! The brushes I have purchased are: 129, 187, 194, 219, 222, 224, 239, 242, 252, 266, 275, and 316. Can you please help me determine how I should be using each brush? A: The 129 is a blush brush or power brush, so you can use it with your blushes, loose powders, etc. The 187 is a stippling brush and can be used to apply foundation or mineralize skinfinishes; you may also use it for heavy blushes so you can have a lighter hand when applying darker blush colors. You’ll use the 194 for concealing, because of its size it allows you to pick up concealer or foundation to apply directly to areas that need extra coverage. The 219 is excellent for touch ups (like say you get mascara on your lid after you’ve finished your shadow) as well as applying color along the lash lines. Both the 222 and 224 are very similar, and they can both be used to gently blend colors together or to apply the crease color. The 239 will be your be-all-shadow brush, because it will most likely be the brush you use to apply your shadows with. With the 242’s flat, stiff bristles, it’s a great brush to apply pigments (when they’re wet), paints, cream colour bases, paint pots, etc. – basically creamy products. The 252 is just a large version of the 242. Everybody loves the 266 because it’s the perfect brush to fill in brows with, but more important is makes an excellent liner brush. Putting liquid or fluidline on your lash lines is a breeze with the 266. I would use the 275 to contour your crease, so another crease brush. You could also turn it into a face brush and contour smaller areas like the nose. The 316 s a lip brush, so you would use it to apply lipstick (I suppose lipglass would work too, but I’d probably pick one or the other or get two 316s). Q: I’m going to a Halloween party and I am going dressed as an element with my friends (we’ve all picked an element out of earth, air, fire and water) and I was wondering if you had any suggestions for make up that we could do with a sort of elemental theme… we were thinking of using colours that would go with our elements (reds, yellows and oranges for fire, greens and browns for earth, blues and teals for water and silver and greys for air)… we were wondering if you could help us by making a step by step tutorial for each or even suggesting current tutorials if that is not too much trouble. A: What a great Halloween costume idea! I’m not sure if I will have the time to do the tutorials you want, but I did go through the tutorials section to find some possibilities for you. You may also want to browse through the looks organized by color and take a look at a tutorial – I really do use the same technique in nearly every application, and the colors simply change. This is one you could use for fire, maybe adding some more orange/gold to the inner lid for a better fit as in this one . For earth, I think this one fits your description. Here is a blue and teal one for water, and this is a even bluer one. I did a tutorial for a classic silver-black smokey eye that might work for air here . It seems like I might actually already have a tutorial for the looks you’ve asked for ? Q: I have terrible lashes! Aside from them not curly well with a lash curler, they also go in every direction. Mascaras work well, but not when some of the lashes cooperate and others don’t. What do you suggest? Do you think lash extensions would work? A: You might want to try investing in a lash comb and running that throw your lashes before you apply any products. I would also suggest checking into a lash primer, perhaps to reduce the “every direction” problem you’re having. I’d vote against lash extensions, just because they make me nervous personally! Q: I’m having a big party for my Sweet Sixteen and wonder what look would look best with a teal and black dress. I’m planning to go to a M.A.C. counter at a department store to get it done, but a lot of people are saying you’ll end up looking like a drag queen and I definitely would not want that. Lol. Do you have any suggestions? A: AI would think about doing a teal and black smokey look! You could do teal all over your lid and then add Carbon eyeshadow to the outer lid and crease. If you have any teal glitter liner, that would make a great upper lash liner, too! If you go to MAC with an idea of what you want, tell them (pictures are also good, too), you shouldn’t have a problem. Sometimes people tell them “do whatever” or “go crazy” and they really WILL go crazy! Q: I was wondering if you need a separate brush for every eyeshadow color you use, or do you clean them between each color, and if so, how do you clean the color off them without washing? I don’t see the need to buy a brush for every color, but I don’ want the colors to mix. Thanks! A: I generally use one brush for the entire application. Really, really dark colors like Carbon e/s I’ll use a separate brush for, but I find in general, most colors don’t end up mixing much. I usually swirl the excess off the brush on a tissue or the palm of my hand when I move to another color. If you’re working with a white, I would use a separate brush, so you can keep it the whitest.']",34777c726acb0735870505eb3ad5167be590d1f1,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/ask-temptalia-question-answer-session-9/,['2007-09-23 00:00:00']
"['ClearPluss™ Acne Clearing Treatment Review Skincare Jan 07, 2008 January 07, 2008 Clinic’estetica ™, a state of the art aesthetic medical clinic that meets the needs of individuals seeking non-surgical permanent and semi-permanent solutions for cosmetic and reconstructive procedures, is proud to introduce ClearPluss™ Acne Clearing Treatment — an original and uniquely designed at-home acne clearing product line for face and body (chest and back). ClearPluss™ is based on the theory and testing that has shown that acne has a trigger; when that trigger is disengaged acne outbreaks will be curtailed and possibly stopped. Each product in the line is a step-by-step acne clearing treatment. ClearPluss™ creates an accumulative positive result for controlling all types of acne while working to keep skin healthy and unmarred. Breakouts, swelling, and scarring become a distant memory. I spent just about three weeks testing out Clinic’estetica’s ClearPluss™ Acne Clearing Treatment. As someone who has always had a touch of acne (thankfully nothing so bad as frightful as of yet), I was curious to see how this system would work for me. It consists of a four-stem system; you begin with the Acne Clearing Cleanser, which aggressively prepares the skin to absorb the elements of ClearPluss while removing dead skin cells and dirt. I personally enjoyed this cleanser, which is definitely an exfoliating cleanser. I would say that those with more sensitive skin may not like how abrasive the particles in the cleanser are. It took me a few cleansings to get used to it and like the feel of it really working. The second step is the Acne Clearing Treatment, which is a serum used daily to reduce or eliminate acne, blackheads, and overly oily skin. It has a pleasing smell of peppermint and a little goes a long way. Since this is the product that really is the cornerstone of the system to keep acne at bay, I blame the patches of dryness that occurred after two weeks on this one – for those with drier and/or sensitive skin, I’d opt to use this serum only once a day or every other day. Especially since I am not plagued by severe acne, I think it would have been just as effective. The third step is the Acne Clearing Tonic, which is to help skin control excessive sebum production. It is meant to be used in-between to reduce acne persistance during the regimen. I only used this a few times, because my skin does not really require a toner. The last step is the Acne Clearing Moisture, which provides additional moisturization to dry, sensitive skin. It helps reduce the inflammation resulting from acne, rosacea, etc. It does not have any oil or fragrance, which is always a great thing in a facial moisturizer. Results? Yes, I saw results. My skin looked and felt healthier, cleaner. It is a meticulous routine, though, so if you are forgetful or often skip steps in your skincare regimen, this is probably not for you. However, on the same note, all these products work together to achieve maximum results, so you do not have to worry about finding the right mix of non-matching products. Most of my acne was reduced to just one or two small, manageable pimples along the chin area or forehead — noticeably less, and any small bouts that appeared were hardly visible (did not get any enormous, traffic-stopping zits!). ClearPluss™ Acne Clearing Treatment can be purchased at http://www.simplysvelte.com/ .']",72d3f2b77699e62af1b94916d3fecbd900eedc03,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/clearpluss%e2%84%a2-acne-clearing-treatment-review/,['2008-01-07 00:00:00']

"['Creme de la Mer – Introduction & Reviews of Creme de la Mer, Lotions, Hand Treatment Reviews Sep 22, 2007 September 22, 2007 I recently had the opportunity to check out and try several La Mer products over the past few weeks. Since La Mer focuses on skincare, I wanted to test everything for awhile, so I could really give you a true blue review on them! You’ll find a review on eight different La Mer products: Creme de la Mer moisturizing cream, Moisturizing lotion, Moisturizing gel, Eye Balm, Concentrate, Cleansing Gel, Refining Facial, and Hand Treatment. Overall , La Mer products are luxurious against the skin — there is no doubt about it — soft, silky, and deliciously moisturized and well-balanced skin results from using their products over a matter of days. I love that they’ve come out with several versions of their most popular item, Creme de la Mer, so they can provide products that can really cater to a customer’s individual skin. They have lightweight versions of it, which I found was great for days when the weather was just too hot for anything remotely thick. Creme de la Mer — I can see why this product is raved about, because it made my skin soft and supple, and I swear there was a touch of glow to it after using Creme de la Mer for a few weeks. It has a very light scent, which is a definite plus for me, as I prefer my facial products with minimal scents. The cream itself is rich and thick, and you have to make sure you warm it up between your palm or fingers before applying in order to achieve the best results. Moisturizing Lotion — This is the lightweight version of Creme de la Mer, which I just adore for days on the go, hot days, or when I know I’ll be running around like a chicken without a head. Sometimes the original formula is too rich for my skin, so I really find that this is a great alternative. Also, in the winter months, a lot of people experience drier skin, while in the summer months find their skin is more normalized in moisture, so being able to alternate between the two formulas is excellent. Moisturizing Gel Cream is very similar in the results that are yielded as Creme de la Mer and the Moisturizing lotion! Just pick your favorite texture and thickness. Eye Balm — I’ll have to admit that I was probably not the best reviewer for this, as I’m still young enough where I haven’t been plagued by an abundance of eye wrinkles (though I see them starting, trust me!), but after a few days of use, I noticed my eyes were less puffy and the skin seemed tighter. Concentrate — I didn’t have a chance to use this yet (probably a good thing?) as it is meant to be used over post-trauma skin to improve and aid in the healing process. This is ideal for use to reduce the scarring and redness from recent surgery, microdermabrasion, etc. Cleansing Gel — If you want a clean and fresh feeling, this product definitely does it for you. It does a decent job of removing all excess dirt, makeup, etc. off of your face (though I’d recommend using a separate eye makeup remover prior to this cleanser for the ultimate clean). It does leave your skin feeling a bit tight, and I know some people love that feeling, while others prefer cleansers without it. I like that the gel is thick, not loose at all, so you don’t need too much for an individual application. Refining Facial — Oh, I loved this! My skin felt so soft after I used it – it’s meant to help exfoliate by sloughing off dead skin and really getting into your pores and bringing out the glow and healthy sheen your skin should have. I adore this product for sure! They describe it as your skin feeling awakened, and I have to nod my head in agreement. Hand Treatment — Let me tell you, my hands thanked me after just a few days of using La Mer’s fabulous hand cream. They literally said, “Where have you been all my life?” to the tube of cream! I’m an obsessive handwasher, which unfortunately results inn dry hands (though I’ve lucked out and they’re not as dry as they could be), so this lotion definitely came in handy. I also used the cream on the heels of my feet on occasion, and it worked great!']",db2fc0981cd76a6271db5193fe975440a2d77599,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/creme-de-la-mer-introduction-reviews-of-creme-de-la-mer-lotions-hand-treatment/,['2007-09-22 00:00:00']

"['Looks – Heatherette Trio #1 Fake-it in Smoky Teal Looks Mar 22, 2008 March 22, 2008 Even though Mood Ring is gorgeous, and the packaging for the eyeshadow trios is sleek and up my alley, I just can’t bring myself to buy it quite yet. So I set out to dupe a look I know I’d do as soon as I got the trio instead… BTW, clean your brushes often! I went to fix part of the inner lid, and what do you know, I get some teal-black, too. I used Soft Ochre paint pot all over lid, Shroom eyeshadow on inner lid, Aquavert eyeshadow on middle of lid, Newly Minted eyeshadow patted on middle lid, Cloudburst eyeshadow on outer lid and crease, Newly Minted eyeshadow patted on outer crease, Shimmermoss eyeshadow on outer lid, Shroom eyeshadow above crease and on brow, Black Funk/Pop Blue dual edge pencil on lower lash line, Gorgeous Gold eyeshadow on lower inner lash line, Plushblack mascara, and Brun eyeshadow for brows. I wore Springsheen blush on cheeks with Guerlain Mythic Parfait Pressed Meterorite to highlight cheeks. I had Soft Lust lipstick with Vital Spark and Tartlette lipglass on my lips. * This look is meant to replicate one that could be made using Heatherette Trio 1. Shroom = Hoppin’; Mood Ring = Aquavert, Newly Minted, Shimmermoss (They all get muddled together in this look – Aquadisiac + Newly Minted would also work; Meadowland is a good dupe on its own); Cloudburst = Cloudburst eyeshadow (launched with Blue Storm) — can be replaced with Carbon and layer Shimmermoss (tap it) for the slight blue reflects from Cloudburst. ** The lips are meant to also duplicate Heatherette products: Soft Lust = Lollipop Lovin’ (no green reflects in this version); Vital Spark + Tartlette = Sock Hop with shimmer.

It had good pigmentation both wet and dry, though the dampened application yielded a stronger, foil-like shine and full coverage.

There was some fallout over time (seven to eight hours) when used dry and very minimal fallout over time when applied with a dampened brush. It\'s a good formula overall, but the price point seemed skewed, even within the brand\'s formula (typically, eyeshadows are less expensive compared to the brand\'s lipsticks, and the Luxe Lip Colors are $37 so these are more expensive).

"['Looks – Sunny Yellows and Oranges Looks Aug 19, 2008 August 19, 2008 The horseback ride was pretty nice, though I can certainly feel it today! I call it the “Triangle of Pain,” because you feel it on about three points at the seat of your pants. It’s not fun. I’m praying that the Zipline harness doesn’t overlap those points, because I imagine the harness itself might make me a bit sore, too! I told the boy that when I came home, I’d be an “Octagon of Pain.” Hawaii’s been great for the most part, but I haven’t slept well at all, so it’s starting to take a toll on me! I keep going to bed and getting that sleep where you wake up 20 times, and each time you do, you feel like you never even went to sleep at all! The look I’m sharing with you today is what I wore to go horseback riding. It seemed like it was going to be a good day, weather-wise, and sure enough, perfect! Breezy and not too humid or hot aka my makeup wouldn’t slide off the first step I took outside. Today, I’m going to go pretty bare-faced for the Zipline adventure (we picked the 8am time slot), but I’ll put on my “real” face later, LOL. You will need the following… Eyes : Soft Ochre paint pot (creamy neutral base), Going Bananas eyeshadow (frosty yellow), Fab & Flashy eyeshadow (frosty orange), Bold & Brazen eyeshadow (bronze with pink), Dark Edge eyeshadow (matte dark brown), Ricepaper eyeshadow (neutral highlighter), UD 24//7 Stash Eye Pencil (dark gold), Plushlash mascara (black) Cheeks : Margin blush (dirty pink) Lips : Swelter slimshine (bright coral), C-thru lipglass (nude) Brushes : 266 (firm, angled brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 129 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Going Bananas = Bright Sunshine; Fab & Flashy = Juiced (not a great dupe); Bold & Brazen = Twinks; Dark Edge = Brun; Swelter = Skew Directions: Define brows using a coordinating powder shadow applied with the 266 brush. Apply Soft Ochre paint pot all over the lid as the base with the 249. Apply Going Bananas eyeshadow to inner third of the lid using the 239 brush. Follow by applying Fab & Flashy eyeshadow to the middle of the lid. Darken outer lid with Bold & Brazen eyeshadow. Apply Dark Edge eyeshadow into outer crease to deepen, using the 239. Soften harsh lines with Going Bananas eyeshadow swept above crease. Highlight brow with Ricepaper eyeshadow. Line lower lash line with UD 24/7 Stash Eye Pencil. Sweep apples of cheeks with Margin blush using the 129. Apply Swelter slimshine to lips, and then top with C-thru lipglass for color and shine.']",54d03e2ca5b000d9208c27788bc2a5eed0fe102e,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/looks-sunny-yellows-and-oranges/,['2008-08-19 00:00:00']

"['Looks – Global Goddess Serengeti Tribal Eyeshadow Quad Looks Jul 24, 2008 July 24, 2008 For months, I have been drawn to Global Goddess’ products, because they just look so pretty. I recently received a few items from the brand to try out, and I am glad that I didn’t fork over the bucks myself. The review will follow this entry, so you can read about my experience with it, but suffice to say I wasn’t impressed and I think this look can even show you some of the trouble I had with it.

"['MAC Cosmetics Cremeteam Review & Thoughts Reviews Feb 05, 2009 February 05, 2009 OVERALL , Cremeteam introduces several nice shades of Cremesheen lipsticks to the permanent line, and they also launched limited edition Cremesheen glasses, which left me wanting. Cremesheen is a finish of lipstick that MAC introduced to us last year, and the finish might be described as fairly pigmented color with subtle sheen and low frost. They don’t have shimmer as far as I could tell either. The new shades of Cremesheen lipsticks add a nice variety of color the permanent lipstick range, and I definitely found myself liking the colors a lot more than some of the limited edition lipsticks from the past few collections. As far as the new Cremesheen glasses go, I just can’t get on that train. Every single one of them is sheer in color, with some varying in pigmentation (the real test will be lip swatches, which I will do, but probably not until tonight, FYI). The finish and texture of the new glosses is almost buttery and quite creamy, so they do feel nice on the lips. For the price and quantity you get, I find it difficult to even recommend them, because the price alone just grates on my nerves. I’ll put a little price analysis behind the cut, so you can read that if you desire ? Temptalia’s Recommendations Must-Haves : Crosswires, Lavender Whip, Shy Girl Nice-To-Haves : Creme Cup, Hang Up, Lickable Skip : Fashion Scoop, Looks Like Sin See individual, in-depth product reviews as well as some cost analysis… Cremesheen Glass at $18.00 A regular MAC lipglass costs $14 and you get 0.17 oz. for your money. Cremesheen glass will run you $18 and you get 0.09 oz. for your money. It’s really hard for me to understand why it costs $4 more and yet you get nearly half as much. The packaging is different, but let me tell you, I’m happy with the packaging for lipglasses if it’s going to save me $4! If you found yourself running out of your Dazzleglasses quickly, I would expect these to go the same way. I didn’t really grasp why Dazzleglasses were priced so much higher than lipglasses when they were originally launched either, so please let me know if there’s some magic ingredient that hikes up the product cost (and yet not worth mentioning in advertising). Cremesheen Lipsticks Creme Cup is a medium-toned neutral pink. It’s pretty, and it’s brighter and pinker than a lipstick like Angel. It’s not quite as opaque as most other Cremesheens, but it has good color pay off compared to lusres and glazes. Creme In Your Coffee is a deeper pink-mauve with brown tones to it. It’s a great way to try out a lipstick that’s more brown-based without going for something more obviously brown. Lavender Whip is a pastel purple shade with a little bit of pink to it, but it’s pretty lilac-y to me. It has good color and pay off; and you bet, it does resemble Fashion Mews from Hello Kitty, but it’s not as light/pale nor as frosty. Lickable is a bright hot pink with subtle sheen, not too much fuchsia in it either. It reminded me a bit of Girl About Town a little. Hang Up is a subtle cranberry shade. It’s reddish without being a true red; it has enough berry tones to keep it dark. Shy Girl is a stunning peach-nude color. I imagine it will be quite flattering on many different skin tones. I did find that this was the sheerest of the eight new (but permanent) Cremesheen lipsticks. Spice Is Nice is a warm tan-brown shade, perhaps with a little rosiness to it. It’s not a shade I’d rock myself, but I know it would make a nice everyday shade for others. Crosswires is a bold coral-red shade. It’s not an orange-based coral, for those who prefer that family of lipsticks. This is one of my favorite colors from the launch, even though it is a repromote. Cremesheen Glass Boy Bait is a mid-tone neutral pink (with almost a touch of peach in it). Creme Anglaise is a berry-pink color. Ever So Rich is a lilac-lavender shade, very sheer (so you better buy Lavender Whip if you want to emulate the promo photo!). Fashion Scoop is a light, milky pink. It’s cooler, and it’s also much lighter than Boy Bait. Looks Like Sin is a brownish-reddish color, but it’s obviously not a very red in color. This is the only one that bled into my skin (as you can see in the swatches). Despite being dark, the pigmentation is lacking when applied to my lips. Melt In Your Mouth is a bright, springy shade of pink. It’s not hot pink, but it’s brighter than the other pink glosses in the launch, but it’s pinker than Creme Anglaise. Partial to Pink is a warmer medium pink–more pop to it than Boy Bait–and it did seem a little more pigmented than the other choices from the swatch alone. Petite Induglence is a fuchsia-pink, leaning very fuchsia and almost cool. It might pop in the swatch, but towards the edges, it sheered out and wasn’t giving me a ton of color.']",82487803b601506956e2e2fa27d7284413992910,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-cremeteam-review-thoughts/,['2009-02-05 00:00:00']

"['Buying Guide for Sephora’s Friends & Family Sale Features Oct 19, 2009 October 19, 2009 When the Sephora Friends & Family Sale starts (20% off – use code FF2009 at checkout), I always get an influx of questions about what people should buy. To me, there are three categories of products to consider whenever a decent sale rolls around in the beauty world. Otherwise, it’s really a matter of what your budget is like, what you need, and what you want. There are so many amazing beauty products that I think are worth checking out, but I couldn’t even begin to compile a list for you, since it definitely matters what you’re looking for! So here are some of my suggestions on how to whittle your lists down… More expensive purchases that you’ve otherwise held off on make great buys during big sales. I know that I often delay pricier purchases until I’m really sure I want/need it. If you’ve been drooling over something for the past six months, this is an item you might want to consider splurging on. For me, if I lose interest by the next week, I know I made the right move by using what little patience I have waiting. Products like the Clarisonic fall right into this category of sale possibilities. It’s a product that’s been well-received by many beauty addicts, but it’s also one of the pricier purchases you might make this year. (I do recommend the Mia for those on a tighter budget — performs just as well as the full-size version.) And it doesn’t have to be that pricey–just pricier than you feel comfortable paying on a regular basis–like Guerlain Rouge G Lipsticks . They’re overpriced, though fabulous, and with 20% off, it brings the price down to a more palatable $36. It’s all about you and what you consider a splurge — for me, a splurge is Rouge G. For others, it may be an Urban Decay Lipstick at $22! I always like to use beauty sales to stock-up on my favorite makeup and skincare staples. For me, that means Philosophy shower gels and pricier skincare like Kate Somerville. Don’t forget about things you use often and go through within the year, like cleansers, makeup removers, mascara, etc. These are always good purchases, because you know you’ll use them and aren’t just buying them because there’s a sale. The third category of products are all of the gifts and value sets that various brands put together for the holiday giving/receiving season. I like these because they usually represent a better value than if you purchased the included pieces individually, so then when you save 20%, you’re really saving even more. Totally love that! Plus, as a beauty addict, my stash is only going to grow, so I don’t necessarily need full sizes of everything–sometimes the gift set size is perfect. I love being able to try multiple products for the same price as one or two full size products!']",a98c89dd66792ee09222e9c9147757ad06051940,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/buying-guide-for-sephoras-friends-family-sale/,['2009-10-19 00:00:00']

"['Celeb-a-Like – Alyssa Milano’s Silvery Smoky Eye and Coral Lips Dec 27, 2007 December 27, 2007 ALYSSA MILANO goes for a silvery smoky eye with coral-brown lips and looks fabulous! Begin by applying your base of choice (the cult favorite is Urban Decay’s Primer Potion ) all over your lid. Using the 239, apply a touch of MAC’s Gesso eyeshadow to the very inner portion of the lid, just for a pop of white shadow. Pick up a generous amount of MAC’s Silver Ring eyeshadow and apply all over the lid, leaving a touch of the Gesso remaining on the inner lid. Apply MAC’s Black Tied eyeshadow using the 224 to the outer crease, blending outwards and upwards to darken and add depth. With the 239, apply MAC’s Shroom eyeshadow above the crease and underneath brow to highlight. Line eyes with a black eyeliner, like MAC’s Graphblack technakohl, and then with the 219, lightly line eyes with MAC’s Knight Divine eyeshadow. Apply several coats of ultra black mascara to both upper and lower lashes to finish the eyes. Get Milano’s flawless, dewy skin with a foundation that dries to a semi-matte finish. If you only have a matte foundation, try adding a bit of moisturizer to it. We recommend MAC’s Face & Body liquid foundation. Using a concealer brush (194), dab on a touch of liquid foundation to cheeks, chin, forehead, and nose. Spritz a fluffy powder or buffer brush (129, 150, or 182) with a mist of water or Fix+, and then buff the foundation onto your face. Work your way outwards to ensure full coverage. Apply more dabs of foundation if you so require. Set with any loose powder if have oilier skin (or feel the need to) using a fluffy powder brush (129). Brighten up cheeks by using the 129 and picking up a small amount of MAC’s Springsheen blush and dusting onto the apples of the cheeks. Blend outwards using the 129 brush, softly swirling it on the cheeks, and finish by buffing the color into skin with the 182. For perfectly pouty lips, first line the outer edges of your lips with MAC’s Cream Kiss cremestick liner to get a very defined shape. Apply MAC’s Peachstock lipstick on lips either straight from the tube or using a lip brush like the 316. Top lips off with a light coat of MAC’s Lychee Luxe lipglass.']",6b23e19d18021130eb32b803cbf614575f542127,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/celeb-a-like-alyssa-milanos-silvery-smoky-eye-and-coral-lips/,['2007-12-27 00:00:00']

It’s housed in a sleek matte black case, and it’s about nine inches in length. The palette has a nice variety of colors, ranging from warm pinks to shimmery peach to magenta fuchsia. I would say that the majority of the colors are warmer rather than cooler, if that makes a difference for any of you.

"['FAQ: Review & Rating System Site News Oct 19, 2009 October 19, 2009 FAQ: Review & Rating System This post is designed to help readers understand more about how I review products, what characteristics I’m looking for in products, what criterion I use for different aspects of a product, and the like. My goal is to qualify my review process in such a way that helps readers understand why a product receives a certain score. Ultimately, I hope that this FAQ reduces any confusion and gives everyone a better understanding of the rating system and how best to use it. Read the FAQ on how I review and what the rating system means to me … The Review I always test out products I review. I’m not reviewing a product I haven’t seen in person, with my own eyes, and touched with my own fingers (or applicator–whatever!). When it comes to most makeup, the trial period isn’t particularly extensive (if an eyeliner fades in an hour, wearing it for a week isn’t changing that!), but the review is about that trial, my results, what I liked/disliked, where a product could use improvement, whether it’s worth the price tag, and if it lives up to its claims. For skincare, I test most products for two to three weeks at a minimum, but depending on the type of product, I often test products for as long as six weeks. Skincare really depends on what I’m reviewing it for (e.g. anti-acne, anti-aging, etc. require longer testing periods, but if it’s just a facial scrub, a few weeks of testing is usually enough). I usually indicate the testing period length when I do skincare reviews. Bottom Line: Products are photographed and swatched/used/tested as appropriate. The Rating System The rating system is not a substitute for the written review or photos/swatches included with the review. It is meant to be a quick summary, but it should be considered in context. Product – 60% weight The Product score is a measure of a product’s effectiveness, efficacy, and how it performs. In my eyes, this is an extremely important factor, which I have always weighted higher than the other factors I review on (value, ease of use, and packaging). At the end of the day, I want to know if a product did what it was supposed to do–I don’t care if it was a steal or I felt like I got robbed or if it comes in a paper bag–it’s all about how well it works. I often look at a product’s claims to determine how well it meets them. Value – 20% weight Value is a measure of whether the product is priced in line with expectations and whether you’re getting enough for your money. I do not think it reasonable or even remotely helpful to compare a $25 lipstick with a $2 lipstick. If that’s how you look at value, then few products will have value. Even a L’Oreal lipstick is pricey compared to a $1 Wet ‘n Wild lipstick! I think it’s silly to compare Chanel to Wet ‘n Wild to determine value. Value, to me, is a combination of how the product’s price stacks up against similar products from direct competitors and if you’re getting enough for that money. For instance, I compare value across brands like Chanel, Dior, and Guerlain, but I don’t compare any of these higher end brands to mass retail brands like CoverGirl, L’Oreal, and Maybelline. So I ask myself these questions: 1) how much product do I get for my money? (I use price per ounce, usually!); 2) how does it compare to direct competitors/similar products from the brand?; and 3) how many usages will I get out of it? Value is something to look at, particularly if you’re on a budget, but a product should, ultimately, not be so docked down that it receives a low rating purely because it’s expensive. Ease of Use – 10% weight Most products are fairly simple and easy enough to use, so this is an area where a lot of products can get some “gimme” points, essentially. However, sometimes I do come across products that are confusing in their directions (like a mask – it might not tell you whether to rinse it off or not) or are impractical (e.g. lip palettes). It’s something I look for in a product, but it has a very small impact on the overall score. Packaging – 10% weight The way a product is packaged can often grab your attention, so we know brands pay attention to packaging, and I think it’s important to keep it in mind as part of a review. I love fun packaging, but packaging doesn’t make or break a product (well, not usually–there’s always an exception), so this is just a minor characteristic to judge a product on. I often look at the practicality of packaging, whether it keeps things sanitary, how it functions, and the like. Overall The overall score is given on the American grading system of A, B, C, D, F, with both pluses and minuses to reflect degrees of scores. I feel this system conveys a clear message of how good or bad a product is. If you think about it, there are three ways to say B: 8/10, 80%, and B-, but they do all mean the same thing. I award a maximum of 30 points for product, 10 points for value, 5 points for ease of use, and 5 points for packaging. There is a maximum of 50 points to help determine the overall score. This overall score may be influenced by my overall feel (such as perhaps I’d like to give more like 3.5 points out of 5 for packaging, and the like) and experience with the product itself and how it stacks up, so I may round up (e.g. point values are 79%, I may round to a 80% or a B-). So here is a break down of what each letter means: A: This is a product that is excellent overall. A+ is the highest grade a product can achieve, thus it is a rare, but coveted, score. A- reflects an excellent product with a minor flaw (be it value, ease of use, packaging). If I give a product A- or above, it’s something I’d consider purchasing again in the future and will likely use repeatedly in the future. B: This reflects a good product overall. A solid product that I’d recommend to others and wouldn’t mind using, but I may not repurchase in the future because I feel like there’s something better out there. It’s good, but not good enough that I want to stop the search for more. B+ represents a product that’s just at the cusp of good and great. B- represents a product that’s a cusp of good and average. C: This reflects an average product overall. This is a product that performs decently, but it’s not something I’d recommend to others overall. Like the other grades, a plus indicates slightly better than average but not quite good, and a minus indicates a slightly less than average product. D: This reflects a below average product overall. I do not recommend products with this low of a score. These are products that often perform well below expectations and fail to meet the claims it makes. To earn such a low score, the product itself must be less than effective. F: This reflects a failure of a product overall. I’ve never given this grade out, though I have come close. This is a product that doesn’t work and isn’t worth your time. It’s probably not even worth the time it takes to read the review about it.']",976deadb0dc9fa992ccc606b54517c2a006e4a36,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/faq-review-rating-system/,['2009-10-19 00:00:00']
"['The Scarlet Season: MAC Russian Red Lipstick Series Nov 07, 2009 November 07, 2009 MAC Russian Red Lipstick The Scarlet Season: MAC Russian Red Lipstick MAC Russian Red Lipstick ($14.00 for 0.10 oz.) is one of the brand’s classic reds–and by classic, I mean, it’s been around forever, worn by numerous celebrities, and embraced as as an iconic shade of true red. It’s a vibrant red with a slight blue-base, but on me, it doesn’t run too cool and almost ends up neutral (not too blue, not too orange) on my lips. It has a matte finish, but it does have a slight sheen when applied. It’s creamy, applies opaque with ease, and it stays put for hours (partially due to the fact that it is a matte). Even though the finish is matte, it’s creamy enough not to be drying (which is a huge plus, as some of MAC’s mattes can be). This is really one of those shades that I feel must be tried at some point in your lifetime, whether you’re a fan of red lips or not!

"['Sonia Kashuk Showstoppers Eyeshadow Quad Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Nov 09, 2009 November 09, 2009 Holiday Glitz: Sonia Kashuk Showstoppers Eyeshadow Quad Sonia Kashuk Showstoppers Eyeshadow Quad ($10.99) is the glitz-in-a-pan that’s so perfect and fitting for the holiday season I couldn’t resist saving this review until now. There are certain items that impress you at first swatch, and this was definitely one of those items for me. It includes a glittery warmed-up frosty white, muted reddish-brown with golden bronze glitter, glitzy soft pale antique gold, and smoky charcoal gray-black with silver glitter. These applied and looked almost wet–I will say they looked much better in person than in photos. There’s just something about the shimmer that I couldn’t capture, despite taking dozens of photos! I will say that the only real drawback to these is they have a tendency to get all over your cheeks if you use a regular eyeshadow brush with them. I do recommend using a sponge-tip applicator or else use these applied wet to minimize the fall out. The texture of the eyeshadows was surprisingly soft and almost creamy, despite the obvious glittery bits, and the pigmentation was decent overall. I found the gold shade was the least opaque, followed by the white shade, while the brown and gray shades were both opaque. The price is just right, and you can often catch Sonia Kashuk on sale at your local Target–though I’ve heard this isn’t as easy to find locally as it is online. Bottom Line: This is just one of those really fun, totally glitzy and glittery pieces that you may not pull out and wear everyday, but it sure is glamorous to have all that bling sparkling on your eyes. It’s really, really stunning when you swatch–not quite as lovely on the lids (but still nice!), but ultimately not the most practical item I’ll own.

This particular flavor is part of the Mentha Lip Cordials, so there is a bit of a cooling sensation when you initially apply it, and apparently it also freshens breath (zero calories!). It gives lips a glossy look with just a touch of shimmer but no real color (which is fine) while keeping them hydrated while you wear it. Warm Spiced Cider is new for the holiday season, along with Hot Buttered Rum, Triple Hot Chocolate, and Vanilla Cream Eggnog. I find I apply this when I’m running errands or around the house to keep my lips in tip top shape. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ?

"['New York Fashion Week Fall 2008 – Backstage with MAC at Jason Wu, Nicole Miller, and Baby Phat zArchived Feb 04, 2008 February 04, 2008 JASON WU | In fall 2008, we saw the bright lip, while in spring 2008, it was all about cheeks and alshes. For fall 2008, it is about the glitter eye. At Jason Wu, we saw a very fifties/seventies-lady show of chiffons, florals, and A-line skirts with fur-trimmed sweaters. Artist Romy Soleimani said she gave models’ lips a wine color with layered peach pink over it, to give the illusion that she had just been sipping sherry. She created a gold on grey glitter eye — “grey for cool, and gold for warm,” she said — using MAC’s Reflects, a fine powder glitter. The eyes were soft, not disco, but rather “The harbinger of a whole new zeitgeist.” The cheeks were sculpted using the latest sculpt/shape line. NICOLE MILLER | “Think Stephanie Seymour or Karen Mulder, the supes of yore,” said Romy Soleimani, who was the key artist for the show featuring brocaded cocktail dresses and coats in yellow or cobalt. It was a rather 80s kind of feel. She used glitter as inspiration with a maroon base that was topped with an olive gold from MAC Reflects glitter. She opted for lipstick in a rosewood color that was put sheerly on without liner, and no gloss. Lashes were looking false, looking incredibly long, but very fluttery–but they weren’t, chalk it up to the newest gel mascara MAC plans to launch later this year. BABY PHAT | Christopher Ardoff noted Kimora’s inspiration was the 1920s, so he opted for a Clara Bow, Josephine Baker, Billie holiday kind of look. He blocked out brows using a nude pencil while he used grey glitter in a rounded crescent shape for the eyes. He paitned lips a red-orange kind of color that truly stood out. For darker skintones, he added more depth with burgundy glitter to eyes.

"[""NARS Aigle Noir Soft Touch Shadow Pencil Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Nov 09, 2009 November 09, 2009 Holiday 2009: NARS Aigle Noir Soft Touch Shadow Pencil NARS Aigle Noir Soft Touch Shadow Pencil ($24.00 for 0.14 oz.) is a new product recently released by NARS designed to provide smooth, long-wearing all-over eye color. It can be used to smudge along the lash line or as a base. NARS also released two other shades: Goddess (a shimmery light pink) and Skorpios (a shimmery copper). Aigle Noir is a dark brownish-black with green-gold shimmer laced through it. It’s a very nice, solid shade to wear on the lower lash line, but when it’s applied to the lid, it just tends to appear sheerer (especially if you apply or blend with a brush or fingertip). So, every cream-based eye product gets a very simple test: apply it all over my lid and wait to see if it creases. NARS’ Soft Touch Shadow Pencil did not make it past five minutes before there was a distinct line where the color creased on my eyelid. Consequently, I wouldn’t consider this a grab-and-go product, because it just doesn’t hold up on its lonesome. NARS says the new Soft Touch Shadow Pencils are the “[i]deal base for layering with powder eyeshadow to increase color intensity,” which is always the follow-up test when an emollient product can’t keep from creasing. They also state that this is a “smooth, creamy, long-wearing formula,” which I’ll have to disagree with–at least when worn by itself. However, when set with a powder eyeshadow, the results are definitely much better. I didn’t find it creased or smudged on me once I had a layer of powder shadow on top. I imagine you could, if you really wanted to keep the color itself showing, try translucent powder dusted on top to minimize creasing. Since NARS suggests these as an “ideal” base and doesn’t necessarily call out that it should be used totally alone, I won’t knock off a ton of points for missing the mark on that. Nope, NARS does, actually. Major impact on rating! I know that even purported crease-proof products can vary from person to person, with it never creasing on some but creasing in minutes on others. For the record, my lids are about average; neither dry nor oily. It also works nicely as an eyeliner, and it didn’t smudge, budge, or migrate on my lower lash line when I wore it for a day. I noticed it had no staying power on my waterline, though, so if you were hoping to use it for that, you may find yourself looking at other products. I will also say that because these are oversized pencils, they’re not the easiest to line with. I was able to get a thin line on my lower lash line, but it does take a little maneuvering to make sure you don’t end up with a thicker line. Aigle Noir was smooth, lightly creamy, and worked best as an eyeshadow base. Bottom Line : These are not crease-proof on their own, but they can work as a good base beneath powder eyeshadows. Once you’ve set the product with the powder eyeshadow, you’re good to go. Aigle Noir applied fairly evenly when I applied directly from the pencil onto my lid, but it took a bit of layering to get a more opaque look. I wasn’t blown away by the formula, but if there’s a color that really calls to you, I think it’s worth checking out. For me, I’d would have loved to see this shade as a pressed eyeshadow.

"['Chanel Aqualumiere Gloss for Holiday 2009 – Canari, Colibri, Hirondelle – Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Oct 20, 2009 October 20, 2009 Chanel Aqualumiere Gloss: Canari, Colibri, Hirondelle Chanel Aqualumiere Gloss ($27.00) will see an addition of three new, limited edition shades as part of Chanel’s Holiday Collection . The shades include Canari , which is a peachy-melon with golden-peach shimmer; Colibri , which is a shimmery champagne with iridescent shimmer; and Hirondelle , which is a medium pink with pink and gold shimmer. All three Aqualumiere Glosses appearing with the holiday collection are very sheer shades. They pack pretty shimmer, but they don’t add much in the way of color. Canari goes on as a golden shimmer, which is pretty and definitely holiday-esque–I’d probably layer it over a red for a little extra glitz. Colibri makes my lips appear cooler and paler with iridescent silvery white shimmer. It actually reminds me a bit of MAC’s She-Zam Dazzleglass , but with a little more of a pinkish tone to it. Surprisingly, Hirondelle adds the most color to lips, and it appears as a soft, slightly milky pink with pink shimmer. Aqualumiere Glosses are sheer, ultra glossy, and non-sticky. It comes with a brush-tipped applicator which makes for fairly easy application. I’m easygoing when it comes to gloss applicators – doe foot or brush, it’s all good! They’re not the most long-lasting lipgloss (I certainly wouldn’t dub them long-wearing) – I get about three hours of wear when I layer one on by itself. Over a lipstick, I do get better results (four to five hours overall for the average pairing). I still prefer some of the earlier released shades of Aqualumiere Glosses–I remember being really jazzed over them initially–but these new shades for holiday are a little too sheer for my liking. I’d suggest checking out permanent shades like Candy Glow and Ginger Shimmer instead. Bottom Line: Aqualumiere Glosses are, by their nature, sheer, so I’m not going to knock a bunch of points off on that account. These shades just aren’t to my particular taste, but if you like non-sticky, ultra glossy lipgloss, then Aqualumiere Glosses are always a good bet–just as long as you’re in the market for something on the sheerer side. Product : 24/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : If you’re a fan of the feel and texture of Chanel’s Aqualumiere Glosses, you might want to peep the new shades.

"['New York Fashion Week Fall 2008 – Backstage with MAC at Sari Gueron, Ruffian, Alexandre Herchcovitch, Costello Tagliapietra zArchived Feb 04, 2008 February 04, 2008 SARI GUERON | “Sari’s clothes have a lot of volume this season,” explained makeup artist Gucci Westman. To counteract this, she opted for “Grey, smudgy, and slept in – very real girl” eyes with nude pink lips. “She’s the girl we all want to be,” laughed Westman. “She doesn’t take hours to do her makeup and she still looks good.” RUFFIAN | It was all about the eyes as James Kiliardos designed the look for the show. He smeared eyes with a pale gray mixed with violet, followed by gloss “for a hollowed wood nymph effect.” He did focus on the lips by adding a bright pop of a semi-matte red and purple that showed up as a shocking fuchsia. He skipped mascara as well as sculpting the cheeks, so the lips could stand out even more. THREEASFOUR | Gordon Espinet describes the fall look as “radiance,” which inspired his look for the ThreeAsFour show. The skin is no longer powdered or shiny, just flawless. He applied MAC’s new mineralized blush to give a look of “faces on a cold winter day” and used a rose lip color that was high glossy in finish and yet not at all frosty. He used MAC’s #20 lashes along with Royal Winkd fluidline to make the eyes really pop. ALEXANDRE HERCHCOVITCH | “Think Bauhaus and pop art,” Philppe Chansel said as he described his inspiration for the looks of the show. He used bright pops of colors in various uses from blue to green or pink or orange from MAC Chromacakes. They were created in dome shapes with black liner and false lashes. He went for a beigey pink gloss on the lips and natural cheeks. COSTELLO TAGLIAPIETRA | Makeup artist Kabuki was responsible for the makeup seen at the show, where he layered burgundy, pink, and beige pigments to give faces a romantic appeal. “Think Mary Shelley and Frankenstein,” he described as influences. “She’s a little bit witch, a haunted woman straight out of the 19th century romanticism.” She used MAC’s Burnt Burgundy paint stick around the eyes with Taupe over it and adding a coat of gloss.

"['Chanel Aqualumiere Gloss for Holiday 2009 – Canari, Colibri, Hirondelle – Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Oct 20, 2009 October 20, 2009 Chanel Aqualumiere Gloss: Canari, Colibri, Hirondelle Chanel Aqualumiere Gloss ($27.00) will see an addition of three new, limited edition shades as part of Chanel’s Holiday Collection . The shades include Canari , which is a peachy-melon with golden-peach shimmer; Colibri , which is a shimmery champagne with iridescent shimmer; and Hirondelle , which is a medium pink with pink and gold shimmer. All three Aqualumiere Glosses appearing with the holiday collection are very sheer shades. They pack pretty shimmer, but they don’t add much in the way of color. Canari goes on as a golden shimmer, which is pretty and definitely holiday-esque–I’d probably layer it over a red for a little extra glitz. Colibri makes my lips appear cooler and paler with iridescent silvery white shimmer. It actually reminds me a bit of MAC’s She-Zam Dazzleglass , but with a little more of a pinkish tone to it. Surprisingly, Hirondelle adds the most color to lips, and it appears as a soft, slightly milky pink with pink shimmer. Aqualumiere Glosses are sheer, ultra glossy, and non-sticky. It comes with a brush-tipped applicator which makes for fairly easy application. I’m easygoing when it comes to gloss applicators – doe foot or brush, it’s all good! They’re not the most long-lasting lipgloss (I certainly wouldn’t dub them long-wearing) – I get about three hours of wear when I layer one on by itself. Over a lipstick, I do get better results (four to five hours overall for the average pairing). I still prefer some of the earlier released shades of Aqualumiere Glosses–I remember being really jazzed over them initially–but these new shades for holiday are a little too sheer for my liking. I’d suggest checking out permanent shades like Candy Glow and Ginger Shimmer instead. Bottom Line: Aqualumiere Glosses are, by their nature, sheer, so I’m not going to knock a bunch of points off on that account. These shades just aren’t to my particular taste, but if you like non-sticky, ultra glossy lipgloss, then Aqualumiere Glosses are always a good bet–just as long as you’re in the market for something on the sheerer side. Product : 24/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : If you’re a fan of the feel and texture of Chanel’s Aqualumiere Glosses, you might want to peep the new shades.

DKNY | Charlotte Tilbury opts to go for a fresh, wide-eyed kind of look. She used MAC’s to-be-launched mascara for dazzling lashes, while the lips were a mixture of Lush and Rapturous mattene lipsticks. Cheeks were sculpted and painted a soft pink. PREEN | James Kaliardos went for a colorface that is reminscent of Kim Basinger in “Nine and a Half Weeks.” He created a grey, taupe rounded eye using regular powder shadows in combination with cream shadows, and he contrasted it with a red lip. It wasn’t a scarlet or blood red, but more like a blue based red that borderlines fuchsia with a touch of gold opalescence. TULEH | Polly Osmond thought of Charlotte Rampling in the 70s for inspiration, which meant a shiny metallic eye that dominated. She used bronze pigment on the eye with a chocolate shadow in the crease. Emote blush was used to shade and sculpt the cheeks. Polly went for tofee lips using 4N lipstick with 2N lipglass. JOHNATHAN SAUNDERS | Val Garland mixed and layered warm wine tones; claret, tawny port, merlot — and even a little champagne — to add to the list of fall 2008 faces that are romantic, flushed, wind-touched, with both matte and shiny elements. She calls it “sexy texy.” Check out more photos…']",b44aa3c2e680becb45135014948f7a3e689d8105,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/new-york-fashion-week-fall-2008-backstage-with-mac-at-herve-leger-dkny-preen-tuleh-johnathan-saunders/,['2008-02-04 00:00:00']

"['Tutorial – How To Apply Red Lips, Holiday Makeup zArchived Nov 04, 2007 November 04, 2007 This tutorial is designed to walk you through, step-by-step, how to create those crisp, red lips. Skill Level : Beginner Lips : Viva Glam I lipstick (any matte red lipstick will do) Tools : MAC 316 lip brush, MAC 194 concealer brush Start with bare lips. (Mine have a touch of foundation from applying it to my face, but this is not an issue, as you’ll see in the next step.) Using the 194, apply a layer of foundation all over your lips. Alternatively, you could use Urban Decay’s Primer Potion or MAC’s Lip Erase (PRO product). The purpose is to neutralize your lips and reduce pigmentation and undertones. Your lips should resemble something like this. Using the 316, pick up a generous amount of Viva Glam I lipstick and begin applying it to the bow of your lip. Using the 316, you want to line your lips with the lipstick itself, before applying it all over the lips. Alternatively, you could use a matching lip liner (Red Enriched cremestick liner is my recommendation) to get a cleaner line or for added bleed prevention if your lips have a tendency to bleed. This is how your upper lip should appear. Now, utilize the same technique to line the bottom of your lower lip. Since we are using the same lipstick to fill in the lips, perfection is not key! It doesn’t have to be an exact line. It’s time to fill in your lips. Keep brushing the 316 against the lipstick itself and then apply the color generously to your bottom and upper lips. Keep repeating the process until you get to the desired level of redness. It will start off as a light to medium pink and get darker, eventually to the truest red that you see from the lipstick itself. After several applications, your lips should have a color like this. Fix any imperfections by slowly going over the edges of your lips. If you find yourself with a few bits that are outside the lines, there are two ways to remove it. One, use a cotton swab with a touch of make remover, and erase the flaws. Two, use foundation or concealer to go over the flaws. Either way will usually accomplish what you need, but if there is a significant stray red mark, makeup remover is the better option. Here is the final version. Plushy red lips!']",baf505710816d772c2531f28c99985017a6a2aa3,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tutorial-how-to-apply-red-lips-holiday-makeup/,['2007-11-04 00:00:00']
"['Chanel Bird of Paradise Eyeshadow Quad Sample Reviews Oct 07, 2009 October 07, 2009 Chanel Bird of Paradise Eyeshadow Quad Chanel Bird of Paradise Eyeshadow Quad ($56.00) is a new, limited edition, colorful palette that’s part of Chanel’s Holiday Collection . It includes four pops of color, which is a surprising twist on what we typically expect from holiday launches. Genius, perhaps? We’ll see… The shades included in the palette are: A paled down blue-teal with green-teal shimmer. I love the mix of a blue-teal colored base with green-teal shimmer. The color is muted without being boring; it still packs a punch of color, but it’s not over the top. It’s kind of what I’d expect from a teal by Chanel. It’s pigmented, silky soft, and blends easily. A warm pop of goldenrod yellow-gold. This is an interesting color, because I think on cooler tones, the yellow is going to come out to play more, whilst on warmer tones, you’re going to get more of a warmer, golden shade. Also, I noticed that it seemed to warm up and cool done depending on the lighting situation (less light = more yellow; brighter light = more golden). This one wasn’t quite as pigmented or smooth as the other three shades, but it was still soft and the shimmer wasn’t too gritty. I really love the shade itself, though, because it’s not a true gold, yet it’s not orange or yellow. A muted coppery-orange with golden shimmer and sheen. Orange can be a tough color to pull off, particularly for those who naturally have cooler complexions (because many oranges run very warm), so I know some just skip this color altogether. This is a great shade of orange that runs neutral-warm, which means it has some warmth, but it’s not overly so. It’s also not a straight copper. I love how the golden sheen catches light. A soft olive green with golden olive shimmer. A lovely shade that actually reminds me more of fall than it does winter, but nevertheless, still nice. Pigmentation is true and the shade itself feels smooth to the touch and goes on like butter. I’m really digging Chanel’s take on holiday this year. The colors are fun and playful, but they’re not hard to wear or even pair together (I was a little weary at first – so much color, could they work together? but alas, they can!). The only shade it’s really missing is a highlight shade, so you will have to tap into your stash to get that, but at least you get four rockin’ colors in it. Each has a metallic shimmer sheen, and I think that’s exactly what the holiday season is about–lots of glitz and glam! This eyeshadow quad is eons better than Chanel’s Les Folie Noirs Eyeshadow Quad — so I am quite pleased. I was a bit hesitant that this one might not do it for me, but it worked out, thankfully! As far as value goes, I do believe Chanel quads are around 0.24 oz. (I have some that say 0.24 oz., others that don’t say, and the recent Noirs Obscurs quad was 0.21 oz.), so they’re not a bad deal by the ounce (less than MAC eyeshadows). With colors like these, you may find yourself slower to get through each shade as well, so I think you’ll get plenty of usage out of the palette. Bottom line: This is a nice palette with quality eyeshadows that give you color to play around with, but it’s not intimidating. It’s inviting, and I think it’s a good mix of colors that can also work together, not just by themselves. It’s also not overly warm or cool on the whole, so it’s more universal. I really like it, overall, but I’m not head-over-heels for it like I am over their Rouge Allure Laques. Product : 27/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : For a downplayed approach to color, Chanel’s Bird of Paradise eyeshadow quad is stop that might be worth your while.

"['New York Fashion Week Fall 2008 – The Adventures of Temptalia in NYC zArchived Feb 04, 2008 February 04, 2008 GREETINGS EVERYONE! I just got back, and I’m recovering in California after spending a couple of days in New York City for Fashion Week extraganza. I did manage to write a few detailed posts while away, but I thought I would do a bit of a “recap” kind of post and just walk you through what I did from beginning to end. THE BEAUTY BLOGGERS I met had to be a definite highlight of the trip, because they are truly a group of independent, incredibly intelligent, and interesting women. There just isn’t a boring one in the bunch; everyone is beyond successful in their lives, whether it is with an envy-inspiring career or an amazing family. I had a chance to chat with Shannon from A Girl’s Gotta Spa , Michelle from All Lacquered Up , and Lianne from The Makeup Girl Blog because they all sat right by me. I also was able to gawk (seriously, she’s so gorgeous!) at Kristen from Beauty Addict (and talk with her a bit), and exchange beauty blabber with a whole slew of other bloggers who attended. I attended a dinner hosted by MAC Cosmetics on Saturday evening at Indochine , and I saw some familiar faces from the night before. I got a chance to figure out that Amber from Beauty Blogging Junkie is a prettier Kate Hudson (seriously, they could be twins), talk shop and everything else under the sun with Amy Focazio (who works with print media for MAC) who is so fab and FUN, as well as with Henna from Canadian Beauty and Jen from DeLush . I saw my girl Heather Park (who handles online media for MAC), not to mention Victor Cembellin (MAC Senior Artist). After dinner, I caught up with Erika from Makeup Bag , Julia from All About the Pretty , and Daneen from Spoiled Pretty before heading up to chit-chat with Teri from Aging Fabulous , Christina from eBeautyDaily , Elke from The Beauty Blog Network , and Shannon. Loved them all! NEW YORK CITY was surprisingly better than I thought. I say this because I really am not a city girl; I love the suburbs, and I love driving everywhere. I only just took my first mode of public transportation two years ago in D.C. (subway there), so I really am quite spoiled. I can definitely see why people love the city, though, because it would be tough to get bored for long in a place as busy and active as NYC. It’s not a place I would want to live in, but there is a certain appeal it has even to those who thought they would loathe it! FASHION WEEK was an amazing experience, and I’m glad I was able to go to it. It is truly an event that has something for everyone with the celebrity sightings, barrage of events, dinners to go to, runway shows, and backstage opportunities–there’s no shortage of entertainment. I’m really happy that I didn’t cram my days with shows and events, though, because it gave me a chance to see and do things throughout without being stressed or fearful I would miss my next scheduled appointment, you know? It felt sort of low-key, and I think that was a good way to go as a first-timer. I also really loved to watch the makeup artists in their element, prepping and priming faces, painting them, and perfecting them. I found it all quite exciting to just watch, let alone interact with the artists by asking them questions. Get a minute-by-minute run down of my three days in NYC, just DAY 1 5:30am : Left the apartment to catch a 6:55am flight to LAX (Los Angeles) and then onto JFK (New York). 8:00am : Arrived in LAX yawning and hungry! 9:30am : Finished boarding my flight to LAX only to have captain come on and inform us all that we are stuck waiting in the plane until 10:50am because of poor weather conditions at JFK. 11:00am : Finally take off — yay, Temptalia is totally on her way to New York now! 7:00pm : (For reference, times are now EST!) Captain informs us we are 75 miles away from JFK, but again, terrible weather rains [literally] on my parade. We get told to “hold” for the next two hours. 9:00pm : Land at JFK, rush out (thanks to carrying on and no checking in bags!), grab a private car to take me into Manhattan. 9:35pm : Arrive at hotel, whereupon I find out that the key that was left for me is missing–and everybody is attending the Project Runway show (I was supposed to see this, too, but thanks to weather delays, nope, nada!). Luckily, I was able to contact someone about ten minutes later. 9:50pm : Dash into room (and marvel at how fast the elevator takes me from the lobby to the 18th floor–the elevator at my school’s parking garage doesn’t even respond in the same time span), throw open the suitcase, and get dressed. I had worn jeans to be comfortable on the flight, and I needed to get a little dressier. I did five-minute makeup and proceeded to run–not walk–out of my room. 9:58pm : Ask the doorman where Bryant Park Hotel is, he shows me, and thankfully it’s literally a 45 second walk from my hotel. 10:00pm : Arrive at Koi restaurant (located in Bryant Park Hotel), just in time for a dinner sponsored by Aveda and Total Beauty . Sat down and met a whole gaggle of my fellow beauty bloggers! It felt kind of awkward because I think a lot more people had an inkling who I was and what blog I ran whereas I couldn’t recognize more than a few faces. 2:00am : Head back to the hotel with a few of my beauty bloggers. Totally drooled over a gift bag I received from Aveda, as well as a Total Beauty one. 2:15am : Do some quick checking of e-mail to ensure I didn’t miss any crises while being airborne for the majority of the day (and thankfully, all bad news averted!). 3:00am : Finally snuggle up into bed. Day 2 9:00am: Wake up from having passed out at 3am and proceed to check some email, putz around the internet. 10:00am : Take a shower, get dressed, and put on makeup for the day. 11:30am : Head over to the tents to check out what was going on, see what people were doing. 12:20pm : Check in for backstage access at the Mara Hoffman show and luckily get let in (somehow, my name was missing from the list, but they gave me a pass anyway). 12:30pm : Talk with Christopher D. and Victor C., both senior MAC makeup artists, as they ready models’ faces for the runway. 12:45pm : Step back from the artists and just watch all the hustle and bustle of backstage. 1:00pm : Head back to the hotel to do some Fashion Week blogging! 2:20pm : Took a taxi down to MAC’s NYC PRO store for the meet and greet with readers. I ended up seeing about five or six readers while I was there. 5:15pm : Left MAC PRO and started walking towards the hotel, looking for a taxi, but not finding one. Of course, I walked the wrong way (went to Park Avenue instead of 6th), and I didn’t manage to find a taxi until I hit 30th Street (I was at 22nd). My feet now have several blisters, because while I broke them in and can stand and wear them all day, I did not intend to walk quite so much all at once in them. Oops! 5:30pm : Got back to my hotel only to find that there was a bunch of police tape that said “police line do not cross” wrapped around the hotel lobby and sidewalk in front of it. Apparently there was some sort of scuffle, and the police were investigating the whole thing (including fingerprinting). 5:45pm : Spent some time on the internet, blogging and prepping posts/emails. 6:30pm : Headed out to go to a dinner sponsored by MAC Cosmetics at Indochine. 7:00pm : Arrived for dinner at Indochine, which, I swear, has models as waiters/waitresses. Seriously, every single woman was incredibly tall and skinny–and gorgeous! 11:00pm : We were kicked out of the restaurant, and I took a cab home with a few other bloggers. 11:30pm : I hung out with a few of my fellow beauty bloggers for a bit, talking shop, listening to Julia tell hilarious stories about the trials of having African American hair. 12:30am : Went up to Teri, Christina, and Shannon’s room (they were two floors below mine), and then we headed to the hotel lounge and hang out some more. 2:00am : I headed back to my room, checked some email, and worked a bit on my review. 3:00am : Conked out! Day 3 9:00am: Woke up, immediately started working on my Fafi review, and managed to finish it (yay!). 11:00am : Showered (can I just say I love those elephant showerheads? Awesome!), got ready. 12:00pm : Headed down to Bryant Park Grill for lunch with Megan from Clinique. 1:30pm : Went back to the hotel, changed clothes, and then went back down to go to FedEx to ship some of the things I received in goody bags. I learned that you cannot ship bottles of wine unless you are licensed! 2:00pm : Returned to the hotel, packed my bags, and managed to get everything done in time. 2:30pm : Caught a taxi to LGA to start my return journey. Unfortunately, I couldn’t change my originaly flight out on Monday morning to go through any other city than Chicago because the flights were full. Weather in NY was supposed to be subpar on Monday, as well as reasonably poor (thunderstorms) in Dallas, so I decided to head home when I knew I could make it home rather than risk getting stuck in an airport all day Monday. 7:30pm : Arrived in DFW airport, milled about, scarfed down some Taco Bell express (why does bad food taste so good?). 10:00pm : Arrived back to SJC airport, waited around for baggage, and my boyfriend to pick me up. 11:00pm : Home at last! * I was supposed to stay all day Sunday, including going backstage at both Tuleh and Terexov shows. I was really disappointed I wasn’t able to make them, but at the same time, I needed to be back before 2pm on Monday for class, so it just wasn’t meant to be!']",6564fcf62dd2c7c36da3139f2155b3e09740a670,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/new-york-fashion-week-fall-2008-the-adventures-of-temptalia-in-nyc/,['2008-02-04 00:00:00']

( Be sure to check out reviews on the limited edition nail polishes and lipsticks , too!) It’s a limited edition eyeshadow quad with each shade being embellished with the brand’s signature logo in black. While I was impressed by the new Rouge Allure lipsticks and Le Vernis shades, the eyeshadow quad was a disappointment. In fact, I had to let my disappointment simmer a bit in case I was too harsh/expected too much. I do not recommend this eyeshadow quad unless you’re a Chanel collector–then you’re not really looking to use it so much as own it as a collector. If you actually want to use it, the shades are poorly pigmented, go on unevenly, and just overall, look mediocre–even with a sponge applicator. (Swatching with a brush always gives the least amount of pigmentation, whereas swatching with a sponge applicator usually yields the most.) The swatches included in this post are with a sponge applicator, for your reference. The dark brown shade (top left) goes on extremely sheerly and almost looks chalky on my skin. The color itself is a cool-toned dark brown. Next to it is a dark forest green with a slight bit of shimmer. This one swatched better and had so-so pigmentation (just not quite as intense as I’d like). On the bottom right, there’s a muted, dark navy blue with subtle navy shimmer. This also swatched decently, though not quite as well as the green. The last shade is a slightly warmed-up medium chocolate brown that isn’t as sheer as the other brown in the quad, but it’s still quite faded when swatched. Ultimately, if you use a sponge applicator (or even use this product wet) and layer on the color–and I do mean layer –you may find this works well for a range of smoky eyes. For me, at the price tag, I expect well-pigmented eyeshadows that feel soft, silky, and require minimal effort to work into my eyeshadow wardrobe. Chanel, I love you, but this one is a miss for me! Product : 16/30 Value : 6/10 Ease of Use : 3/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : Skip this — opt for a permanent Chanel eyeshadow quad if you’re in the market for eyeshadow or else sneak a peek at the limited edition Rouge Allure Lipsticks!

"['Malie Kauai – Body Cream in Koke’e and Rescue Tonic Reviews Reviews Nov 05, 2007 November 05, 2007 From the lush, tropical rainforests and rich volcanic soil of the ancient Garden Island of Kauai, we’ve created Malie (mah-lee-ay), luxurious natural products for home, body and spirit. The gentle, soothing essences of our wild-crafted and organic ingredients flow through pure Hawaiian hydrosols, the therapeutic floral waters that infuse each product. Immerse yourself in the tranquil beauty of Hawaiian aromatherapy – our gift from the Garden Isle of Eternal Rainbows. Aloha. Malie Kauai is a brand devoted to promoting and utilizing its Hawaiian Roots on the Garden Isle of Kauai by using only indigenous flora for their natural luxury spa products. They ensure sustainable growth of all ingredients they choose for their indulgent products. They even use local artisans to create their products. This line is truly about bringing you the best in natural products, and they make sure to provide you detailed information about the ingredients they use, how they use, and which ones are in the products you love. To find out what I thought of their Body Cream and Rescue Tonic, I recently tried out Malie Kauai’s Body Cream in Koke’e , which is their newest arom. Koke’e is the organic essence of Kaua’i’s ancient Koke’e rainforest. Malie will make a donation of a portion of its sales of Koke’e products towards the rainforest conservation program. Koke’e is described as a “magical scient that lingers in the air after a sun shower or in a hidden canyon where a gentle waterfall reveals itself after a long, delicious hike.” I’m inclined to agree! I found myself feeling as if I was inhaling the subtle scent of something tropical with a touch of freshness, lightness. This is not the potent smell of other “Hawaii-inspired” scents; it is truly a subtle scent that lingers. I really was reminded of languid days spent lazing around in Hawaii, and the imagery immediately relaxed me. I also had the opportunity to try out their Rescue Tonic in Lilkoi Lemongrass , which is meant to eliminate mid-day oily skin by rejuvenating the skin without washing. They also offer three other tonics (Renew, Purify, and Beautify). Those familiar with the art of facial tonics and sprays will find this one refreshing. Spritz Rescue once or twice to hydrate your face and give you that “clean” feeling in half the time. Sometimes I get that “oily face” feeling during the day, and this helps me feel refreshed! There is a very light scent to it, which is mostly just something organic and natural, very clean smelling.

We were served several courses that came out appetizer-style/family-style, in the sense that you picked what you wanted from a main plate, as compared to having your own individual plate. Koi is an upscale Japanese restaurant with flare and originality. I met numerous other bloggers from the beauty sphere, which was really great as I could put names and faces to blogs. I sat near Shannon from A Girl’s Gotta Spa , Michelle from All Lacquered Up , and Lianne from The Makeup Girl Blog . They were all such great company!

Finally, she dotted black pigment on the center of the lower lip for a “bitten effect.” She then used the same burgundy base to smudge onto cheeks and finished with a flourish of mascara. “It’s all about a strong mouth. It’s sophisticated, but playful at the same time,” says Diane Kendal. Look breakdown | MAC Studio Tech Foundation was applied where needed for fresh, moisturized skin. Burgundy Paintstick was blended onto the apples of the cheeks with fingers. A small about of MAC Fluidline in Blacktrack was applied to the lash line with Brush 210. Eye lashes were curled and coated with Plush Lash Mascara in Black – heavy on the top lashes and light on the bottom lashes. A mixture of MAC Lip Pencils in Nightmoth and Chestnut were sheared out on the lips and Media Lipstick was layered over. A touch of MAC Créme Colour Base in Black was blended into the center of the lips with Brush 316. MALADRINO | Tom Pecheux went with green eyes to keep with the show’s theme of green and organic. He used a dark green, lime green, and moss green to create a rounded eye up to the crease of the eye. The models had bare cheeks and a matte nude lip that was created by MAC’s Lip Erase that Pecheux described as “it’s like a concealer and lipstick in one.” “Very organic. Very green. Reminiscent of leaves,” says Tom Pecheux. Look breakdown | For very matte skin, MAC Studio Fix Fluid was applied to the face, followed by Blot Powder Loose. Using MAC Brush 224, Bitter Eye Shadow was applied very lightly all over lids and softly in the crease. Velvet Moss Eye Shadow was brushed onto the lower lash line, followed by Tealo Powerpoint Eye Pencil layered gently over lower lash line. Using MAC Brush 224, Bitter Eye Shadow was applied very lightly all over lids and softly in the crease. Velvet Moss Eye Shadow was brushed onto the lower lash line, followed by Tealo Powerpoint Eye Pencil layered gently over lower lash line. Lips were conditioned with Lip Conditioner to help with texture, followed by Lip Erase. LUCA LUCA | Again, Tom Pecheux created a look that represented the Luca Luca lady who is “cash–and sass,” so he opted for gold on the lid and crease. The lips were a sheer coral so keep the emphasis on the eyes with everything else more understated. “Sophisticated glam rock,” says Tom Pecheux. Look Breakdown | MAC Studio Fix Fluid was applied where needed on the face, followed by Select Sheer Loose Powder. MAC Carbon and Ground Brown Eye Shadows were blended from lash line to just above the crease for a smoky eye. Satin Taupe Eye Shadow was placed in the corners of the eyes brushed out and up towards the brows with Brush 224. MAC 7 Lashes were applied, followed by MAC PRO Lash in Black. A sheer lip was created with applying MAC Lust is Lush Lipgelee. PORTS 1961 | Isabelle LaPage created a look that represented the pink skin of a Scottish girl, only she went with played down lips using burgundy pigmented mixed with MAC’s Matte Gel. She kept eyes glossy with high shine by using a berry lip gelee. She placed clear plastic pieces on top, “so it was little like a cherry popsicle highlighted the eyes.” For more beauty shots, Carolina Herrera Luca Luca Images: Style.com ; Breakdowns: MAC']",de1185d172bab527f418012e695c40e7d3a32f2d,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/new-york-fashion-week-fall-2008-backstage-beauty-with-mac-at-carolina-herrera-maladrino-luca-luca-ports-1961/,['2008-02-05 00:00:00']
"['Beauty Tips: How to Line Your Lower Lash Line Sep 03, 2009 September 03, 2009 Tips & Tricks: How to Line Your Lower Lash Line When it comes to lining your lash line, do you often get lost on the who, what, when, where, and why of it all? Here are some of my favorite tips and tricks to make lining the lower lash line a breeze. When using gel liners… I find using a more traditional pencil liner to an extremely effective tool for applying the gel liner itself to the lower lash line. What I do is I take a similar colored pencil liner and dip the tip into the gel liner. I then apply it to the lower lash line (or water line). This is especially useful when lining the water line, too, because I know my water line is far too sensitive to endure using a brush! Prevent smudging and migration… by setting any and all liners with powder. You could certainly try translucent powder (e.g. MAC Transparent Finishing Powder), or you can use a similar colored eyeshadow. I’d apply it sparingly and lightly using a very thin or pointed brush so you don’t smudge your liner too much. Prevent smudging and migration, part deux… by using a concealer or primer base first on the lower lash line. This is only going to work with skin-colored bases (and I mean, your skin), which is why concealers tend to be the go-to, but if your skin tone matches your eyeshadow primer/base, that will work just fine. Apply sparingly, because you don’t want too much product in that area–too much will cause it to sink into fine lines and end up creasing. Just like with eyeshadow, a good base for liner helps to keep it in place. Softer is better… you want a soft, smooth, near-creamy product for the lower lash line (or the upper lash line, for that matter). Gone are the days where we have to suffer through stiff, tough liners that drag and tug at our eyes. No one needs to settle for that! If your eyeliner is tough, try heating it up for a few seconds under a blow dryer, but if that fails to help, toss it and invest in softer liners. My picks are Make Up For Ever Aqua Eyes and Urban Decay 24/7 Pencils. You don’t have to go all the way… you don’t have to line your entire lower lash line. It may not be to your liking or taste, or you may find your eyes are more open by just lining the outer third of the lash line. There are no hard and fast rules about how much or how little you need to line–the best way to figure out what works for you (particularly in discovering what you like best on yourself) is experimenting. What are your tips & tricks on lining the lower lash line?']",36886bf32cd65a51f0a800aabce0c4869f82f661,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/beauty-tips-how-to-line-your-lower-lash-line/,['2009-09-03 00:00:00']

"['NARS Cosmetics – Holiday 2007 Siren Song Review Reviews Nov 05, 2007 November 05, 2007 It is not often that I am so powerfully swayed by a product that isn’t MAC right from the get go. I tend to need a bit of coaxing, a bit more temptation to defect from my brand loyalty. Of course, I have several beauty products that I consider staples that are outside of MAC’s scope, so it is not an impossible task, but only the best are up to the challenge. NARS is finding a way back into my heart with their Holiday 2007 collection Siren Song , which features this stunning eyeshadow duo in Balthazar (along with Cheyenne and Violetta ). I was immediately drawn to the vibrancy of the duo, especially of the tarnished gold. One swipe, and I was in heaven! I am not as in love with the brown (it is more easily duplicated), but it is an excellent partner for the gold shadow. This is just such an awesome combination for the upcoming holiday season, where golds and bronzes often reign supreme. To hear me gush more about one of my favorite holiday collections out this year, you’ll have to The three luxurious items pictured above are my other three favorites from the launch: Virdiana lipstick, Cheyenne eyeshadow duo, and Saratoga nail polish . Virdiana is a rich burgundy, a touch vampy, and yet perfect for alluring holiday pouts. Imagine a touch of gold on the lid from Balthazar, perhaps a semi-matte or matte warm brown in the crease, and lips the shade of deep crimson. Oh, glory! Saratoga is an obvious pick, because I adore raspberry reds for nail polishes (Chanel’s Tulipe Noir is a favorite). Cheyenne is almost like a more toned done version of Balthazar, and just such a classy duo. I am such a sucker for anything gold, aren’t I? You’ll also find items to tempt yourself with in Rose Gitane lip gloss, Luster blush (ohh, I imagine a slight glowy, bronzy look–perfect for winter cheeks), Night Snow and Night Rider single eyeshadows, Bad Education lip gloss, and Metis/Victoire, Turkish Delight/Sayonara, Sand Piper/Daredevil, Moon Fleet/Indian Red lip gloss/lipstain duos. If only I had unlimited funds, I would dive right into Cheyenne, Saratoga, Luster, Moon Fleet/Indian Red. Instead, I am trying to be content with my Balthazar duo, and I hope I can resist temptation!

"['New York Fashion Week Fall 2008 – Mara Hoffman Backstage Beauty and Makeup zArchived Feb 02, 2008 February 02, 2008 Hey everyone! It’s Temptalia live from New York City, haha! SO, I just got back from backstage at Mara Hoffman, and I have sometime to post, so of course, I must! Above, that’s me on the left (duh) with MAC senior artist Victor Cembellin (who we first met back at San Francisco’s Fashion Week last August). He was working at the Mara Hoffman show, and it was so great to see a familiar face there. It really helped put me at ease instantly! Backstage is super busy, and everybody is bustling about, so we weren’t able to stay too long (I didn’t want to hog up the artists’ time or get in the way), but we did manage to talk to Christopher D., a MAC senior artist, about the look he was doing on a model for the show. He told us that it was a Moroccan-inspired look with sun-burnt skin that he created using a rich, coppery red cream colour base on the cheeks with pale, nude lips, which he added a touch of lipgelee for a pop of color and make the nude suit the model’s skin better. He was trying out a new mascara with a gel formula that’s slated for fall release, and he loves it more than Zoomlash and Plushlash. It has a much smaller brush, and it does an excellent job of lengthening and separating without any clumping. He kept the skin fairly natural and matte, with just a bit of dewiness on certain areas of the face to highlight it. Take a peek at some of the other photos I snapped whilst backstage, as I make my way over for the Temptalia Meet&Greet over at MAC PRO in NYC. Hope everybody’s having a great weekend!']",cfcfcf6f2c5aaa219352775280604417a0c2842c,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/new-york-fashion-week-fall-2008-mara-hoffman-backstage-beauty-and-makeup/,['2008-02-02 00:00:00']

"['The Best of Dior Beauty zArchived Sep 03, 2009 September 03, 2009 The Best of the Best: Dior Dior excels at creating (even when you thought you had it covered) staples that you’ll use time and time again. Many of my favorite products to use on a daily basis are dior. Dior can be colorful and bright, but they’re more often subtle and natural–not boring, mind you. Dior Diorskin Shimmer Stars ($43.00) are quite possibly my favorite product by Dior, period. These are subtle highlighters that work well on all skin tones and give that “glowy” appearance without overloading the skin with shimmer. They’re natural and bring out the skin’s own glow. Really, really phenomenal. You can just see how many looks I’ve done with Amber Diamond and Rose Diamond alone. Dior Addict 1.7 oz Eau de Parfum Spray ($72.00) was one of my first fragrances, and it is still one of my more coveted scents. It is a heady scent that works extremely well for evening and formal occasions. Dior Diorskin Nude ($45.00) is a water-based, lightweight light-to-medium coverage foundation that gives skin a flawless and healthy look. You can read my full review for even more reasons why it rocks my world. Dior ‘One Color Extreme’ Eyeshadow ($27.50) are highly pigmented single doses of eyeshadow. Dior is actually coming out with several new shades this fall/winter, so look for them! For now, you can check out the two that came out with the fall collection. Dior Addict Ultra-Gloss Reflect ($25.50) are non-sticky, hydrating lipglosses with a beautiful glossy finish. They come in a variety of shades, and they’re one of Dior’s signature products. Dior 2-Colour Eyeshadow ($35.00) are richly pigmented eyeshadow duos. They’re not quite at the level of the Extreme eyeshadows, but they’re coordinated shades that are worth the investment if it’s in your budget.

"['Holiday Makeup: Gold & Greens Looks Dec 03, 2009 December 03, 2009 Hey, Ma! I did a look! So it’s been a couple of weeks since the Lady Gaga inspired look which totally wreaked havoc on my eyes, but my eyes seem to be recovered now. (They were swollen for a few days, and then they proceeded to just be itchy/red and consequently dry and flaky afterward. You know, generally unpleasant.) I thought I’d try to do something holiday-esque, but maybe not the most typical holiday look (err… at least, my typical holiday look) of golds, cranberries, and red lips. P.S. – Lashes are looking a little beat-up, because I was testing out a new mascara, wasn’t loving it, tried to layer another mascara over… and yeah, not the best idea. Lesson learned = don’t test new mascara when you’re doing an actual look! You will need the following… Eyes : Soft Ochre paint pot (neutral beige base), Goldmine eyeshadow (true gold), Bio-Green eyeshadow (medium green), Humid eyeshadow (dark green), Bottle Green eyeshadow (dark green-blue), Femme-fi eyeshadow (neutral highlighter), Smashbox Wish Pencil Eyeliner (dark green-blue), Urban Decay Honey 24/7 Liner (gold), too many mascaras (so ignore the lashes, they’re terrible) Face: Kiehl’s Tinted Moisturizer in Medium Cheeks : Dior Coral Riviera blush (coral-pink), Dior Amber Diamond Skin Shimmer (bronzy highlighter) Lips : Guerlain Gems lipstick (coral), Guerlain Perle de Lune lipgloss (pearly beige) Brushes : 266 (firm, angled brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 214 (smudge brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 129 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Femme-fi = Shroom Directions: Define brows using a coordinating powder shadow applied with the 266 brush. Apply Soft Ochre paint pot all over the lid as the base with the 249. On the inner lid, pack Goldmine eyeshadow on using the 239. Apply Bio-Green eyeshadow to the middle and outer portions of the lid. Darken crease with Bottle Green eyeshadow using the 226, then deepen the outer lid with Humid eyeshadow. Sweep Femme-fi eyeshadow underneath the brow bone to highlight. Finish with Urban Decay Honey Liner on lower waterline and Smashbox Wish Pencil Liner on the lower lash line. Apply mascara on lashes. Sweep apples of cheeks with Dior Corial Riviera blush using the 129, then highlight with Dior Amber Diamond Skin Shimmer with the 188. Apply Guerlain Gems lipstick to lips, and then top with Guerlain Perle de Lune lipgloss for color and shine. Check out more photos !

Dynastie is a beautiful shade of fiery coral. It’s not too red or orange–it’s a good mix of bold and bright without being over the top. It has an orange-coral base with a softer peachy-coral shimmer and glossy sheen. It feels like silk on the lips; weightless and just a smidgen creamy when you apply it, and then just long-lasting color for hours. It’s opaque in just one layer (I only need to use whatever is on the applicator; no double-dipping required!) and easy to apply with precision. Being able to apply it with ease and not having to worry about it bleeding or dragging on my lips is such a relief. It just makes this a no-brainer for me. This shade is deep enough for the fall/winter, but it’s still appropriate for a lovely summer coral, too! Since I don’t want to just re-write what I say about the formula (since it is the same–if there are any variations, you can be sure I’ll call them out), here’s a quick bullet-point summary. Pros Satiny, creamy lip color that hydrates Opaque color in one layer–very pigmented Lasts for hours and even through eating/drinking Glossy sheen Looks like a lipstick AND a gloss Easy to travel with Sleek packaging Cons Pricey at $32 each Product : 29/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 5/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : If you love coral lips and want color that lasts for hours and looks gorgeous, try Dynastie!

"['MAC Cosmetics – Curiositease Collection Review, Swatches, and Product images, Photos Reviews Oct 31, 2007 October 31, 2007 Overall , Curiositease is a gorgeously packed opportunity for MAC fans to try out a variety of lipglasses, plushglasses, soft sparkle liners, and pigments without buying them individually at higher prices. I felt like each set had a good mix of colors – some bold, some soft. I loved the stylish packaging of the canvas holders with crown motif emblazoned on the side. If you were wondering what to do with these, they make excellent makeup holders for brushes, liners, mascara, etc. If I had to pick favorites, I’d probably go with the warm lipglass/lustreglass and cool pigment sets. Keep reading for detailed individual color and product reviews, as wella s swatches and product photos! Cool Lipglass/Lustreglass Be Seen is a shimmery white lipglass with lots of glitter particles; it’s obviously going to be incredibly sheer and tone down a bold lipstick. Spirited is a pink-mauve lipglass with pink shimmer, good opacity. It would help to make a great toned down vampy lip when paired with a very rich and dark lipstick. Nymphette is a gorgeous dirty pink with gold pearlized particles. It’s a color I’ve never owned, but always kind of wanted to. It’s in the medium pink family, but it has a touch of “dirtiness” to it. Star Nova is one of loveliest lustreglasses, because it has pretty good opacity, relative to most lustreglasses. It is raspberry hued with pink-purple shimmer. Flash Mode is a bright pink with raspberry undertones and less shimmer than the other items in the set. Warm Lipglass/Lustreglass Expensive is a pale yellow with white-gold shimmer, which is quite pretty. This color makes a great way to add some va-voom to any lipstick. It just manages to alter the lipstick color in such a subtle, but fabulous way. Bada Boom is a gorgeous medium-pink with subtle shimmer gloss. It is fairly opaque, but sheer enough to allow some buildability. Pink Grapefruit is a cult favorite, because it is such an excellent coral gloss. It is a peachy-orange with gold shimmer, and it’s definitely one of my staple glosses for a good coral lip. Beaux is a dirty plum-mauve with multi-colored shimmer in gold and pink-purple. With the shimmer, it takes it from a would-be brown-purple to something gorgeous. Ornamental is another great lustreglass to grab, because it’s such a rich orange with pinkish-purple reflects in it, even some gold shimmer. It always reminds me of the holidays! Plushglass Pretty Plush is an incredibly sheer color (it does not show up as more than a few sparkles and the faintest sheen on me), which makes it a great alternative to add high shine to a lipstick without altering the base color(s). Bountfiul is a frosty cool pink, very shimmery. It might seem a bit “pornstar pink” at first, but the plushglass formula makes all the choices fairly sheer, so it shouldn’t be overwhelming. Pink Luxe has one of my favorite names out of the Curiositease sets, and it’s a hot pink with cool pink reflects. I think people will really love this particular color, because for some reason most of us are drawn to bold, bright glosses! Hot Stuff is a darker medium-pink with subtle shimmer, kind of a dirty pink. I was thinking Hot Stuff and Pink Luxe should switch names, personally. Wet, Wild, & Wonderful is a warm brown with gold reflects, and while it’s not a color I’d immediately grab for, it would definitely ring some bells for darker skin tones. Cool Pigment Set Reflects Blue is a white-based glitter that shows up with a shimmer of white-blue. I personally love Reflects Transparent Teal more, because it has a much finer texture. Helium is a gorgeous cool light pink with purple undertones, and I swear it feels more finely milled than its original version. I wonder if they reformulated it at all, because it went on smoothly, not in chunks. Softwash Grey is a lovely purple-gray color; it’s one of the more unique colors that MAC has put out in pigment form. I truly find this really adds diversity to looks because of the duochrome nature of it. Naval Blue is a deep navy blue with purple undertones. Very winter-esque! Forest Green is a deep, dark green with subtle shimmer. It’s such a great cool color, because it lends itself well to combinations with Femme Noir or Humid for a bit of a brightening touch. Warm Pigment Set Reflects Gold has incredible gold reflects with a dirty base, kind of like antique gold. I liked this one over Reflects Blue, but all the glitters are fun to play around with. Lily White came out almost as a light pink-purple on me, rather than a brighter version than I remember. It might have been the lighting on this one! This also seemed less chunky than the full-size release. Dazzleray is one of my favorite colors, because it is such a great peachy-gold color. It looks good on nearly everyone, in my opinion! Sunpepper is much like Blue-Brown (you don’t need both unless you’re a pigment collector). Reddish brown base with bluish shimmer. Coppersparkle is chunky as ever, but I’ve found this to be one chunky pigment that works well despite its texture. It’s a gorgeous bright copper color with so much shimmer. Those who aren’t a fan of shimmer/frost, steer clear of this one! Softsparkle Pencil Set Nightsky is a faded black with silver glitter. Peacocked is my favorite out of the bunch, because it is medium-teal with silver reflects. Iris Accents is a medium-to-dark purple with silver reflects, but I’ve never found it to be that usable when I do my looks. Reflecto is the pale blue of the collection, again with silver reflects. Goldenair is gorgeous, but harder to use; it is a white-gold with gold reflects. It’s pretty, but I’m not sure where I’d use this besides the waterline, though I’m not positive if the glitter is waterline safe. Each set is $29.50.

"['Smashbox Heartbreaker Jet Black Liquid Liner Pen Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Feb 05, 2010 February 05, 2010 Easy Liquid Lining with Liner Pens: Version Smashbox Smashbox Heartbreaker Jet Black Liquid Liner Pen ($24.00) is a felt-tipped pen that’s designed to look and feel like liquid liner, but with the control and precision that a pen can deliver. The pen is new and limited edition from Smashbox’s Heartbreaker Collection for the spring. It’s actually kind of funny, because it seems like pen liners are the new thing to do, as several brands have put one out for the spring. I remember the first one I ever used was MAC’s Penultimate , which I still use on occasion. I like pen liners because they are easier to use than traditional liquid liners. I think I do personally prefer gel eyeliners for the upper lash line over liquid liners, but I do prefer pen liners over traditional liquid liners. You have a lot more control, and it is nice that the tip is always rich in color–you don’t have to worry about running out or product drying on you mid-lining. Smashbox’s Liquid Liner Pen comes in just one shade, Jet Black , which is a rich black. It’s pretty intense and does go on as a slightly shiny black. I’ve noticed that a lot of black liquid liners seem to reflect more brown-black when swatched, but they really do appear quite black in real life–the same thing happened here. I urge you to check it out where I wore it in this look (on the right eye–your right, not mine–the left eye was done with Stila’s Pen Liner !) If you like extremely tight/thin lines, I don’t think this is your best bet. It can give you a relatively thin line, but I had trouble getting and keeping it ultra thin. The tip is long enough to give you a nice, broad stroke, but it’s not so long that you lose control over the shape and direction of your line (nor does it kind of bend too much). This does have a very “liquid” feel when you use it, so don’t go over the line too much — once or twice should be plenty. This liquid liner does last a solid eight hours or longer on me (I avoid wearing my makeup for longer than eight hours a day!) and doesn’t fade, smudge, or migrate whatsoever while I’ve worn it. It’s housed in a simple pen-shaped tube with a removeable cap that clicks back on. It’s very minimalist, but it’s slim and functional. The price tag seems a little higher than I’d have expected (Jet Set and Cream Eye Liner by Smashbox are both $22), but it’s not too out of the price range for Smashbox liners. The other downside is that this is a product that could become a staple in your routine, but it’s limited edition!

"['Smashbox Naked Beauty Lip Gloss Collection Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jun 14, 2010 June 14, 2010 Truly Barely There Lip Gloss with Smashbox Smashbox Naked Beauty Lip Gloss Collection ($25.00 for 8 x 0.04 oz.) includes eight shades of sheer, barely-there lip gloss. The lip gloss itself is smooth, not too thin (but not thick), and non-sticky. They last about one to one and half hours on lips for me. This set is part of Smashbox’s summer collection, and I did lip swatches but forgot to write down the order I did them in. Normally, I can figure out which shade is which, but these were all so sheer, most of them were indiscernible from the next. I planned to re-do the lip swatches, but I haven’t gotten around to that yet, and I’d like to at least review it in part before it’s no longer available for sale! (I guess you could say that since these ran so sheer, I was less than enthused at re-doing them.) Buff is a sheer pinky-nude with white shimmer. Sunkissed is a sheer reddish brown with gold shimmer. Exposed is an ultra sheer, milky pink. Bare is an ultra sheer pale, pastel milky pink with iridescent pink shimmer. This looked like clear gloss with very subtle shimmer on my lips. Nude is a sheer, darkened peach-nude with gold shimmer. I found this one brightened up my natural lip color just a smidgen, but it was pretty colorless. Naked is a pale gold with white gold shimmer. Like the other shades, it’s very sheer and looks like a colorless gloss with shimmer on lips. Pure is a sheer watermelon pink. It looks a lot more pigmented in the swatch than it does on lips. What’s nice about this one is the pink does play-up the natural pink tones of your lip color and gives them a juicier look. Natural is a sheer red-coral. Like Pure, it has that juicy look when worn, but the color is very, very hard to distinguish. I think the set is a good value, and if you’re not necessarily a gloss person or you enjoy ultra sheer glosses, it’s worth a look-see. If you like gloss that’s pigmented, or you hate when items are limited edition, it’s not for you. Each lip gloss is pretty small (I’d guesstimate at 4-6 uses per container), but I didn’t see any of these show up in Smashbox’s permanent lip gloss ranges. Once you’re out, you’re out! They’re very travel-friendly, though, since their compact size makes them easy to toss anywhere without taking up much room at all. ( Knowing me, I would easily lose these and find them in the couch! ) They definitely represent the theme of “Naked Beauty” quite well–they range from the ultra sheer to the sheer. Some have jelly-like appearances where there is no real shimmer, while other shades look frostier on lips. They all have a great glossy shine, though. I want to reiterate that Smashbox fully intended for these to be very sheer–they’re described as “barely there shades”–and they did exactly that. It’s not my cup of tea, but the product delivers exactly what it sets out to do. I do wish that they’d varied up the shimmer more in the gloss — at least so the effect would be different, even if they didn’t add much color.

It contains four shades of eyeshadow: a pale, silvery-white; a medium-dark matte black; a mauve-tinged silver; and a subdued, cool-toned dark brown. Like Dazzling , the Champagne consists of smooth, well-pigmented eyeshadows that feel like buttery goodness to the touch. They apply easily and softly, and they never look garish. They blend seamlessly together, and they work well with all of your favorite eyeshadow bases. They also still blend well when used with other brand eyeshadows. One of things I like about the Dolce & Gabbana quads I’ve tried so far is that the colors go on as they’re pictured. They’re apply and swatch true-to-color, so there is a whole lot less guesswork to be done. I can also appreciate the “honesty” of the palette in that sense, too. Champagne, in particular, works well together, because the shades are diverse enough to create gradients, but they can be worn in pairs of triplets. For those who find the price a bit steep, D&G is priced competitively with other major high-end brands like Chanel ($56), Dior ($56), and Guerlain ($58). The packaging is hefty and looks like gold (though it does hold fingerprints). It’s sleek and elegant, so it does look lovely when you hold it. If it didn’t hold fingerprints, the packaging would definitely help sway me even more.

"['Korres Thyme Honey Cream Review, Photos Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Oct 01, 2009 October 01, 2009 Korres Thyme Honey Cream ($32.50 for 1.35 oz.) is a daily moisturizer designed for normal and dry skin. Korres is known as a brand that doesn’t use a lot of those “bad” ingredients like parabens, suflates, petro-chemcials, and synthetic dyes. My personal stance is I’m not overly concerned by them, as research hasn’t proven otherwise (at least not to me) — one of my favorite beauty blogs, The Beauty Brains, did a write-up on parabens . So for me, a “natural” product just has to be a good product for me, but I’m not looking for anything explicitly natural. (It’s totally fine if you are, though! To each their own! ? ) This is a medium thick cream that comes in a jar, but it actually feels lightweight and absorbs very quickly. I went through my entire jar in about four or five weeks. It definitely felt a little faster than normal (normally I’ve spent the requisite four to six weeks testing it out, and then I move on and there’s still plenty left). To be clear, though, I was using this both AM and PM and typically I do have a separate AM and PM moisturizer. I’d expect if you just use this as a PM moisturizer, you’d get about two to three months of use out of one jar. This doesn’t have any SPF, which does make it usable at night (without feeling like you’re wasting the SPF factor!), but consequently, you do need to wear something else that does have SPF. I found it moisturized my normal-to-dry skin very well, and I never felt dry or had any dry patches creep on me. I will caution some on the scent, which is kind of like an earthy honey scent. It didn’t read synthetic honey to me, but it’s noticeable when you first apply it. I personally didn’t notice the scent linger on after it absorbed, but if you’re not a honey person, I’d recommend you choose one of Korres’ other moisturizers. I liked the scent, though I didn’t love it, but it wasn’t an issue for my nose! Even though Korres does recommend this for normal skin, I think it’s more suited for those with drier skin, because it is quite hydrating and rich enough to soothe drier skin, it may be too heavy on normal skin. I wouldn’t recommend this one for oily skinned folks, either. If you have normal skin but sometimes need an extra boost in hydration, I’d suggest checking out Korres Thyme Honey Mask instead, as an as-needed intensive treatment. I’m not a big fan of open-jar packaging. I’m just not keen on using fingers to scoop out product (let’s face it, most of us are not vigilant enough about using a separate, sterile spatula every time we go to moisturize), so I’d rather an airless pump in some form myself. The packaging feels nice (I think it’s glass) and has some heft to it, and the way Korres’ labels their products is cute and functional. Overall, after using this for over a month (’til I ran out), I liked it, but I’m still on the hunt for something else. I don’t typically use up whole jars of anything, so it is a testament to how much I did enjoy using the product while it lasted. It moisturized and kept my skin moisturized throughout the day without causing breakouts or clogged pores. That’s pretty much what the product is supposed to do, and it definitely did that! I’m trying out Korres’ Wild Rose moisturizer now, will let you know how that works out… Product : 26/30 Value : 7/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : For those with dry skin, Korres’ Thyme Honey Moisturizer will keep your skin hydrated and soothed!

MAC Impassioned is brighter. MAC Moxie is pinker. MAC Party Parrot is lighter. Guerlain Gigi is a smidgen brighter. NARS Funny Face has an iridiescent sheen. MAC Full Fuchsia has more fuchsia in it. The Conditioning Lip Sheen formua is supposed to be a “lightweight, conditioning lipstick that delivers medium pigmentation and shine.” It’s scent- and taste-free. Each lipstick is pakcaged in a gunmetal-colored metal tube with two rows of “crystals” going around the bottom of the cap. Despite the metal finish, fingerprints stay relatively well-disguised (under bright light and if you’re paying attention, you’ll notice some). It comes with a little more than the average lipstick–this contains 0.12 oz., and many lipsticks are right around 0.10 oz. It’s a thinner, lightweight formula that still has some slip, so it glides across the lips, depositing even color as it goes. It delivers almost opaque color, but there’s an underlying sheerness–you can still make out my lip freckle quite easily–so it’s not fully opaque. Because the texture is spreadable, you could also use a lot less for more of a stained lip look. This is not really what I envisioned this looking like, given its name, as it’s not really fuchsia–more pink and red, not quite coral. It’s bold and just shy of being a true bright lip color, so it’ll be a nice addition to any summer routine. Fuchsia Lining wore for five and a half hours, and it was moderately moisturizing while it wore and my lips still felt good to go for a couple of hours post-wear.

We recommend Magic Copper all over lid with Moonlit Burgundy in the crease and Heavenly Beige to highlight the brow. You could even try the Starry Rose highlighter if it isn’t too shimmery for your taste as a brow highlighter! Be sure to swipe on Tender Rose blush on the apples of your cheeks, while applying Starry Rose on your cheekbones, forehead, and chin for added radiance. Dust shoulders and d colletage with Starry Rose to really distract the male variety wherever you go!

To add more oomph to your look, try a pair of false lashes–not too dramatic–to achieve it without taking away from the rest. It’s important to give your face and body a healthy dose of “glow.” We love Jergen’s shimmery glow lotion, and we also love dusting beauty powders (like Peach Haze from MAC) along shoulders. Play up features, but this look is meant to compliment the dress while keeping the dress the central piece of the evening (we just think it’s gorgeous, don’t you?).

"['Spadaro Sole Nero Eau de Parfum Review and Photo Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jun 05, 2012 June 05, 2012 Spadaro Sole Nero Eau de Parfum Spadaro Sole Nero Eau de Parfum Spadaro Sole Nero Eau de Parfum ($135.00 for 100ml) has notes of Italian grapefruit, bergamot, white pepper, cumin, musk, sandalwood, almond, and vanilla. The bottle I have is sample packaging, so what is available at retail is larger and prettier–it looks a lot like a lantern. The bottle design is actually what made me notice the brand to begin with! The Story Each day, we climbed steep stone pathways to yet another wonderful outdoor market, where we would shop for fresh produce. Grapefruit has always been one of my favorite oils, and I found myself surrounded by citrus fruits being cut for juice and handed out to passersby for sampling. So sweet and succulent, they are emblazoned in our collective memory. During a mountaintop dinner one night, we watched Mount Etna’s ambient light glow in the distance. The faint smell of smoke wafted in the breeze. We all sat around a beautiful Italian table, enjoying wines from nearby vineyards and reminiscing about our family’s connection to the land. We heard fascinating stories about distant relatives, many of whom we have never met. When I returned to the States, I was compelled to make a fragrance with just a hint of grapefruit, rounded out by soft musk and spices, to mark that great trip and to celebrate the spirit of family. Initially, there’s a strong pepperiness that almost smells like black licorice, though it’s certainly not listed anywhere in the description. It fades very quickly to a scent dominated by bergamot and musk. There’s a subtle sweetness and nuttiness from the almond and vanilla that rounds out the fragrance. The bergamot starts taking a backseat, and the sensual woodiness from the sandalwood moves to the forefront alongside the musk. The scent is strong, heady, sexy–lots of muskiness blended with sweet woods. I don’t get a lot of citrus or spiciness, though–if I take a really slow, deep inhale, I feel like I can almost detect a light pepperiness in the very background of the scent. It’s very smooth, kind of creamy in a way. If you’re a fan of musk, it’s worth checking out (and conversely, if you loathe musk, skip).']",e63370b68465794188984c80800773a6c61c6d17,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/spadaro-sole-nero-eau-de-parfum-review-and-photo/,['2012-06-05 00:00:00']

Revlon Raspberry Pie is a smidgen less red, not quite as bright. Guerlain Girly is redder. OCC Queen is brighter. Guerlain Champs-Elysees is rather close, just more opaque (so it looks a little darker). This lipstick formula is supposed to be lightweight, hydrating, and have “medium pigmentation.” The color coverage is mostly opaque with a light translucency that allows for some of the natural lip color to come through. It has a light, balm-like consistency that slides on like butter, but it manages to stay on lips for a full five and a half hours. The formula is moderately hydrating (and more so than the last shade I tried in this range), so lips don’t feel parched post-application and you won’t feel compelled to run for your lip balm right away. It’s also scent- and taste-free. It comes in a gunmetal tube that clicks into place well and doesn’t show fingerprints for the most part.

This is MEGA-WATT bright, I swear! Despite its brightness, it’s actually a little less opaque than the majority of Rouge G lipsticks , which is odd. It does remind me of MAC Full Fuchsia Lipstick , which is a PRO shade, but it’s a lot frostier (and thus more reflective). Gigi seems to have less blue in its base, too, and this would make it a touch more flattering on warmer skin tones than Full Fuchsia . I am definitely surprised to see such a bright shade launched by Guerlain, and even more since it’s part of their fall launch!

"[""MAC By Request – Lipsticks Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Mar 16, 2012 March 16, 2012 MAC 3N Lipstick MAC By Request – Lipsticks Review, Photos, Swatches MAC By Request is a collection that’s voted on by the fans–there are 18 shades of lipstick, lipglass, and eyeshadow that MAC has listed for grabs, and your votes will determine the top three from each product type that will go on to be launched in an online exclusive, limited edition collection in August. Voting is open and closes on March 30th and users can vote once per product category per day. Not sure where to cast your vote? I’ve got the goods on the six lipsticks up for a comeback! ? 3N is a pale pink beige nude. It has a lustre finish. The color coverage is semi-sheer and adds a touch of pink. Cle de Peau #129 is more opaque, slightly darker. MAC Lazy Day is a bit pinker, almost a little gray. Korres #13 is similar but warmer. Candy Yum Yum is a bright, neon magenta pink with cool, blue undertones with opaque color coverage. It has a matte finish. MAC Pink Pigeon is a bit lighter, pinker. MAC Show Orchid is darker, more fuchsia. MAC Quick Sizzle is pinker. MAC Rose Hip is lighter and pinker. Eden Rocks is a subtly pink-tinged coppery brown with a frosted shimmer. It has a frost finish and semi-opaque color coverage. MAC Felicienne is subtler, less coppery. Moxie is pinky-red with opaque color coverage. It has a matte finish–I think! Not to worry, it feels like a modern matte: creamy, easy to apply, and doesn’t shrink-wrap your lips. MAC Party Parrot is more coral, no blue undertones. OCC Queen is darker. Guerlain CHamps-Elysees is darker. Guerlain Gigi is very similar but has a glossy sheen. Rocker is a darkened brown-based red with subtle shimmer. I’m not quite sure what the finish is–I had the original listed as a matte. Will inquire! Nonetheless, it yields opaque color coverage with very subtle shimmer. shu uemura Rouge Luster is slightly more orange. MAC Such Flare! is a bit lighter, more orange than brown. MAC Extended Play has more brown in it. MAC Unknown Pleasures is a bit darker. Rimmel Metallic Seduction and Make Up For Ever #48 are darker. Shitaki is a medium-dark warm brown with a pale gold-champagne shimmer-sheen. It has a glaze finish, so the color coverage is semi-sheer. Guerlain Chant d’Aromes is pinker, less brown. MAC Flustered is more golden. MAC Kraft is darker. Lancome Bronze Show is a bit darker, more orange. The formula on these was typical MAC–I didn’t have any unexpected issues with these. Generally, I find lustre lipsticks to be drying and wear only two hours or so. The more matte-like finishes ( Candy Yum Yum, Moxie, Rocker ) felt creamy and opaque, so no trouble there. Glaze finishes ( Shitaki ) are less drying than lustres though still a touch drying over time and tend to wear for a similar short time. MAC lipsticks are vanilla scented. Continuing with the fun, here are some shades I think could have been good choices: Ahoy, There! (Naughty Nauticals ’08), Angeldish (Aquadisiac ’03), Big Bow (Hello Kitty ’09), Blue Eve (Eden Rocks ’01), Blueberry Fizz (Cocktails, ’01), Brave New Bronze (Style Warrior ’09), Curtsy (Dance ’06), Fashionably Fuchsia (Classic Coordinates ’06), Flash-n-Dash (Fafi ’08), Gladiola (Dame Edna ’08), High Top (Fafi ’08), Isabella Blow (MAC for Isabella BLow ’05), Jazzed (In the Groove ’10), Legendary Femme (Raquel Welch ’07), Lollipop Loving (Heatherette ’08), Marisheeno (Lustreful ’04), Mellow Mood (Electroflash ’08), Merry Mistress (Black Tied ’01), Pink Maribu (Lingerie ’05), Port Red (Naughty Nauticals ’08), Queen’s Sin (Antiquitease ’07), Rebelrose (Rebel Rock ’05), Red No. 5 (MACouture ’06), Rococo (Rococo ’04), Strawberry Blonde (Catherine Deneuve ’06), Tiger Tiger (Raquel Welch ’07), Wild ‘Bout You (Rockocco ’06). I was confused when I saw both Eden Rocks and Shitaki being promoted–I thought they were both permanent, but I guess they were discontinued in the past two years or so. (If they were such bestsellers, why were they ever discontinued?!) With a collection concept like this one, I think the older the better–and certainly not shades that were permanent for years! If we’re going to go so recent, might as well repromote the Iris Apfel lipsticks, since those sold out so quickly. It’s just such a great concept and one that fans have been asking to see forever, and I’m left wondering, “What data did you use to come up with these lists?” Because I can’t seriously believe that there was no top selling coral lipstick–historically, MAC corals sell out quickly! I am however pleased to see Moxie and Rocker make the list — those are two I’ve heard about, and they’re both oldies (but goodies). I don’t think I have most of these in the original forms; I should have 3N and Candy Yum Yum, but I’m not so sure about Eden Rocks. I know I owned Shitaki once upon a time, but I don’t think I kept it.

A lot of the duos, though, are more basic than not, so whether any are must-haves depends on the size of your stash. Mr. Gold is a medium yellow gold with a soft, frosted shimmer finish. The color payoff is good, but it could be a little denser in texture to give it really excellent color payoff. MAC Sweet & Sour is less yellow. Bare Escentuals Remix is slightly darker. Bare Escentuals Aspire is similar. MAC Goldmine is very similar. Mr. Silver is a medium silver with a frosted, metallic finish. As with Mr. Gold, the color payoff was just good — it wasn’t as intense or as pigmented as Tarina Tarantino’s line has been in general. MAC Misty is similar, slightly more metallic. Giorgio Armani #12 is a smidgen lighter. This wasn’t my favorite set, mostly because of the quality. It’s good, but it’s not great , and so many of Tarina Tarantino’s eyeshadows are fantastic. The texture on these was a little drier–not quite as creamy or as dense–so the pigmentation was less than many other shades. I felt that it performed just as nicely on the lid as other shades, and both shades were buildable to fully opaque color on the lid with or without a base. When I wore the shades to test the wear, I achieved seven hours with no fading or creasing (with slight fading around the edges after eight) when applied over bare lids, but I didn’t have any problems after eight hours when applied over a primer. 5 0 Mr. Gold/Mr. Silver 5 0 Mr. Gold/Mr. Silver A- Where to Buy Affiliate Links DermStore Tarina Tarantino 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Cle de Peau T9 (Albertine) Extra Rich Lipstick Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jun 05, 2012 June 05, 2012 Cle de Peau T9 Extra Rich Lipstick Cle de Peau T9 Extra Rich Lipstick Cle de Peau Albertine (T9) Extra Rich Lipstick ($60.00 for 0.14 oz.) is a soft pink-tinged peach with a fine golden peach micro-shimmer. MAC Delectable is darker, more orange. MAC To the Future is very similar but doesn’t have the shimmer. MAC Fashion City is more orange. Chanel Santal is very comparable. Albertine delivers mostly opaque color, but there’s a little hint of translucency. It applies evenly and smoothly, and the formula itself has a fair amount of slip but isn’t too thick, despite the creaminess of the texture. It’s lightweight and comfortable to wear, and this particular shade wore for four and a half hours, which wasn’t particularly long but longer than average for shades of this lightness. This is a very wearable shade, and it is a bit more dupeable and less nuanced compared to some of the other colors available in the Extra Rich formula. I like it, and I am personally drawn to peaches and corals as go-to shades, so it is a color I’d wear often. Cle de Peau advertises that there are “skincare benefits” in the formula, and while I can’t attest to that, given that I cannot commit to a single formula for six weeks to trial it, I can weigh-in on the short-term benefits like de-emphasis of lip lines (softened after ten to fifteen minutes of wear) and intense hydration. There are a lot of lipsticks that keep lips hydrated while you wear them to the point where your lips are no worse for the wear after they’ve faded, but there are fewer formulas that leave your lips feeling more hydrated than they were when you first applied the product.

"['The Art of Shaving – For Women – The Perfect Shave Year: 2007 Launches Nov 06, 2007 November 06, 2007 The Art of Shaving is a unique concept guided by the expertise and hands-on attention of our founders. Passionately devoted to the very best in skin care, we have created a luxurious line of shaving products that promises optimal shaving results for legs, bikini area and under arms. We call this The Perfect Shave. You know what to find out how to get the barest skin, so The Art of Shaving isn’t just for men, they have a whole range of products to achieve “The Perfect Shave” for women. Start yourself off with their Pre-Shave Oil ($18), which softens hair and protects skin in delicate areas like the bikini line, and it reduces irritation, ingrown hairs, cuts, and leaves skin irresistibly soft. Apply Shaving Cream ($30), which has some of the same benefits as the Pre-Shave Oil, but it also helps to provide an easy way for the razor to glide across the skin. If you want real luxury, use their Pure Badger Shaving Brush ($60) to build up a good lather, gentle exfoliation, and an all-around lovely shaving experience. Turn the mundane into an at-home spa treatment! Protect your perfectly shaven skin with After-Shave Body Milk ($36) by replenishing the moisture to your skin and keep it moisturized all day long. To stop those nasty ingrow hairs in their tracks, use Ingrown Hair Night Cream ($30) with shea butter to soften skin, which helps ingrown hairs break free (and means all good things for you). All of the products to achieve “The Perfect Shave” use Rose Absolute, which is a gentle anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and increases suppleness. You’ll find a host of antioxidants in each of their products to keep your skin delightfully bare and soft. Shop for these products at www.artofshaving.com . P.S. – For that special man in your life, definitely take a look at their range of products for the male variety!']",b3d3b0899aaa14882e5c55cdc13345db5c6c96a4,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/the-art-of-shaving-for-women-the-perfect-shave/,['2007-11-06 00:00:00']

It runs a little on the reddish wine side, and the shimmer is noticeable without being too much. It’s a diamond shadow, so it has a frostier finish than other iridescent shadows by Make Up For Ever. #141 is a sheer, slightly shimmery pale mauve-pink. It doesn’t have the best color pay off, but it can be layered to get a little more pop out of it. #162 is a matte, brownish-burgundy shade. It can be layered for increased intensity, though it has decent color pay off. I like it for the crease, personally! #84 is a shimmery, smoky green with gray tone. It has golden shimmer laced throughout. It reminded me of a lighter MAC Greensmoke eyeshadow, actually. #47 is a matte, grayed-down green. It’s kind of like a drab green in a way, but it’s a nice way to add depth to the crease without adding a lot of darkness. Which of these are your favorites? Check out more photos !

Check out breakdowns for each reader’s look! PK is obsessed with makeup and runs a beauty blog . WHAT SHE LOVES ABOUT HER LOOK : It’s girly but natural and completely do-able in 10 minutes! WHAT SHE USED : On eyes, she used MAC Tete-a-Tint Eyeshadow, MAC Paradisco Eyeshadow, and Korres Black Mascara. On her face, she skipped foundation and used MAC NW20 Select Cover Up Concealer and MAC Dainty Mineralize Blush. On lips, she used MAC Dressmaker, Dressmaker Lipstick. DAWN is 20 years old and lives in Canada. She runs both a blog and YouTube channel . WHAT SHE LOVES ABOUT HER LOOK : I love that this look is really simple and quick to do. It gives my skin a break from foundation, so my skin feels refreshed and renewed. My favourite part of this look is MAC’s Soft Brown shadow in the crease, it gives depth and warmth to my eyes but still looks very natural. WHAT SHE USED : On eyes, she used Benefit Eye Bright, MAC Naked Lunch Eyeshadow, MAC Soft Brown Eyeshadow, MAC Blacktrack Fluidline, and Lancome Hypnose Mascara. On the face, she used MAC NC15 Studio Finish Concealer, Make Up For Ever HD Powder, and MAC Blushbaby Blush. On lips, she used MAC Hue Lipstick.

She says, “After all the bills are paid and there is food in my fridge, I enjoy spending my free time and money on beauty products!” She just started up her own beauty blog . She warns you all that she is growing her brows out! WHAT SHE LOVES ABOUT HER LOOK : It’s me but better! I love that it’s quick, not over the top and still makes me feel pretty. The lipstick adds that extra little kick to make it look polished. WHAT SHE USED : On eyes, she used NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base, MAC Bisque Eyeshadow, MAC Honesty Eyeshadow, MAC Wedge Eyeshadow, MAC Modelette Eyeshadow, L’Oreal Dark Brown Liner, and MAC Opulash Mascara.

EMILY loves to do many different types of makeup looks. She also loves teaching people what she knows, and you can find her on YouTube! WHAT SHE LOVES ABOUT HER LOOK : It seems like a few products, but it doesn’t take long at all to do and it is my go to look. I love how it looks like I put in a lot of effort and I usually get some compliments on this look, but it takes literally like 5 minutes to do. It makes me feel made up, but it’s super simple! WHAT SHE USED : On eyes, she used Coastal Scents 88 Matte Palette, Urban Decay Zero 24/7 Liner, and Fresh Supernova Mascara. On the face, she used Maybelline Creamy Natural Dream Liquid Mousse Foundation, Amazing Light Concealer, MAC Light Mineralize Skinfinish Natural, NARS Laguna Bronzer, and NARS Orgasm Blush.

She’s hoping to start her own beauty blog soon, but for now hopes to guest post on her friend’s blog . WHAT SHE LOVES ABOUT HER LOOK : I love this look because it does look natural for school days and isn’t heavy at all. I can slap it on pretty quickly when I’m running late (which is most mornings). If I feel in the mood or have some extra time I might add black or brown liner to my top lash line, or some combination of neutral coloured eye shadows. Dallas has been my go-to blush for probably over a year, it’s so quick and simple to apply with a MAC 129 brush and is really flattering. WHAT SHE USED : On eyes, she used CoverGirl LashBlast Volume Mascara and MAC Show Off Brow Set. On her face, she used Biotherm Face Multi-Protection Sun Cream SPF 30, MAC Studio Finish Concealer, MAC Medium Mineralize Skinfinish Natural, and Benefit Dallas.

WHAT SHE LOVES ABOUT HER LOOK : I’m a huge eyeliner junkie so what I like most about my “no makeup look” is that I can keep the drama with the eyeliner while having a fresh looking face. It’s obvious I have eyeliner on but I can’t resist! WHAT SHE USED : On eyes, she used MAC Blacktrack Fluidline and Avon Mascara. On her face, she used Cargo Blu_Ray Blush. On lips, she used Dior #217 Ultra Gloss Reflect. XT loves to work out, read, and spend time with her friends and family–when she’s not busy being a makeup addict and writing her beauty blog .

WHAT SHE USED : On eyes, she used Shu Umeura’s Eyelash Curler, Maybelline Falsies Mascara, and MAC Feline Kohl Power. On the face, she used Shu Uemura Concealer, Laura Mercier Secret Concealer, Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer SPF 20, and LORAC Perfectly Lit Highlighter. On lips, she used Chanel #65 Lip Shine. BEE hails from Toronto, Canada. She’s starting her senior year of high school, and she loves to read, cook, bake, watch movies, and listen to music. Her ultimate fashion idol is Coco Chanel! WHAT SHE LOVES ABOUT HER LOOK : What I love most about this no makeup look is that it’s fuss-free and very simple, it only takes 5 minutes at the most. I love that it doesn’t require large amounts of makeup, and yet I feel very put together with this look. I also love the fact that I look like I didn’t try hard at all (because I obviously didn’t either). WHAT SHE USED : On eyes, she used DiorShow Blackout Mascara. On the face, she used BareMinerals Original SPF Foundation and Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess Soft Matte Bronzer. On lips, she wore Maybelline CoverStick. YIJIA is new to makeup but has been inspired by the gurus she has seen to start her own makeup channel on YouTube . She’s a full-time college student who loves makeup and anything beauty related (or science related… games… gaming… computer science — she admits that she’s a nerd!). WHAT SHE LOVES ABOUT HER LOOK : My “no makeup” makeup look is one that I use quite frequently (8am classes everyday forces me to). It’s very easy to do and doesn’t take much time at all. What I love about it? It’s done in 5 mins max! WHAT SHE USED : On eyes, she used a felt tip penliner on the upper lash line, waterproof liner to tightline, and white liner on the lower waterline, with NYX Milk Jumbo Eyeshadow Pencil and Maybelline Full ‘n Soft Mascara. For the face, she used Maybelline Cream Dream Mousse Concealer, Maybelline’s Cream Dream Matte Powder, ELF Complexion Perfection, and Essence Big Wave Survivor Blush. On lips, she used Golden Rose #141 2000 Lipstick.']",1b65877b554bd0f5edc70c43e745bf2ead02b1ca,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/your-%e2%80%9cno-makeup%e2%80%9d-makeup-looks-part-4/,['2010-08-06 00:00:00']
"['Earthen – InstantPeel – Facial Exfoliant Review Reviews Nov 02, 2007 November 02, 2007 Who doesn’t love a little facial pampering? And who doesn’t love to beat the price of an at-spa treatment with a do-it-yourself one? Earthen’s InstantPeel is a non-irritating exfoliant that does it gently and quickly to remove impurities and residue from the skin to give it a lovely texture and renewed vibranchy. Each box contains six single-use packets, which might not sound like a lot, but it just depends on your skin type. If you have oily skin or normal skin use this once every other week or so; and for dry skin, use it once every three weeks. It is an all-natural exfoliant, and it is hypoallergenic, which makes it excellent for those with sensitive skin. No burning, scratching, or harshness whatsoever; it is a gentle exfoliant that does its job! Want to see the rest of my review? I found myself enjoying this little luxury, because it made my shower seem more pampered and left my skin feeling so soft and fresh-feeling. It’s incredibly easy to use–practically foolproof–all you need is to take one packet into the shower with you, go about your normal sudsing and soaping, and after at least five minutes of hydration from the steam, apply InstantPeel. You’ll feel little flecks of dry skin just coming off your face (okay, that sounds gross, but shh! it’s in the name of beauty!), and it just rinses off effortlessly. Oh, and you can always take these to go, which is why the packaging is fantastic. At $50 for a pack of six, it’s really not so bad, because one box should last you at least a month, if not more. Earthen’s InstantPeel is available for sale at Saks Fifth Avenue, www.saks.com and www.InstantPeel.com .']",53704e6952eeaa8237ab8bca6c8133db3ed35744,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/earthen-instantpeel-facial-exfoliant-review/,['2007-11-02 00:00:00']

"[""Zoya FeiFei Nail Lacquer Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Aug 21, 2012 August 21, 2012 Zoya FeiFei Nail Lacquer Sheer is Not the New Opaque! Zoya FeiFei Nail Lacquer ($8.00 for 0.50 fl. oz.) is described as a “medium steel blue base with heavy gold, blue, and pink iridescent metallic sparkle.” It’s a cool-toned, purpled blue with a hint of steely gray skies, then coated with blue, green, and dark pink sparkle. I don’t have anything quite like it. Zoya Skylar has one or two similarities, but it is largely different. China Glaze Skyscraper is a similar blue, but the base color is darker, and it has mostly silver sparkle. Unfortunately, like Daul , this is supposed to be fully opaque (Zoya lists it has having an intensity of five, which is the equivalent to opaque), and it’s not. After two coats, there is still sheerness; I suspect after three coats, you would be pretty close to opaque color coverage. The good news is the consistency isn’t thick, so three coats is doable without feeling like you have lots of polish on. I typically get a week of wear out of Zoya’s formula with no chipping and minor tip wear. 12 2 FeiFei 12 2 FeiFei B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beauty Brands Zoya 8.5 Product 8 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9.5 Longevity 4 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Burberry Blossom Light Glow Natural Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Aug 21, 2012 August 21, 2012 Burberry Blossom Blush Burberry Blossom Blush ($42.00 for 0.24 oz.) is a coral-orange–there is the merest hint of pink in the background–with a natural finish, just a smidgen of a sheen. It’s a lot like the just-reviewed MAC Supercontinental , which is barely lighter. MAC Fleet Fast is darker, redder. Chanel Tweed Brun Rose is more orange. Tarina Tarantino Feather is pinker and lighter. Tarte Blissful is brighter, pinker. Tom Ford Flush is more vibrant and a bit pinker. MAC Ripe Peach is more orange, lighter. Burberry’s Light Glow Natural Blush is a formula designed to have good color payoff, easy application, and yield a healthy glow. A lot of the great coral blushes are limited edition, which means once they’re gone, they’re gone for good. Blossom is a wearable coral that’s not too pink, but not so orange that it ventures into a reddish area. The texture is as soft as silk, smooth as butter; it’s something you have to touch and feel to appreciate. I didn’t even realize just how soft this powder is until I had played with a few other blush formulas–this was one of the softest, most finely-milled powders. The finish has a faint sheen, which looks natural and glowy without being shimmery–it doesn’t emphasize pores in the slightest. It actually seems to soften the appearance of them (superficially, not actually). It applies with good color, no need to be careful but you don’t have to spend awhile building up the color if you have a deeper complexion. Because of the soft feel, it blends like a dream. When I tested this shade for wear, I was able to get a full eight hours of wear, and it started to fade after nine hours. 36 2 Blossom 36 2 Blossom A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Net-A-Porter Burberry (US) House of Fraser (UK) Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Escentual Sephora (PL) 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 98% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"['Sunscreen 101: What protects what? UVA ingredients, UVB ingredients, broad spectrum! What you need to know! zArchived Apr 18, 2008 April 18, 2008 Protecting yourself from the sun is essential. With as much research out, it is no longer an optional step in your beauty routine. Most of understand that anti-aging creams are not nearly as effective as taking preventative steps that reduce aging rather than attempting to reverse what has already occurred. UVA & UVB? UVA damage occurs in shortwave (320 to 340nm) and long-wave (340 to 400nm), while UVB occurs between 280 to 320 nm. UVA tends to penetrate into the skin, while UVB damages the top layer of skin. Common Ingredients for UVA Protection : Avobenzone, Ecamsule (Mexoryl SX), Zinc Oxide; Titanium gives some, but not the entire range of the spectrum Common Ingredients for UVB Protection : Octyl methoxycinnamate, octyl salicylate, octocrylene Ingredient to watch for : Zinc Oixide provides protection against short and long UVA as well as UVB. Avobenzone protects against UVA, while oxybenzone only protects against short wave UVA and titanium dioxide protects up to 385nm (of 400nm). Caution : SPF is a measure of UVB protection, NOT UVA . In fact, many sunscreens labeled “broad spectrum UVA/UVB” do not protect against the entire UVA spectrum (short and long waves). Ingredients known for sun protection: Octocrylene is an organic compound used in sunscreens. Oxybenzone is a derivative of Benzophenone and an organic compound often used in sunscreens. Octisalate is a chemical suncreen ingredient that blocks UVB. Homosalate is an organic compound used in sunscreens to absorb ultraviolet rays. Avobenzone is an oil soluble ingredient that may also go by Parsol 1789, Eusolex 9020, Escalol 517. Octyl methoxycinnamate or octinoxate is an organic compound used for sun protection. Octyl salicylate is an organic compound used in sunscreens. It absorbs ultraviolet light. Dioxybenzone is an organic compound used to block UVB, derivative of benzophenone. Titanium Dioxide is used in sunscreen, and it is often used to because of its high refractive index. How effective is your SPF? Calculate how long you can stay in the sun with your sunscreen.']",5870ed26c8698f5566928a9868e846bb96c8a829,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/sunscreen-101-what-protects-what-uva-ingredients-uvb-ingredients-broad-spectrum-what-you-need-to-know/,['2008-04-18 00:00:00']

Holographic or not, it is chocked full of shimmer, though, as the formula might lead you to believe. Revlon Rosegold is pinker, warmer. MAC Blessedly Rich has more orange and copper in it. Bobbi Brown Beach is sheerer and has more gold/bronze shimmer. MAC Social Light is similar. MAC Explicit is a bit lighter. MAC Spree is browner. I feel like a broken record, because I’m in love with nearly every single shade within the formula’s range. New for fall (but staying in the line), Bronzed Heather is no exception. It has semi-sheer to semi-opaque coverage, though the color itself is more semi-sheer with such a hefty amount of shimmer that it’s almost semi-opaque. There’s a noticeable translucency that enables your natural lip color to come through. The gloss has a lightweight consistency that’s not too thick or too thin, spreads evenly, and when tested, this shade wore four hours. It’s hydrating, and the shimmer doesn’t travel to parts unknown. 17 1 Bronzed Heather 17 1 Bronzed Heather A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"['Prom 2008: Pale and Pastel Yellow Dresses and Makeup Apr 25, 2008 April 25, 2008 One of my favorite colors, especially on deeper skintones, is this shade of pale yellow; it’s not too sallow nor too bright. It has just enough oomph to bring out your natural glow, while still being quite spring/summery. If you want to go big, try an eye that has primary yellow on the lid–you can match this with oranges, pinks, and even greens. For some coordinating, but much more subtle, try a pale yellow eye with colors like Nylon, Going Bananas, Goldmine, etc. Go for a pale yellow lid with a darker gray or black in the crease for a subtle smoky eye. I like coral lips for this look, or maybe pale peach lips, too. Keep cheeks in line with your look–avoid bright corals if your eyes are dolled up. Love peachy and coral-toned blushes like Margin and Springsheen. Check out suggested looks : one , two , & three .

"['Interview wIth Jen M. MAC Make Up Artist zArchived Nov 12, 2007 November 12, 2007 If you are a makeup artist who is interested in being interviewed, let us know at [email protected] ! Temptalia had the opportunity to interview MAC make-up artist and beauty blogger Jen M ., age 36, who has been an artist for two years and with MAC for less than one. Even though she has no formal beauty training, she’s finding her way as a makeup artist just fine! Temptalia: What surprises you most about working as a makeup artist? Jen: That’s a great question! I think I’m most surprised by the many women I meet who apologize for not knowing how to do complex looks with their makeup. How on earth do women expect they should have learned these things?! Unless you’re a makeup junkie and magazine addict, like I was, or if you had a mother who was a makeup junkie, there’s no way to expect that the knowledge would just “come to you”. That’s why there are makeup artists, and when you meet a good one he/she should be able to teach you some tricks so you can expand your own looks. The other thing that really surprises me is how many women immediately degrade themselves when they sit in my chair. I hear “oh- don’t look at my brows! I need to wax them” or “I know I have wrinkles, but – or “Ugh, my skin is so bad” or other things that are harsh and they wouldn’t say to a friend. Why can’t women be accepting of their own unique look? You know you want to see the rest of the interview, so Temptalia: Where do you find your inspiration? Jen: My inspiration mostly comes from the women with whom I work. They tell me their stories, be it why they want a new look, or how many kids they have, or whether they’re going on a date – those things help me come up with creative ways to help each woman look her very best! I also find a lot of inspiration in my colleagues, both where I work and out in the rest of the world. I watch Top Model mostly for the makeup, and that’s the first thing I notice in all of my magazines (even Parents!). The I challenge myself to stretch. Temptalia: What’s your favorite way to achieve the perfect natural look? Jen: Ah, the natural look. It’s what most people want when they come to the counter – even at MAC! I think a nice healthy glow is important, as is wearing something that makes one comfortable. In addition, I recommend great skincare to keep skin at its peak condition. This whole process is different for everyone. For me, Clarins skincare makes my skin look gorgeous and healthy and most importantly: hydrated! Keeping hydrated minimizes those irritating fine lines that make me look my age. Besides, makeup sits in ’em! I also love MAC’s Mineralize Skinfinishes. I use the MSF Natural in Light as my foundation most days (sometimes I substitute Armani Designer Shaping Cream Foundation – in fact, I do so more and more often, lately!). I also like Shimpagne and Lightscapade to add highlights on the cheekbones and under the brow. A bit of blush that makes it look like I just ran up the steps (not ran on the stairmaster!) helps, as does a pale eyeshadow in a shade that compliments my eyes. A bit of lipgloss or a natural tone lipstick. Always mascara to really help the eyes look big and awake. That’s all I use on myself and that’s all anyone really “needs”. Temptalia: What feature do you love to accentuate? Jen: This is definitely different for each woman! I think lately everyone is focusing on the eyes, but I love to really feature each woman’s best asset. Many women have great skin and that should be the focus if that’s you! Glow, get dewy, maybe even get your shimmer on! For women with huge or particularly pretty eyes, make that the focus. If your pout is superior, that should be the focus. I have deep-set, small eyes, so unless I’m working at the counter (when I have to pile on the eye makeup) I play up the skin. I sometimes shift focus to the lips, since mine are full and fairly decent. I like to switch it up. Temptalia: Do you love working any specific brands or lines? Jen: I love working with MAC, of course, but I’ll admit it’s not the only brand out there. I love Armani foundations and Face Atelier foundations. I think that Bobbi Brown’s correctors are one of the best things in the industry. I had the privilege to test products from an up-and-coming line called Yaby (http://www.yabycosmetics.com/) and really like them a lot. Shiseido and Lancome actually have some lovely eye shadows. Clarins skincare – I can’t say enough! Temptalia: What advice do you have for those wanting to become a makeup artist? Jen: Practice on other people – lots of different types of people. Working with people who don’t look like you is one of the harder things to get used to. The second thing I’d recommend is that aspiring artists should try to reproduce looks from the pages of magazines, fashion websites, and any other sources they can find. And don’t just try to copy them – try to adapt them for the person you’re making-up, so they “read” well. Temptalia: What are three important skills required to be a makeup artist? Jen: Number one: patience, because you’re dealing with people. Two: adaptability. You’re going to need to think on the fly and change the original plan more often than you think you are! Third: diplomacy. Sometimes you’re going to be asked to do things that aren’t possible, and despite your urge to say “it’s a makeup brush, not a magic wand,” you’re going to have to find a nice way to nudge your clients in new directions. Temptalia: Could you share your three beauty tips you could not live without? Jen: . Have a good cleanser, moisturizer, night cream and eye cream. 2. Use primer for everything: skin, lashes, lips, eyes. It makes everything slide right on and then stay put! 3. Change your makeup every few months. By this I mean if you’ve been wearing the same 2 shades on your eyes for 5 years, you’re officially in a rut. So get a new shade of lipstick, try a different color eye liner. Do something to shake it up. Who cares about how you look- it’s how you will feel when you look in the mirror and see something fresh that counts! Thanks for the interview, Jen! We really appreciate the opportunity to talk with you!']",fee96db397069906b8c10d598ab5cc37d6f1f9dc,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/interview-with-jen-m-mac-make-up-artist/,['2007-11-12 00:00:00']

"['Tutorial – Dewy, Glowy Flawless Skin; Foundation, Blush, Contour, Highlighting Tutorials Dec 06, 2007 December 06, 2007 This tutorial will walk you through, step-by-step, on how to apply liquid foundation, powder, contour, blush, and highlighting for a semi-dewy face. You may want to peruse my red lips tutorial , as well as brow tutorial . Also, I have done a few face tutorials in the past (you can never have too many, right?): glowy cheeks , and my original face tutorial . Do let me know what you think, and if this was helpful! (Now, back to studying!) And if you have a TeamSugar account, make sure to show us some love ! You will need: Products : Liquid foundation, concealer, blush of choice, contour color of choice, highlight color of choice Tools : concealer brush (194), buffer brush (182), stippling brush (187), angled contour brush (168), blush brush (150) I used : MAC Face & Body (NC30), Make Up Forever Lift undereye concealer, Afterdusk blush, Sculpt sculping powder, Tenderdusk beauty powder Now, it is time to build the full-face with all the trimmings… Step 1 : Start with a freshly cleaned and moisturized face–free of makeup. Step 2 : Using the 194 brush (small, firm concealer brush), apply dabs of liquid foundation onto cheeks, chin, and forehead (nose, too, if you wish!). Step 3 : With your buffer brush, pull each dab of foundation out to provide even coverage of the area (e.g., chin as shown). Step 4 : Continue to pull the foundation dabs to cover your skin (e.g., cheeks as shown). Step 5 : You can use sweeping or circular motions, depending on your preference. I usually sweep the dabs out across the skin and then use circular motions to even it out. Step 6 : This is what a naturally dewy liquid foundation looks like. Step 7 : Admittedly, most people apply concealer first, and I do it sometimes as well — I haven’t found it particularly meaningful for eyes (which is the only place I use it). If you use color-correcting concealers, then it is a must to apply prior to foundation! Nonetheless, same technique can apply… Apply undereye concealer underneath lower lash line covering the dark circles life has given you, and make sure you apply enough that it goes below the area you want to conceal. Step 8 : Introduce MAC’s 187 stippling brush–a cult favorite–is great for gently brushing concealer into skin. Step 9 : Sometimes I need to close my eye to really be able to sweep the concealer to perfection. Step 10 : Bye-bye dark circles, well, kind of. Step 11 : Using the 187 stippling brush, apply a pressed powder like MAC’s Mystery Powder all over face to set the liquid foundation and help minimize shine. Step 12 : See, less shine already, yay! Step 13 : Using the 168 angled contour brush, I picked up a token amount of Sculpt sculping powder and place it just below the apples of my cheeks. Step 14 : Suck it in, ladies. Finding the right place to contour is easiest by making the “fish face.” Where your cheeks hollow out, that’s where your brush should be going. Step 15 : Gently blend the contour out–not too much–but just enough so it fades out and isn’t a harsh line. Step 16 : It’s coming along, right? Step 17 : It’s easier to see the effect of contouring from straight-on–too bad I’m a little off-center there! But you can tell on the left side (your left) that my cheek isn’t so pudgy. Step 18 : Using the 150 powder brush, pick up a little bit of Afterdusk blush. Step 19 : Smile pretty, because you want to see the apples of your cheeks, which is where the blush should be concentrated on (and blended outwards so you don’t have two circles on your face). Step 20 : Blend the blush color upwards towards your temple, but not so high as to extend past your eye area. Step 21 : Like so. Step 22 : If it’s not dark enough, go over it with another pass, utilizing the same technique. Step 23 : See, same technique! Step 24 : Back to our beloved 182 buffer brush, because we need to buff the blush color and contour color together. Step 25 : Don’t leave out any part! Step 26 : Now we have raspberry-ish cheeks. Step 27 : Subtle blush, I would say, perhaps a touch darker than subtle… Step 28 : Again, with the 150 powder brush, pick up a bit of Tenderdusk beauty powder (our highlighter). Step 29 : Apply on the top of the apples of your cheeks–essentially, we are trying to highlight the cheekbones, so if you need to, feel around your cheeks for good measure. Step 30 : Move upwards towards your temple. Step 31 : Pretty! Step 32 : Hey, if you want to utilize your highlighter, feel free to dab a touch of it on your forehead. Step 33 : Chin, too — reflecting light off your chin can accentuate features. If you really want to go all out, dust a touch along the center of your nose (best to do this last, so you use remnants of highlighter rather than a full swipe of it, so you don’t overdo it). Step 34 : Cheeky, aren’t you! Step 35 : Always fun to see it from the side-view. Step 36 : Add eyebrows (thank god for brow filling!), change shirt (love green shirts, but not with this blush!), and you look instantly more put together. Step 37 : Yes, I do believe we’ve done our skin a favor. Step 38 : Add eyeshadows and lip color for a true view of how it all comes together. Step 39 : One more view from the side, just to show off the cheeks better. Voila!']",23af2a4811ccf5e6382665037f567e0dcfe38ef3,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tutorial-dewy-glowy-flawless-skin-foundation-blush-contour-highlighting/,['2007-12-06 00:00:00']

"['Nails – MAC Cosmetics’ Antiquitease White and Gold Crackled Nails Tutorials Oct 26, 2007 October 26, 2007 I was jonesing to try out those interesting nails featured in the Antiquitease promotional photos: white base with gold overlay. Now, luckily I didn’t have to really bother with experimentation and delving into my creative mind, because Carleen explained how to do it! I didn’t quite follow it step for step, as I’m absentminded and tend to recreate without remembering to look at what I’m trying to copycat. So how did I do it? I used two coats of a white (creme finish) polish then put one coat of Gold Veneer polish on top. I would add the gold polish to one nail at a time. You have to add the texture/swirls/crackling before the polish dries, so it’s better to do one or two at a time, crackle, then move on. I personally tried to do two at a time and found the second one ended up already being a bit too dry! For the crackling, I ripped off a small square of paper towel, maybe four inches on each side. Mine is textured (at least somewhat) as Carleen suggests, but I ended up using the edge of the paper towel to create better variance across each nail. Just pressing the paper towel ended up giving me the pattern on the paper towel, which was very uniform. Now that I’ve done it once and experienced first hand how easy it is, I’m definitely going to try again to make them resemble the original Antiquitease photo. What do you think of these kinds of nails? Love ’em, hate ’em? My boyfriend said they look dirty!']",437ff01f691bb726e923218ac40449bb7f5e1b64,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/nails-mac-cosmetics-antiquitease-white-and-gold-crackled-nails/,['2007-10-26 00:00:00']

"['Prom 2008: Vibrant Red Dresses & Makeup Apr 26, 2008 April 26, 2008 I adore red dresses, especially these deep, elegant ruby red dresses. They’re completely royal and classic, rather than in-your-face kind of red. My favorite choice would be something in line with the second look pictured, because golds complement reds so well, and yet there’s a touch of Cranberry eyeshadow to tie everything together. I feel like it’s an excellent choice for both depth, color, and overall style. But of course, with a dress in such a bold shade, going completely neutral on the eye is never a bad choice! I also like a soft smoky eye, something with a little bit of gold and a brown-gray, not so much straight black. Pink lips, nude lips, coral lips… anything goes. Even red lips could work with the appropriate eye (and the right shade of red). For a dress like this, I would concentrate on perfecting the skin and using a subtle blush to bring out my natural flush. Check out suggested looks : one , two , & three .

"['MAC Cosmetics – Dazzleglass Review, Swatches, Product Photos Reviews Apr 24, 2008 April 24, 2008 OVERALL , Dazzleglass introduces sixteen wearable shades of ultra high gloss/sheen lipgloss that’s bound to, ahem, dazzle. It’s great that MAC introduced so many at once just for the fact that you’re bound to be drawn to at least one or two of them! The consistency is thicker than lustreglass, maybe even as thick or thicker than lipglass, but with less stickiness than lipglass (though they still felt a little tacky to me). The glitter doesn’t feel particularly gritty in the swatch, though I personally felt that as they wore away through the day that some did feel gritty. After playing with them a bit, it really does seem like these are colored glosses mixed with reflects glitters–the new ones, the ultra finely milled ones. The texture of the glitter in these is nearly identical to reflects glitters (again, the newer ones that are finely milled). The packaging for this is larger than either lipglass/lustreglass, but it is not a glass tube as far as I could tell–it sounded and felt like plastic (nor were they very heavy), but they are kind of like test tubes. If you love super high reflecting glosses… check these out! They really do look amazing on lips, especially in sunlight (looks like shimmering water!). Pleasure Principle is the sheerest of the sixteen Dazzleglasses, primarily because it’s intended to be a very sheer, semi-clear glossy color. Cute to put on top of colors! Sugarrimmed is similar to Pleasure Principle, but it’s more of a white with pink undertones in it. Bare Necessity is a pale peach color with great iridescence/reflection. If you have paler lips, this would be a great beachy/summery color. Baby Sparks is a baby pastel pink with cool reflects, and I see this one being quite popular. Rags to Riches is a soft pastel mauvey-pink kind of color with multi-colored reflects. Get Rich Quick is a warm brown with pink reflects that is more wearable than you’d think. Money, Honey is a darker medium pink with equivalent reflects that go pink and fuchsia-purple. This one stood out the most to me in terms of something I’d wear often. Date Night is a dark berry color with a burgundy tone and pink reflects. Very pretty and suited to its name. Steppin’ Out is a brighter baby pink than Baby Sparks with warm tones, so I think those who’ve been wanting a light pink gloss will find either or both suitable for them. Love Alert is a pink-fuchsia that’s fairly bright, but as the Dazzleglasses are all fairly sheer, it’s wearable. Glamour O.D. is a warm pink with coral undertones and pink reflects. It’s a cute color. Spanking Rich is a darker pink with peach-berry undertones with multi-colored reflects. Like Venus is surprisingly pretty, very much a light purple-pink with light pink reflects. I was tempted by this one! Funtabulous is a bright fuchsia-purple color with cool purple reflects. Like Love Alert, it looks quite bold when swatched. Ms. Fizz is a medium pink with purple undertones – similar to Steppin’ Out except it does have that purple-fuchsia dimension to it. Comet Blue is a cool blue with a little bit of gray undertones. It’s not straight blue, nor pastel blue, but a mix.

"['Bridal Makeup: All About the Lips — Wedding Makeup for Lips, Long wearing Lipstick, All Day Lip Color zArchived Apr 22, 2008 April 22, 2008 The Lips | Finding the right shade of lipstick that coordinates with your makeup, dress, and wedding feel/theme/mood is hard enough, but keeping it on is even harder! It is important to consider the variety of lip products out there and how they can help you achieve the longest wearing lip you can get. But first a reality check: there is no real way to make your lipstick last forever or even look pristine 24/7. You will likely have to touch-up throughout the event, and any eating/drinking will do some damage to your pout. These tips and tricks are designed to help minimize touch-ups, damage, and the overall maintenance of your lips during the big day. Don’t forget to read our generalized tips for wedding makeup ! Prep and Prime! In the weeks leading up to your wedding, you should ensure that you treat that pucker with care, especially if you have dry, chapped, or cracked lips. Start exfoliating with a gritty sugar scrub (you can do a DIY scrub of sugar + extra virgin olive oil) and regularly moisturizing your lips with chapstick, lip balm, vaseline, etc. I really love Peter Thoams Roth Lips to Die For Set . It’s pricey, but it’s such a great kit. The clay step really does smooth and soften lips like a dream. To Line or Not to Line? (Pt. II) | If you’re not choosing an all-day, long-wearing formula, you should maximize your application by lining your lips. Lining your lips helps give your lipstick something to further adhere to, and it has a less dramatic effect as your lipstick starts to wear off. Plump Up Your Pout! There is a wide range of lip plumpers on the beauty market these days, and if you feel like you need a little more oomph in your pout, go for it. I am not a fan of DuWop’s Lip Venom because I just can’t handle the tingling (oww!), but I really loved LipFusion Micro-Injected Collagen Lip Plump XL because I could hardly feel it working but it did work! Remember that a lot of lip plumpers are not going to last all day, so you may find that your pucker deflates as the ceremony goes on. Choose Your Color! As with shadow choices, it has a lot to do with what kind of theme/type of wedding you’re having, and of course, it should coordinate with the rest of your makeup, too. I love to see pink-corals, soft pink-beiges, light pinks, and sometimes the classic red. For evening weddings, a good berry or plum can work wonders, too. Glossy or Matte? Depending on your application and wedding type/setting/place, high gloss may not be appropriate. While some feel that gloss photographs oddly, I do feel you can still wear high gloss or high sheen without sabotaging your photos. As we’ve always recommened, take test shots with your photographer (especially candid test shots) to see how your makeup will turn out. You can always go for tinted gloss, sheer gloss, or clear gloss to acheive a glossy lip. All-Day Color? If you choose a long-wearing or all-day lipstick, remember that most formulations are drying, which is why it is essential that your lips are well moisturized and taken care of prior to the big day. One trick is to apply a heavy lip balm/moisturizer to lips about an hour before you apply the lipstick. Blot it off about 15 minutes before you apply. When applying all-day color, make sure to give the color plenty of time to dry. You have to work fast, though, because once it dries, it’s a pain to remove (aka practice before hand and be precise). Lip Seals? There are a few sealing products on the market, particularly Make Up For Ever Lip Seal and Benefit Cosmetics She Laq , but to be up front and honest–none of them work perfectly. I find that with Make Up Forever’s Lip Seal that it does a great job of turning any lipstick into a more long-wearing formula, but the lipstick peels off rather than fades, which can be troublesome. It does break down a bit while eating anything oily, too. She Laq works similarly, though I have less personal experience with it. I have heard mixed reviews overall however. Application For Long Lasting Lip Color Step 1 : Prep and prime lips as we spoke of. I like using either an actual lip primer like MAC Prep + Prime Lip or foundation as my base primer. Be sure to let it dry. Step 2 : Apply lip liner around the perimeter of lips, then fill in the lips. Obviously, one should choose a lip liner lighter or the same as the actual lipstick color. Step 3 : Apply lipstick using a lip brush. Step 4 : Take a tissue (like Kleenex), and place it over your lips. This isn’t for blotting! Let it rest there (and yes, you’ll look a little silly), and dust loose powder over your lips (try using the finishing/setting powder that you’d use for your face). Step 5 : Apply another layer of lipstick using your lip brush. Step 6 : (Optional) Apply lip sealer if you choose to use one. Step 7 : (Optional) Apply lipgloss using a disposable lip wand to your lips. For a plumping effect, concentrate the gloss on the center of your bottom lip. ** Lip Plumper : depending on your type of lip plumper, it will either be a step you’d do before everything, or towards the end (if it’s a gloss). Most products are available at Nordstrom.com and Sephora.com .']",c685451e9ccd1451d41637e115a6eee3ee48f9ab,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/bridal-makeup-all-about-the-lips-wedding-makeup-for-lips-long-wearing-lipstick-all-day-lip-color/,['2008-04-22 00:00:00']

"['Ask Temptalia – Question & Answer Session #5 Features Jul 16, 2007 July 16, 2007 Q : Where can I find discounted MAC? I can’t afford MAC at retail price. A : My favorite place to find discounted MAC is at Makeup.com . They always carry various MAC products at slight discounts. Right now, though, there is a code for 50% off MAC orders of $50 or more, if you use code SAVE50 at checkout. This is such a great deal, and it is not as if MAC goes on sale at the actual MAC stores ? For brick & mortar shoppers, check for a Cosmetics Company Outlet store near you, which carries slightly discounted MAC and other Estee Lauder brands. Q : What do you use the most, Pigments or the regular eyeshadow? (If it’s eyeshadow, do you use the shiny eyeshadow or velvet? what kind) And do you know how to make eyes look smaller? A : I use both regularly – I generally use a pigment for nearly every look I do, but I also use several eyeshadows, too! I love all textures in eyeshadows. My favorite would be veluxe pearls, though. I know one trick that tends to make eyes look smaller is liner on both the upper and lower lash line. For some this opens up eyes, but on others it closes them quite a bit. Q : Do you find that your craft brushes are the best for applying your eyeshadow? I bought a new eyeshadow brush from the Body Shop yesterday and it’s pretty stiff. My less expensive brush is a lot softer, but I don’t know if that’s worse to apply eyeshadow with. What do you suggest? A : I apply my eyeshadow with a makeup brush, actually, but I have no problems with craft brushes. I would only recommend ensuring that it is extremely soft for shadow applications! Sometimes a brush will soften a bit after some use, though. I definitely suggest using whichever one works the best for you – so maybe try them both and return the one that doesn’t work so well! Q : I was wondering if you could reccommend a few (say 5 to 10) shades that you think are the most versatile and can be used in multiple looks. A : Five great staple eyeshadows to own would be Ricepaper (excellent neutral and highlighter), Carbon (matte black to darken any look), Bronze (warm chocolate brown), Goldmine (true yellow gold), Woodwinked (velvety brown), and Soft Brown (warm medium brown). Q : I was wondering if you could reccomend eyeshadows that are similar to Rye, Casablanca, Beauty Burst, and Canary Yellow, since they are all Limited Edition. A : Rye is such a tough color to find a permanent color that’s similar. You could try Patina, which is similar, but not all that close. Summer Neutral and Tendermetal were both extremely close in color, but those were also limited! Casablanca is really similar to Nylon eyeshadow. In place of Beauty Burst, you could try Texture eyeshadow. In the case of Canary Yellow, I’d try using Goldmine eyeshadow but then lightening it by adding a paler/white shadow to help bring down its intensity. Q : My left eye looks a little bigger then my right eye. Is there anyway for me to make them look even? Because of this, I try to avoid lining the top of my eye with eyeliner because it make it look worst. A : You might notice the difference because you are more critical of yourself, so the first thing is to figure out if the difference in size is noticeable to people around you. What you can do is try to emphasize the smaller eye by lining only the bottom or top, or using a white liner on the waterline to help open them up. Lighter shadows will also enlarge eyes. Q : Is there any specific product you’d recommend to use for contouring? I use the MAC NC 35 concealer. Also, what other shades of lipglass would you recommend I use? A : A lot of people adore Strada blush as a contour. It might be a tad light on you, so I would try it at the store befor eyou buy, if possible. Taupe blush is a great choice, too, but it is only available at PRO stores. Harmony blush is a darker, slightly rosier choice that can work on deeper skintones as well. For lipglass suggestions, I really like Lychee Luxe for a coral color; Russian Red for a glossy bright red; and Pink Poodle for a playful pink color. Q : I can’t afford every Mac brush you have for all the looks, can you list a set of eye brushes that I can use with everything ranging from smokey to natural looks? I read your list on the Brush section but I can’t find the Philosopy brush or the Benefit brush anywhere. I use brush 216 for blending but its alittle to big for my eye size!!! I see you have 252 but you use it occasionally. Do I really need to get it? A : You might want to check out your local craftstore and pick up high quality paint brushes. They work fabulously as cheaper alternatives for makeup brushes. Not only are they less expensive, but you can often get a really quality brush for the price you pay, too. The 252 is not at all an essential brush! I rarely use it. Also, keep an eye out for makeup brush sets, especially miniaturized or travel kits, because they tend to be discounted since you are buying in “bulk” so-to-speak. Here are a couple I found: Makeup.com Professional Brush Set 6 Piece Brush Set , Lola Cosmetics La Petite Brush Set Brush Set – 7 piece set , Clinique Brush Basics Set . Q : I’m just curious to know how many Pro stores are there in U.S. and where are they located?! A : I think there are about 5-10 PRO stores in the US. I know MAC has changed a handful of regular freestanding stores into PRO stores in the past year or is planning to in the near future. Your best bet is to go to macpro.com and do a find store search and locating stores that only sell MAC products. There are three PRO stores in California – San Francisco, Los Angeles, Costa Mesa, one in Las Vegas, another in Dallas, two in Florida (Miami & Orlando), as well as one in New York. Q : I am a female of color and just to give you a sense of my shade, my foundation of choice is MAC studio fix C7. I would like to know if you have any recommendation on blushes and eyeshadows that will compliment my skin tone, especially in the neutral, so that I can try the neutral look you have up, as well as any other suggestions you may have. A : If you want to go more neutral with blushes, I would definitely recommend going for Desert Rose for a dusty pink, Raizin for a darker bronze blush, and Style for a peachy-coral blush. As for eyeshadows, some of my favorite neutral permanent colors are Ricepaper, Bamboo, Expresso, Bronze, Shroom, and Mulch. Q : What do you use to remove the eye makeup? A : Most often I use Cetaphil cleanser, which removes the majority of my makeup. Sometimes when I have heavier makeup on, I will use makeup remover wipes to facilitate the process. One trick to getting stubborn makeup or waterproof makeup off is to use an oil-based remover, because oil breaks down makeup product, thereby making it easier to remove! ? Q : I love playing up my eyes but I’m stuck with not very much choice when it comes to color and designs. I can only use 1 color on my eyelids, maybe 2 if I apply a lighter color on the crease and brow section. I’m desperate for your suggestions. A : One way to brighten and open eyes is by using a white or light colored liner on the lower waterline. Sometimes minimizing the amount of dark or black liner can also help – some people find that lining both top and bottom lash lines are necessary, while others find that just the bottom is perfect or just the top opens up their eyes. The key is to experiment and see what works best for you. Another trick is to only use liner on the outer portion of the lash line, instead of the entire length of it. Q : I wanted to ask you if there is any trick to applying MAC’s paint as a base to the eye? When I use the paint, and then apply my eyeshadow it looks bumpy, caked up, and not smooth. I use MAC’s 217 brush to apply my shadow. Am I applying to much paint or not using the correct eye shadow brush? A : This is an interesting problem you are having! Have you tried to smooth the paint on your lid with the tip of your finger? It might help make sure it is completely smooth. I think there is a chance you are simply using too much paint. Try using less and seeing if that minimizes the bumpiness of it! The 217 doesn’t seem like the ideal brush to apply paints with; I would personally gravitate more towards a flat, stiff brush like the 242 or 252 for applying paints. Hope that helps! Thanks for all the questions! Keep sending them in to [email protected] . If you have a time-sensitive question, please let me know so I can try and answer it on time.

"['Wedding Makeup, Bridal Makeup, Wedding Tips, Bridal Beauty zArchived Apr 15, 2008 April 15, 2008 Common Beauty Fixes for Bridal Disasters Dark Circles It is important to know what you are trying to counteract; if you opt for something too light, you may get a gray cast to those dark circles you’re trying to conceal. I often find that color correctors are an absolute necessity to really counteracting any discoloration, including dark circles, especially as a prepping stem. Concealer should be a shade or half a shade lighter than your natural color foundation, and it is important that you be patient while applying concealer and do a thorough job. If you have noticeable wrinkling or lines around the eye, I suggest finding a primer that helps minimize noticeable lines by “filling” them in before you apply concealer. My favorite concealer is Kanebo’s Brush-On Concealer –it’s a little pricey, but it does the job well. Other cult favorites are YSL Touche Eclat (also pricey) and Dior Skinflash Radiance Booster (pricey again–see a trend?), but MAC Select Cover Up is a less pricey favorite, too. Tear-proofing Some brands make eye and lip sealers, which help to minimize the effects that water (aka your tears) will have on your makeup. Mascara is the easiest, as so many come in waterproof formulas these days–some, like Kanebo , have kinds that will only come off with water at a certain temperature (like lukewarm water that you’d wash your face with) and others like Clinique’s Lash Power last 24 hours (btw, take the Lash Power Challenge & score a free tube of Lash Power ). Liner is tougher, but it can be done, especially if you opt for liquid (Liquidlast by MAC will save your life!). Eyeshadows, blush, and foundation will be the most susceptible to sliding around with too much tearing. Kryolan has a makeup sealer that you can spritz on your face to minimize the effects that works decently. Benefit’s She Laq and Make Up For Ever Eye & Lip Seal can both be effective as well. I do prefer Kryolan , because it holds up better, though, but it is harder to track down. The most important thing you can do is to layer your makeup, including prepping and priming each area, regardless of whether you routinely do this in your everyday makeup. Stress Breakouts Go back to your basic skin routine, and be sure you are absolutely removing all of your makeup each night. It is important that you are getting the right intake of water on a daily basis as well as trying to get at least eight hours of sleep at night–and solid sleep, not constantly waking up. Wedding planning stress keeping you up? Try keeping a notebook by your bedside so you can jot down any last minute ideas or concerns before dropping off to sleep–this way you can deal with those in the morning. Also, reading a fun book may also help relax you (e.g. cheesy romance novels!) and get your mind on something else. Invest in either Zeno Pro Acne Clearing Device or Thermaclear Heat Enabled Acne Treatment to really banish those nasty zits pretty much overnight. Considering how much the average wedding costs, the cost of either gadget will be well worth it when you see your wedding photos (and much clearer skin). I’ve just found nothing that is more consistent and effective in really reducing and even eradicating that bothersome pimple that decided to pop up right on the tip of your nose two days before the big day. If you can, going to the dermatologist for a cortisone injection is also an option to consider. Plump Up That Pout Lining your lips helps to give an appearance that they’re fuller, as well as putting a touch of high shine gloss to the center of your bottom lip. Defining your lips (including accentuating your cupid’s bow) will also help to give an illusion that your lips are bigger than they normally are. Many brands also offer a whole slew of lip plumping products which basically increase the blood circulation of your lips, which then give a bee-stung pout effect. I prefer FusionBeauty LipFusion as my plumper of choice, though it is pricey. I found that it plumped well, held it for a few hours, and it didn’t burn like DuWop’s Lip Venom does (I couldn’t take the sting on that one!). Perfect Photographing One of the most important pieces of your bridal makeup choice is how it will reflect in photos. These are mementos you will be looking at for the rest of your life, and it is only natural to want to look your best. Part of this is recognizing that certain makeup and products photograph better than others. As important as SPF is, note that SPF often reflects light in photographs, which will make your face appear lighter than the rest of you (or wash you out). I always advise you to skip the SPF for this one occasion if it’s possible. If you burn easily and have an outdoor wedding, makeup artist Tosha suggests using MAC’s Prep + Prime SPF50 , because it is a primer so it’ll be layered with foundation and powder without SPF that it shouldn’t reflect light, especially since outdoor weddings do not utilize flash as often (and having to wear SPF is usually a concern for those having an outdoor wedding). Less shimmer means better photography. Flash just interferes with everything, doesn’t it? Shimmer may look fab in person, but it can often reflect too much in photos, causing you to have white spots or look washed out/too bright. It may accentuate wrinkles or problem areas, too. Opt for “adult shimmer” if you must, which is mostly ultra fine shimmer that goes on evenly and subtly. Test, Test, & Test Again This is your big day, and there is no reason to decide on makeup the night before. Practice the look you want, especially if you’re doing it yoruself, but more importantly, to test to see how it will hold up under reality. Mist yourself with water to see what happens if you sprung tears all over the place! Wear it for hours and see what it looks like–did your foundation slide around? Wear it out in hot conditions if you’re having an outdoor wedding! Eat a meal and check to see how much re-applying you have to do. Also, if you take take test shots of your makeup either with your own camera or the hired photographer’s–do it! This is totally going to help you determine how you’ll appear in photographs, especially candid shots. If you take these measures, you will be able to fine-tune and create a dream makeup routine that you know will work for your big day. Most products are available at Nordstrom.com and Sephora.com .

Focus On: MAC 224 Tapered Blending Brush MAC 224 Tapered Blending Brush ($28.00) is a long, fluffy brush with a dome-shaped tip designed for assisting you with blending out color. It can also be used to deposit color more subtly for those who need softer application. I do like using this as a highlighter, both on the face or on the brow bone. It’s not a brush I reach for often, as I tend to favor other brushes, but for some, this brush outdoes brushes like the 217 and 222. The fluffiness of this brush also makes it good for applying creamier products, like concealer, in hard to reach places (e.g. around the nose). The 224 is one of those brushes that many people swear by, and others will say they prefer another brush (e.g. the 222), so it’s most definitely worth taking a peek at next time you’re at a MAC store. It will certainly help you out with blending if that’s ever been a problem for you! How to decide between the 222 and 224? Think about what you’re going to use it for. If you’re looking for a brush primarily to help blend or deposit crease colors, you might opt for the 222 since it is narrower and thus allows for more control. If you’re more concerned with blending crease colors, the 224 makes it a cinch! How do you like to use this brush ?

"[""OCC Nylon Lip Tar Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Aug 20, 2012 August 20, 2012 OCC Nylon Lip Tar Does It Get Any Brighter Than This? OCC Nylon Lip Tar ($16.00 for 0.33 fl. oz.) is described as a “neon pink.” This color is electric–it’s absolutely a bold, bright neon pink with subtle blue undertones. I really think this is the brightest pink I own. MAC Dear Diary is darker, less bright. MAC Candy Yum Yum is a bit more magenta and less bright but comes the closest. OCC’s Lip Tars are supposed to have the wear of a lipstick with the ease of a gloss–long-wearing, lightweight, and satin-matte in finish. Nylon is insane . It’s blindingly bright. True to form, a little goes a long way for opaque color coverage. There is a learning curve with Lip Tar, but if you apply with a brush, you’ll learn quickly and easily. It’s just such a pigmented formula that if you over-apply, you’ll end up with too much product, which will end up on your teeth and will be prone to feathering. The texture is a creamy liquid, not so thin that it’s watery, but not thick or heavy. On the lips, it feels lightweight and sets after a couple of minutes to the satin-matte finish (initially, it may look a wee bit glossy, depending on how much product you’ve applied). When I wore this, it lasted for eight and a half hours–and there was still a pink-y stain left behind. (It stained my arm when I did a swatch for it, and it couldn’t have been on my arm for longer than a few minutes.) It lasted through a meal and two coffees. The best part, aside from the awesome wear, was that it wasn’t drying.

I spent the day at this year’s IMATS down in Pasadena, CA! I flew down in the early morning, and the lovely Pursebuzz picked me up on her way to IMATS. IMATS is basically a convention for makeup artists, and this year’s Pasadena show was sponsored by Make-up Artist Magazine . Temptalia definitely has to thank Make-up Artist Magazine for inviting us down to check out the show. I hung out a ton with Pursebuzz and her cousin Ames, as well as Koren (of EnKore Makeup ). I also met a ton of YOU while attending and perusing the show! It is such an honor to meet all of you, and it is just so amazing to see your support! I got to meet several other YouTube-famous ladies & gents like Leesha , Josh , Suzy , Nessa , Elle, Blair (my spelling may be off!), and more. Almost started to feel like a blogger convention! It made be sad to have to fly back home in the afternoon, but next year, I will try to plan better ? IMATS is really a great opportunity for makeup artists in particular, but the general public is allowed in and can peruse through all of the different vendors. There are a lot of theatrical brands and products available, as well as well-known brands like Bobbi Brown, Chantecaille, MAC, and Make Up For Ever. They also offer classes taught by various professionals and brands (like Koren’s class!), too! If you’re in the southern California area, you should definitely look into going and buying tickets at the door. They open at 10am and close at 5pm tomorrow! P.S. – If we took a picture together, I’d love to see it and/or post it on the blog. You can send me a copy (let me know if I can post it!) to [email protected] ! ? Some pictures… more to come ! We hit up MUFE first thing, because both Pursebuzz & I fully intended to go a bit nuts there. MUFE canvas-thing! Naked Cosmetics booth! Lots of pretty colors! Koren is doing a class for Naked tomorrow morning with Pursebuzz as his model. More vendors… Entry into the “Gothic” student show. Closer-up… Lunch time @ Islands across the street. Ames on the left, Pursebuzz on the right. Pursebuzz! Koren! There was a chalk show or contest… something going on outside, and this one of an eagle was my personal favorite. Stunning!

Origins takes its natural premise one giant leap further changing the beauty landscape by providing consumers with a new choice in personal care products through a collection of skin, body and hair care products certified to meet United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Organic standards. As the organic movement began to spread its wings from the produce aisles of grocery stores, Origins waited somewhat impatiently for organic capabilities to stretch to the beauty-care arena. “I Don’t Get Wasted” Shopping Bag | 100% Organic Cotton Canvas $10 What a fun tote bag! Be eco-friendly with this 100% organic cotton canvas tote bag, but fashionable with its cute design and slogan.

It’s quite large, so ladies with those mammoth purses (yes, I’m looking at you!), you’ll find it accommodating. BYO Toting this 100% certified organic cotton canvas bag when you shop makes great eco-sense. Each year, an estimated 500 billion to 1 trillion plastic bags are consumed worldwide. That comes out to over one million per minute. Billions of these bags end up as litter or in landfills each year. And to make the billions of paper grocery bags used annually, millions of trees are felled each year. Beyond helping to save the environment, 100% of the profits from the purchase of this bag will be donated to the Organic Farming Research Foundation.

"['SEPHORA COLORVISION: Nouveau Purples Site News Aug 20, 2012 August 20, 2012 SEPHORA’S COLORVISION is about transforming a face, a mood, or even an attitude. They had a vision: “Color sets the tone, ignites the moment, defines a mood as quickly as it transforms a look. Open your eyes to our bold new way to see, feel, learn, wear and love color.” Sephora has taken inspiration from this season’s color stories to create and explore a deeper connection to color. It’s less about a single trend, but rather a state of being. Sephora wants YOU opening your eyes to color, YOU connecting with color, and YOU feeling total color confidence. With their vast expertise, Sephora has created three distinct color visions inspired by the hues and shades of fall. The first vision to experience is NOUVEAU PURPLES. This fall, experiment with NOUVEAU PURPLES to bring out the eyes and find new ways to enhance your beautiful peepers beyond neutrals. Soft Eye Combine soft purples with effortless neutrals for a soft eye look that incorporates a dash of purple in the crease. Start by applying a light purple over the lids with small, feathered strokes, and blending just above the natural crease. Take the color and lightly glide it along the lower lash lines for added definition. Next, take a deeper shade of purple and apply it into the crease for a gently defined crease. Give lashes added volume by applying black eyeliner between top lashes and then smudging a dark purple eyeshadow along the upper lash line. As a final step, sweep a bronze shadow along the creases to balance the look and add warmth, and then finish with two coats of mascara. Sephora Recommends: Sephora + Pantone Universe Alchemy of Color Eyeshadow Palette ($34) Finish the Look: Urban Decay Super-Saturated High Gloss Lip Color in Lovechild ($19), Dior Blush in Strawberry Sorbet 943 ($42) Iridescent Eye Fall in love with the gorgeous hues of purple with a wash of iridescent shimmer–and it’s so easy and has just enough drama to make it interesting! Start by applying an iridescent navy shadow along the upper lash line and diffusing the color just beyond the outer corners. Next, blend a glimmering purple shade into the creases using small, feathered strokes and brush color along the lower lash lines. Finish by applying two coats of mascara over top lashes. Sephora Recommends: NARS Eyeshadow Duo in Marie-Galante ($34), Kat Von D Shade Shifter in Love Letter ($16) Finish the Look: NARS Lipstick in Dolce Vita ($24), NARS Blush in Madly ($28) Smoldering Eye For an intensely smoky, smoldering eye, bold purples will take your look to the next level of drama! Begin by sweeping a mushroom shadow over lids, blending from lash lines up toward the creases, and build up the color for richer coverage as desired. Next, layer on a shimmering amethyst shade and work from the outer to the inner corners, then wrap the color along the lower lash lines. To add definition, line top and bottom lids, including the inner rims, with black eyeliner. To avoid harsh lines, blend the pencil and shadow together. You can add warmth as well as dimension by sweeping a matte peach shadow above the creases and bring it along the lower lash lines. Finally, finish the look with two coats of mascara on top and bottom lashes. Sephora Recommends: Urban Decay Smoked Eyeshadow Palette ($49) Finish the Look: Kat Von D Painted Love Lipstick in Cathedral ($19), Tarte Amazonian Clay 12-hour blush in Dollface ($25) You can check out full how-tos and breakdowns of the looks from Nouveau Purple here .']",48a3296c3e5f8d304544d037bb31fdbfc40dced5,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/sephora-color-vision-nouveau-purples/,['2012-08-20 00:00:00']

"['MAC Cosmetics – Moonbathe Collection Review and Swatches Reviews May 31, 2007 May 31, 2007 MOONBATHE – Detailed reviews of individual products as well as swatches are behind the more link! Overall I felt like this collection was a good mixture of hues for the upcoming summer season, and it seemed as if this collection was different compared to the past few that have launched this year. I suppose if I was reminded of any prior collection, I would have to say C-Squeeze. I was pleasantly surprised by what purchases I actually made and what I was able to skip over. I found the majority of the lip products to be things I could pass on or colors I couldn’t see myself wearing more than once or twice. Those who want to test out vampy colors – there are plenty here! The colors of the collection seem to be a bit more muted, though still dramatic with the bold cranberry colors. What I purchased : Firespot eyeshadow, Other Worldly blush, Astral Rays and Ritzy! glimmershimmers, Molten Sol liquidlast liner, and Moonbathe lipglass. LIPSTICK Eclipse – Talk about a dark, vampy burgundy! This is a brown-burgundy that’s matte in texture (but not the yucky dry mattes like Blow lipstick was) with a decent amount of moisture in the lipstick so your lips won’t look chapped or cracked with this on. It was much too dark for me to feel comfortable in, even though the artist insisted on it. Honey Moon – The sheerest and lightest lipstick of the four, and I would say it is a pale, neutral pink with a touch of brown undertones. I could see this color washing out a lot of ladies, but it is gorgeous. Solar Plum – For those who liked Wild ‘Bout You, this is a chance to get a similar color (though more brown in it), only in a frost, so it is sheerer and buildable. It is also not nearly as potent in the color, which allows it to be more wearable for most users. Sunmetal – This is a bronzy, light-gold color, which I imagine looks good with deeper skintones, but I never seem to drawn to this color family in lipsticks. LIPGLASS Crescent – This color turned more orange-brown on me, and it was simply too dark for me to find it wearable. Dark Flower – This gloss reminded me a bit of Sex Ray lipglass with more brown undertones, which was limited edition awhile ago, but not so chunky, more shimmery. Elaborate – This is the typical sheer/clear gloss that MAC tends to put out in each collection; I had absolutely no use for this color, as I already own one too many in this family. Moonbathe – A cute watermelon color that would be great on less pigmented lips as a fun summer gloss, and quite lovely over darker lipsticks in need of a brightening for summer-wear. EYESHADOW Cranberry – In case you weren’t aware, Cranberry is an existing shade in the permanent MAC line, so unless you have a fancy for the creamy packaging, you can always pick up this shade later. I do like this shadow, though, so make sure to check it out at some point down the line. Claire De Lune – A faint white color with a touch of color, which turned a bit pink/purple on me, despite appearing like a light beige in the pot. The texture was a bit chalky for my liking, so I skipped this one easily. Cosmic – I thought this was an absolutely divine color, especially because it went on so smoothly and the color payoff was incredible. However, it instantly reminded me of Elite eyeshadow, which I owned at some point, and just never used. I know that I have near-dupes of Elite, so I had to pass on this color, too. Firespot – A great orange shadow without being over-the-top; it’s shimmery, has decent color payoff, and the texture is smooth enough to make it a very workable shadow. I like that it is an orange without being extremely bold/bright. This will be perfect in sunset-esque looks! Saturnal – Like Claire De Lune, this shadow felt more on the chalky side for me. I really like the color, if only for the fact that there isn’t one like it in the permanent line. Sadly, though, MAC launched a shadow called Sable Wrap in the last holiday palette collection, which is a dead ringer for Saturnal. LIQUIDLAST LINER Molten Sol – A gorgeous bronzy gold that looks beyond lovely, and if you enjoy bronzes and golds, you simply will be hard pressed to pass it up. Point Black – Repromote (permanent?) of a black liquid liner. BLUSH Afterdusk – I actually expected to be ga-ga over both the blushes from Moonbathe, but I found Afterdusk to be extremely chunky, instead of smooth. However, it did remind me a bit of Petticoat mineralize skinfinish, and since it is glittery, it might even be worthwhile for someone to check into a comparison between the two. Other Worldly – Going with the theme, this is a bronze/gold blush with a lot of warmth, and the best part is how smooth the texture is. It goes on like butter and almost feels like a cream blush in the pot (though it is a powder). GLIMMERSHIMMER Astral Rays – I fell in love with this color! It is such a gorgeous creamy color that I can see myself using it as a highlight not just on the face, but on collar bones and shoulders. You could definitely mix this with one of your favorite moisturizers for an all over shimmery look. Ritzy! – I think this is a repromote, but I don’t remember offhand. It is a lovely deeper bronze color than Other Worldly blush, and it does remind me an awful lot of a darker Melon pigment.']",9fb93a67473e7c33fed1a6ffa27fea67f73bad41,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-moonbathe-collection-review-and-swatches/,['2007-05-31 00:00:00']

"['Brushes I Use Regularly – Details and Photos zArchived Dec 03, 2006 December 03, 2006 From left to right: 1. Benefit 05 2. Loew-Cornell 1/8 7400 Angular (craftstore) 3. Loew-Cornell 1/4 793 Angular Flat (craftstore)* 4. MAC 194SE 5. Philosophy “Shadow”* 6. MAC 190SE 7. [Unknown] Stiff, thick angle* 1. Benefit 05 Benefit 05 brush is ridiculously soft and versatile. It is softer than my MAC eye brushes, actually, and it picks up color easily. This used to be my all-time favorite brush to apply and blend eyeshadow with, and sadly, it is discontinued as far as I know. Occasionally I will use this brush when I am using black eyeshadow, so I do not dirty up my regular shadow brush (#5) Also, it can be used to pick up shadow along the edge to apply more precisely, especially on the lower lash line. 2. Loew-Cornell 1/8 7400 Angular (craftstore) Yes, I use craftstore brush. Why not? I’ve yet to hear a compelling reason to avoid using them; they can be substantially cheaper compared to high-end brushes. You can always spend a little extra for a higher quality craftstore brush, as well, and still be under budget in comparison to cosmetic line brushes. This brush is insanely small, stiff, and thin. It is for absolutely precise lining, and I primarily use this brush when applying MAC’s liquidlast liners. This allows for you to have a lot more control over where you are putting the liner than with the liquidlast’s applicator. 3. Loew-Cornell 1/4 793 Angular Flat (craftstore) I adore this brush. If you’ve wondered how I’ve managed to get my eyebrows not to look like they want to run away… This is one of the two tools that do it (#7 is the other). It has extremely soft bristles, but it is also quite firm, which is perfect when I go to pick up MAC’s Expresso eyeshadow to fill-in my eyebrows. I use this to refine the edge of my inner brow and to fill-in the thinner parts of my brow, including the “tail.” It is thin enough to be able to give me a fine line, but not so thin that I get a sharp line, it naturally pushes the color out so it looks more natural from the get-go. 4. MAC 194SE I have only recently accumulated this brush, and I personally do not have many uses for it. It is meant to apply concealer, and I have used it to build up foundation in certain spots. Usually I will take a dab of Studio Fix Fluid with this brush and place it on the problem area, blend it out just a tad, and finish up the blending process with MAC’s 187 (#14). 5. Philosophy “Shadow” Hands down, this is the most important brush in my daily makeup application routine. I apply all my dry eyeshadow products with this brush, and I also use this brush to blend everything together or as I go. It essentially performs all of the functions to bring together any eye look. It’s fluffy, but still has a touch of firmness so you can have control over what you’re doing with the brush. In terms of picking up color, this brush accomplishes it fairly easily. I rarely have to pack on shadow in order to get pay-off (only when the shadow is fussy, not the brush!). However, the bristles of this brush could be softer, and I would say that is the only downfall of this brush. I use this brush to apply and blend shadow both on the lid and crease and on my lower lash line. 6. MAC 190SE Another recent acquistion, and I personally do not use it much, if at all. For me, it is simply not necessary, as I apply and blend my foundation with MAC’s 187 stippling brush (#14). However, this brush can be good to initially apply and brush out liquid foundation, because then you can smooth it out with the 187 or fluffy dome brush to buff it out to give your foundation an “airbrushed” or “flawless” look. 7. [Unknown] Stiff, thick angle* My aunt gave me some random makeup kit, and it happened to include this brush, and it somehow became an essential brush in order for me to fill-in my eyebrows. As I mentioned with Loew-Cornell’s 793 (#3), this is one of the two brushes I must use in order to fill-in my eyebrows. I simply pat this brush with Expresso eyeshadow and apply it to my inner brow portion (the thickest part), and it really is that easy and all that I use it for. Bristles are hard, but it is a stiff enough angle brush with a good width to cover the majority of the inner portion of my eyebrow. Currently, I am considering replacing this with a higher-end brush, because it is quite rough. From left to right: 8. MAC 168SE* 9. Loew-Cornell 3/8 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore)* 10. Loew-Cornell 3/8 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore)* 11. MAC 219 12. MAC 252 13. Loew-Cornell 1/2 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore) 8. MAC 168SE I bought this brush only a few weeks ago, but it has become a staple brush in my everyday look. It is meant to contour, and I use it for that purpose. I pick up a touch of bronzer (just a bit darker than my skin itself) and contour my cheeks. I consider this brush to be fairly soft, and it does a good job of taking a little product and making it go a long way. I personally do not like white brushes because you can see them getting dirty as soon as you use them (and sometimes they can get stained). The angled dome shape is perfect size to fit into the hollow of your cheeks in order to contour them. I have yet to use the brush to contour other parts of the face, and it could be harder to use in smaller areas that require more precision. 9. Loew-Cornell 3/8 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore) If Philosophy’s Shadow brush (#5) was the most important, this brush would be the second most important. I use it in every single one of my looks so long as there is a pigment involved. I apply all of my pigments wet, so I have to keep a separate brush that can take the wetness without having to worry about wanting to use dry shadows later on. I have two of these, because I like to have one for lighter pigments and one for darker pigments. They are small enough to allow for precision, but not too small that covering your entire lid is difficult. They do stain easily (which may be the nature of pigments), though. The bristles could also be a touch softer, but overall the firmness and shape of the brush make pigment application easy and worry free. 10. Loew-Cornell 3/8 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore) See above ? 11. MAC 219 At last we get to a MAC eye brush! One of many I bought, but this is one I was too lazy to return. I do not feel this brush is particular exceptional, and it is definitely not a must-have by any means. It is soft, but quite firm with the bristles coming to a slight point at the tip. The only use I have found for it is to apply shadow on my lower lash line, and I probably only use the 219 to accomplish this 4/10 times I apply shadow to my lower lash line, anyway. 12. MAC 252 Another MAC eye brush I forgot to return, so here it sits. It’s a flat, large shadow brush, but I find it too large to deal with application. It does not really allow for precision in terms of initially applying the shadow, nor the blending process. It isn’t too firm, but it’s not very fluffy, and I feel like it tends to eat up the shadow I pick up with it. I currently use this brush for extremely dark eye shadows (again, so I do not dirty up my main shadow brush), like if I use MAC’s Carbon eyeshadow. 13. Loew-Cornell 1/2 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore) This is a larger version of #9 and 10, and as a result of its size, the brush is less useful than its smaller counterparts. I do use it to apply pigment on my cheeks, sometimes, but I have not used this much lately. It tends to be a brush of the last resort. From left to right: 14. MAC 187* 15. Philosophy “Blush” 16. MAC 187SE 14. MAC 187 I am positive that most people have heard of this brush, and they have also heard numerous raves on it. I like the 187 (first positive MAC brush experience!), but I do not think it is the best brush ever made, and it is not my holy grail brush, either. Of course, I do not use mineralized skinfinishes, and I know most people use the 187 to apply those, so take what I say with a grain of salt. This brush is so soft and fluffy, and it is perfect for blending liquid foundation (I use Studio Fix Fluid) so that the finish is flawless. I did not find that it applied blush as nicely as my regular blush brush did (#15), so I’ve kept the 187 purely for foundation. Plus, I find that using it for liquid foundation makes it seem gross to use it for other things, too, unless it has been washed! 15. Philosophy “Blush” This used to be a staple brush for whenever I was applying blush and/or bronzer. It is reasonably soft and fluffy, not at all stiff and immovable. It picked up color well, and it did not seem to apply the blush heavily, either. There is nothing inherently wrong with this brush, because I have used it regularly since I have got it (at least a year ago), but since purchasing MAC’s 182 buffer brush, I have favored that instead. 16. MAC 187SE This is a smaller, machine-made version of MAC’s 187. I travel frequently, so it was worth picking up this miniature version of my staple 187. Plus, it was hard to pass it up with the price tag being so low (because you get four other brushes, too). In a comparison of this 187 and the regular 187, it isn’t quite as soft, and it feels denser than the larger 187. From left to right: 17. MAC 182 (Couture)* 17. MAC 182 (Couture) My newly acquired and beloved 182 buffer brush, Couture edition. This has to be the best MAC brush I have been able to use, and it accomplishes what it is supposed to do exceptionally well. I have been using it apply my blush on my cheeks, and also to blend the blush and contour lines together. Sometimes I use it to apply pigments as highlighters for my upper cheekbones, too. It works fabulously to blend all the various face products I have used throughout an application to help bring everything together. The brush is luxuriously soft and dense, picks up color like a dream, and applies wonderfully. I absolutely recommend this brush — so much so that I am seriously contemplating purchasing a second 182.']",584087335e5b7c749cbad0134ffd975b65a87d7b,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tools-brushes-i-use-regularly-details-and-photos/,['2006-12-03 00:00:00']
"['MAC Cosmetics – Congratulations, MAC Aids Fund Celebrates $100 Million Raised! Latest Collections Nov 14, 2007 November 14, 2007 This fall, the MAC AIDS Fund is marking a momentous milestone – $100 million raised to help fight HIV and AIDS around the world. The money represents the sale, over the past 13 years, of more than 7.1 million VIVA GLAM lip products of which 100 per cent of the sale price has gone to the work of the Fund. Our $100 million landmark has been reached with enormous commitment from our VIVA GLAM spokespeople, MAC makeup artists and dedicated customers, said MAC AIDS Fund Executive Director, Nancy Mahon. The only thing more exciting about reaching this milestone is the prospect of setting and reaching our next fundraising goal and continuing our grant-making and partnerships around the world. Helping to drive fundraising for the MAC AIDS Fund have been a cadre of celebrity spokespeople. Each connected with a specific shade of VIVA GLAM Lipstick, these 16 spokespeople have made public appearances and appeared in advertisements over the last 13 years to raise money and awareness for the fight against HIV and AIDS. The inaugural VIVA GLAM spokesperson was performer, RuPaul. Since then, others have joined the ranks, including k.d. lang, Mary J. Blige, Sir Elton John, Shirley Manson, Lil’ Kim, Missy Elliott, Boy George, Linda Evangelista, Chlo Sevigny, Christina Aguilera, Pamela Anderson, Debbie Harry and Lisa Marie Presley. Currently the face of the MAC AIDS Fund is R&B artist, Eve and burlesque star, Dita Von Teese. The celebrities who have joined us over the years embody the spirit of MAC and the MAC AIDS Fund. Every Race, Every Sex, Every Age, said MAC AIDS Fund Chairman and MAC President, John Demsey. By bringing these new faces to VIVA GLAM, we have been able to keep not only the brand but the cause fresh for consumers, helping to drive the MAC AIDS Fund to new levels. Among the first fundraisers in the HIV/AIDS arena to develop a consumer-based giving model, the MAC AIDS Fund has worked to replicate a firsts model throughout its grant-making. It is among the early funders of sometimes-controversial programs, like prevention education for sex workers in India and needle exchanges for street youth in Russia. ABOUT THE MAC AIDS FUND The MAC AIDS Fund, the heart and soul of MAC Cosmetics, was established in 1994 to support men, women and children affected by HIV/AIDS globally. MAF is a pioneer in HIV/AIDS funding, providing financial support to organizations working with underserved regions and populations. As the largest corporate nonpharmceutical giver in the arena, MAF strives to raise awareness of four key issues in the fight against HIV/AIDS: prevention, the link between poverty and HIV/AIDS, access to care, and adherence to medications and treatments. To date MAF has raised $100 million (U.S.) exclusively through the sale of MAC’s VIVA GLAM Lipstick and Lipglass, donating 100 per cent of the sale price to fight HIV/AIDS.

Face Time Cosmetics is founded by makeup artist Linsey Snyder, and for the holiday season, they have developed “Beauty In a Box,” which is a product specifically designed for the gift recipient. Linsey and her team of experts work with the customer using photos, hair color, skin tone, and personal tastes to create the ultimate customized beauty box. They even provide a “Face Card” with detailed instructions for application! It takes less than a week to have it customized and shipped to you! The custom beauty in a box is $150, but if you want to go another route, check out already selected items in Romantic, Stunning, and Sultry ($90). I recently had the pleasure of trying four of Face Time’s Well-to-Hue eyeshadows in Camilla’s Class (muted purple with subtle silver shimmer), Jamie’s Gem (rich medium-green with gold shimmer), Lauren’s Loyalty (white beige with gold undertones), and Virginia’s Vitality (matte medium pink). All of Face Time’s eyeshadows have been named after women who have influenced the company along with their “most valuable attributes.” Each shadow gave me great color pay off, felt like butter, and I liked that they come in a variety of shades to serve every woman’s needs. Of course, I fell in love with the green (who doesn’t love a green with a touch of gold in it?), and I tend to gravitate towards any white-gold colors, like Lauren’s Loyalty.

"['MAC Cosmetics – Tendertones Collection Review and Swatches Reviews May 31, 2007 May 31, 2007 TENDERTONES – Detailed reviews of individual products as well as swatches are behind the more link! Overall I wasn’t overly impressed by the Tendertones. They are sure lovely in their little glass pots (oh, and a tad heavy!), but I prefer my lip products in tubes, sticks, etc. because it is easier to grab and go with those. I’d rather not dip my finger into a product if I can help it, and let’s face it, I’m not the type of girl that is going to remember to carry a lip brush with her. Despite looking fairly pigmented on my hand, please take heed that I did swipe a good amount of product to get it that way. I put on Take A Hint on my lips, and I’m not exactly sure that it’s even on – it’s that sheer. They are very soft on the lips without being sticky, and they still give off a high gloss shimmer. Despite being soft, though, if you attempt to build up the color, you’ll end up with a very thick layer of the stuff, which is not nearly as delicious as the raspberry smell. What I purchased : Take A Hint tendertone. Deep Sigh – Sheer warm brown with light shimmer. Hush, Hush – Extremely light in color just by looking at the pot, and once applied, even sheerer; almost like a light nude gloss. Pucker – This looks gorgeous in the pot – a dark raspberry color – but so unimpressive swatched. It looks more watermelon than raspberry. Purring – I imagine once this is actually applied on lips, the orange color would not stand out so much. It does look quite bright in the pot, but it is easily sheered out during application. Shush! – I actually read this is as Sushi! instead of Shush – which would have been completely appropriate since it is green. This is was actually a very pretty color when swatched, with just the faintest green undertone. It would look lovely on top of other colors; kind of like a greener Luminary lustreglass. Softnote – This color instantly reminded me of Helium pigment if it were mixed with a bit of clear gloss. Take a Hint – A darker pink than Tender Baby, but still ridiculously sheer when actually applied to lips. Tender Baby – I was reminded of Fun Fun or Real Doll lipstick with this color, because it is a bit of a pale pink, but this is incredibly sheer. Warm Smile – This is too similar to Hush Hush, which is a light nude color. I would say this is a touch deeper, with more pink-orange warmth to it.']",11560d6729595d12c97a24885786ef6f907b82da,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-tendertones-collection-review-and-swatches/,['2007-05-31 00:00:00']

To view the entire series to date, be sure to visit the beauty basics , or you can view posts within the series about MAC Eye Brushes . Focus On: MAC 225 Large Tapered Blending Brush MAC 225 Large Tapered Blending Brush ($36.00) is large, tapered blending brush with a dome-shaped end. Think the 224 but about three times larger. It really is huge relative to your eye and most other eye brushes. (If you own the 227, it’s in the same realm of size.) Even though it’s classified as an eye brush, I personally use it as anything but. The fluffiness of the bristles, yet the overall denseness of the brush, allows for great application of creamy products like concealer and blush cremes. It’s also incredibly soft with no scratchiness or harshness whatsoever. When using it with concealer, it helps me conceal problem areas/blemishes with a more natural result. I have also used this for highlighting when I want/need more precision – like the nose, right on the cheek bones, etc. If you want to do a soft wash of color all over the lid, this is up to that task. I just find it too large for any precise eyeshadow application, and I much prefer using many of MAC’s other smaller brushes like the 239, 217, 222, etc. for that purpose. P.S. – I think this brush has been discontinued, but I found it at my local MAC store. You might check yours or a CCO (if you are jonesin’ for this brush). How do you like to use this brush ?

"['MAC 225 Large Tapered Blending Brush Photos & Review Reviews Jun 21, 2009 June 21, 2009 Beauty Basics: MAC Eye Brushes Beauty Basics is a series covering basic products and tools that help to make applying your makeup easier. To view the entire series to date, be sure to visit the beauty basics , or you can view posts within the series about MAC Eye Brushes . Focus On: MAC 225 Large Tapered Blending Brush MAC 225 Large Tapered Blending Brush ($36.00) is large, tapered blending brush with a dome-shaped end. Think the 224 but about three times larger. It really is huge relative to your eye and most other eye brushes. (If you own the 227, it’s in the same realm of size.) Even though it’s classified as an eye brush, I personally use it as anything but. The fluffiness of the bristles, yet the overall denseness of the brush, allows for great application of creamy products like concealer and blush cremes. It’s also incredibly soft with no scratchiness or harshness whatsoever. When using it with concealer, it helps me conceal problem areas/blemishes with a more natural result. I have also used this for highlighting when I want/need more precision – like the nose, right on the cheek bones, etc. If you want to do a soft wash of color all over the lid, this is up to that task. I just find it too large for any precise eyeshadow application, and I much prefer using many of MAC’s other smaller brushes like the 239, 217, 222, etc. for that purpose. P.S. – I think this brush has been discontinued, but I found it at my local MAC store. You might check yours or a CCO (if you are jonesin’ for this brush). How do you like to use this brush ?

"['Celeb-a-Like – Jessica Alba’s Makeup in Neutral and Bronze Nov 15, 2007 November 15, 2007 JESSICA ALBA is looking dewy, fresh-faced, and supremely natural (although her lashes make me wonder…). This is a fabulous look for any occasion, any time of the year, because it’s incredibly fitting to her complexion and natural features. I recommend MAC’s Face & Body Foundation for a great finish that is a touch dewy. Using a flat concealer brush, like the 194, use it to put dabs of the foundation on your cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin. Spritz a fluffy brush like a blush or a buffer brush with Fix+ (or flick some water onto the brush with your fingers) and go over the dabs of foundation, sheering them out and giving yourself coverage. With the 188 fibre-duo brush, apply a touch of MAC’s Natural minearlize skin finish on cheeks for just a touch of warm glow. Alternatively, use a subtle blush like MAC’s Springsheen and dust lightly on the apples of the cheeks. Apply MAC’s Bamboo eyeshadow all over lid with the 239 brush to cover any imperfections of the lid while keeping the eyes naturally beautiful. Use MAC’s Soft Brown eyeshadow in the outer crease, putting just a touch on the outer lid, and blend softly with the 239 brush. Alba’s lashes are a thing of beauty, and whether or not they’re real, you can still get these lovelies with MAC’s #1 lashes , which are a natural length with a clear band. Take the 266 brush and dip it in Blacktrack fluidline and line along the upper lash line to give the illusion of even fuller lashes. You may want to prime your natural lashes with MAC’s Plushlash in Plushblack for extra blackness and volume. Opt for one or two coats of mascara on lower lashes, but avoid lining them. It is likely that Alba just slicked her lips with lipgloss, because her lips are quite natural-colored. However, MAC’s Fresh Brew lipstick is a great nude lip color, especially when paired with C-thru lipglass. If you prefer using lip liner first, MAC’s Summerfruit cremestick is an excellent choice for any neutral lip product. Smile with your eyes, and you’ll be one stunning celeb-a-like!']",f94af577bd74c777536170f83454b52c6ddf2a99,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/celeb-a-like-jessica-albas-makeup-in-neutral-and-bronze/,['2007-11-15 00:00:00']

We all love that moment when we finally get to unwrap our Christmas presents and find out what’s inside â€“ but once we’re done unwrapping, we’re left with a pile of unwanted gift boxes, decorations and gift wrap that is hastily thrown away. Here at LUSH we have the environmentally friendly alternative to Christmas gifts. Not only can loved ones be treated to deliciously fresh handmade cosmetics, but all of our festive gifts are lovingly wrapped by the LUSH elves using 100% recycled paper and prettily tied with recycled paper ribbons — so you can give that amazing present and help save the planet.

It’s a wearable scent, so don’t fear that you’ll be smelling like pine. I also love that this is one sparkly green shower jelly. So much fun in the shower! The Jingle Spells bath bomb is adorable, because it’s purple with silver star sparkles/sequins in it, and it smells divine. The Green Green Bath of Foam bubble bar is in the shape of a Christmas tree with red lights/ornaments. I love it! Definitely an adorable gift to give.

"['MAC Cosmetics Collection as of September 2007 Features Sep 04, 2007 September 04, 2007 This is my collection as it stands September 1st, 2007. Obviously with SO many huge collections coming out, it’s likely to grow quite a bit in the next few months, lol! Just as an “FYI” type introduction to my collection, please realize that I have been a huge MAC Cosmetics fan since late 2004, so it isn’t as if I acquired everything in a matter of a few days.

"['Ask Temptalia – Question & Answer Session #3 Features Jun 20, 2007 June 20, 2007 Q : I love love love MAC paints as eyeshadow bases, but my tubes always gush like crazy and i lose ALOT of product! Is there anything I can do? I squirted one into a screw top container like others do with pigment samples and it dried out! HELP A : Here’s a tip I know has worked for a ton of people: unroll the bottom part! This should help minimize the gushing! Let me know if it does help. Q : I like to apply a beige e/s over the entire lid, and then just a brown line in the upper and lower lash line for a very classic, understated look, but after 30 minutes my eyes look gray, tired, awful! SOS, which one do you recommend for this not to happen? I’m NC 25-30, yellow undertones, hazel eyes. A : Perhaps try using a similar colored eyeshadow like Grain or Yogurt eyeshadows to help set the shadestick. Alternatively, you could invest in Untitled or Architecture paint and try it that way! Q : I bought Seedling eye shadow from Strange Hybrid, but I dont know what I can use it with? A : Seedling is a neutral color, so first off, it would be great in ANY combination of other neutral colors like Bisque or Ricepaper, Expresso or Amber Lights, and so on and so forth. For a different look, try using Seedling eyeshadow all over your lid and do a bold, dark crease like Shadowy Lady eyeshadow. You could also pair it with golds to brighten it or greens to tone them down. Q : My first one is I thought you had to be a MAC Pro member in order to purchase from the store and online? My second is are you from NYC? A : No, you do not have to be a PRO member to purchase from the store in-person or if you call up an actual PRO store to place a phone order. However, to be able to purchase online, you DO need to be a PRO member. Nope, I’m located in California, way far from NYC ? Q : I was wondering if you own or ever had the Strobe Cream and if you use it, do you use it as a highlight, primer, moisturizer, etc.? A : I do own it, and I used to use it regularly. I’ve kind of forgotten about it (it’s a touch expensive IMO!), but when I was using it, I used it mostly as a moisturizer before putting on the rest of my makeup. It gives a great light shimmery glow, though. Q : Could you please tell me where to find your eye diagram? The one where you drew the different regions… inner lid, outer lid, etc. I searched and couldn’t seem to relocate it. When you are not otherwise notating a pigment or creme color base, what can we assume you are using for your base? (ie. neutral 012) A : You can find the diagram here: https://www.temptalia.com/tutorial-eye-diagram-eye-parts . I generally list all products in the order I use them, so if the first product is a shadow, it means I didn’t use a base! ? In Neutral 012, for example, I didn’t use a base. Q : Would you have recommendations for a substitute MAC eyeshadow for Say Yeah? I love how this color ties a look together but can’t find it in our counters, so any recs would be very helpful. Thanks! A : Say Yeah is a flesh toned eyeshadow – it is similar to Ricepaper eyeshadow or Grain eyeshadow for me, but with more shimmer. I generally use it as a highlighter or brow color, so it’s very easy to swap out without affecting the look! Thanks for all the questions! Keep sending them in to [email protected] . If you have a time-sensitive question, please let me know so I can try and answer it on time. If you didn’t see your question, check for it in the next Ask Temptalia post.']",2c83fb1854664a2efebdefe6a334d8d7d4001b2e,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/ask-temptalia-question-answer-session-3/,['2007-06-20 00:00:00']

"['Make Up Tips – Temptalia’s Top 10 Makeup Tips Tutorials Oct 02, 2007 October 02, 2007 Last week I asked readers to give their three best makeup tips to beginners when it came to makeup. Now, I’m going to share my top ten make up tips I think are important for anyone at any level or skill. These are in no particular order! Accentuate your favorite features, and remember that focusing on one feature per look tends to achieve a better overall look. Doing dramatic eyes, cheeks, and lips can sometimes take away from beauty because it comes out overdone and perhaps even “clownish.” This is not to say you shouldn’t or you can’t do bold eyes and lips; it is more a word of caution when it comes to doing multiple focal points. Confidence is the most essential piece to what you wear out. Anybody can rock any color eyeshadow, blush, or lipstick/gloss as long as they have the confidence to back it up. Being comfortable in your makeup is vital, because the awkwardness or self-consciousness will definitely be picked up by others. So, honey, take that bright blue shadow you’ve been lusting over, but haven’t dared to wear, and pull it off by just realizing how amazingly beautiful you are and how much fun can be had with experimentation and trying colors that aren’t your norm. Looking polished is easily achieved by complimenting your makeup and not forgetting the parts of your face. Those with naturally fabulous skin can do well simply by moisturizing (and if you feel the need, a light powder or concealer), and others who have less-than-perfect skin have so many variations and formulas of foundation available to them to turn that skin into even, smooth, flawless-looking skin. Perfecting the skin can do wonders on your confidence, because so many of us fret over those teenage acne scars or the slight rosacea some of us have, and other various skin “flaws.” Sparse eyebrows are easily turned into glamorous sisters by gently filling them in. Lips are defined by lip liner and/or lipstick, or even a light gloss with only a hint of color to give off an image of lush puckers. Eyes can be enhanced with nothing but natural brown mascara, to lengthen and thicken lashes just slightly. Finding your natural or preferred brow shape is something that can brighten up your face without even putting on a single swipe of makeup. It’s important to maintain your eye brows once you’ve found the right shape to compliment your eyes as well as your face. I really do suggest having them shaped professional for the first time or two, and then you can do upkeep and maintenance of that particular shape. I personally made the mistake of having a friend do mine years ago, and it has taken me a good two to three years to get them to a decent shape! Experiment, experiment, experiment. I cannot say it enough. You will learn what kinds of techniques work for you, what shapes and colors you like the most on yourself, and how to have fun with being creative when it comes to makeup. When makeup is a chore, that is the first sign that you are not experimenting enough! Try things that are out of your comfort-zone; it isn’t as if you have to leave the house with whatever look you attempt. That’s one of the best aspects of makeup: it washes off. It’s not permanent. Try blue and orange and green together, try Russian Red lipstick. Just don’t be afraid to test the waters, because makeup can be an amazing outlet for all of your artistic inclinations. Take good care of your skin, because as mentioned earlier, skin is a piece of beauty that will always be a feature you want to accentuate regardless of where you are in life. Make sure to moisturize regularly, be religious when it comes to sunscreen usage, and take the time to thoroughly cleanse the skin at least once daily to remove the day’s dirt and grime (and makeup!). Also, one of the easiest ways to improve and maintain your skin is by drinking at least eight glasses of water a day. Tools and the quality of them can really make a difference in the application process. Quality tools do not necessarily mean high priced, high-end. There are reasonably priced alternatives, and it is a matter of looking around and being creative. Craft stores often carry brushes made for painting, and the kind of brushes you would use for makeup application will often be cheaper, but still good quality, than a high-end line’s similar brush. Also, Sonia Kashuk is a line found at Target that makes decent brushes for a price worth noting. Of course, high end brushes are often going to be better in quality, they are not necessary to have the skill and talent to do flawless makeup. Skills far outweigh brush quality in the end. It is important to wash your tools periodically, and more often for ones used for skin products or cream products to minimize bacteria growth and transference. Even using baby shampoo on brushes is an easy and cost-effective way to clean them. If you are just entering the world of beauty and makeup, don’t feel compelled to buy every product you see if your pocketbook does not allow it. Not everybody has a lot of disposable income to spend on makeup, and it is important to discover inexpensive products to supplement more expensive ones. Think of products like mascara, eyeliner, lip liner, etc. as accessories to good makeup, and think of a well pigmented eyeshadow or blush as a classic piece. Dress up those few classic pieces by using inexpensive accessories. Neutral eye shadows do not need as much pigmentation as does a bright pink eyeshadow, so going drugstore means you won’t necessarily sacrifice quality. Drugstore lines have come a long way, and there are comparable products to be found. Many drugstores also offer a return policy, even if you’ve used/open the product, which allows you to test and see what works (and what doesn’t). Beauty holds a different meaning for each person. Don’t be afraid to do your makeup the way you want to, the way you feel best accentuates your features and enhances your beauty. Think of all beauty “rules” more like guidelines as to what often works but doesn’t always work. Just like the tip that states that bold lips, cheeks, and eyes can be overwhelming is more of a guideline than an absolute “do not do this.” Breaking so-called beauty rules takes confidence — can you see how some of these tips really tie together? Criticism comes in many forms , some of them quite hurtful, and others with good intentions. Try to be receptive to criticism that means well, and try to let hurtful criticism roll off your back. We never stop learning in our lives, and the same can be said when it comes to beauty and makeup. Listen to what someone has to say, and try to see whether you agree, can see where they’re coming from, or if they’re crazy. For a long time, I focused on my eyes and forgot the rest of my face, and it took me awhile to see that people who told me to think about using blusher or lipgloss had good intentions, and now I love to use both.']",45cf03675b840bdb489fd4d7f4240dae65767a58,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/make-up-tips-temptalias-top-10-makeup-tips/,['2007-10-02 00:00:00']

"['Report – Nordstrom Cosmetics Trend Show November 2007 zArchived Nov 15, 2007 November 15, 2007 I attended Nordstrom’s Cosmetics Trend Show this past weekend, and now it’s time to share some of the tips and tricks shared throughout the show with my dear readers. The show was divided into three scenes: Matte Skin, Lined Eyes, and Red/Burgundy Lips. SCENE 1: MATTE SKIN This season’s extra-fine matte finish creates a natural yet flawless look. Unlike the heavier mattes of the ’90s, today’s mattes are more lightweight and transparent, offering you healthier and brighter-looking skin without the shine. You’ll feel fresh and rejuvenated in this fall trend. Product spotlights: Diorskin Extreme Fix Long-lasting Setting Powder | A universal color suitable for all wearers to help set foundation and liquid products for ultimate day-long wear. DiorShow vs. DiorShow Unlimited | Unlimited as a skinnier brush than DiorShow, which allwos for more precision and getting every single lash. Prescriptives Custom Blend Bronzer | Prescriptives recommends ensuring you have both a winter and summer bronzer, rather than a year-long one to achieve great, natural-looking skin. Fusion Beauty SkinFusion Micro Tech Soft Focus Fluid Foundation | With SPF 10, this is a colorless foundation that activates with your skin to match your color flawlessly. Trish McEvoy Brow Builder | Build fuller eyebrows with this brow extension product. There’s so much more for me to tell you! SCENE 2: LINED EYES Dynamically lined eyes gtive power and strength to this season’s makeup. Apply black, grey, or slate liner to top lashes for a flirty flare or a bold rocker look. Apply to jsut the lower lashes for a tough, chic, edgy look. When eyes are drawn in black, lips are done in more natural tones. It’s not about hiding the lips–it’s about keeping the focus on the eyes. Product spotlights: Clarins Advanced Extra-Firming Neck Cream | The neck is one area that even plastic surgery can’t fix so protect with SPF! Shiseido Accentuating Cream Eyeliner | Fade, smudge, and water proof! Philosophy Microdelivery Peel | In the morning, you need Vitamin C; in the afternoon, suncreen; at night, retinol–plus a peel every now and again. MAC Cosmetics Lashes | A whole slew of false lashes that are to die-for, all newly revamped by celebrity lash artist Christina Smith, and now with clear bands. SCENE 3: RED/BURGUNDY LIPS Saturate your lips in scarlet, burgundy, or aubergine hues this fall. Vamp up this look with ultra-gloss, or smooth it down with matte pigments. With all the attention on lips, eyes are done with a hint of color and defined with mascara. Product spotlights: Estee Lauder Signature Lipstick | Great shades to suit you, and a plethora of reds with every undertone you could think of. Clinique Supermoisture Makeup | It was pushed through a soft serve machine (like for ice cream!) to get the rich, luxurious texture. Lippman Spray On, Get Off | Remove those tough calluses with this easy technique.']",8c16a63211417ce4d15394272f44b115c6788fd3,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/report-nordstrom-cosmetics-trend-show-november-2007/,['2007-11-15 00:00:00']

The collection includes 16 products, 12 hand blended specifically for the AW 07 McQueen show by Terry Barber, MAC Cosmetics Director of Makeup Artistry and lead makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury just days before the show. The classic MAC Cosmetics packaging is stamped with the Alexander McQueen logo, as if plucked straight from the makeup artists table backstage. When we embarked on the packaging, I wanted to have the sense that these are really just imprints by Alexander McQueen, fresh, hot off the runway. They are meant to be direct from the runway and feeling on trend, says James Gager, Senior Vice President/Creative Director for MAC Cosmetics. Since 1996 MAC Cosmetics has worked with Alexander McQueen backstage by providing makeup and artistry support. â€œThe makeup for a show plays up certain elements of the clothing, changes the overall feeling, and mood. I work with the key artist, Charlotte in this case, to take the makeup in a certain direction, and discuss my original inspiration for the collection as well as the mood, theme, and focus for the show. This time inspiration was derived from Elizabeth Taylor in the 1963 film Cleopatra. The Egyptian influence plays up a very feminine sexual strength that was present in my inspiration for the collection, says Alexander McQueen. This marks the first time Alexander McQueen has partnered with a cosmetics company. Keep reading for detailed information about the Eyes and Lips, as well as collection information, on Alexander McQueen’s inspiration behind the collection. The Eye The look features a highly structured eye achieved with Kohl Power Eye Pencils, Paint Pots and Eye Shadows. Eye brows are drawn in Velvetone to create the stark handsome brow that frames the brightly pigmented lids and brow bone. Paint pots in colours created by Terry Barber and Charlotte Tilbury specifically for the AW 07 show range from Pharaoh a creamy yellow green, Otherworldly a mid-tone sea blue to Electro Sky an intense royal blue. Another dimension is added to the eye by layering eye shadows over the paint pots in matching shades designed specifically for this collection. Eyes are outlined with Kohl Power pencils in Jealous, Black Karat, and Feline. MAC 20 lashes reinforce the thickly lined eyes. â€œAlexander McQueen was very specific about the makeup direction and I translated his ideas of Egyptian, graphic, bold coloured makeup into a look that was strong yet hypnotic; which was very much in the spirit of the show, said key makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury. The Lip Custom created by Terry Barber and Charlotte Tilbury, Archetype and Masque lipstick, were used as a base layers with Nothingless, or White Magic Lipglass on top to create the soft pale lips. The Glow Mineralize Skinfinish in New Vegas was polished into the cheeks to give the final gilded touch to the look. A makeup artist favorite, MAC Mineralize Skinfinish gives skin a subtle glow, casting the slightest metallic hue over cheekbones. Four time winner of the British Designer of the Year award and 2003 CFDA International Designer of the Year, Alexander McQueen left school at 16 to begin an apprenticeship with several well known London tailors. His study of design and career in fashion grew as he moved on to work for theatrical costumiers, designers and completed his Master’s Degree at London’s St Martin’s in 1994. His entire degree collection was purchased by Isabella Blow, former Fashion editor of Tatler and famously eccentric matron of fashion. He is now one of the most internationally renowned fashion designers, known for incredible tailoring, pairing of the dark with the romantic and ingeniously theatrical runway shows. MAC Cosmetics expresses its support of the fashion world by working with makeup artists at over 160 shows during the international collections with the MAC PRO team behind the scenes in New York, London, Milan and Paris. MAC (Make-up Art Cosmetics), a leading brand of professional cosmetics, was created in Toronto, Canada in 1985 and is now part of The Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. The company’s popularity has grown through a tradition of word-of-mouth endorsement from makeup artists, models, photographers and journalists around the world. MAC is now sold in over 55 countries worldwide. View Alexander McQueen full-size collage here .

"['MAC Cosmetics – Of Beauty Review, Swatches, Product Photos Reviews Nov 15, 2007 November 15, 2007 Overall, I adored the beauty powders, but how could I not? (And did you expect me NOT to?!) I adored them so much when they were released earlier at the PRO store (if you didn’t know, Dancing Light, Drizzlegold, and Natural Flare are all permanent in the PRO line, along with several others) that I picked up every single one of them, whew! I find that the texture of these is incredibly silky, they’re luxuriously fine-milled and have such a perfect amount of shimmer in them to highlight the face and body. My favorite was Soft Flame, because it was the most gorgeous deep pink-plum color. I also loved the 183 brush, but with two 182s, I managed to save my pocketbook from that one! Launching Studio Lights alongside the beauty powders is quite genius, because Studio Lights are creamy in texture, they’d be excellent to put on cheekbones to highlight and then set with a touch of one of the loose beauty powders for ultimate long-wear. P.S. — Don’t forget that Curiositease also came out today, and you can see our full review, swatches, and product photos here . Beauty Powders Dancing Light is a gorgeous light white gold with soft yellow undertones. Drizzlegold is a luxe bright gold color with peachy undertones–more orange than Dancing Light. Natural Flare is a shade that is bound to be coveted by warmer skintones, because it’s a darling light peachy-pink shade that gives that ever-sought-after “glow.” Sunspill is such a pigmented beauty powder in a gorgeous orange-coral–definitely fitting in with its name. Very lovely, would give a soft peachy glow for most skintones. Tenderdusk is a delightful light pink, not cool like Micro Pink, but not too warm, either. It’d make a great highlighter on top of bolder blushes to add both shimmer as well as lighten a touch. Soft Flame is my new favorite beauty powder (previously it was Peach Haze); it is the most divine plummy pink shade. This is definitely one of the powders you could wear as a blush, not just a highlighter, which makes it a multitasker–always good in my book. I’m just in love with the color itself and the bits of shimmer in it. Studio Lights Skin Lure is a peachy, fleshy color that I imagine would be quite lovely on warmer skintones, but probably wouldn’t work as well for incredibly light skintones (just might come out too dark as a highlighter). Ideal Pink is a pinky color, very creamy, and it’ll be an awesome highlighter for very light skintones for sure; not to say that it wouldn’t be rockin’ on just about everybody. It’s such a subtle color of pink, and the texture is just lovely. Smoothspice is the deepest warm brown color, and it is definitely not a universal shade by any means. I am positive you could find a way to use it on lighter skin tones if it was incredibly sheer, however I see it as a shade meant for deeper colors like NC45+. But hey, maybe you could use it as a contouring color, even though it’s warmer than I’d personally like in a contouring color. Frangipan is a pale yellow, and I’d say this one is my favorite out of the bunch, because I find it flattering for most skin tones. It gives you such a lovely golden glow, and I could see it being used on cheeks, browbones, and even body. Sand is not nearly as dark as Smoothspice, but it does seem more pigmented than the others. When you sheer it out, though, it’s actually very nice. I find it comparable to Natural Flare in Studio Light form, actually! Brushes 183 Flat Buffer Brush is a ridiculously soft-bristled flat buffer brush with a good amount of firmness to it, making it excellent to apply these beauty powders on cheeks as well as body. 188 Small Duo Fibre Face Brush is great for those who want to deposit less to give more–especially if anyone is fearful of too much shimmer, this allows the user to apply and build the shimmer better. 222 Tapered Blending Brush is a brush that many use as a staple brush for crease and blending work, and it is great for those things, as well as highlighting the browbone.

"['A Bridal Makeup How-To For All Seasons: Summer zArchived Jun 27, 2007 June 27, 2007 Every bride wants to look her most beautiful on her wedding day , however that may translate in her eyes. It might mean dramatic siren red lips or soft neutrals on her lids. Each bride and her wedding are different enough to warrant a full spectrum of great full face looks that would match her taste and style. However, there are often several common themes that tend to appear when finding inspiration for bridal looks. Because bridal makeup encompasses such a large range of potential looks, this is only one part of a series of bridal make-up tutorials. Some brides like to use the season to help determine the color theme of their makeup, which is a great starting point! SUMMER is warm, breezy, and makes destination weddings so much more popular! Soft bronzes, golds, and tans are all excellent choices in creating a fresh summer eye and face. First and foremost, make sure you choose your base carefully – you want something that will not budge or crease. Some potential products might be Urban Decay’s Primer Potion, MAC’s Prep + Prime Eye, or L’Oreal’s Decrease. Additionally, Benefit’s She-laq may be great to go over the look to help seal in the color and prevent it from fading/running if you get misty. Try using a light white gold shadow all over the inner lid, with a touch of truer gold or a more antique gold on the very outer lid, use a deep, warm brown in the crease to bring dimension to the eye, and finish with a matte or satin finish neutral highlighter shadow above crease and underneath the brow. Opt for liner or do without, but it is a good idea to invest in a smudge-proof, budge-proof, cry-proof product. I definitely recommend MAC’s Blacktrack fluidliner for this purpose; a stiff angled brush like the 266 makes for a prime applicator. Just like the liner, mascara should also be waterproof for all the tears of joy many brides cry. There are a wide range of waterproof mascaras, and it is likely that there is one in your favorite brand/product! To keep the face in the summer theme, think bronzy, glowy, golden goddess. Start by applying your favorite moisturizer, and then apply your favorite foundation (haven’t found one yet? Try Everyday Mineral’s for mineral makeup or MAC’s Studio Fix Fluid for liquid foundation!) all over face, with a light hand. Products like Benefit’s High Beam or MAC’s glimmershimmers make for excellent highlighters that can add a healthy dose of “glow.” Place these types of products on the top of cheekbones and a touch on the temples. Contour the hollow of your cheeks to further define the face by using a slightly darker color than your natural skin. Contouring can be accomplished using several different types of products, including darker foundations, tinted moisturizers, bronzers, or blushes. If you fall in the NW/NC15 category in MAC shades, try Strada blush. For NW/NC30s, I recommend Taupe or Strada blushes, and warmer complexions might find bronzers to work best. Deeper complexions beyond NW/NC45 might find Blunt, Format, or Harmony powder blushes complimenting. A good blush color would lie in a warm, bronze family; to go bolder in color, try a coral with a lot of warmth or even a subtle watermelon pink. I find MAC’s Dollymix, Foolish Me, Margin, Peachtwist, and Springsheen to all be great choices. Just be sure to use a light hand when dealing with blush so you can build to the right intensity. Some brides might find a bronzer to be a perfect blusher with this look. Because the eyes are more subtle than dramatic, the choice in lip pairing is extraordinary. For bold lips, a dark red or brown with a coral tint, something with warmth, which is one common characteristic of this look. I would opt for a coral lip gloss to increase the warmth of the lip, as most reds may be too potent in this season. In general, bold lips for this look could be simply going with a deep coral like MAC’s CB96 lipstick and pairing it with a neutral/sheer gloss to add high shine. As always, it is the bride’s choice, but when using extremely bold colors on any part of the face, definitely do several test-runs before deciding. Lighter lips using “my-lips-but-better” shades work extremely well, especially when paired with a pinky coral gloss. Make sure if you are using regular lipstick to line lips and even fill them in (find a liner close to your lip color) to add lasting power to your lip combination. Otherwise, think about investing in long-wearing lip-wear like MAC’s prolongwear collection (most cosmetic brands offer long-lasting lip colors in their product lines). These products will allow you to kiss your honey at the altar without getting color all over his lips! Not to mention, many of these products last eight or more hours, which means you’ll spend less time worrying about your fading lip color and more time enjoying yourself at the reception. Some looks I have done in the past that may give you a few ideas: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 But what if I want dramatic? Color? Even though summer reminds me a lot of bronzes and golds, it does not mean that a more dramatic eye or one with more color than simply bronzes and golds will not work! Try adding more dark brown to the outer lid or increasing the amount in the crease to dramatize the eye. Add a matte black shadow for even more smokiness. If you are looking to add a splash of color, think about the colors that are being used in the wedding; if many of the flowers are pink, perhaps try a combination of gold and pink, with the pink being used on the outer lid and crease. Even a light pink all over the lid with a darker cranberry color on the outer lid and crease will create a lovely look. Stay tuned for the next installment: FALL!']",b04e2c6cfdfaaff5b9f7ba33f2a398864285ac95,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/a-bridal-makeup-how-to-for-all-seasons-summer/,['2007-06-27 00:00:00']

The first thing I noticed was there was the slightest scent to all of Principessa products, very subtle, which made me fall in love because it’s a lovely scent with a touch of sweetness, but not much at all. I love products with lighter scents for daily usage because then I can top my outfit off with a few spritzes of my favorite perfume without worrying about some crazy scent mix. I tried the Bellezza Box , which provides sample sizes of a wide range of their products. This will make a great holiday gift, because it’s a reasonable $45 and you receive 7 products in good sizes (these aren’t made for just one use, you get plenty of body-lovin’ goodness out of these!). I always enjoy a company that allows customers to try products in smaller sizes before committing to full-size products. Bacio Me — A cute tin of pink solid balm that melts slightly as you apply pressure from your fingertip into it to make it easy to put on your lips. It has plenty of shea butter and vitamin E, which helps to soften your lips. Bagno Bliss — A shower body cream that’s meant to give you a taste of how it feels to be treated like a princess at a spa, only for far less and in your own home. It really helps to soften skin all over, and all you have to do is add water! Massage gently into skin and voila. Candela-to-go — I’m not a huge candle person, just because I always forget about them (I have several around the house), but the tin is adorable with its pink and black motif. I imagine this would be a darling and easy-to-hide candle to take with you on a romantic getaway. It’s made out of 100% pure VegeSoy wax, too. Cattiva Diva — I have awfully dry hands sometimes, because I have a tendency to wash my hands far too many times throughout the day. What I liked about this hand cream is how lightweight it is; it’s not oily, heavy, and it dries in a matter of minutes so you can quickly go back to what you were doing. You don’t need too much to thoroughly moisturize your hands either, which is a great thing in my book — better value for your money! Dolce Dreams — Just like the hand cream, this product feels lush and rich during application, but as it softens the skin, it dries quickly and leaves you feeling fresh and smooth. Fresh Fiore — I love a good body wash! I also love the slight fragrant scent that lingers behind after using this cleanser. I was able to work up a good lather when using it, and afterwards, I had that “clean” feeling (who doesn’t love that?). Principessa pouf — Like I mentioned before, the Bellezza Box makes an excellent gift, because of how many products are in it, the reasonable price tag (totally get your money’s worth), and how self-contained it is. They even provide this adorable pink pouf to use with their products, like Fresh Fiore, to help exfoliate your skin.

"['MAC Cosmetics Danse Collection Review Reviews Dec 26, 2006 December 26, 2006 Eyeshadows Like most of the past collections, the eyeshadows were the least interesting part of the launch. I found most of them to have poor color payoff, and the texture to be too frosty and shimmery for my tastes. They tended to flake off quite easily, and again, with so little color payoff, who needs to work extra hard to get what little color to stay? The only eyeshadows that stood out were Rite of Spring and Swan Lake. Rite of Spring I might possibly go back for, but will probably hope and wait that someone decides to sell theirs off the community. It is very similar to Pink Opal pigment (which I have an entire jar, so I really should pass on Rite of Spring altogether!), only in shadow form. It isn’t as flakey as the other shadows, but the finish leaves something to be desired. Swan Lake is a bit different compared to other permanent shadows, because it is a more chalky, dark navy blue. But because it lacks superb color payoff, it does not seem worth getting when Deep Truth eyeshadow can get the job done, too. French Grey would be my third choice out of the six released, but again, it is a bit chalky like Swan Lake, and it is a more brown gray from what I remember. Scene 1 and Jete looked awfully pretty in the pots, but hardly worth mentioning once they were swatched. The pink ends up looking more like a barely pink, mostly white color with too much shimmer, and Jete is similar, only with a slight coral undertone. Lipsticks If you are into sheer lipsticks, Danse just might be the collection for you! Curtsy was my favorite lipstick out of the launch, because it is a lovely coral color that is sheer enough to wear with anything, but with enough color power to be the focal point of a look, depending on application. Besides, coral lips look the best on me (IMHO), so I couldn’t resist. Danse is an absolutely lovely color, but it reminds me too much of Pink Maribu. The texture was nice, and the color payoff would make it a worthwhile lipstick for anyone thinking about getting it. Both Classical and Russe lipsticks were ridiculously sheer on my skin; I could barely see them as a swatch, so I knew that these were not for me. I would much rather wear tinted chapstick or lip conditioner than worry about a fading lipstick that you can hardly see in the beginning. Lipglasses If you like lipglasses, you will probably find at least one that you will love out of the four released. I personally liked all four, but forced myself to only buy three (I know, I am so good at control, harhar!). Pas-de-deux is not half as crazy on as it does in the tube; I mean, really, a silvery lipgloss, what was MAC thinking… Oh, they were thinking! One of my favorite pigments to use everywhere BUT the eyes is Pink Opal pigment, and I think MAC must have been inspired by this color as it wasi n Rite of Spring eyeshadow, but it is also apparent in Pas-de-deux lipglass. It is a lovely sheer, irridescent lipglass that will give a slight multi-color tint to whatever color you have on your lips. En Pointe is soft, pastel pink that will look great on just about anybody. It is not over-the-top pink, like Standing Ovation, but much more wearable and subtle. Speaking of Standing Ovation, it is a worthwhile lipglass if you do not already have a decent hot pink lipglass. It is not like Pink Poodle lipglass, which is very thick, but similar to Wild Girl lipglass (discontinued). It is sheer, but it does have color to give you. It is perfect for brightening up any lipstick or giving a deep pink tinge to naked lips. Corps-de-ballet is also a great lipglass, but it does not offer anything that the existing permanent line does not already. While awfully gorgeous, simply not stand-out enough to get right this moment. Pigments Aire-de-blu pigment is not like Azreal Blue. Oh, they are similar, but their textures are so drastically different that the way they apply makes it worth having both, if you use blues more than once every six months. It is a paler blue, and not nearly as shimmery as Azreal Blue. Pastorale pigment is not like Golder’s Green, which resembles a mix between Golden Olive and Kelly Green, but rather a pale, pastel green that is not at all bright. It is a great green to layer paler, more olive-toned greens over. Mineralize Skinfinishes What can I really say about the new mineralize skinfinishes that will make you want them or hate them? I have never liked mineralize skinfinishes, and I know that that puts me in the minority. Lightscapade looks divine in its pot, because of all the gorgeous colors swirling together. I would say I like this one more than Glissade only because it reminds me a lot of how Pink Opal pigment looks when I use it as a highlight. Glissade might work best to add a more bronzy glow to skin, but I am not positive it will work for everyone, because it is more pigmented than Lightscapade. Nail Polish I could never wear this color, because it is simply over-the-top frosty. It is a shiny, almost chrome-like, white nail polish that goes on a bit sheerly (as most MAC nail polish does, though). It just looks odd on my nails, but I also do not wear nail polish regularly, so I might not be used to seeing color on my nails regardless. Overall I thought Danse was probably worth the wait for many of its admirers. I picked up plenty of stuff, but I could have skipped the mineralize skinfinishes without missing a beat. Damn the “sell out” mentality we all have as MAC addicts. The only “must-have” out of this collection would be Pas-de-deux, because it absolutely lovely for changing or creating a duo-chrome effect on your lips. I ended up purchasing: Curtsy lipstick; En Pointe, Pas-de-deux, & Standing Ovation lipglasses; Aire-de-blu and Pastorale pigments; and Glissade and Lightscapade mineralize skinfinishes.

"['MAC Cosmetics – Mattene Lipsticks Collection Product Swatches and Review Reviews Sep 27, 2007 September 27, 2007 Overall , Mattene is impressive in its range of hues and shades (dirty corals to vibrant reds to deep berries) coupled with a deliciously smooth texture. One of my reasons for not owning many matte shades is due to the fact that they tend to be incredibly dry and without some sort of gloss, look quite awful on my lips. While I really am a gloss girl, so I doubt I’ll be sporting any of the true mattes (didn’t you know, half are semi-matte !) sans gloss, just because that’s a personal preference. Now, for those that love a great matte lip, look no further, Mattene lipsticks are the answer to that quest! You’ll find at least one color, if not a handful (armful?) that suits you beautifully. Remember, half are matte and the other half are semi-matte (you’ll see it noted in each individual product review); even the semi-mattes are incredibly close to being classified as a matte, so don’t let that put you off! My personal favorites were Seriously Rich, Immodest, Classic Dame, and Rapturous (bold colors I love, but how rarely I wear them!). Keep reading for a detailed review, and don’t forget to view Temptalia’s swatches of all 16 new Mattene lipsticks here . 40’s Pink — A deeper medium pink than Poise, though the two are similar. I would say get one or the other, unless you must have them all. I think I’d pick 40’s Pink over Poise, though! All Grown Up — Super chocolate brown hue, which means it’s not up my alley, but deeper skintones? Matte dark brown with a touch of gloss and lots of moisture, not at all dry. Cafe Matte — A brown-based nude (keep calling it Cafe Latte, and even mistyped it on the swatches, sigh!), a bit dark for my lips, I think, and I envision it washing me out with my particular skintone. Semi-matte in texture, which means subtle gloss and sheen. Classic Dame — A vibrant scarlet, described as a “blood red.” It’s brighter than blood red to me, as perhaps they meant fake blood red, then it’s more accurate in description. Nonetheless, ultra gorgeous as a moisturizing matte shade. This is the color Dita Von Teese wore during our interview last week, and she said she was lovin’ it! Composure — Plum-pink neutral/nude, good color pay off, and it would make a great subtle lip. It’s a semi-matte texture, which means it has absolutely no problems with drying or flaking, and it reminds me of a lustre finish, but with amazing intensity. Flattering — One of the sheerest of the Mattenes; it definitely is of the nude family, but with a touch of pink as the base. I’m always more intrigued by bolder colors, so I found this one less “have to have.” It is a semi-matte, so there is subtle sheen and a bit of glossiness to it. Immodest — Who doesn’t love a good Barbie hot pink lipstick? I know I have a soft spot for this color family, even though it can be a bit over the top. This is a gorgeous true hot pink in a semi-matte finish, and this is exactly what I wanted the Isabella Blow lipstick to be (instead, Blow was ridiculously dry and near impossible to work with). To be sure, semi-matte looks quite near matte, so don’t be afraid of giving this finish some lovin’, too! Night Violet — A deep wine/berry semi-matte shade that makes me think of a grape vampy lip, which means it’s perfect for the fall season. Dark and sultry, I think this is one of the ultimate “occasion” lipsticks. Orange Dare — This is close to Vegas Volt lipstick, only in a semi-matte texture. I really do love the texture of all of the Mattenes – very similar to Slimshines in how lovely, just a more matte finish (duh). Not quite in-your-face orange like they say, but close enough! Poise — A pretty light medium pink, almost seems a touch frosty, but it’s just the slight sheen from the semi-matte texture. It’s a nice color, and I imagine it is one that nearly everyone can pull off with ease. Powersuit — Such a gorgeous bright raspberry red. It’s similar to Seriously Rich, only brighter and more pink than berry-purple. Matte finish and a pretty pink. Rapturous — Similar to Rougette, only redder, deeper. If it was a few shades darker, it would be a candidate for that perfect vampy lip. Not quite so bold or dark, which makes it easir to use for everyday wear. This is also a matte finish. Rougette — Despite the name bringing visions of scarlet hues, this is a subtler raspberry-red color, making it incredibly wearable for most. It reminds me a touch of Red No. 5 from the Couture collection a year ago, but with a matte texture. Seriously Rich — I loved this color, because it’s a bright raspberry red, lots of boldness, and comes in a semi-matte finish. Love the subtle sheen, and it’s a rich red with purple undertones, making it simply divine. Tango — I think there’s a bit of Mari-sheeno lipstick likeness in this one, which means… everyone who’s drooled over my Mari-sheeno lips needs to get this one! It’s a matte, but boy it sure doesn’t FEEL like it, which is the bset part. Ultra pigmented and so easy to apply. You Say Tomato — Bright red, glorious for those pouty puckers for those who bare to go red. It is true to the description that it is a tomato red, and with the matte texture, I see it being perfect in pin-up or glam looks.']",bf757183c463c6cde1fba6fba58056c6bd4ea6e1,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-mattene-lipsticks-collection-product-swatches-and-review/,['2007-09-27 00:00:00']

"['Holiday Make Up Guide – Part 8: Little Black Dress and Holiday Golds zArchived Nov 16, 2007 November 16, 2007 Everybody has–or should have–a little black dress that’s suitable for just about any occasion. Here’s a great example of something classy with a bit of fun, too, by Calvin Klein (and hey, it’s even reasonably priced!). We’re lovin’ Dior’s quint in Sunset Cafe for its soft gold, taupe, and pink-beige. Even the antique gold with green undertones (center shadow) could be the most gorgeous color in the crease. Pink-beige all over lid with gold on the outer ldi and the deeper taupe in the crease with the gray-beige as a brow highlighter impresses us when paired with this dress. Try Blush ‘n Brighten in Berry by Laura Gellar for a great flush with gold shimmer on the cheeks. We like Dior’s “I Love Dior” lip palette because it gives us several colors to work with. The berry (second one) would be a lovely way to top off the look we’ve described here. 1. Calvin Klein Strapless Satin Party Dress @ Nordstrom for $168.00 2. Laura Gellar’s Blush N Brighten in Berry @ Sephora for $28.00 3. Dior Quint in Sunset Cafe @ Sephora for $52.00 4. Dior “I Love Dior” Lip Palette @ Sephora for $40.00 One of the best aspects of the little black dress is that it is versatile, which means makeup can range from pitch-black smoky eyes to lavish false lashes and a bold red lip. It really is anyone’s desire that can be fulfilled (makeup-wise!) when it comes to dressing to impress in a LBD. Still, a classic red lip with lots of mascara is a combination you could never go wrong with. Try mixing your look up by experimenting with other bold lip colors like berries, vamps, and crimsons. And don’t forget long, voluminous lashes for a bit of drama.']",cda4cf8a48819ba0af10bddc9860d5dcbba1d512,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/holiday-make-up-guide-part-8-little-black-dress-and-holiday-golds/,['2007-11-16 00:00:00']

"['Dior – Spring 2008 – Flower Blossom Collection Review Year: 2008 Launches Jan 02, 2008 January 02, 2008 As far as I’m concerned, spring has sprung, because I’m diving head-first into all of the tantalizing spring collections launched. Dior’s Flower Blossom collection is no exception, with its flirty, fun springtime colors in pastels and feminine hues. I haven’t tried everything there is to be had from it, of course, but I played with one of the most gorgeous quints I have ever laid eyes on (Pink May), discovered a gorgeous my-lips-but-better-color im Amber Camera (and Brown Close-Up is surprisingly lovely), found a great lid contour color in Flirty Brown, and a darling pink highlighter in Blooming Pink. I really wish I could have had tried out the Flower Blossom palette, as well as the Spring Bouquet quint. Maybe next time ? Check out in-depth product reviews, plus product photos/swatches… Pink May is one of Dior’s two quints launching with Flower Blossom, and I have to say, it is just the prettiest thing. The color combination is not only the embodiment of spring, but they make an amazing subtle eye. I found that the shadows were smooth and easy to work with, not at all chalky. There was a definite amount of shimmer in them, though, so those who prefer less frosty shadows may want to check this out in person. I loved the pink the most, but I liked the deeper purple for its richness. Blooming Pink is an opalescent cool, pale pink that is sure to be a hit for paler skintones, but it makes an awesome brow bone highlighter, as well as a cheek highlighter (hey, I go for a multi-tasking product!). Flirty Brown is a darker neutral shade of brown with a bit of reddish tint to it. Brown Close-up is such a nice shade of fleshy dark pink, and I think the name is a bit misleading! There really is not much brown–at least not visibly–because it merely tinges the natural lip color and enhances it. Dior lipsticks are smooth, go on easily, and the texture is just fab all around. I find that they last quite awhile as well. Pink Liberty is part of Dior’s Ultra-Gloss Reflect line, and if you have ever wanted a medium pink gloss without a ton of shimmer nor a shade of bubblegum, this is it. Despite how many pink glosses there are in the beauty world, I find that there are very few that are just that right shade of pink that is universally wearable. Amber Camera is beyond gorgeous with its perfect combination of reddish pink and glossy finish. I love a lipstick that has its own sense of sheen, because I know that sometimes, a lipstick is all you want. I think this is a fitting color for the spring season, because it isn’t so cool or pale or pastel that it is hard for most skin tones to really pull off. Instead, it is a great shade of a bright pastel pink with subtl eshimmer. Flower Blossom will be available at your local Dior counter and www.dior.com this Spring.']",4d4b9ef2e141177ee88cefb21d6714a9cb482be5,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/dior-spring-2008-flower-blossom-collection-review/,['2008-01-02 00:00:00']

"['Looks – Sea & Sky Goes Bold, Deep Dark Blue Looks Jul 11, 2008 July 11, 2008 I’m a bit under the weather at the moment (I think it’s the flu…), so if I look a bit ragged/tired, that’s why ? This didn’t quite come out how I wanted it, and I really wanted to wipe it all off afterwards, lol. Don’t you hate when that happens? Hopefully tomorrow will go better! (It’s been a rough few days here over at Temptalia HQ – nothing has gone as planned!) By the by, Deep Dark is way too orange for me. I ended up using it more as a blusher (and had to buff it a bit), so I’ll be exchanging that next week when I go pick up my Colour Forms products (18th). I do like it as a light blush, so we’ll see – I’ll keep experimenting this week before I return it. It’s Friday, ladies! Rejoice, we’re almost to the weekend. What do you have planned for tonight/this weekend?

"['Skin MD Natural Shielding Lotion for Dry Skin Product Review Reviews Sep 28, 2007 September 28, 2007 Skin MD Natural Shielding Lotion is an amazing moisturizing lotion that can be used on any part of your body from face to feet to hands to legs.This product works differently in comparison to other moisturizers in that is uses a shielding method where the lotion helps to moisturize and then locks in moisture to rebalance your skin’s natural moisture.It’s important to follow the directions, because you do not need very much product to do a full application.I have been using this mostly for my face and feet, and this lotion really does work to reduce overall dryness and requires me to use it less and less over time.Users are recommended to apply the product to skin every four to eight hours for the first few days to a week, and then users can taper off the frequency of their applications as their skin adjusts and starts to moisturize itself. I absolutely love how light weight it is, and it absorbs incredibly quickly even better.It makes a great hand lotion to minimize dryness because there is no oily residue or slippery feeling left minutes later.Really, the lotion absorbs in less than a few minutes.Skin MD Natural is also hypoallergenic, not tested on animals, non-comedogenic, and fragrance-free.I love fragrance-free lotions when it comes to my face, so this is definitely on my list of top three facial lotions. This is one product I very much endorse and hold out as a miracle worker when it comes to aiding dry skin. You can find Skin MD Natural Shielding Lotion www.skinmdnatural.com ! You may also find it a retail location, which you can find through the site, as well.']",fce53c0cb96322540068713d79c6087e6c2ee122,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/skin-md-natural-shielding-lotion-for-dry-skin-product-review/,['2007-09-28 00:00:00']

"['Looks – Sea & Sky Goes Bold, Deep Dark Blue Looks Jul 11, 2008 July 11, 2008 I’m a bit under the weather at the moment (I think it’s the flu…), so if I look a bit ragged/tired, that’s why ? This didn’t quite come out how I wanted it, and I really wanted to wipe it all off afterwards, lol. Don’t you hate when that happens? Hopefully tomorrow will go better! (It’s been a rough few days here over at Temptalia HQ – nothing has gone as planned!) By the by, Deep Dark is way too orange for me. I ended up using it more as a blusher (and had to buff it a bit), so I’ll be exchanging that next week when I go pick up my Colour Forms products (18th). I do like it as a light blush, so we’ll see – I’ll keep experimenting this week before I return it. It’s Friday, ladies! Rejoice, we’re almost to the weekend.

"['MAC Cosmetics – Matte2 Make Up Tips and Application Tips zArchived Sep 28, 2007 September 28, 2007 Senior MAC Artist Louise Zizzo gives us the low down on how to rock the new matte shadows with the right bases and brushes! Temptalia: What is the best way to apply the new Matte2 shadows? Louise Zizzo: The matte2 shadows are super smooth, very fine pigment and silky because of this you need to ensure that you apply them to a base that is already matte, meaning that you will have a hard time applying them directly on to an emollient surface, like cream color base. Temptalia: (Makes mental note: do not use with CCBs!!) What products should be used as a base? What have you found that works well? Louise Zizzo: Here is what I have found works really well. MAC Paints once dry, the matte textures v’s the frost to keep that matte finish. Paint pots in the cream textures rather than frosts to keep the shadow looking matte, again the paint pot needs to have dried down. I also find a sheer layer of concealor works well but you MUST set with a pressed or loose pressed powder. Temptalia: What products specifically would make good bases? Louise Zizzo: Yes, Painterly is perfect and Bare Canvas. Just a sheer application, don’t pack it on and let it dry completely, I would say may be a couple of minutes. Also when you are using your 224 keep your touch light, don’t press hard with the brush. Temptalia: What brush do you think works best with the matte shadows? Louise Zizzo: As far as brushes my favorite is the 224, use this and gradually build up the color to the intensity you require. Temptalia: Any other tips or suggestions to make mattes work flawlessly? Louise Zizzo: Like any matte shadows especially when you are using darker shades you have to build rather than getting too much on and then trying to blend down as you could end up with a blotchy mess!']",ccdd18c560132b138be0d5c9f237f3e902788133,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-matte2-make-up-tips-and-application-tips/,['2007-09-28 00:00:00']

"['Temptalia’s Best From 2007 zArchived Jan 01, 2008 January 01, 2008 With the new year, it is only fitting for us to reflect back on the posts from Temptalia in the past year. In this special year-end “best of” post, you will find a few favorites from both readers and myself. If you had a favorite post that you remember, feel free to share it! Features One of the new additions to Temptalia has been “Temptalia Asks You,” which stemmed off of “Ask Temptalia.” Some of the best questions (rather, the best answers) have given: a slew of eyeliner tips , your very first makeup buys , five products you use everyday , your strange beauty habits , how others view your makeup addiction , great skincare tips , and makeup tips for beginners . Plus, you answered and we compiled to give you the First Annual Temptalia Beauty Awards ! Tutorials are a popular favorite around these parts, but these few have been particularly well-received this year: cateye eyeliner tips and tricks , achieving flawless skin (complete with contouring, blush, and highlighting!), bold, bright, and totally teal , how-to get perfect red lips , my top ten makeup tips , learn the parts to the eye , Temptalia’s signature black smoky eye , how-to for blending , and duplicate Barbie Loves MAC face chart . Sometimes the looks on Temptalia are like peacocks , even a bit wacky , experiments with Metal-X , and reminiscent of fall . Celebrity look breakdowns only began late this year, but while it is a hate-it-or-love-it kind of column for many, Arielle Kebbel dazzles with icy blue shadow, while Keira Knightley has an awfully plump pout, but still looks gorgeous. So many opportunities happened in 2007, including many, many interviews with fabulous people. MAC let us interview Viva Glam spokseperson Dita Von Teese , which was one amazing experience, but there were some great home-grown interviews with makeup artists from all walks, including founder of Face Time, Linsey Snyder . It is always fab to have Temptalia readers submit to the site, and how can we forget Skyler’s enviable pigment storage solution ? Skyler, tell Doug I desperately want one, too! (But here’s my storage solution … for now.) Check out the readers’ pick for winner of the Halloween mask contest, as well as the judges’ pick . Kris shared this awesome teal look with us, while Janis goes smoky eyed. MAC We are already anticipating for Spring 2008 here in the beauty world, but MAC’s collaboration with Heatherette and Fafi have everyone in a tizzy, excited for February and March to roll around already! While the unsung hero of the year will have to be Sculpt & Shape , only because it gave me the perfect contouring color, and The Originals turned out much better than expected. Although Antiquitease and Holiday 2007 offerings overwhelmed us a bit, I loved the look of the Antiquitease crackled nails enough to try it myself. MAC put out a lovely collection of smoky blues in Blue Storm , but we still wish MAC would make Temptalia’s Color Story . Many loved, and some hated, but C-Shock was a shock to the sensible with its bright and bold hues. Don’t forget how everyone ran, not walked, to get Barbie Loves MAC (which I liked, but didn’t love). Reviews YSL teaches us a lesson in truly luxury beauty and makes us fall in love with their cream blush , while our experience with Chanel Glossimers hasn’t yet converted us to the dark side! Skin discoveries were abound this year, and Osmotics Cream Extreme saved me from a fate worse than death. I can’t go a day without Estee Lauder’s DayWear Plus –it is the perfect morning cream. What else could be love at first sight? Oh, Renee Rouleau’s AHA/BHA cleanser ! Even though I shared my skincare routine with you this year, I think 2008 will require an updated version as I have found all new light o’ loves. Also, as a reminder, don’t forget about submitting your Reader Feedback Survey nor participating in our New You with New Beauty contest !']",945f5b14a7467a17a740f62e519fb93cb322749a,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/temptalias-best-from-2007/,['2008-01-01 00:00:00']

"['MAC Cosmetics – The Originals Review, Product Swatches Reviews Dec 19, 2007 December 19, 2007 Overall, I enjoyed this collection enough that I found several products interesting enough to purchase. I felt like the lipsticks and lipglasses turned out to be my favorites, but I have been on a bit of lip kick lately. I really loved Back to Del Rio, Rozz Revival, Supersequin, and Utter Pervette! The glosses were all lovely, but of course I was attracted to both Avarice and Real Desire–two shades I would rarely wear. Nico Now is gorgeous and I think will be popular with most as it is quite the universal shade. Surprisingly, I found that I adored Daisychain and Ochre Style out of the eyeshadows–if we didn’t have Smoke Signals come out, I would love Charred and Clue, too. Parrot is as to be expected; I can’t see any difference myself from the original formulation. The pigments are all permanent, but they at least selected three shades that rock (Golden Olive, Melon, and Violet). The reflects glitters are to die for, but you should have already known that as I covered them in their entirety from my PRO store haul! Antique Gold is the must-get, if you like playing with color; Very Pink is a great glitter to use on cheeks and lips, though. The collection offers something to everyone, even if addicts had expected their favorite hard-to-find products. Don’t knock it ’til you swatch it! For an in-depth review of individual products and shades, plus additional swatches… LIPSTICK Rozz Revival is a hot, bright watermelon pink with no sheerness to it, so it’s really quite bold. This is one everybody has been a bit excited over, and I can see why – it’s a lovely shade of a deep coral-orange-red with slick texture (go high sheen). Chintz on Chintz is a sheer, warm chocolate brown – great for ladies of color, for sure. Too dark for me on its own (definitely would need a lipglass to lighten it up), but you’d be surprised what you can mix it to make it an awesome shade on you. I think I own the original Chintz! Utter Pervette is such a lovely sheer, frosty cool pink shade. It has plenty of shimmer in it, though, so those who are wary of frost may want to skip this one. This one is excellent for spring! Back to Del Rio is one of my favorites! It is a subtly wine-berry with brown undertones and gold shimmer. It’s just this shade that’s dark, yet not at all bold and so wearable on an everyday basis. Nouveau-Frou is the sheerest of the bunch, and it is a pale lavender with gold shimmer. This is the most passable one, only because it wouldn’t show up well on me or anyone with pigmented lips whatsoever. Retrofluid is a deeper brown than Chintz on Chintz with purple and gold reflects. I’d really love to see this on darker skintones! Supersequin is probably my favorite, because it’s a gorgeous semi-frosty medium pink. It’s warmer rather than cooler, and I love the gold shimmer. I am reminded of one of the lipsticks from the Finery sets, though – I want to say Blueblood. Twig-Twig is completely contrary in color to the description. I honestly don’t see much brown in it at all! I am pretty certain it is Twig Twig (I swatch in alphabetical order so I *don’t* forget, ha!), too. It’s lovely, though. It’s very much like Supersequin, only cooler and with purple undertones. It is a relatively frosty look, not as much a silky lustre like Back to Del Rio. Sandy B is a lovely shade of light neutral-pink, sheer enough that it starts out light but it can be built up. This is a permanent shade already. Russian Red is a bright, bold matte red with blue undertones. It’s part of the permanent of the line. LIPGLASS Full on Lust is a gorgeous opaque watermelon pink hue with gold shimmer in it; this is totally the one that matches Rozz Revival, though it’s much subtler. Avarice is a rich orange-red with gold reflects, very deep and bold. Real Desire is the darkest of the five, and it is a really rich burnt red-burgundy with red reflects. Nico Now is a lovely shade of purple with pink hues with lots of shimmer. I think this is my personal favorite, even though it’s not insanely original. It’s just quite pretty. C-Thru is a white-neutral gloss with soft white shimmer that goes on fairly sheerly, though it will lighten up any dark lipstick for sure (take that, brown lipsticks! I’ll wear you yet!). EYE SHADOW Daisychain is actually one of my top picks from the nine shadows, because it will be the most gorgeous highlighter! I am such a sucker for white-gold colors with touches of shimmer. It is as if Nylon lost half of its shimmer and got a better finish. Ochre Style is another top pick, because it is this lovely shade of a brown-gold with gold shimmer. It reminds me of Juiced in the texture and feel, but the color is more wearable on most people (Juiced can make some look sallow). It is up my alley — when have I resisted a gold? A Little Folie is a warm, matte chocolate brown. I think this would make an excellent crease color (kind of like Soft Brown is a great choice) for warmer neutral looks. Memorabilia is a luxe dark purple with a matte texture. I found the formulation of this matte to be incredibly workable. It is not like mattes of the past, nor is it like Matte2s; I like this, and I think the shade is great for spicing up holiday looks. Clue is a shimmery gray-blue color – much prettier to the actual eye than the camera lens. I kept thinking Clue would be much bluer for some reason. As to the texture, it reminds me of the shimmer of Black Tied, with better color pay off. Alum is a mid-tone gray in a satin finish, so it has very subtle shimmer – perfect for older lids as well as any smoky eye with a lighter twist on it. Charred is a rich, charcoal gray-black with plenty of shimmery particles. It is a lovely color that would make for gorgeous smoky eyes. Again, like Clue, the amount of shimmer is similar to Black Tied, but you get more color than you do with Black Tied. Frisco is a soft, pastel pink in a matte finish; it is a little bit chalky, but not much. It’s one of those afterthoughts you have and makes you go, “Hmm,” since you’re not quite sure. I am reminded of the shade I wanted Pink Venus to be, if it didn’t have shimmer. It’s nice to see this pink added to the MAC line up (though it is close to Pen ‘N’ Pink from Matte2). Parrot is exactly as I remember it being. I have owned Parrot in three forms (including it as Kicky Blue) over my time as a MAC fan, and I never end up keeping it. It is a gorgeous color, but I never felt like, “Wow! This is worth $40!” I would suggest picking this up purely out of the addict-factor, which means this is sure to sell out quickly. It is also the boldest, brightest eyeshadow from the collection, which is also a big pull. But yes, I found the texture and color to be nearly identical to the original (I no longer own it, otherwise I’d have compared the two!). PIGMENT Kitschmas is a bright pastel purple with high sheen and frost-factor; and it is constantly being repromoted. All of the pigments are permanent to the MAC line, so there is no reason to jump out and get them all. Violet is one of my favorite pigments, because it has such great intensity in its purple hue. Melon makes an excellent summer blush and highlighter, because it is a great shade of gold-peach. Golden Olive is a delicious shade of olive green with gold sheen (the same really does ring true!). If you love green eyed looks, you must have this! Steel Blue is a subtle dark blue with chunks of gold glitter particles – it has a chunky texture compared to Melon or Golden Olive; it is chunkier than Kitschmas, from my experience. GLITTER — Check out my swatches from the PRO store for better pictures here . Reflects Blackened Red is a glittery deep red-brown with red reflects. In my other post, this is the one listed as “Charred Red” (because I spaced on the name and didn’t check, bad me). When they say blackened, it’s more like a burnt reddish brown – it’s not black. Reflects Very Pink is a medium pink with lots of light pink glitter reflects. This makes an excellent color for lips – just mix it with any gloss (including clear) to make a pout stand out. Reflects Transparent Teal is a glittery white base with small particles that reflect a tealish-green light. Great for body glitter! Reflects Antique Gold is my absolute favorite out of the four reflects glitters launched in this collection. It is such a gorgeous mixture of gold, brown, and antique gold that results in the most lovely shade. I bet you wouldn’t think of it, but you can rock this as a lip color or mixed with a red gloss! Originals is on counters and in stores now, as well as www.maccosmetics.com , as of today!']",14ddf7b3f02c45792e51ca442ee7e486856ef739,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-the-originals-review-product-swatches/,['2007-12-19 00:00:00']
"['Happy New Year 2008 – Resolutions Galore Site News Jan 01, 2008 January 01, 2008 With 2008 in full swing for everyone around the globe now, many of us have made a few resolutions or are thinking about ones to make for the new year. As with every year, at least half of us forget the resolutions we have made, fail to follow through on them, or simply give up. I have to give kudos for those who stick with them to the end, especially if they manage to succeed. My boyfriend teased me last night for not having any resolutions, which influenced me to come up with a few goals that I’d like to attain this year. Get Organized My apartment is overflowing with beauty products, and the lack of organization of them all is driving me batty–really. I honestly think there may be too much of a good thing going on at my house! I just don’t know how to organize it quite yet, but I would really love to overhaul some of it soon. For this past Christmas, I definitely did a lot of passing-on of the beauty products to family members, which did make a nice dent into what I have but no longer use. It is just so difficult to throw out beauty products for me–I hate wasting them! A few weeks ago, I made a make-shift shelf/drawer out of a cardboard box to hold a bunch of skincare products, and I have to say, that is serving me well! It has significantly decluttered my bathroom countertop (which has no room to spare, beauty products or not). Do you have any hidden secrets to beauty organization? I would also like to do some closet clean-out, because I have far too many shoes and clothes I no longer love or do not find suit me anymore. I don’t think I have ever thrown out a pair of shoes for any reason other than wear and tear, so I am not sure I will have the will power to do it. (Of course, by throw out, I do mean, give to the Goodwill.) Study Harder I haven’t gotten my grades back from my first semester at law school (I will get two permanent grades, three pencil ones – ones worth only 25% of my total grade, the other 75% to come in May), but I feel like I should have done better. I am going to work harder to pay attention in class, take more extensive notes, and make sure to read more carefully. I would like to say that I do feel I worked much harder this past semester than I ever did for undergrad (which, sadly, wasn’t hard to do, considering how little I worked), which does impress me. I stayed on top of the majority of my reading (boring!), went to nearly all my classes, and spent a decent chunk of time studying prior to the tests. Appreciate More I fear I take some things for granted, and I would really like to show people that I appreciate their effort and energy more often than I have in the past. I want people to think of me as someone who is nice and approachable, so I hope that by being more conscious of this will help me achieve this. I am encouraged by the fact that over the years, I have steadily become more appreciative of the things I have and the people I know. Re-discover My Creativity Sometimes I really do feel like I am running on empty (and this has been an on-going feeling for the past five years) when it comes to being creative, original, or remotely unique. I have been in this rut for such a long time that I fear I don’t know what it feels like to be creative any more. I am going to actively try to climb out and find things that enable my creativity and foster it. I know you can’t force it, but I’d like to think that certain circumstances may persuade it to come out and play! Lose Weight, Feel Great; Operation Hot Part 203822 Every year, like so many, I make weight loss a goal. I know that many of my dear readers will also be tackling this particular resolution with the new year, and I wish everyone the best of luck and the utmost support in becoming active, eating healthier, and losing weight. In 2004, I lost 45 pounds (I was on the Atkins’ diet), and while I never hit my “dream” weight, I did get to a weight I was happy enough with. I have gained about 10 pounds of that back in the past six months, and I would really like to get back down to that “happy enough” weight or lower. Being active is something I have struggled with for all of my life, and while I would love to say my resolution is to run everyday, it isn’t realistic. Instead, I would like to add activity if and where I can, but my concentration will be on eating better and more moderately. Bye-bye, Starbucks, you addictive fiend! Here are some tips and tricks to keeping your resolutions… Tell Friends, Family, Significant Others Tell the people in your life that you have a specific goal that you are working on, because this way, you can gain a support system. Make sure your gal pal knows that you are swearing off the ice cream sundaes, so she can try not to take you past too many Coldstones. Other people are entitled to live their lives how they desire, but it doesn’t mean it should compromise your success. By letting them know, you are giving them the chance to not be an enabler and try to support you (because they should!). Mini-goals and Rewards If you have a resolution that is quite encompassing, try to set mini-goals within it. Since weight loss is a popular resolution, and probably one of the hardest to keep, I’ll use it as an example. If you decide you want to lose forty pounds (by the way, as someone who lost weight, try to set a realistic goal for yourself, not a standard set by a supermodel blessed by genetics), make your first goal losing ten pounds or successfully adding a few sessions of cardio/fitness into your week or learning how to cook and eat healthily. With each mini-goal you meet, reward yourself! Everyone loves a reward, and while the ultimate reward will be the success of the goal itself, a little added incentive can go a long way. Make your significant other take you out for a night on the town, buy a new dress, hop into a new pair of shoes, or throw on some fabulously false lashes. Whatever your reward is, make it something fun and simple–and not something that compromises your goal (hey, indulgence isn’t bad, but it is SO hard to return to a diet if you go off of it too much!). Be Realistic Lofty goals are nice to think about, but they are often met with disappointment. Set a realistic goal for yourself, because you will have the lofty, ultimate, unrealistic goal in the back of your head anyway. If you meet your realistic goal, you can always set new goals, you know? Nobody says that January 1st is the only day you can make and begin resolutions! Be Assertive Be aggressive when tackling your goals–know exactly what you want and figure out some ways that you think could lead to achieving it. If you want to learn to play an instrument, pick up a few lesson books, start lessons if you can afford them, find a friend who wants to play to, and read up on it. It is so much easier to fall in love with something and figure it out when you immerse yourself in knowledge of it. If you want to read more, think about getting a library card or joining a reading group (online or otherwise). Check out other people’s book lists on sites like Amazon or Shelfari to get inspired (if you loved X book, and another person did, you might find that their tastes run parallel to yours and can get great suggestions from their reading lists!). If all else fails, read classics–you can never go wrong with those! Keep a Diary A diary, a journal, a log… whatever you want to call it, try to keep one. For dieters, try creating a spreadsheet of what you ate for the day–figure out what you’re eating, how much you’re eating, and whether it was enough for the day. Keep track of your weight loss; is it two pounds this week or have you stalled? Even just keeping a journal about your feelings and thoughts every week or so on how your goal is going will keep you thinking about the end results and better integrate it into your life. And if you don’t succeed… Try, try, and try again! A resolution may go bust by February, but that doesn’t mean you can’t try to get back on the horse in March or May or even September. Try setting a lesser goal instead (remember, realistic goals? perhaps yours wasn’t as realistic as you thought!) or even working on an entirely different goal for awhile. GOOD LUCK AND BEST WISHES FOR 2008! HAPPY NEW YEAR!']",f0d73b2e9664e55d9a69845332d4c97b2117170e,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/happy-new-year-2008-resolutions-galore/,['2008-01-01 00:00:00']

MAC’s Antiqued eyeshadow is a near perfect duplicate for Hewitt’s all-over-lid color in a dark copper color. After applying your favorite eyeshadow base (we know you have one, but if not, try Urban Decay’s Primer Potion , a cult fave), use the 239 to apply Antiqued all over the lid, stopping just above the crease. Using the 219, apply a thin line of Antiqued eyeshadow along the lower lash line. Line lower waterline with a smudge-proof and waterproof black liner, and avoid lining too heavily–stick to the waterline or just beneath it for those with sensitive rims. Get fuller lashes by applying a thin line of MAC’s Blacktrack fluidline along the upper lash line with the 266 angled brush, and be sure to coat lashes several times with a thickening, volumizing black mascara (we like DiorShow for this look). One may always add false lashes to truly open up those peepers, and for that we suggest MAC’s #7 lashes . Matte skin is in, as they say, for this winter, and the magic of matte skin can be found in MAC’s Studio Fix Fluid liquid foundation. A light to medium coverage liquid foundation that’s blendable, buildable, and most importantly, dries to a gloriously matte finish that isn’t cakey or drying. It is one of my personal favorites in foundations. Dab the foundation on your cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin using a concealer or small firm brush like the 194. Spritz a fluffy or buffer brush with water (or Fix+) and then blend out the dabs of foundation your face. The spritz of water moistens your brush and helps achieve a flawless coverage. It also ensures that you get a good even layer, which is essential to having “airbrushed” skin. Hewitt’s bronzed, glowy cheeks can be replicated easily with MAC’s Sunbasque blush , which is a deeper bronze with pink undertones kind of color with a touch of shimmer, but nothing over the top. Apply using a blush brush like the 129 or 150 with a light hand, as this blush is particularly pigmented, and it is easier to build than it is to reduce later on! We think adding MAC’s Drizzlegold loose beauty powder as a cheekbone highlighter will give you the most gorgeous glow. Highlight using a regular blush brush or use a brush like the 188 or 222 for more precise application (the 188 will give you more control over how much, the 222 will give you more control over exactly where). To temper this bronzed goddess, Hewitt wears a pink lipstick with a layer of peachy gloss to get that high sheen and color. Line lips with MAC’s Pink Treat cremestick liner , which will match our choice of pink lipstick perfectly. MAC’s Sweetie lipstick is a sheer medium-pink that’s flattering nearly universally, and when it is paired with MAC’s Lychee Luxe lipglass , the combination is amazing. Lychee Luxe will add a touch of coral and gold reflects that will shimmer; the lipglass formulation will add the glossy finish we see on Hewitt. Congratulations–you’ve master the art of rich, bronzy beauty!']",50b8751172479389cba6cfce851ea29c0ea6372b,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/celeb-a-like-jennifer-love-hewitts-makeup-in-bronzes-and-coppers/,['2007-11-18 00:00:00']

Me? Yes, totally long hair, and I have always been a fan of the Herbal Essences line (really, I think from the beginning nearly!). I switch shampoo/conditioner often, but it was good to try their newest release. I love the scent, which is red raspberries, because I am a raspberry addict. You know what’s great? I use these products, and I find myself compelled to match with philosophy’s raspberry sorbet shower gel! I digress… the scent is subtle, not overwhelming, and I found my hair was soft smelling throughout the day. It isn’t an overly sweet or cloying scent, so I think most people will enjoy it. While my hair is far from fussy, I did notice that I could go longer between washes before my hair would seem oily (3 days versus usual 2). And these products do not do anything for drying time, I swear my hair dried faster since starting to use these (10 minutes versus 15, with a regular, aging blow dryer).

"['LUSH Cosmetics – Go Green For 2008 – Product Reviews Year: 2008 Launches Dec 31, 2007 December 31, 2007 LUSH wants you to “ Go Green ” this 2008, and I think it’s obvious that I am a definite LUSH fan, but me? Green? I’m a bit loathe to admit it, but I’m not necessarily the greenest nor eco-friendliest person you’ll meet. Despite this, however, I have attempted on several occasions to try more organic and environmentally friendly products, but I have met mostly mediocre results. Becoming a LUSH junkie has given me a better taste for more natural and green products, though, so when they came out with some eco-savvy products for their Go Green promotion, I felt I had to give them a whirl. Inspired by UK-based environmental activist, Rebecca Lush (really, that’s her name), Go Green is a whole new line of fragrance dedicated to those who focus on making a environmental difference by walking the walk, literally. A genuine lady, Rebecca eschews single-passenger vehicles and routinely walks, cycles or takes public transportation. But, sometimes such activities leave her feeling less than fresh. So, Mark Constantine, our founder, created a fragrance just for her (and those of us like her). GO GREEN — THE SCENT | You must enjoy the Go Green scent, as it is infused into each product of the Go Green promotion. If the scent makes you cringe, it’ll be hard to see you loving any of these! The scent itself is a citrus-y scent with a woody after-scent; it tends to smell almost like cleanliness does (just that good clean scent). It will definitely give you a vision of earthly delights and a touch of nature whenever you use one of the products. I found that the perfume is the most heavily scented, while the other products are more subtle (which makes sense). For reviews of Squeaky Green Shampoo Bar, The Greench, Go Green Solid Perfume, and Go Green Body Spray… Squeaky Green Shampoo Bar was actually my first venture in solid shampoo (by LUSH or otherwise), and I have to say that I was a tad wary of it all. I mean, let’s face it: solid shampoo, and one that looks like this one, does not seem nearly as good as the typical liquid one. I must say that as a result of my misgivings, I was completely awed by the way the product worked. This is a great alternative for sensitive scalps, because it is free from sodium aluryl sulfates, while it has both tea tree and rosemary to reduce dandruff (always good). The Greeench is a deodorant powder that reduces natural body odors while discouraging sweating, which is always a good thing in my book. I’m a bit clumsy, so this is a tough product for me to use. I personally shook some of the powder into my flats, because while I like to think my feet are fairly cleanly and not at all odor-bearing, I am sure that adding some of the powder can’t be a bad thing. Go Green Solid Perfume is described as “a citric blend of grapefruit, bergamot and neroli oils refresh while earthy vetivert calms and sweet, woodsy sandalwood oil encourages well-being.” The best thing about a solid perfume is that it is easy to carry, toss around, and you never have to worry about spilling it. It is a great thing to have in your purse for a last minute freshen-up moment or something to use right after the gym for some rejuvenation. Go Green Body Spray is nice way to feel refreshed with a cool misting of this spray. As all the other products come, this one does, too, with the patented Go Green scent. You can check out product photos from my previous post on Go Green here !']",605905c5578617ce994f903defba3adfb08f5b4d,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/lush-cosmetics-go-green-for-2008-product-reviews/,['2007-12-31 00:00:00']
"['Tutorial – Barbie Loves MAC (Green Look) Tutorials Jan 08, 2007 January 08, 2007 This is a tutorial detailing how to do one of the Barbie Loes MAC face charts/looks from the MAC promotions. It uses green and pink for the most part. Skill Level : Moderate I used Golder’s Green pigment on lid, Fuchsia pigment above lid, Metamorph eyeshadow on lid, Guacamole eyeshadow on outer lid, Humid eyeshadow on outer lid, Pink Papillon eyeshadow above crease, Nocturnelle eyeshadow in crease, Sketch eyeshadow in crease, Soft Heart eyeshadow on brow, Metamorph eyeshadow on lower lash line, and Graphblack technakohl on lower lash line. I had Dollymix and Plum Foolery blushes as well as Glissade mineralize skinfinish on cheeks with Enriched Refined Bronze to contour and Pink Opal pigment to highlight. I wore Fashionably Fuchsia lipstick with Crystal Rose lipglass and Already Fab! chromeglass on my lips. Supplies: Golder’s Green pigment, Fuchsia pigment, MAC’s water-based mixing medium, Pink Papillon eyeshadow, Metamorph eyeshadow, Guacamole eyeshadow, Humid eyeshadow, Nocturnelle eyeshadow, Sketch eyeshadow, black liner, black mascara, Enriched Refined Bronze, Dollymix blush, Plum Foolery blush, Glissade mineralize skinfinish, Pink Opal pigment, Fashionably Fuchsia lipstick, Crystal Rose lipglass, and Already Fab! chromeglass. Dampen (not wet!) your brush and pick up Golder’s Green pigment and apply it all over your lid. Like so. Picking up more Golder’s Green pigment, apply the pigment to your outer crease. Bring the brush in a fluid motion further towards your inner lid by brushing upwards and inwards. You want to cover your entire lid as well as your crease with Golder’s Green pigment. You can do this by starting at your inner lid and brushing upwards and outwards, the reverse of the previous step. Like so. Using the same method as before, only this time with Fuchsia pigment, pick up a small amount of the pigment and gingerly apply it above the Golder’s Green applied earlier. We only want a very thin line of pink, so take your time. You do not need to have a precise line, but something like this will do. Using your eyeshadow brush, pick up a generous amount of Metamorph eyeshadow and cover the entire portion of Golder’s Green pigment on your lid. Make sweeping motions to help apply, blend, and set with the pigment underneath. Like so. Like so x2. Pick up Guacamole eyeshadow and apply to the outer portion of your lid as pictured. Add a touch of Humid eyeshadow onto your brush and apply to the very outer edge of the green portion of your lid for more dimension (hard to see here). Like so. Picking up some Pink Papillon eyeshadow with your brush, apply over the Fuchsia pigment in the same way you applied the pigment originally, and follow the same “line.” It is best to start on the inside and move towards the outside by making a fluid, sweeping motion that drags the eyeshadow further out. Like so. Pick up a bit of Nocturnelle eyeshadow with your eyeshadow brush and apply to crease. Start slightly further inside and move towards the outside. Hold your brush so that it is horizontal (a small edge, almost like it fits inside your crease) and drag-pull it downwards and outwards. Make several sweeping returns over the same area and in the same motions to blend the crease color with the rest of the colors. Like so. Apply Soft Heart eyeshadow to brow, starting just under the arch and move outwards and downwards, following the line of your brow. Pick up more Soft Heart eyeshadow and apply it underneath the innermost portion of your brow. Pull Soft Heart eyeshadow to blend with the other colors by picking up more of the color as needed and going slightly over the highest dissimilar color and dragging it upwards to blend out the darker pink color. Like so. Now, the look is essentially done, but fix any mistakes or oversights at this point. I darkened the crease with Sketch eyeshadow following the same method as earlier. I also put on a little more Metamorph eyeshadow on the lid. Like so. Like so x2. I’m using a small crease brush to apply Metamorph eyeshadow on my lower lash line. I start on the outer portion and move inwards until I have a thin, solid line. Like so. Add your choice in black liner and black mascara.

"['Provocative Thoughts – Make-up As a Luxury Features Nov 18, 2007 November 18, 2007 LUXURY is commonly considered the extravagant, hard-to-attain item governed by an astronomical price tag and so-called quality beyond compare. Some insist a luxury piece must be rare, or else it would not be, but on the other hand, several consider the affordability of an item to make that distinction. The cost of luxury goods generally keeps an item available to a limited number of parties, because unfortunately, most of us do not rake in millions of dollars a year and simply cannot afford to spend $3,000 on a handbag. MAKEUP AS A LUXURY is harder to determine, because high-end makeup has become such a common item that you’ll find in a wide range of households, regardless of yearly income. It isn’t the commonness that seems to make these supposed luxury items lose some of their edge, but the price point is not nearly as painful as with other markets like bags, cars, clothing, or shoes. So does that mean that luxury beauty has really just transformed into affordable luxury, and thus only a few true luxury brands exist? WHO’S WHO IN MAKEUP tells us that among the priciest cosmetic lines are Chantecaille, La Prairie, Serge Lutens, –two of which are much more known for their skincare products than their makeup or “color” lines. Who comes next in line? Brands like Chanel, Dior, Fusion Beauty, Givenchy, Guerlain, and Yves Saint Laurent all come to mind. It just seems that luxury in the beauty department is simply affordable for a great many of us. While one definition of luxury reiterates that an item is not necessary, rather a refinement of living, couldn’t we say that for a great many products? I am hard pressed to say any beauty item is a necessity, other than perhaps sunscreen. Another definition seems a bit more on the money–pun intended–that luxury is someone who lives at a higher standard of living, beyond that which is considered reasonable. It appears that living comfortably is fine and dandy, but to live luxuriously is moving up to a higher echelon. So while the reasonable woman can most likely afford to dabble in a majority of high-end brands like Estee Lauder, Lancome, and Shiseido, I suspect her budget does not allow for oodles of Chantecaille creams or the whole range of La Mer at her fingertips. Conglomerates like Estee Lauder are home to a great variety in brands within a brand; for instance, Estee Lauder Companies include such favorites as Bobbi Brown, Clinique, MAC, and even Flirt! (low-end). By diversifying their target audiences by manipulating the beauty market through brand development, Estee Lauder is able to capture a wider range of women. MAC is often considered one of the first brands young women fall in love with, covet, and ultimately leads them to the doors of other high-end lines. MAC itself is considered a high-end brand on the low-end of the scale; it has a more budget-sensitive price point for a majority of their items relative to the lines it competes against. It essentially gives the consumer the chance to experience luxury with a more affordable price tag than delving straight into the likes of Dior where a single lipgloss may cost in excess of $25 (compared with MAC’s price of $14). But what about budget beauty? Doesn’t a woman first find herself overwhelmed by the numerous brands found in the cosmetic aisles at her local drugstore? These days, not always. Drugstore cosmetics have increased in quality, but I have found that many well-known brands like CoverGirl, L’Oreal, and Maybelline have also increased their prices. When it comes to mascara, it isn’t hard to spend $8 or more on a single tube at the drugstore. Going back to our entry point, MAC, their mascara is priced at $11. For an extra three dollars you get a chance to experience high-end, “luxury” cosmetics. Luxury doesn’t seem so out of reach anymore, does it? Beauty appears to have built a perfect structure that slowly lets you into the world of gold-infused lipsticks, diamond-encrusted compacts, and miracle creams by introducing you to their version of affordable luxury. Even the lines considered luxurious often offer a few items that are impossibly out of budget for the majority of women like Guerlain’s Kiss Kiss lipstick with a retail price of $62,000. Is that what luxury is when it comes to beauty? Does that make a line like Chanel affordable luxury? If Chanel is affordable luxury, is luxury an absolute term rather than an relative one? The average college student cannot afford even entry brands like MAC in excess, let alone indulge themselves in Chanel; while a single twenty-something working woman could easily find herself at a Chanel counter with few qualms over price, but would still find Creme de la Mer to be a painful purchase to make. Is luxury an item you cannot afford or an item that you will never be able to afford?

"['October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month – Support the Cause zArchived Sep 25, 2007 September 25, 2007 This October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month ! This program began 1985, and through its tremendous awareness efforts, the mammography rates for women 50 or older have double, and the amount of deaths related to breast cancer have declined. One of the purposes of the organization and month long awareness promotion is to encourage all women to screen and prevent breast cancer by doing breast self-examinations once a month as well as seeing a doctor and having a mammogram done regularly. Breast cancer increases with age (rare in women under age 35), but it’s never too early to start preventative measures and talking with your doctor about getting tested and how to reduce your risk. For more information, visit www.nbcam.org , where you can learn about the disease, its stages, prevention, treatment, and get support. Learn & Do More: Donate to the Cause Beauty is not only skin deep–many beauty lines are taking a stand and promotiong awareness as it is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month by offering to donate a portion of sales/proceeds from certain products that are purchased.

"['MAC Cosmetics – PRO Launches Beauty Powder and Loose Powder, New Reflects Glitters Reviews Sep 29, 2007 September 29, 2007 MAC PRO Launch Reviews Overall , PRO products are always fun to dabble in because most of have to make special trips to the PRO locations to even check these out. I went with my girl Karen to check everything out, and whew, we both hauled some good items! First, I went with the mind to check out the new beauty powders and nudes & shapers. I have all the Nudes and Shapers already on their way to me, so it was more to just sneak a peak at than buy. There is so much stuff available, and it was a bit overwhelming. However, Karen and I scored one of the best makeup artists, David, who was the manager of the San Francisco PRO store. (BTW, anyone can place an order for PRO items, just call (415) 771-6113 and ask for David — tell him Christine from Temptalia.com sent ya!) He was absolutely so helpful and showed us all these crazy tricks and how to use some of the products. He turned me on to the new reflects glitters, which are just beyond gorgeous, as are the beauty powders. Beauty Powder/Loose Powder A sheer, jet-milled loose powder that brings a silky smooth wash of colour and luminous shimmer to eyes, cheeks and skin. Daisydust — This is my favorite out of the bunch! It’s a lovely light gold with a touch of white shimmer, and it reminds me of Gold Dusk pigment, only more finely milled. Dancing Light — This is almost like a lighter version of Daisydust, more white gold than yellow gold. Drizzlegold — Part peach, part gold, and overall, gorgeous. It’s a slightly peachy gold that’s light enough to use just about anywhere! Lightly Lilac — The “craziest” color out of the bunch, which I could see working for some, as it is a lovely bluish purple color, very cool. Micro Pink — A lovely cool pink with tiny bits of shimmer, which goes on so smoothly. Natural Flare — A gorgeous reddish peachy color, lots of melon hues in it, and it’ll warm up cheeks perfectly (though it’s not overly warm!). Paperwhite — White, white, and white! I had to skip this beauty powder because I’m too tan to work this as well as the others, but it feels like silk on your skin with slight shimmer. Peach Haze — A pinkish peach with shimmer, and like all the beauty powders, goes on flawlessly. Reflects Glitters Reflects Antique Gold — My favorite out of the bunch, most definitely. It looks like shimmering water when applied. Incredibly shimmery and smooth. Reflects Bronze — More gold than bronze, but gorgeous. Think Goldmine with a whole lot more punch! Reflects Blackened Red — Sultry, dark maroon with glitter and insanely smooth. If Maroon pigment had glitter, this would be it! Reflects Bronze — More gold than bronze, but gorgeous. Think Goldmine with a whole lot more punch! Reflects Copper — I was totally thinking this was Off the Radar in glitter form – it’s a very orangey color. Reflects Purple Duo — Kind of an odd color, probably my least favorite, as it sort of looks like Turquatic, but with more purple. Reflects Rust — More red than rusty copper, but lovely nonetheless. This looks amazing over red lipstick! Reflects Transparent Pink — Like Transparent Teal, this is a great body highlighter. This reminded me of Pink Opal pigment, only much more intense. Reflects Transparent Teal — Oh, wow, this was gorgeous – it’s this crazy whitish with teal reflects glitter color, so it would make an amazing body highlighter. Reflects Turquatic — Very blue, darker than sky blue by a touch, but really gorgeous. Hard for me to see where I’d use this other than the eyes (and I don’t know if these are eye safe yet — none of the other Reflects Glitters are, so history says no!). Reflects Very Pink — Fuchsia pigment with glitter, but ultra fine and amazing color pay off. Check out the rest of the post for product photos and swatches!

"['Celeb-a-Like – Alicia Key’s Makeup in Smoky Silver Nov 19, 2007 November 19, 2007 ALICIA KEYS wore a very stunning look to the American Music Awards this weekend with a lavish lashes, silvery smoky eyes, and flawless skin. Keys’ skin is absolutely flawless and the finish is matte (in fact, it looks like velvet to us), so we recommend MAC’s Studio Fix Fluid or Make Up Forever’s Mat+ Velvet liquid foundation as a great product to give you light to medium coverage with a matte finish. Use a concealer brush like the 194 to apply dabs of foundation to your cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead. Spritz a blush or buffer brush like the 129, 150, or 182 with water (Fix+ if you have it) and blend out the dabs of foundation to even out the coverage. By dampening your brush with just a touch of water, you can use less foundation and achieve better coverage; less foundation means less chance of looking like you’re wearing it. Contour cheeks with an appropriate color that’s only a shade or two darker than your normal skintone (lighter skintones will love MAC’s Strada blush, deeper skintones should try MAC’s Harmony blush; even darker foundations can be used as contour color). Mauvey-pink cheeks give Keys a nice flush, but something subdued and easy on the eyes. Try NARS Sin blush as a great powder blush to give you those lovely hued cheeks Highlight with MAC Dancing Light loose beauty powder on the tops of cheeks to achieve a bit of glow. Smoky silver eyes with lots of bright silver open up Keys’ eyes and make them pop . Try MAC’s Silver Fog pigment all over lid with the 239 brush. Make sure to use MAC’s water-based mixing medium –just a touch, a drop or two, onto your brush before picking up the pigment to ensure this look will last you all night and into the next morning long! If you don’t have a PRO store handy, you can make a homemade version with one part water to three parts glycerin (found in the first aid aisle of most drugstores, it is a liquid). Take a touch of MAC Carbon eyeshadow onto your 239 brush and apply on the outer lid and just lightly in the outer crease as well to add depth and dimension to the eye. With the 266 angled brush, apply MAC Blacktrack fluidline along upper lash line and create a cat eye. A cat eye is essentially winged out eyeliner that extends past your natural lash lines. You’re almost lining the angled portion as if the bottom lash line would keep extending upwards, but you’re faux-ing the effect. With the 219 brush, use MAC’s Silver Ring eyeshadow to line the lower lash line to really open up eyes. Be sure to line lower water line with Blacktrack as well–make sure whatever you use to line water line is as close to being waterproof, smudge-proof, etc. as possible otherwise risk it moving or smudging later on. Adorn your newly dolled up eyes with MAC #6 lashes for full, dramatic lashes; add mascara to upper lashes for additional fullness, as well as lower lashes for completeness. Keys’ lips are a lovely shade of pink that matches her cheeks almost perfectly. Her natural-looking pucker can be replicated using MAC’s Angel lipstick with MAC’s Oyster Girl lipglass for added sheen. If opting for liner, try MAC’s Pink Treat cremestick liner for a precise, but gentle liner. Smile and just look confident–that’s beautiful!']",02f7bf32f4cbc4abfa586032dd5cb8fa5fbf09e4,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/celeb-a-like-alicia-keys-makeup-in-smoky-silver/,['2007-11-19 00:00:00']

"['Bobbi Brown – Spring 2008 – Pink Raspberry Collection Review Year: 2008 Launches Dec 30, 2007 December 30, 2007 I checked out Bobbi Brown’s Pink Raspberry Collection , and I have to say, the palette she put together for the launch is quite nice. I played with the Pink Raspberry Face Palette; Pink Raspberry and Wild Raspberry lip crayons; and Black Raspberry lip sheer. Pink Raspberry Face Palette is a palette meant for more subdued looks, because Navajo is a light white-gold shadow with soft shimmer, while Fog is a deeper, smoky charcoal-gray with light shimmer as well. They both feel more semi-matte to me than anything; they’re definitely not frosty or over-the-top, so they’re perfect for just about anyone. The Pink Raspberry blush is a bright medium pink that will need a light hand when applying it, because it is easy to go overboard. I adore both of the lip sheers for their soft, pink-berry hues; knowing that they are meant to be sheer, I was not disappointing with their opacity. I found that Raspberry was a deeper berry with pink undertones whereas Blue Raspberry was definitely a cooler, sheer pink. Black Raspberry lip sheer is a berry-brown with more color than the lip sheers included in the palette, which makes it a nice alternative to those with more pigmented lips. Both Pink Raspberry (warm pink with berry undertones) and Wild Raspberry (gorgeous brighter red-berry) lip crayons felt so glossy and smooth when applied. They’re kind of like jumbo lip pencils, which means they’re great as liners, glosses, or lipsticks–my kind of tool!

There will be one grand prize winner, but there will also be a smaller prize that goes to the person who wins the “readers’ choice” award! Contest ends October 31st, 2007. Keep reading to view the details, contest rules, and see some examples of past MAC Cosmetics Halloween face charts for inspiration. Rules: 1) Only one entry per person will be judged and entered. You may submit multiple ones, but only one will be entered into the contest; just let Temptalia know which you want judged (for example, you submit one October 4th, but then think you do a better one October 20th, you can have the second submission as your entry!). 2) Each entry must be accompanied by at least one close-up shot and one full-face shot to be considered of the mask on a person. It is a mask, so a full face is absolutely necessary to truly show it off! Dimensions of the photos bust me a minimum of 390 pixels wide. More photos are most definitely encouraged, but not required. 3) Entries must be accompanied by a list of products used (if you end up forgetting a few, that’s OK, but knowing the main products used is essential!). 3) Contest entries will be posted on Temptalia throughout the month, but judging will not occur until November 1st, 2007. 4) Prizes and rules are subject to change at any time without any notice (gotta cover my rear, right? Yay, legal mumbo jumbo!). 5) Submit your entry to [email protected] by October 31st, 2007. Prizes: All entries will be judged by a panel of beauty bloggers to determine a grand prize winner ($60 value of beauty products, with $30 guaranteed to be MAC). Readers will be able to vote for their favorite to select one entry to receive the readers’ award and subsequent prize ($30 value of beauty products). Inspiration: These photos are face charts done by MAC artists in the past, and these detail what a face mask can be.']",510941cba0deceb86d601abc50431fac5bf57882,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/contest-october-halloween-mask-show-us-your-best-halloween-inspired-makeup-mask/,['2007-09-30 00:00:00']

"['Hamadi Beauty – Introduction and Review of Healing Serum, Hair Mask, and Hair Cream Reviews Sep 26, 2007 September 26, 2007 Hamadi Beauty is a haircare line that promotes a healthy and modern view on the approach to hair products by never compromising quality by using artificial ingredients. Jamal Hammadi is the founder and creator of Hamadi Beauty, and he was born and raised in California. He says that his creative vision and passion is the result of, “growing up in a creative household and was greatly influenced by his mother’s Parisian style, and also by his father, a gifted chef who worked with the Hollywood elite.” He has a solid reputation for creating amazingly glamorous hairstyles, and he has had his work featured on covers like Vanity Fair, Marie Claire, Jane, and InStyle. He’s worked with stars such as Drew Barrymore, Linda Evangelista, Sharon Stone, Naomi Watts, just to name a few. Hamadi Beauty is Jamal’s answer to the absence of organic hair products. All products are “tested on actresses, never animals.” Now, onto some product reviews! Healing Serum: Every so often, your hair might be fried, overblown, or just plain tired from day to day wear and tear or from the various torture we put our tresses through in the name of style. This is a product that is meant to repair all the damage you’ve caused your mane, and it really does return it to its natural balance of rich, luxurious locks with a good amount of moisture locked into each strand. This is a product that I personally only need to use on occasion, but it is a great way to healthy-up hair and it doesn’t take long at all. I designed the Healing Serum as a ready-to-wear treatment, one that women can spray in their hair at any time and just go, says Jamal. Now damage can be treated any time, all day long, and women don’t have to wait to find the time to do a deep treatment mask. Shea Hair Mask: This is another product meant to help and repair tortured, unhealthy hair, and for those who need it more often, use it daily, and others can use it as little as once a week. It even helps those with colored hair by enhancing it. I love that it includes sunscreen to help protect your hair from the sun (we so often overlook sun damage to our hair!). It’s ultra moisturizing, and a little goes a long way, which is always good to know in advance! Shea Hair Cream: This is a great styling product for adding texture while keeping hair smooth and healthy looking. It can be used on dry or wet hair, and it can be left to dry naturally or blown dry, depending on the style you’re after. Shea butter has naturally occurring sunscreen in it, and as I mentioned earlier–great added bonus. The unique Hamadi Beauty line contains : Ginger Soymilk Hair Wash Daily Shampoo For All Hair Types – Contains essential oils of ginger, sweet orange, and rosewood. This gentle shampoo can be used everyday to invigorate and purify the hair. Soymilk seals in moisture and proteins. 4oz. $18, 8oz $27 Honey Soymilk Hair Wash Daily Shampoo For Fine Hair – Contains essential oils of ylang ylang and guaiac tree. This gentle shampoo can be used everyday. Honey adds volume, texture and body, while Soymilk hydrates the hair without weighing it down. 4oz. $18, 8oz $27 Lemon Mint Hair Wash Shampoo/Color Protector For Blonde Hair – Contains essential oils of peppermint, green mint, white cedar and lemongrass. It removes product and environmental build-up, protects against chlorine discoloration, and seals in existing color. The fresh-smelling wash leaves hair and scalp feeling buoyant, refreshed and pampered. 4oz. $18, 8oz $27 Shea Leave In Daily Conditioner/Styling Cream – Contains essential oils of lemongrass, verbena, ylang ylang, and lavender. When used as a light conditioner, it moisturizes and adds shine to the hair without being too heavy, leaving the hair pliable and textured. When used as a versatile styling cream, it creates soft, natural looks, and enhances curl. This light cream can also be used to straighten and add shine, leaving no traces of starchiness or stickiness. A naturally occurring sunscreen in the shea butter protects hair and scalp from harmful rays. 4oz. $22, 8oz $37 Shea Hair Cream All Around Styling Solution – Contains essential oils of lemongrass, exotic verbena, lemon, and palmarosa. This styling cream texturizes, separates and smoothes. It can be used as a straightener or to enhance naturally curly or wavy hair. It contains rice protein to enrich and strengthen. A naturally occurring sunscreen in shea butter protects hair and scalp from harmful rays 4oz. $23, 8oz $38 Shea Hair Mask Moisturizing Treatment – Contains essential oils of vanilla and ylang ylang. This is the perfect weekly indulgence or daily essential for hair in need of repair, replenishment and color maintenance. Avocado oil silkens and aloe vera hydrates from roots to ends. It leaves the hair feeling sensuous and touchable. A naturally occurring sunscreen in shea butter protects hair and scalp from harmful rays 4oz. $24, 8oz $39 Shea Pomade Classic Grooming Aid For Short Hair – Contains essential oils of bergamot and ylang ylang. For a no-nonsense style, use this pomade to create slick, spikey, and tousled looks.

"['Lancome – Spring 2008 – L.U.C.I. Luminous Colorless Color Intelligence Collection Review Year: 2008 Launches Dec 29, 2007 December 29, 2007 Recently, I played with several of the upcoming products available from Lancome’s spring collection, L.U.C.I. , which is a gorgeous collction based on luminous, iridescent hues. I tried out Sunray and Seashell Color Fever Gloss; Desert Pink and Luminous Color Fever Shine; and Ombre Glacee in Morning Pearl. Check out lip swatches and an in-depth review of the products… Desert Pink is a lovely shade of medium pink with cool undertones that goes on easily. The texture is incredibly smooth and buildable, while the color is opaque, but not so bright that it becomes over the top. Color Fever Shine lasts for several hours through normal conversation and day-to-day activities (not including eating). I thought Desert Pink looked really lovely with Seashell Color Fever Gloss on top! It just really brought out the pink and made it pop. With Sunray , it brought out the cooler undertones, changing it a pink with more purple shimmer, which was quite lovely. Luminous is a sheer, opalescent lipstick that adds plenty of shimmer and shine, but not a lot of color (it reflects light, actually). This would be a great way to add some more dimension to a more matte lipstick. I loved what a light, ultra glossy lip Luminous & Sunray made together – despite how low in color it was, it actually drew quite a bit of attention to my pout. With Seashell Color Frever Gloss, Luminous provides additional shimmer and iridescence to the gloss itself.']",368b24bc40a4cc2573d0dcf38fe798be17d75590,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/lancome-spring-2008-luci-luminous-colorless-color-intelligence-collection-review/,['2007-12-29 00:00:00']

"['Celeb-a-Like – Eva Green’s Smoky Eye & Red Lip Bold Look Dec 04, 2007 December 04, 2007 EVA GREEN is seen here in a very fashion forward look, because very rarely will you see a celebrity (and in fact, it is technically a “makeup don’t”) sport both a classic red lip with dark, smoky eyes. For someone with Green’s features, both are definitely not necessary to accentuate her beauty, but I think half the fun in breaking the rules is having the confidence to do it, so why not share how Green pulls this look together? Start with your favorite eyeshadow base (like Urban Decay’s Primer Potion ) all over the lid. Apply MAC’s Satin Taupe eyeshadow all over lid using the 239 shadow brush. With MAC’s Mystery eyeshadow, apply it to the outer corner with the 239 brush. Using your 224 brush, dust MAC’s Carbon eyeshadow into the outer crease, blending into the outer lid. Take the 239 brush and gently dab a touch of more Satin Taupe above the crease, blending it upwards just a bit. With the 239 brush, again, apply MAC’s Phloof! eyeshadow above crease and all under the brow bone to highlight. Apply MAC’s Feline kohl power along lower lash line, and then use the 219 to take a bit of Carbon eyeshadow and smudge it along the lower lash line, going lightly on the inner portion and heavier on the outer portion. Apply several coats of black mascara to both upper and lower lashes–top with false lashes for extra drama. To really duplicate Green’s look, take a powder eyeshadow similar to your natural brow color and gently extend brow outwards as pictured in Geren’s look. Green’s face is excellently highlighted with a healthy dose of pink glow and shimmer, which livens up her cheeks while still allowing them to be fairly subdued relative to the rest of her face. It is truly a feat of mastery to be able to look gorgeous in bold eyes, cheeks, and lips simultaneously. Keep skin looking light and natural by applying a light coat of foundation, whether powder or liquid. For powder, try a mineral-based one to minimize a cakey look. For a liquid, we recommend MAC’s Face & Body foundation. With liquid foundation, spritz a fluffy powder or buffer brush (129, 150, 182) lightly with water or Fix+. Dab a bit of the liquid foundation on your cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin using a 194 brush (concealer). Using your lightly misted fluffy or buffer brush, spread the dabs out evenly to give yourself a light cover of foundation. For powder products, using a buffer brush is still recommended in the application process. Use a cream blush like NARS’ Multiple in Orgasm all over cheeks with MAC’s Dancing Light beauty powder dusted lightly on apples and cheekbones with a 129 or 150 brush. We are thinking Green’s lips are utterly matte, or at the very least, semi-matte, so we cannot emphasize enough how important it is to prep and prime lips to the fullest. Make sure to moisturize lips with a thick lip balm prior to putting on lipstick (preferably, apply it at the start of your makeup), and then remove any excess lip balm that has not been soaked into your lips. With bold red lips, it is important for anyone who has lips that have a tendency to bleed with wear to line lips effectively. We recommend MAC’s Red Enriched cremestick liner for all red lips. With the 316 lip brush, apply MAC’s Russian Red lipstick (or MAC’s Classic Dame mattene lipstick–perfect, but limited edition!) going along the edge of your lips. On the second pass, start filling in the center of the lips.

"['Lancome – Spring 2008 – L.U.C.I. Luminous Colorless Color Intelligence Collection Year: 2008 Launches Dec 07, 2007 December 07, 2007 Who is L.U.C.I.? A better question might be what is L.U.C.I.? It stands for Luminous Colorless Color Intelligence and it’s the latest technology from the Lancome laboratories. Gucci Westman, the celebrated makeup artist and Lancome’s artistic director, was captivated by the beauty of sand, the iridescence of shells and the play of light on water at different beaches around the world and turned to the labs to bring her inspiration to reality. Gucci test-drove some of her new creations at Peter Som’s Spring 2008 show. “I wanted the models’ makeup to look easy and sexy,” says Gucci. “I gave the eyes a bit of a pop with Ombre Glacee for a sultry effect.” Read about this new technology and all the products coming with it! The Technology Iridescent color, like that found on a butterfly’s wing or a bubble, is the result of an optical phenomenon where hues of an object change color based on light interference and viewing angles. Iridescent color is not composed of pigments and is therefore sometimes called “colorless color.” Lancome Advanced Research created a patented invention that is able to interpret particles of colorless color and incorporate them into makeup products to create “photonic” makeup. The formula of this makeup looks white to the eye, but when applied to the skin or on top of another product, it creates a spectacular transformation. Each of the colorless color particles acts as tiny light chambers, capturing and intensely refracting light for an iridescent finish. The pure and intense halo of color that is produced reflects rose, blue, coral or green hues, enhancing lips, eyes and skin. Depending on one’s complexion, the halo of color changes; when a photonic product is placed on fair skin it transforms into an iridescent and pastel shade, while on darker skin, it becomes deep and intense. Star Products L.U.C.I Eyes — Light Color in Motion Eye Shadow Duo | A stunning shell-shaped eye shadow compact holds two shadows, a beautiful bronze and a photonic shade. Use the photonic shadow over the bronze color to create a unique third shade. Or use the photonic shade on its own to create a luminous look. Available in Ray of Apricot Light . $45.00 Photonic — Illuminating Powder Brush Face | This glowing, translucent photonic loose powder can be used to sculpt the face or add a sheer veil of radiance. Available in Ray of Apricot Light . $40.00 Ombre Glacee — Cooling Gel Illuminator Eyes | This creamy, cooling eye shadow can be used alone or blended over another color to highlight and brighten the eye area. Apply the light texture over your eyelid and up to the brow bone or experiment by bringing it from the eye down to the cheekbone to create a beautiful aura that lights up the face. Available in Chameleon, Morning Pearl and Sunrise . $22.00 Color Fever Gloss — Sensual Vibrant Lipshine | Make a statement and use the photonic gloss as a topcoat over lipstick or one of the two new shades of Color Fever Gloss to transform shades into intense, brilliant colors. Available in Sunray (photonic shade), Seashell and Rainbow . $23.00 Color Fever Shine — Sensual Sheer Color. Vibrant Shine. | Revamp your lips with two new lipsticks.

"['Too Faced’s New Romantic “Unicorn” Palette for the Holidays Review Reviews Dec 04, 2007 December 04, 2007 New Romantic “Unicorn” Palette ($27.50) Inspired by the euphoric and intoxicating feeling of new love. The New Romantic Unicorn palette contains everything needed to evoke your inner romantic. Three lovely shadows flirt with a trio of seductively shimmering glosses all meant to be mingled with the kit’s perfectly passionate blush! Create the look of innocent love or go all out glam to inspire an evening of lustful bliss! What makes it worth it: The shadows have good color pay off, and the selection is versatile enough to give you the ability to create several lovely looks from the three eyeshadows. I think the blush is absolutely gorgeous; it’s a shimmering pink that is almost pale, but not quite, making it excellent for both warm and cool tones. The packaging is cute, so if this is your thing, you’ll love this palette for sure. Why you might pass on it: If you aren’t a palette fan, then this obviously isn’t for you. The brush with this palette is similar to other Too Faced palettes, but I’d probably never use it myself. Also, with no blush brush, you’d have to dig into your own stash anyway.

Organic, toxin free, and non-comedogenic are just few of the many features of von Natur’s hair products. These hair products revitalize your scalp, hair, and skin with an all natural creation that has been specially formulated to promote growth. This unisex formula is good for all hair types and maintains a low pH balance which is highly recommended for the wellness of your hair and skin. What makes it worth it: As I am always on the prowl for the latest in beauty trends, going organic and natural is definitely pulling in a lot of fans these days. I thought to try von Natur’s latest line of Exquisite Bath products, which included a Complete Hair & Body Conditioner and Wash. The Hair & Body Wash is similar to that of most shampoo, a bit thinner in consistency, but I adored the lemony citrus scent. It lathered great on the body, as well. The conditioner uses Charcoal in it, as one of its unique ingredients, which is meant to pull out impurities for truly healthy hair. It creates a protective coating to help keep moisture locked in while reducing static electricity. Normally I use typical shampoos found at drugstores, but I really loved how shiny my hair looked using this combination of products. I also found the scent to be more pleasant than other shampoo/conditioner combinations I’ve used in the past (I love that they match). Also, who doesn’t love that you can use these on your hair and body? Why you might pass on it: If you’re a fan of ulta thick, luxe shampoos, you won’t love von Natur’s, which is thinner with a higher liquidity. If you need something specific to your type of hair, colored hair, etc., you may prefer something that is targeted rather than general (it is recommended for all hair types, though!).

From St. Tropez to Ibiza, by way of Santorini, the season’s palette was inspired by the world’s famous ports and resorts. Navy blue, turquoise, lagoon green and sea foam white unfurl in a wave of endless nuances, borrowing from light on water or the transparency of water itself. A sea of summer shades enhanced by luxurious textures and contrasting finishes, Sea Belle is presented in packaging with nautical themes and colours.

It goes on effortlessly, sparkles all day long, and washes off instantly with soap and water. Use alone for a total luminous look or blend with our moisturizer or foundation for a more subtle effect. Complexion Enhancer in Bronze ($29.00) The Complexion Enhancer sashays into summer with an all-new shade: BRONZÉ. Ideal for brightening the complexion with an instant sunless tan, it blends beautifully into the skin, leaving it soft, matte, with a subtle sheen and glow The perfectly pigmented shade of this hydrating fluid naturally enhances all skin tones.

"['Osmotics Cream Extreme Barrier Repair Review Reviews Dec 10, 2007 December 10, 2007 Cream Extreme Barrier Repair ($75.00) A healthy and glowing complexion is directly related to the optimal functioning of the skin’s barrier. CREAM EXTREME features Osmotics’ BRT, (Barrier Repair Technology), a patented combination of epidermal lipids clinically proven to repair, nourish and maintain healthy barrier function, thereby eliminating the underlying cause of dry skin. In addition, this breakthrough technology dramatically improves moisture retention and increases penetration and absorption of antioxidants and vitamins. Ideal for post treatment care after peels, lasers and dermal procedures and extreme weather conditions. Skin becomes healthier and acts younger. Physiological Lipids- these lipids occur naturally in the epidermis and are the key components of the skin’s barrier. When all three are used in the proper molar ratio, they restore the lipid balance (by forming lamellar membranes) and provide long-term barrier repair. The three physiological (epidermal) lipids are: Chlosterol, Ceramides, Fatty Acids- including both non-essential and essential. Also included are: Non-Physiological lipids, Petrolatum, Lanolin, Glycerin, L-Carnosine, Linoleic Acid, Allantoin, and Tocopheryl Acetate. What makes it worth it: Let me preface this review by saying that I have had this product awaiting a test run for quite awhile, but I have only recently had sufficient reason to lust after a product of this caliber. I recently experienced incredible dryness around my mouth–I cannot really figure out why, but I think it may have been a skin drying reaction from anti-acne production–and this was my MIRACLE product. I had already been trying to moisturize twice a day, sometimes more, for that area, in addition to applying hydrocortisone cream to it (which is what my dermatologist recommended for dry/flaky eyelids). That particular regimen just wasn’t working, it wasn’t making it better. It would hide it for the day, but it didn’t FIX the problem. Osmotics’ Cream Extreme was the answer to my problem. This is an ultra rich moisturizer, but it dries quickly and doesn’t feel heavy. It truly does create a barrier, locking moisture in. In two days–yes, 48 hours later–and my dry, flaky skin had been resolved and turned back into normal, healthy skin. For that, I am forever in debt to this product. I fully recommend it. I am so tempted to continue using it, but at $75 a pop, I will use this as a spot treatment for dryness as I experience it. Why you might pass on it: The price is quite hefty for most, but it is a definite must for truly eradicating dry, flaky skin. If used as a treatment, and not a regular everyday moisturizer, this product should last you quite awhile. Even using it as an everyday moisturizer, it should last you at least a month, if not two. Anyone who has experienced skin that is visibly dry and literally flaking off will know that $75 is nothing to get back to gorgeous, naturally healthy skin.']",8d5c732e646035a43a8d242f3207216c84a43aa7,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/osmotics-cream-extreme-barrier-repair-review/,['2007-12-10 00:00:00']

"['Tutorial – Gold and Green Eyeshadow, Easy Makeup How-to Tutorials Jan 11, 2008 January 11, 2008 This tutorial is designed to show you step-by-step how to create an easy gold and green shadow look. You will need : Golden Olive pigment (bright yellow-green), Ochre Style eyeshadow (dirty yellow-brown), Goldmine eyeshadow (gold), Velvet Moss eyeshadow (velvety mossy green), Clue eyeshadow (dark gray-brown), Feline kohl power (black kohl liner), Plushlash mascara (black mascara). For cheeks, Springsheen blush was used; for lips, Rozz Revival lipstick and Full On Lust lipglass were used. Brushes : 239 Get the detailed step-by-step how-to… 1. Start with a clean eye-space; if you fill-in your brows, you’re welcome to do them now [or later]. 2. Dampen brush slightly with a drop or two of water-based mixing medium. Pick up a small amount of Golden Olvie pigment from the excess on the plastic insert found in the pigment jar. Apply all over lid. 3. Pull it outwards to be able to cover your entire lid area. 4. This is what it should look like. 5. Apply Ochre Style eyeshadow with your brush to the inner third of your eye lid. 6. This is what it should look like. 7. With your brush, pick up a generous amount of Goldmine eyeshadow and apply to the middle of your lid from the crease to the lash line. 8. Your lid should look like this at this point. 9. With the 239 brush, apply Velvet Moss eyeshadow to the outer third of the lid, from the crease to the lash line, pulling the color downwards. 10. This is how it should look. 11. Getting more Velvet Moss eyeshadow, apply it to the outer crease, keeping your brush horizontal. Bring it towards the outer portion of the crease. 12. This is what you should have. 13. Apply Clue eyeshadow to the outer crease by using light touches of the brush. 14. Pull it outwards to deposit the slightly deeper color into the outer portion of the crease. 15. This is how it should look. 16. Apply Juxt eyeshadow just above the crease, starting inside and moving outwards. 17. Move outwards so you can deposit Juxt above the entire colored area of the lid/crease. 18. This is how it should look right now. 19. Apply Daisychain eyeshadow directly under the brow to highlight the browbone. 20. Make sure you cover the entire brow bone area, and if you need to, go back to grab more of the shadow. 21. This is what you should have now. 22. Add black liner on the lower lash line (and upper lash line if you so desire). Add mascara and finish the look.']",536fec62fb39ce559c82547fe51ae2425767465c,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tutorial-gold-and-green-eyeshadow-easy-makeup-how-to/,['2008-01-11 00:00:00']
"['New York Fashion Week Fall 2008 – Time To Gear Up! zArchived Jan 23, 2008 January 23, 2008 I’m a first time New York Fashion Week goer! I’m definitely not a pro, and of course, I’m a little nervous about it all. I am thankful I attended San Francisco Fashion Week this past August, even though I’m fully aware of how very different the two are–but it does give me some idea of what to expect as a baseline. I am a planner, first and foremost; I even enjoy the planning that goes into things. Unfortunately, getting a firm schedule is a nightmare, and I only have a few things carved in stone at this point. So since I can’t exactly force my schedule to come together yet, I can at least plan the other details about my visit! WEATHER poses a significant “problem” for me, as I have been a California girl for just over fifteen years now. My teeth chatter as if hypothermia were imminent at about 50 degrees, let alone at 20. As a result, I am honestly more anxious about facing the brutal east coast weather than the designers and tents! Goal #1: I decided I needed to purchase the following items to hope to cope with the low temps: wool coat, boots, gloves, and long underwear. Result: Considering winter is still in full swing, it did not occur to me that winter wear is already on the outs! Alas, I could not find a single pair of boots in my size that did not offend my [limited] sense of fashion. Instead, I bought a pair of black Alfani loafers , which I fully intend to break in over the next week. Pray they don’t kill my feet. I bought two black wool coats, but one fits me much better than the other one. The only problem is there is belt sewn from the back that gets tied in the front that just looks awful! I’m hoping my mother can unsewn the sucker so I can rejoice in my lovely new coat! Better I take it to her than try to DIY it myself! Pending: I’m hoping to save some money and get gloves and long underwear (I don’t care if it’s not sexy nor high fashion, nobody will know!) from my mom. Goal #2: I will double and triple check that I have these warming items with me at all times: thick socks, sweater, and a scarf. If I could wear a hat without looking like a robber, I would! BUSY BUSY is the very nature of Fashion Week, so I need to make sure I take adequate precautions to prevent dehydration, starvation, and overall exhaustion. Goal #3: I will bring at least one bottle of water with me in my bag (Evian is sponsoring FW, so I expect to get more water there!) for emergencies. I will also keep a bag of Goldfish crackers for snacking and a makeshift lunch–plus some sugary sweets for quick boosts of energy. LOOKING GOOD while attending is always desirable, and to do this, I have to make sure I take the right kind of makeup with me. Goal #4: I don’t intend to check any bags, so I have to be conscious of how many liquid products I take with me–this means light on the glosses, lipsticks, and creams. Good news, though, because MAC recently launched an extended accessories line, which includes many empty containers, perfect for travel. I also want to make sure that I do not take too much makeup, for fear of breakage or it being lost/stolen. Eyes : Two quads–one with neutral colors (Ricepaper, Goldmine, Rye, and Bronze); one with darker colors (Carbon, Vex, Cranberry, Velvet Moss); Feline kohl power; Blacktrack fluidline; Plushlash mascara; sample of mixing medium; Gold Dusk pigment Lips: One nude, pink, and red lipstick (Cherish, Mari-sheeno, and Queen’s Sin); one nude, pink, and red gloss (Trifle, Bait, Red Romp); Pink Treat cremestick liner Face : Studio Fix Fluid in NC30; Dior SkinShimmer in Amber Diamond; Sculpt sculpting powder; Margin and Don’t Be Shy blushes; Daisydust beauty powder; sample of Moisturelush; travel size cleanser Brushes : 219, 239, 249 for eyes; 129, 182 x2, 194 for face DON’T FALL BEHIND in school, as I will for sure be missing one day of classes. Since I’ll be busy the whole weekend, I need to make sure I manage to keep up with the reading for my classes upon my return. Goal #5: Print out all the cases I need to read for my classes for week and read them on the plane ride to/from NYC. MUST. READ. I used go on weekend trips all the time during undergrad, and I would always bring some school-related reading… but would never do it. I must use all my will power to not fall into that bad habit! SET UP A NYC GET-TOGETHER for my very lovely Temptalia readers in the area! Now, I know I asked about interest in a SF PRO meet up, but I didn’t know I’d be heading to NYC. Since I’m not exactly a jetsetter, I think it’d be great to take it as an opportunity to meet any interested readers while I was out there. Since my schedule is still up in the air, I can’t give you details, other than it will either be February 2nd or 3rd (and probably during the day). I apologize for how last-minute it is and will be, but hopefully a few of us can gab and talk shop for a bit. Now it’s your turn to help me! Am I missing something that I totally need to make sure I bring with me (either to NYC or to FW)? Advice for facing the cold, harsh winter of the east coast?']",ffa6ed0ecc800568604285271a08601478e9e20e,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/new-york-fashion-week-2008-gear-up/,['2008-01-23 00:00:00']

Now, power shape your lashes with up to 160% more curl. Advanced aerodynamic gel formula with innovative curling polymers gives lashes weightless, seductive curves, without stiffness or flaking. New pigment technology creates intense black impact shades that absorb light and surround your eyes in the beauty of deep, rich color. Fragrance free. Ophthalmologist-tested. Applicator : Medium-sized brush with an oval shape to it–small point a the end. Clumping: Only mild clumping was experienced on the third coat towards the roots of lashes, but not at the ends. Curl : This isn’t a curling mascara, but it does hold a curl when you’ve used a lash curler. Ease : Quite easy to apply given the nature of the wand, which allows for more precision to get to harder to reach lashes on the inner area and the lower lashes. Length : You get a decent amount of length after a few coats of this mascara–not the longest I’ve ever seen–a good length for both natural and more dramatic looks. Thickening : I would have to say that I didn’t feel like my lashes were significantly thicker, even in the appearance. Volume : I found I got more volume out of this Estee Lauder mascara than some of the others I’ve tried. I felt like my lashes appeared fuller. Best : I liked how full my lashes looked thanks to the volumizing effect of the mascara, and the length that came out was quite lengthy. This is a great everyday mascara for those who want a bit of length and drama, but nothing over the top. Worst : No real downside to this mascara; perhaps the price is a turn off for those who are more budget-conscious.']",589e2853a39d586e495f2843c159abae77fe9c09,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/myriad-of-mascara-estee-lauder-illusionist-mascara/,['2007-12-09 00:00:00']
"['Halloween Looks: Mad Hatter, Paula, Paula, Soo zArchived Nov 29, 2010 November 29, 2010 Halloween Looks: Mad Hatter, Paula, Paula, Soo Monika’s husband gets dressed up as the Mad Hatter, Paula as a FIERCE! rainbow, Paula goes goth, and Soo goes as a goddess of the night. Check out their looks! Monika’s husband’s Halloween look MONIKA is a beauty blogger with a bit of a “creative flair” as she likes to say. She has a passion for both neutral and dramatic makeup, as well as natural and organic skincare. You can check out her blog here . INSPIRATION : This look was inspired by Mad Hatter character in the recent Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland movie with some slight changes to accommodate for my husband’s beard and dark hair (we thought of buying a red wig initially, but couldn’t find a good enough one). I wanted the eye make-up to look like splashes of colorful paint on the upper lid and still to blend in with the purple shadow underneath the eye. I’ve also contoured the cheeks and jaw with a plummy blusher mixed in with a bit of a taupe shade. I thought my husband’s bushy eyebrows and strong facial features went really well with the look. BREAKDOWN : Coastal Scents 56 Blush & Eyeshadow Palette, Inglot #58 Gel Lipstick. Paula’s Halloween look PAULA is 24 years old and lives in Florida. She loves color and creativity, and she finds makeup allows her to enjoy both freely. She’s self-taught and tries to pick up as many techniques as she can along the way! INSPIRATION : I had no intentions of going out for Halloween. However, Saturday afternoon, my coworker invited me out for the evening, so I literally had two hours to figure something out and get it together! On the way to the beauty supply store, I said to myself that if I found lashes and a wig, I’d be set! There, I found a bunch of colorful Red Cherry Lashes and a lilac Afro wig. I also picked up some colorful, 99-cent jewelry. Remembering this awesome dashiki I had bought a couple of months before, I decided to put it all together and be a rainbow; well, not just any rainbow, but a FIERCE rainbow! EYES : Sugarpill Tako, Buttercupcake, Dollipop, Afterparty Eyeshadows, MAC Shock-a-holic Eyeshadow, L’Oreal Carbon Black Felt Tip Eyeliner, Rimmel London Pure White Eye Pencil, Milani Everlast Infinite Liquid Liner, Red Cherry Lashes C201 and C202. LIPS : MAC Purple Rite Lipstick, MAC Impassioned Lipstick. FACE : Milani Golden Baked Bronzer, MAC Frankly Scarlet Blush, MAC Shock-a-holic Eyeshadow. Paula’s Halloween look PAULA is a freshman at UBC Okanagan. She loves makeup and nail art. She usually wears a neutral look, so she thought this would be fun! You can find her YouTube . INSPIRATION : A gothic look incorporating black clothing, pale skin, sunken cheeks, intense black-based eye look, and blackish red lip. EYES : Urban Decay Primer Potion, Bobbi Brown Black Gel Eyeliner, Kat Von D Lucifer Eyeshadow, NYX Red Bean Pie Eyeshadow, Maybelline Natural Smokes Eyeshadow Quad, Maybelline Black Line Stiletto Eyeliner, Revlon Really Red Lipstick. Soo’s Halloween look SOO is new to the world of makeup, so she wanted to try out a bold look. You can check out her blog ! INSPIRATION : I wanted a dramatic look for the club this past weekend, so I tried to do that. The NYX contest was about being a ‘goddess of the night’ and I thought of purple being a ‘royal’ sort of color and went with that.

Stacy’s Halloween look STACY is from New York City and just graduated from Fordham University in May in Psychology. She has been doing research at Columbia University and wants to be a child and adoelescent psychiatrist. INSPIRATION : Growing up, I always enjoyed dressing up masculine for halloween. I never liked being the fairy, bride, princess, or any cute, feminine costume what so ever. I always liked being the power ranger, Jason, Freddy, or any “scary” male character. So this year I was inspired by Two face from Batman. I did the joker with a feminine twist by wearing a green corset, purple jeans and a purple tie. IT looked absolutely amazing! I felt with two face I can make it sexy, yet scary at the same time. I always like to think outside the box and not be the typical feminine character.

Today was one of the first days of “fall” here in California–below 70 degrees (ha!). One of the ways we finished up our final days of summer was with a very nice mention on Only In A Woman’s World . I also watched my favorite webisode from the series thus far: I’ve been there so many times, I couldn’t even tell you the funny moments that ensued. Every time my boyfriend catches me jumping into skinny jeans, he can’t keep himself from laughing. If it wasn’t me trying to finagle my way into them, I might even laugh, too. (Maybe.) So with fall upon us, I want to know how (and if) your beauty routine changes as the season emerges!

"['Chanel Coromandel Rouge Allure Laque Review, Photos, Swatches, Lip Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Sep 29, 2009 September 29, 2009 Chanel Coromandel Rouge Allure Laque Chanel Coromandel Rouge Allure Laque ($32.00) is the first up in our seven days of Chanel Rouge Allure Laque feature. After last week’s experience with Chanel’s Dragon Rouge Allure Laque , I knew I had to have them all. There are eight shades in total, and I’ll introduce to each shade over the next week. Coromandel is a fiery orange-based red with just a flicker of orange shimmer that’s very, very subtle. It applies evenly with ease (which is a huge OMG-YES! factor from this product, period), and it feels like a satiny, lightly creamy lip color that hugs lips without drying them out (in fact, hydrating). It has a glossy sheen that lasts for hours, which does fade when you eat/drink through a whole meal, but the color itself hangs on like a trooper–see the evidence here . Coromandel goes on opaque in one layer; there’s no real need to layer here. I usually just slip out the applicator and apply with whatever is on it and I’m good to go. The only downsides of Rouge Allure Laques are that they’re pricey at $32 a pop. The packaging is solid black with a slight glossy appearance–it’s subtle and sleek. To rationalize the price a bit (at least for myself), I consider this pretty much a wear-and-go lip color–that means it’s a gloss and a lipstick in one. There’s absolutely no need to layer on additional lip products with these, because the color is so intense and pigmented and the product itself has the look of a lipstick with a gloss over it… there’s literally no need. This makes it a two-for kind of deal, but it’s also superb for traveling or touch-ups. Get fancy lip color with no fuss! I personally do prefer Dragon over Coromandel for a red, but I find myself drawn to more neutral reds–“true reds”–over orange-y reds.

This week, I’m sharing Just Joey (T2) , which is a browned-tan nude with a little peachiness to it. It is completely opaque in just one stroke, and it delivers a beautiful soft glossed finish without shimmer. This would be a beautiful, upgraded nude on both cool and warm skin tones, but particularly so on warmer skin tones. The Extra Rich line-up includes a total of eight shades : R1 Black Bacara, R2 Red Abundance, R3 Leonardis, R4 Danse du Feu, T1 Halloween, T2 Just Joey, T3 Baby Julia, and T4 Calliope. The Extra Rich Lipstick formula is opaque, smooth, and easy to wear. I get between three and five hours of wear, even with more nude shades like Just Joey. It clings and hugs lips without being drying (but actually hydrating), but it is still a lovely textured lipstick. It’s just not this thick or overly creamy lipstick that slips around lips, but it doesn’t feel tight or heavy either. I’ve also found that it de-emphasizes the lip lines with the effect really settling in after about fifteen minutes of wear. Price aside, is this a nude you’d wear?

"['Cle de Peau Extra Rich Lipstick Review, Photos, Swatches (R2 Red Abundance) Reviews Jun 15, 2010 June 15, 2010 Cle de Peau Red Abundance (R2) Extra Rich Lipstick Decadence in Lipstick with Red Abundance Cle de Peau R2 Red Abundance Extra Rich Lipstick ($60.00 for 0.14 oz.) is a wicked, wicked, wicked shade of vibrant red. It’s a slightly orange-hued red with ridiculous pigmentation and glossy sheen. This is not an affordable lipstick–this is, quite easily, a lipstick that epitomizes luxury. The color is rich, smooth, and clings to lips for hours (I had six hours of wear, including a meal) and retains much of the sheen throughout. It’s not a heavy, thick, or particularly creamy lipstick, but it’s hydrating and doesn’t leave lips parched after it’s removed. The Exra Rich line-up includes a total of eight shades: R1 Black Bacara, R2 Red Abundance, R3 Leonardis, R4 Danse du Feu, T1 Halloween, T2 Just Joey, T3 Baby Julia, and T4 Calliope. The lipstick itself is shaped into a baguette, where the edges are designed to help you apply it as if you were using a lip brush. While I didn’t have any trouble applying it without a lip brush (the swatch is an application straight from the tube), I don’t know about it being particularly owing to the design. It’s pretty and unique as far as lipsticks go, but in terms of making it easier to apply, it felt about the same to me. The lipstick also contains Vitmain A Acetate, which is supposed to be the first lipstick formulated with it, which gives it both the texture and the moisturizing properties. I found the lipstick easy to apply–no drag–but it’s not creamy like YSL Rouge Voluptes; it’s smooth and feels like silk against lips. Where this lipstick excels, as with Cle de Peau’s lipsticks in general, is de-emphasizing lip lines, giving lips a fuller, plumper look (but make no mistake, it’s merely from smoothing out lip lines–no actual lip plumping here). R2 also happens to be a very pigmented shade that really showcases the brightness and depth of this particularly red hue. I’ve also experienced particularly long wear with this shade (which does lightly stain even as it begins to wear off in the sixth hour), but even in the lighter shades (to-be-reviewed), wear is surprisingly lengthy.

"['Chanel Coromandel Rouge Allure Laque , Lip Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Sep 29, 2009 September 29, 2009 Chanel Coromandel Rouge Allure Laque Chanel Coromandel Rouge Allure Laque ($32.00) is the first up in our seven days of Chanel Rouge Allure Laque feature. After last week’s experience with Chanel’s Dragon Rouge Allure Laque , I knew I had to have them all. There are eight shades in total, and I’ll introduce to each shade over the next week. Coromandel is a fiery orange-based red with just a flicker of orange shimmer that’s very, very subtle. It applies evenly with ease (which is a huge OMG-YES! factor from this product, period), and it feels like a satiny, lightly creamy lip color that hugs lips without drying them out (in fact, hydrating). It has a glossy sheen that lasts for hours, which does fade when you eat/drink through a whole meal, but the color itself hangs on like a trooper–see the evidence here . Coromandel goes on opaque in one layer; there’s no real need to layer here. I usually just slip out the applicator and apply with whatever is on it and I’m good to go. The only downsides of Rouge Allure Laques are that they’re pricey at $32 a pop. The packaging is solid black with a slight glossy appearance–it’s subtle and sleek. To rationalize the price a bit (at least for myself), I consider this pretty much a wear-and-go lip color–that means it’s a gloss and a lipstick in one. There’s absolutely no need to layer on additional lip products with these, because the color is so intense and pigmented and the product itself has the look of a lipstick with a gloss over it… there’s literally no need. This makes it a two-for kind of deal, but it’s also superb for traveling or touch-ups. Get fancy lip color with no fuss! I personally do prefer Dragon over Coromandel for a red, but I find myself drawn to more neutral reds–“true reds”–over orange-y reds. They’re both beautiful shades, and I’m sure there are some who prefer Coromandel over Dragon and vice versa!

Sapphire (450) is a nearly matte, periwinkle blue. Posh Peacock (500) is a gorgeous shade of blue with an aqua-teal shimmer-sheen. These are definitely some of the better textured eyeshadows from mass that I’ve encountered recently. They’re also quite pigmented without having to maneuver in certain ways, like packing it on, using sponge-tip applicators, etc. Glam’Eyes Mono Eyeshadows work best with brushes, as the eyeshadows are quite silky. I found a sponge-tip felt a little rough on the shadows–like it was causing the shadow to break apart a bit. Posh Peacock (500) was definitely my favorite, because it was richly pigmented (more so than the other two I tried), and it was just stunning when swatched. It was vibrant and had depth when I’ve come not to expect that from a lot of eyeshadows on the market these days. The other two shades were decently pigmented, but they were a little more on the powdery side, which is due in part to their more matte texture.

The photo above was not intended to be artsy, but upon opening it for the first time, it dropped that much product onto my desk. Now, imagine that on your face–because that’s exactly what I ended up with when I tried applying this for the first time (my carpet is less than pleased). At a mere 0.025 oz. of product, I’m not exactly sure one wants to deal with any wasted product–even by wiping excess on a tissue.

It has a slightly glossy finish and semi-opaque color. It has a little milkiness to the base color. This particular shade is new and limited edition for spring and comes in special edition black lacquered packaging. (You can see the black lacquered packaging here .) It actually feels a bit more like the Rouge G Brilliant formula than the typical Rouge G–not quite as opaque, still very emollient and creamy but not as long-wearing. my thoughts on the formula: Long-time readers will know that Guerlain’s Rouge G formula is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks, so I always look forward to new and seasonal shade releases. Rouge G colors have certain nuances to them just seem to make them more flattering when worn. The formula is moisturizing, long-wearing (four to six hours), and comfortable to wear–never heavy but generally opaque in color. I’m still crossing my fingers for refills, because as elegant as the case is, so much of the price must be attributed to it, and it would be nice to be able to reuse it. The one thing I noticed about these is though the weight feels the same (we actually whipped out the scale, it was a 0.06 oz. lighter), the magnet enclosure seemed slightly weaker. If you throw ’em around, the black lacquered case’s lid will fall off easier than the metal one (which also slips off if you put it through the tests we did, haha). I carried one in my purse all day, though, and it was fine. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 26/30 Value : 7/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 final thoughts: It’s a beautiful springtime pink, and though I don’t have a laundry list of dupes for this exact shade, there are enough springy pinks that you could pass on this shade if you only want to save your $47 for the most unique of the Rouge G line-up.

It is definitely a near-blinding kind of white, though, with a rich metallic finish.

I picked this up when Nordstrom was having some super point thing going on (I think it was triple points…), but I’m not sure I’m sold on it! It contains four shades: a soft coppered gold with subtle gold sparkle; medium-dark violet plu m with blue-violet micro-shimmer; charcoal-mauve with a muted violet shimmer and slight sheen; and dark black with a matte finish. Upon first glance, the charcoal-mauve looked absolutely stunning–it almost gave off a duochrome sheen! It seemed like a mix of violet, plum, gray with green and violet shimmer/sheen. It’s less interesting when swatched, as it appears a bit flat in comparison. The golden shade has Guerlain’s signature bee embossed, while the other three shades have a raised honeycomb pattern. The patterning will disappear after a few uses, though it doesn’t just disappear at first touch. I do, however, like that these patterns utilize each shade’s colors, rather than an overlay of another color, which ultimately affects the end color result but only as long as the overlay exists. I found the golden shade to have a frostier finish and having some kick-up, whereas the remaining three colors were very smooth and were easy to apply.

I love Rouge Allure Laques (I don’t think I’ve kept that a secret!), and Phoenix is gorgeous. It’s this beautiful strawberry-esque pink that’s bold and bright without being electric. I love the full-color coverage, too–totally and utterly opaque on my lips (see, covers my freckle!). Love, love the feel of it as well. It applies evenly and smoothly with ease in what is, essentially, a liquid lipstick formula. On my lips, I get about three to four hours on average, with the gloss fading around hour two or three and the color lingering for a solid four to five hours. (The deeper Rouge Allure Laques have more lingering colors than the lighter shades, like Ming and Santal.) I hope Chanel is listening, ’cause I want MORE Rouge Allure Laques this year! Another eight?

NARS’ Lip Gloss is non-sticky and scent- and taste-free, though they have been known to smell a bit like plastic or wax. I did not notice any scent whatsoever with my Bougainville, though. It is similar to fall’s Strawberry Fields in the way it is pigmented, creamy, lacks shimmer, and is non-sticky. The colors, however, are noticeably different. While Strawberry Fields is a bright raspberry pink-red, Bougainville is a rich berry. It has the same color-rich look with a glossy shine but no shimmer, though.

Phoenix is a medium bright pink. It’s not really cool-toned, but it’s not warm, either (although, I’ve rarely met a pink I’d really classify as warm, but I digress!). I’d call it neutral-cool if pressed. Easy to apply, opaque color in one quick layer, and stunning color that lasts for hours and through eating/drinking? I’m totally on board with that! Phoenix is just as amazing as the other shades, and it doesn’t disappoint in the least bit. It’s a great shade that’s noticeable, bright without being neon, and still wearable. If the lightness of Ming wasn’t your style, maybe the brightness of Phoenix is a better fit for you. It has a light glossy sheen with subtle pinkish/white shimmer. Since I don’t want to just re-write what I say about the formula (since it is the same–if there are any variations, you can be sure I’ll call them out), here’s a quick bullet-point summary.

"['MAC Marcel Wanders Collection Year: 2010 Launches Nov 16, 2010 November 16, 2010 MAC & Marcel Wanders Collection MAC & Marcel Wanders Collection “If I have a basic motivation, it’s to inspire people to make their life a Masterpiece!” Is that not what we do every day at M·A·C? So it is that the Dutch industrial designer – known for everything from his “Happy Hour” Chandelier to his “futuresonic” way with old Delft porcelain, and for co-founding now-iconic design collective Droog AND the amusing, classicism-meets-futurism objects of his own group, Moooi (from the Dutch word for “beauty,” but with an extra “o” for extra-beautiful!) – wandered HERE…It had to be! M·A·C partners with Marcel Wanders – his first foray into the world of cosmetics – and design sophisticates (and people with innate and irreverent tastes) will be bonkers for these limited-edition Lipstick, Lip Gloss, Sheer Mystery Powder, Air of Style Scent Concentrate and his signature brush and clutch creations, not least of all for their arresting packaging – fine collectors’ items all!

Check out more photos, behind the collection, and Q&A with Marcel Wanders! Behind the Collection M·A·C Cosmetics is widely recognized for its stylish, artistic, quirky and edgy collaborations whose partners run the gamut from the world of fashion and art to Hollywood and pop culture. It is no wonder that the latest partnership is with none other than legendary Dutch designer, Marcel Wanders. The two powerhouse brands are teaming up on a 2010 holiday luxe makeup collection that is bound to catch the attention of makeup addicts and design aficionados around the globe. From hotel suites to restaurants, beach accessories to bags and furniture to bathroom designs, Marcel Wanders has put his mind, and maverick sensibility, to them all. Marcel’s design philosophy is to bring beauty to the things that we see all the time; to raise the aesthetic bar and elevate the normality of the everyday. “It’s not just about function, it’s about having something you really love and caring about the details that surround you,” says Wanders. Little wonder, then, that his latest collaboration is with iconic cult brand M·A·C Cosmetics: For what could simultaneously be more everyday and utterly personal than makeup? “As a company I feel we have to explore every avenue of design,” explains James Gager, Senior Vice President and Creative Director, M·A·C Cosmetics, who has teamed up with many of the world’s leading trendsetters on colour collections. “When choosing M·A·C partnerships it’s important that there is an authentic synergy and similar philosophy shared between the brands. We are, after all, Make-up Art Cosmetics so there has to be a strong artistic association to feel it’s the perfect match. I’m always asking the question ‘Is it artful enough to be M·A·C?’” Well, you can’t get more artful than Marcel Wanders. Not only is he an internationally acclaimed designer, but he’s also at the pinnacle of the Dutch design movement characterized by irreverence, risk taking and innovative design solutions – all of which are aligned with M·A·C’s DNA. Wanders was ultimately given free reign when it came to working on the package design for M·A·C’s Luxe 2010 collection. “We simply told him the products we wanted in the collection and asked him to come back to us with his vision,” confirms Gager. “I didn’t want to put restrictions on Marcel, it’s important that our collaborators approach a project from a fresh perspective.” The results are stunningly beautiful and most certainly original. For a company whose signature packaging is all about monochrome and utilitarian cool, the M·A·C and Marcel Wanders collection retained that innate signature look with sleek black lines and tactile finish, while pushing the design boundaries as far from simple as possible. As Wanders quips, “We don’t want minimal, we want optimal!” This maximalist aesthetic works very well for the luxurious tone of M·A·C’s limited edition luxe collection. “We wanted the collection to have a sophisticated feel and the products to have a ‘dress up’ moment,” explains Gager. It turns out that the idea of dressing up is exactly where Wanders is coming from. Marcel always felt naturally inclined to design for women “because they add a sense of elegance to the world that few men have, and I really wanted to explore the idea of how makeup enhances this quality.” Wanders went back to his Dutch roots and the works of 17th Century Dutch Baroque painter Vermeer, famed for his iconic images of women such as “Girl With a Pearl Earring” (1665). While the makeup itself wasn’t Wanders’ remit, the colours and textures of the collection are as decadent andsleek as the packaging. Take the smooth opaque Lipsticks and ultra light Lip Glosses – both come in shades including golden frosted champagne, hot fuchsia and vampy blackened red and the Sheer Mystery Powder, which gives skin exactly that gossamer light and flawless finish Vermeer himself was known for. Predict a stampede for the False Lashes Mascara for that untold oomph this party season. The M·A·C and Marcel Wanders collection is more than a clever edit of what every woman desires come party season. Encased in wonderfully unique packaging with jewel-like compacts, the products reflect the edgy, high-style M·A·C aesthetic and fit perfectly within Wanders’ design dream of creating art out of common everyday items. Q&A with Marcel Wanders How did this collaboration with M·A·C come about? I was talking with a journalist friend of mine about how I felt it would be interesting to work on a project with cosmetics, and I thought of M·A·C. I like to work for women – men are boring but women are exciting! The breadth of your collaborations is amazing, ranging from crystal (Baccarat), homewards (Target), interior accessories (B&B Italia), fragrance (Cacharel), lighting (Flos), bags (Mandarina Duck) beach wear (Puma) to, of course, contemporary interior design and furniture. What was exciting to you about designing makeup? Makeup is such a wonderful invention. Women paint themselves to be beautiful, and have done so for thousands of years. This fundamental idea, and the way that it connects to art – first women paint themselves, then the painter takes his brushes to paint her – immediately interested me. What was your inspiration for the collaboration? Coming from the Netherlands, Vermeer is my culture and “Girl with a Pearl Earring” in particular inspired me. He is the most important painter in the world to me – to revisit his work was fascinating. It’s such a contrast with the way we work now, which in the last few hundred years has become so mechanical. Vermeer is relevant to me because he represents the idea that there’s an interesting story to tell if you look to your world in a more poetic and loving way. Designing beauty packaging immediately made me think of the painterly connection I mentioned before. We are creating striking tools for women to paint and make themselves beautiful. Your philosophy is “Here to create an environment of Love…Live with Passion and make our most Exciting Dreams come True”; how does this apply to your collection with M·A·C? That statement is about everything that we do here. For this collection, it’s about how we’ve created a dream. Like a painter from the Golden Age and his passion, we today use the same tools as Vermeer did 400 years ago to create beauty. It’s a very exciting and beautiful sentiment to me – I feel it’s an elevating and uplifting idea to connect the past and the future in this way. Take the wonderfully intricate Luxe Brush; it was hand milled in Japan as a very classical way of giving lightness to objects. It gives common tools a beauty beyond their functionality. What was your idea behind the Clutch Bag/Brush Roll? This is the pièce de résistance and exemplifies how to take a simple and utilitarian object from the painters’ past and translate it into a glamorous modern accessory. The shape derives from how a painter would store his brushes in a textile roll, but the ribbon and stone closure turns it into something beautiful to carry. It transforms into your own personal mobile vanity set. It’s interesting to me that there’s a fragrance in the lineup. How do you feel about this? Beauty to me only arrives once all the senses discover it at the same time. Fragrance is a great way to make it all work together, to complete a whole vision of beauty. Is there a common design ethos throughout all your works? In my studio we find many different ways to connect projects. I want my work to be a family. I love them to be connected, so I do use a lot of the same design metaphors between different projects. The idea of using current technology to make objects which are completely modern, but that look back in time to when things were handcrafted before the industrial revolution. Were you involved in the specific shade names of these products? Yes, the names of the products themselves are steeped in Vermeer, named after the women – lovers, sisters, wives, mother – in his life. It’s important to me that every detail of the collection works together. I would love to make things that are meaningful and emotional, not just practical. To me it’s not superficial, it’s about having a deeper relationship with the things in your life other than just ‘needing’ them. The collection is based on the idea that your tools can be your jewels.

"['Lipstick Comparisons: $13 to $25 (Part 1) Features Oct 09, 2010 October 09, 2010 Lipstick Comparisons: $13 to $25 (Part 1) In this price range, lipsticks tend to be more pigmented, have less synthetic scents, and wear an average of four hours. I’m not typically disappointed beyond belief with a lipstick formula in this price range. Brands from MAC to NARS to Smashbox fall into this price tier, while designer brands like Chanel, Dior, and YSL are in the next tier. There are really SO many brands and formulas to choose from in this category that I had to split this post into two parts! Benefit Full Finish Lipstick ($18.00) PROS : Creamy, opaque, glossy, wears for 3 to 4 hours, moisturizing NEUTRAL : 0.10 oz., slight sweet scent CONS : Very limited shade range MY REC : These aren’t quite as glossy or as creamy as the Silky Finish line, but they’re more opaque. I still find them rather creamy and moisturizing, though. Some of mine seem to have a very subtle sweetened scent while others have none. Benefit Silky Finish Lipstick ($18.00) PROS : Creamy, moisturizing, glossy, wears for 3 to 4 hours NEUTRAL : 0.10 oz., shades range from sheer to semi-opaque, slight sweet scent CONS : Short shade range centered around pinks MY REC : The Silky Finish is a much glossier, often shimmered lipstick compared to Benefit’s Full Finish range. These actually remind me quite a bit of Laura Mercier’s Stick Gloss. They’re more moisturizing than the average lipstick and have a slicker texture, too. Some of mine seem to have a very subtle sweetened scent while others have none. Bobbi Brown Lip Color Lipstick ($22.00) PROS : Creamy, slightly glossy, wears 4-6 hours, opaque NEUTRAL : 0.12 oz., scent-free, more neutral/pink based shade range CONS : One finish (semi-matte) MY REC : I like the pigmentation and creaminess in the texture of Bobbi Brown’s Lip Color. Sometimes I get caught in thinking that Bobbi Brown is all about sheers, but then the Lip Color line always reminds me that it’s not always the case. Despite their creaminess, they’re not moisturizing; not drying either, but not particularly moisturizing. Clinique Long Last Soft Shine Lipstick ($14.00) PROS : Wearable shade range, creamy, moisturizing, semi-opaque NEUTRAL : 0.14 oz., more neutral/pink based shade range, scent-free CONS : Wears 2 to 3 hours (despite being touted as long-wearing) MY REC : I think Clinique makeup often gets overlooked, but I like how much of their makeup is scent-free. I also think they’re worth more than just a glance given the price tag. Illamasqua Lipstick ($22.00) PROS : Opaque, true-to-tube color, wears 5 to 7 hours, lots of fun shades NEUTRAL : 0.14 oz., scent-free CONS : Mostly matte finishes, dry MY REC : It’s important to note that while the texture itself seems a little dry, these lipsticks don’t suck the moisture out of your lips, but they definitely don’t impart any either. With an abundance of matte shades with drier finishes, these are not ideal for those with dry to ultra dry lips. Korres Guava Lipstick ($22.00) PROS : Creamy, opaque, moisturizing, wears 3 to 4 hours NEUTRAL : Guava-scented CONS : 0.06 oz., limited shade range MY REC : My biggest issue with these is how little you get; they’re half the size of Korres’ Mango Butter Lipsticks and $4 more. The Guava lipsticks are more opaque and not as glossy in the finish, but they’re a little less moisturizing than the Mango Butters. Korres Mango Butter Lipstick ($18.00) PROS : Creamy, moisturizing, semi-sheer, wears 3 to 4 hours NEUTRAL : 0.12 oz., mango-scented CONS : Name/numbering system doesn’t always match tube color, limited shade range MY REC : I find these very moisturizing, and I love the glossiness of the finish, because it almost looks like you’re just wearing a gloss. If you have dry lips and haven’t tried these, you might want to give ’em a shot. Laura Mercier Creme Lip Colour ($22.00) PROS : Creamy, semi-opaque, wears 3 to 4 hours NEUTRAL : 0.14 oz., scent-free CONS : Limited shade range MY REC : I’ve found these to be very creamy, and they’re often more on the opaque side of color. They impart some moisture but I wouldn’t consider it a moisturizing lipstick. Laura Mercier Stick Gloss ($20.00) PROS : Moisturizing, glossy, semi-sheer, wears 3 to 4 hours NEUTRAL : 0.12 oz., Berry-scented CONS : Very limited shade range MY REC : It’s very comfortable to wear and feels incredibly moisturizing–it’s just a shame that there are so few shades available. The Lipstick Comparisons series is designed to provide a quick reference summary sheet for some of the many available lipstick formulas. It seems like most brands have at least a couple of formulas, if not half a dozen, and it can be difficult to find the formulas that will work best for your budget, coloring, style, or taste. This is not necessarily a best of list, and it’s not exhaustive–it is based on actual lipsticks that I’ve tried; they are all, however, decent to excellent lipsticks. (And perhaps, some day, it will be an exhaustive list.) I have summarized my experience based on pros and cons, but also some “neutral” factors that may be pros or cons, depending on your preferences. I will update this series as I try new lipstick formulas.']",d784db853d6557bb50360cf4dc9f5766bfe0e858,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/lipstick-comparisons-13-to-25-part-1/,['2010-10-09 00:00:00']

Michaela’s Halloween look MICHAELA loves cosmetics, and she is from Austria. She creates German videos on YouTube . INSPIRATION : Taylor Momsen BREAKDOWN : First of all I primed my face with MAC prep and prime, then I primed my eyelids with UDPP. I took a white eyeshadow from the 120 palette and applied it all over my face. For my eyes I used MAC cranberry (form and color inspired by some Taylor Momsen pictures). I just blend it with the same white eyeshadow as I used on my face. Then I’ve made my eyeliner with MAC blacktrack and put on some fals lashes. I filled in my brows with a eyeliner by MAC called engraved. For my cheeks I used some red blush and tried to made a angled type of form on both sides. For my lips – I primed with MAC prep and prime for lips and then applied some dark purple eyeliner as a base. Afterwards I used a dark brown lipstick. I wanted to use a black lipstick, but don’t wanted to buy one, so this combination made me happy. Claudia’s Halloween look CLAUDIA is a diverse person with an all-over-the-place background that shows through her makeup and clothing choices. INSPIRATION : The 80s in general. At first it was going to be leggings/leg warmers/crimped hair but I was leaning more towards the rocker 80s by the end and decided on harem pants/leather jacket/rocker hair. I got a lot of JEM comparisons from people, so we can settle on that!

"['Estee Lauder’s Pure White Linen Pink Coral Review, Photos Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Oct 04, 2009 October 04, 2009 Estee Lauder’s Pure White Linen Pink Coral ($72.00 for 3.4 oz.) is the newest addition to the White Linen perfume franchise. Pure White Linen emerged originally, and then a derivation thereof in Pure White Linen Light Breeze. In June, Pure White Linen Pink Coral joined the family. Composition Top Notes: Apple Blossom, Clear Aldehydes, Waterfruits, Pink Peppercorns, Chinese Berry Mist Middle Notes: Jasmine, Pink Peony, Camellia Flower, Cherry Blossom, Sweet Pea, Honeysuckle Base Notes: Vanilla, Heliotrope, Sandalwood I had never taken a sniff of the original White Linen scent, because I come from a family that’s terribly irritated (nose-wise) from fragrances. Growing up, perfume was completely off-limits, and there’s no real way to sneak wearing perfume when you have a bunch of sensitive noses around the house! (Trust me, I tried a few times… spraying outside, but they’d know when I came home with the scent still lingering.) Perfume was always this unattainable product category that I was like, “I can’t wait until I move out of the house so I can wear perfume everyday!” Turns out, unfortunately for me, that a lot of perfumes tickle my nose in rather…unpleasant way, so I actually wear very light scents when I do wear them, and I’d say only a few times a week at that. Estee Lauder describes this scent as a soft floral, “The tender fragrance to live in all year long. It sweeps over the senses, gentle as the ocean at dawn in waves of sea-kissed Apple Blossoms, Waterfruits, Sweet Peas and Camellias blushed with Honeysuckle and Sandalwood. You’ll love how you feel in Pure White Linen Pink Coral.” The scent of Pure White Linen Pink Coral is that of a lightweight, softly sweetened floral. It feels young, not quite as sophisticated as the other scents in the franchise, and it just has that feel like they were going for a younger demographic. It opens with the crispness of green apples and lightness of berries. As it wears, the sweetness of honeysuckle and jasmine start to appear, and gives you a more obvious floral scent. Finally, the dry down is a very tried-and-true combination of vanilla and sandalwood. I feel like this isn’t a unique scent, but it’s a very wearable scent. It’s light, tame, and all-occasion appropriate. It’s probably more suitable to a subtle summer scent than perhaps fall, but I know others, like me, prefer lighter scents year-round, too. I think if you are, generally, a fan of Estee Lauder scents, you may find this scent too much like a redux and merely milking the White Linen chain than an original creation by the perfume giant. I like it, but it doesn’t grab me enough at the open nor at the end, so it’s not something I’ll personally be wearing often. Product : 21/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 3/5 Packaging : 3/5 Recommendation : For a soft, flirty sweetened floral, Estee Lauder may have your poison!

It reminded me of China Glaze’s Midnight Kiss , but it’s nowhere near as gold. It does, however, have a similar finish–it’s almost a foil but not quite, and brush strokes are nearly invisible despite the slight metallic sheen. The drying time is faster than average, but it does dry to more of a semi-matte finish so you may want to use a shiny top coat for more oomph (swatches are shown without a top coat). It took two coats to get opaque coverage, and it was actually incredibly easy to apply and to achieve no pesky brush strokes because of Dior’s brush. This is the first Dior polish I’ve owned that has a wide, tapered brush. I haven’t seen a brush like this before, and I thought it would be too wide to be practical, but it worked really well for me.

It reminded me of China Glaze’s Midnight Kiss , but it’s nowhere near as gold. It does, however, have a similar finish–it’s almost a foil but not quite, and brush strokes are nearly invisible despite the slight metallic sheen. The drying time is faster than average, but it does dry to more of a semi-matte finish so you may want to use a shiny top coat for more oomph (swatches are shown without a top coat). It took two coats to get opaque coverage, and it was actually incredibly easy to apply and to achieve no pesky brush strokes because of Dior’s brush. This is the first Dior polish I’ve owned that has a wide, tapered brush. I haven’t seen a brush like this before, and I thought it would be too wide to be practical, but it worked really well for me. I do think if you have smaller nail beds, though, it may be more difficult (I know I have longer fingers than proportional to my body–thanks piano!).

Dior Five Golds Eyeshadow Quint ($58.00 for 0.21 oz.) is one of two new and limited edition holiday quints. As indicated, it includes five shades of eyeshadow, and this is a palette with a rather metallic feel and look. I purchased this as part of my Sephora Friends & Family haul! It has a similar theme as MAC’s Rockers & Reelers Eyeshadow Palette , because both have a lot of metallic-like finishes, but the colors themselves are a bit different. Dior’s metallic quint is closer to neutral, while MAC’s is on the warmer side. Five Golds includes a dark charcoal gray with a soft silver sparkle; subdued copper-gold with a metallic finish; semi-sheer icy white-gold with a bright shimmer-shine; chocolate bronze with a metallic finish; and a bright, light silver with a high metallic shine. Every shade had rich pigmentation except the lightest white-gold shade, which was on the sheer side, and it also had more of a glittery feel compared to the smoother texture of the other four shades. It looks a lot yellower in the pan than when used, though. The other four shades were true-to-pan in terms of color. This is probably one of my favorite Dior quints in terms of quality; the shades are smooth, soft without being powdery, and really rich in color. Dior’s eyeshadow quints are always a better value than their singles or duos, though it is still more expensive than Chanel’s eyeshadow quads (but less than Guerlain’s!). Even though the shades are dupeable by other brands, the finish and texture really hit home.

"['Look: Ode to Hourglass Gypsy Looks Nov 04, 2010 November 04, 2010 Ode to Hourglass Gypsy I have raved about Hourglass’ Visionaire Eyeshadow Duos before–the texture is really top notch: buttery, soft, and easy to blend. I don’t think there’s a single thing I dislike about these duos. The price is hefty, but then they give you a ton of each color. I would love to see them put out more shades, though. Is that a con? Hm. As you can tell from this look, I was test-driving quite a few products I’ve yet to review. Some quick notes… Hourglass Gpysy eyeshadow duo makes for a really easy, go-to everyday look Lancome Definicils Precious Cells mascara clumped up a lot, seemingly dry, so I’m going to have to check the tube and do some more testing NARS Sex Appeal blush barely shows up on me (NC25/NC30 skin tone, for reference), bummer! NARS Bougainville lipgloss is a sexy, vampy shade — in the vein of Strawberry Fields but noticeably darker You will need the following… Eyes : NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base (neutral eyeshadow base), Hourglass Gypsy Eyeshadow Duo (champagne/chocolate brown), MAC Lord It Up Pearlglide Eyeliner (dark brown), Lancome Definicils Precious Cells Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder (translucent) Cheeks : NARS Sex Appeal Blush Lips : NARS Bougainville Lipgloss Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 116 (dense blush brush) For eyes, start by applying Smudgeproof as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Using the 239, apply the champagne eyeshadow all over the lid, blending just above the crease. Next, apply the chocolate brown eyeshadow into the crease with the 226 and blend softly above and below the crease. Lightly highlight the brow bone with the champagne eyeshadow with the 217. Bring everything together by applying Lord It Up pearlglide eyeliner on the lower lash line. Finish by sweeping lashes with Hypnose Precious Cells mascara . For cheeks, apply Sex Appeal blush on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Bougainville lipgloss for a complementing lip.

"['China Glaze Holiday 2010: Part 3 Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Oct 15, 2010 October 15, 2010 Nail Lacquer : Midnight Kiss, Party Hearty China Glaze Holiday 2010: Part 3 Finally! These are the last four shades of the new and limited sixteen holiday shades by China Glaze. I grouped these together, because three of the four are very glitter-based. I wanted to swatch the glitters last, since the glitter does have a tendency to get into the nooks and crannies of my nails, which can throw off other swatches. Party Hearty is a fun shade but definitely use it to layer rather than alone. Each China Glaze retails for $3 and up, depending on where you purchase yours from. I know the brand is carried at various etailers as well as Sally’s (not sure if it’s in store yet, though). Midnight Kiss is a soft gold with gold shimmer-glitter and an almost metallic/foil finish. It’s the gold version of Cheers to You. It seems similar to Butter London’s Full Monty . Two coats. Party Hearty is a mix of large, red hexagonal glitter; smaller green hexagonal glitter; and smaller silver and gold circular/square glitter. All the glitter particles are flat and suspended in a clear base. This is a shade that’s best layered over other polishes rather than on its own. For swatching purposes, I did both, and when it’s shown alone, that’s three full coats. I liked it best over Midnight Kiss, Cheers to You, and Frosty. Mrs. Claus is a pinky-red jelly with dark pink and fuchsia glitter suspended in the base. I feel like I’ve seen this shade before, but I can’t put my finger on it. I did three coats, but it still seemed rather pink on me. (This shade fell flat for me; it’s just so pink on but red in the bottle–I’d give this a lower product score of 27/30, FYI!) Mistletoe Kisses is an emerald green base with minty-green/silver glitter. After swatching Mrs. Clause, I thought this was going to be just like it, but Mistletoe Kisses is quite opaque! It initially reminded me of China Glaze Watermelon Rind , but it’s far too teal in comparison. Two coats. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ?

"['MAC Tartan Tale: Reelers & Rockers Eyeshadow Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Oct 26, 2010 October 26, 2010 MAC Tartan Tale: Reelers & Rockers Eyeshadow Palette MAC Tartan Tale: Reelers & Rockers Eyeshadow Palette Reelers & Rockers Eyeshadow Palette ($36.00) is a colorful palette with a slight cool tone running through it. This palette includes six eyeshadows: White Rabbit (shimmer white), Melt My Heart (metallic silver), Carbon (matte black), Family Treasure (metallic bronze), Gaelic Gold (metallic gold), and Crown & Sceptre (metallic copper). White Rabbit is a bright, shimmery white, It has a frost finish, and it was originally launched in last year’s holiday palettes. It has a very smooth texture and packs a lot of pigment without having to use a lot of product. It’s similar to White Frost or Gesso (but with shimmer). Melt My Heart is a a light silver with a metallic sheen. It has a veluxe pearl finish. It’s not quite as pigmented as other veluxe pearls, but it has a smooth feel when applied. It’s similar to Forgery, except the texture is soft and smooth–lighter than Electra. Carbon is a dark black. It has a matte finish, and it is a permanent shade. It works better than it swatches, but it will definitely darken anything you layer it over. It’s not the deepest, darkest black, though. Family Treasure is a soft metallic peachy gold with a strong shine. It has a veluxe pearl finish, and it’s as smooth and pigmented as one would expect. It’s a less yellow, more orange Goldmine. Gaelic Gold is a brightened medium gold kissed by molten ore. It has a veluxe pearl finish, and it’s rich in pigmentation and creamy in consistency. It’s slightly darker and deeper than Goldmine. (Goldmine would fit almost exactly between Family Treasure and Gaelic Gold.) Crown & Sceptre is a medium-dark coppery brown with metallic shine. It has a veluxe pearl finish with a smooth, creamy texture and nice color payoff. It’s a little lighter than Antiqued, but they are similar. The palette contains 0.19 oz. worth of eyeshadow along with a tiny 213 brush, which means you’re paying $190/oz. In comparison, if you were to buy potted eyeshadows, MAC eyeshadows run at $290/oz. and pans run at $230/oz. These palettes do offer a little more bang for your buck than if you were to buy shades individually. Like Beauties Playing It Cool, Reelers & Rockers is a little reminiscent of last year’s Devil May Dare palette , but it’s only at a glance, rather than in reality. This year’s Reelers & Rockers is actually more pigmented and brighter. Reelers & Rockers was my favorite palette of the four, not because of colors but how true-to-pan the colors were overall. Four of the shades have really stellar pigmentation and feel incredibly smooth when used–Carbon swatches poorly but works well in practice, while Melt My Heart could be a little more pigmented, it’s decent. It’s an interesting mix of shades; the top row being on the cooler side, while the bottom row is definitely warmer!

This is a gorgeous hue that works well on cool, pale toned skin to warmer, deeper skin. The subtle glimmer of the shimmer and shine give lips a fuller, rounder look while de-emphasizing lip lines. The color itself is nearly opaque, which is a bit surprising given the Brilliant line, but with a color like this, it works. If it were sheerer, it may have looked blotchy. The Rouge G Brilliant formula is like a lipstick and lip gloss hybrid in the way it looks and feels; it holds on and wears like a lipstick (three to five hours) but has the shininess of a lip gloss. It’s also moisturizing and doesn’t emphasize lip lines. Like the Rouge G lineup, though, these have a rosy-fruity scent to them.

"['MAC Tartan Tale: A Fabulous Fantasy Lip Kit Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Oct 26, 2010 October 26, 2010 MAC Tartan Tale: A Fabulous Fantasy Lip Kit MAC Tartan Tale: A Fabulous Fantasy Lip Kit A Fabulous Fantasy Lip Kit ($22.50) is a trio of lip products, featuring one sheer lipglass and two lipsticks. There’s a nice variety in the finishes, and they do seem to coordinate well–they are all a touch on the warm side, but not too warm. Lip palettes tend to be a hate it or love it kind of product; either you love the utility and portability of them or find them impractical and frustrating. I belong to the latter camp, so I’ve always leaned towards MAC’s Lip Bags during the holidays! The lip palette includes: Heroic Tale (sparkle flesh tone), Imagine This (pinky beige), and Storybook Ending (raisin). All three shades are new and limited edition to this palette. Heroic Tale is a shimmering bronzy nude with flecks of champagne and copper shimmer. It is a lipglass. It appears rather sheer on lips and looks glossy with shimmer in it but doesn’t change the lip color much, if at all. It’s a little lighter than Mad Cap and Sinnamon, but they have similar effects when worn. Imagine This is a peach with an orange-brown tone with a creamy look to it. It is an amplified finish lipstick. This is very pigmented and looks opaque on lips. It’s a much more orange version of Peachstock , but it seems a bit darker than Ravishing. Storybook Ending is a plum-tinged brown with gold micro-shimmer and a high-gloss shine. It is a lustre finish lipstick, so despite looking darker in the swatch, it applies very sheer. It imparts mostly a glow and light shine while adding some darkness to my natural lip color. It seems similar, but lighter, than Polished Up. The palette contains one lipglass (0.03 oz.) and two lipsticks (0.09 oz.). A full-sized lipglass (0.17 oz.) retails for $14.50, while a full-sized lipstick (0.10 oz.) retails for $14.50. It also has a tiny 316SE brush. In this case, you’re getting $2.56 worth of lipglass and $13.05 worth of lipstick–so it’s just over $15 worth of product but the price tag is $22.50. Not such a hot deal in regards to quantity, but the other side of the coin is you get to try three shades for $22.50 vs. $43.50.

It works well as a spot cleanser (just spray it on a paper towel and run the brush back and forth, which will draw and pull out whatever is in your brush), because your brush will dry in a few minutes. I also will pour some into a cup and put each brush in it (just a little bit), then rinse with water for a deeper clean. It would be more convenient if it came with a spray pump, because unless you’re pouring some into a vessel, a spray or two would be plenty without any waste.

Minty Lip Gloss : Chicago, San Diego, New York City, Houston Quick Review: E.L.F. Minty Lip Gloss e.l.f. Studio Minty Lip Gloss ($3.00 for 0.08 oz.) are sheer to semi-sheer glosses with a sweet mint scent and a slight minty tingle. The tingle only lasts for a few minutes, and it isn’t painful or burning. I only get about an hour and a half of wear with these glosses (my average is closer to three), though. The formula itself is thin and non-sticky, but the applicator could be better, because I feel like I have to go for three or four pulls of gloss to get enough to cover my lips. Chicago is a coppery orange with flecks of gold bronze glitter. San Diego is a coral-red with gold flecks of shimmer. New York City is a medium pink with subtle gold micro-shimmer. Houston is a muted fuchsia-pink with soft pink shimmer. I know that they’re only a few bucks, so why complain at all about quantity? At the same time, most of E.L.F.’s products grew famous for being $1 each, and then they introduced their Studio line which is the “higher end” range–but you’re only getting 0.08 oz.

This is a gorgeous hue that works well on cool, pale toned skin to warmer, deeper skin. The subtle glimmer of the shimmer and shine give lips a fuller, rounder look while de-emphasizing lip lines. The color itself is nearly opaque, which is a bit surprising given the Brilliant line, but with a color like this, it works. If it were sheerer, it may have looked blotchy. The Rouge G Brilliant formula is like a lipstick and lip gloss hybrid in the way it looks and feels; it holds on and wears like a lipstick (three to five hours) but has the shininess of a lip gloss. It’s also moisturizing and doesn’t emphasize lip lines. Like the Rouge G lineup, though, these have a rosy-fruity scent to them.

I’m curious as to why NARS has started to push out more and more limited edition products; often, in the past, seasonal items were rolled into the permanent range. Pokerface is a medium lilac with subtle pinky-red undertones and pale lilac micro-shimmer. It took three coats, but the end result was opaque, smooth, and beautiful. I see this looking particularly striking on paler, cooler skin tones, as well as deeper skin tones for a stunning contrast. I’ve had good luck with NARS polish in terms of wear–about a week with just minor tip wear but no chipping–and this shade applied nicely.

Play It Proper is a very pale, powdery pink, and it’s really not much like Benefit Dandelion , Shell Pearl , Porcelain Pink , or Oh So Fair . Pearl Blossom is the closest, but the texture is so different; plus it has a sheen, rather than a powdery finish. Too Chic is closest to NARS Albatross , which is a little yellower, while Chez Chez Lame is more beige. Benefit Dandelion is too peachy while Pearl Sunshine is significantly darker. Madly Magenta is significantly more purple than both Show Orchid and Love Forever . Movie Star Red is more pigmented but similar in color as Gesina , while Russian Red has less pink in its base. Tickle Me Pink is closest to Viva Glam Gaga (slightly lighter and cooler) or Snob (cooler), but it is similar to Overtime , which is a yellower pink (almost looks peachy in comparison). Unlimited looks nothing like it. Virgin Isle is a touch lighter than Vegas Volt , while Jazzed and Ever Hip are significantly lighter. See swatches!

It has an initial strength, but it dries down to something incredibly subtle–probably too light. I’m glad it does weaken quickly, though, because it is rather cloying at first sniff. It’s not a groundbreaking scent; despite the abundance of notes, it is has a rather simple result. I have had readers in the past note that Air of Style is reminiscent of Michael Kors, but I don’t own it, so I couldn’t say for sure. I applied it two hours ago, but the majority of the scent has wafted away. Top Notes: White pepper, dried red dates, wild peonies Heart Notes: Tuberose, orange blossom, jasmin, ylang-ylang, orris Bottom Notes: Touch of leather, antique woods, vetiver, amber crystals, tonka beans The packaging is lovely. It’s a heavy, metal multifaceted pendant that hangs from a thin, black ribbon. For me, it would be too heavy to wear around my neck, but I tend to opt for very simplistic jewelry. I really enjoyed the weightiness of the pendant itself, because it feels more luxurious. To me, this is the best packaging MAC has put the Air of Style scent in. It was originally launched in an Italian glass vial, which while lovely, has to be stored in its box, as it will roll off your vanity. It is rather small, as many bejeweled solid perfumes are, but inside contains more than the average ring/pendant solid perfume does. I wouldn’t say this is a value deal, but the price and quantity seem on par for MAC’s brand against higher-end brands with similar solid perfume offerings.

This is a very pink-themed lip palette that does run a bit cool-toned, but it’s very wearable for both cool and warm skin tones. Lip palettes tend to be a hate it or love it kind of product; either you love the utility and portability of them or find them impractical and frustrating. I belong to the latter camp, so I’ve always leaned towards MAC’s Lip Bags during the holidays! The lip palette includes: Endless Fun (sheer frosty pink), Cheers All Around (bright candy pink), and To Joy (medium pink). All three shades are new and limited edition to this palette. Endless Fun is a shimmering pale, milky pink with champagne-gold shimmer. It is a lipglass. It’s a lot like Oyster Girl. Cheers All Around is an opaque bright medium pink with blue undertones and lighter pink-fuchsia shimmer. It is a frost finish lipstick, but it’s not very frosty. This shade is a cross between Bombshell and Creme de la Femme. To Joy is a semi-sheer pale peach-pink with heavy frosted shimmer. It is a frost finish lipstick. High Strung was the closest dupe I could think of, but it’s a little darker. It looks nicer swatched than on my lips! The palette contains one lipglass (0.03 oz.) and two lipsticks (0.09 oz.). A full-sized lipglass (0.17 oz.) retails for $14.50, while a full-sized lipstick (0.10 oz.) retails for $14.50. It also has a tiny 316SE brush. In this case, you’re getting $2.56 worth of lipglass and $13.05 worth of lipstick–so it’s just over $15 worth of product but the price tag is $22.50. Not such a hot deal in regards to quantity, but the other side of the coin is you get to try three shades for $22.50 vs. $43.50. MAC’s lipsticks vary from sheer to opaque, and finish doesn’t always tell the story on pigmentation, so these shades seem in line with the brand’s lipstick range. If you like pinks, this is totally up your alley; if you’re not so into pinks, it won’t make your must-buy list. I don’t think these shades are the most unique, so if you just spot one you’re interested, try giving one of the suggested dupes a shot.

I’m curious as to why NARS has started to push out more and more limited edition products; often, in the past, seasonal items were rolled into the permanent range. Pokerface is a medium lilac with subtle pinky-red undertones and pale lilac micro-shimmer. It took three coats, but the end result was opaque, smooth, and beautiful. I see this looking particularly striking on paler, cooler skin tones, as well as deeper skin tones for a stunning contrast. I’ve had good luck with NARS polish in terms of wear–about a week with just minor tip wear but no chipping–and this shade applied nicely. It wasn’t too thick or thin, and I didn’t experience any bubbling. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ?

It has a high gloss shine, and it is surprisingly thick. I actually found this gloss to be rather thick and tacky, while NARS’ Lipglosses are known for their non-sticky texture. Stickiness aside, I really loved this shade–it seemed different than the usual plums. I loved that it was opaque, but the shimmer and shine almost made it seem metallic when worn. The texture of this particular gloss felt so different from other NARS’ Lipglosses; the stickiness was one thing, but this was very thick, too. I don’t mind a tacky gloss myself, but if non-sticky is a must-have, I would pass on this or else try it in-store first. I did not notice any scent (plastic, wax, or otherwise), though.

"['MAC Marcel Wanders: MAC Sheer Mystery Powder Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Nov 17, 2010 November 17, 2010 MAC Sheer Mystery Powder MAC Marcel Wanders: MAC Sheer Mystery Powder MAC Sheer Mystery Powder ($60.00 for 0.56 oz.) is described as “an ultra-fine, super sheer, and very sophisticated pressed powder … “Mysteriously” silky-soft in texture, glides on to give skin a velvety matte, slightly luminous and altogether flawless finish.” There are only two shades available: Light and Medium Plus. They used to release a shade called Dark Secret, which was more appropriate for darker skin tones. I only picked up Medium Plus, so I only have a swatch of that one, but hopefully it will be helpful enough to show you the texture and look of it. I would recommend Light for NC/NW15s and 20s, possibly 25s if you are definitely NC/NW25. I would recommend Medium Plus for NC/NW30s and 35s. I think it would be too light for any shades higher than NC/NW35. The formula itself is a very finely milled, silky smooth powder that applies incredibly sheer. It is best used as a setting or finishing powder, because it does not offer coverage, but it will set your foundation or help to mattify skin. It is not completely matte in finish, but it is semi-matte. I like it, and I think it’s a good pressed powder, but it’s not the best one I’ve ever tried. I don’t know if it’s that much better than MAC’s Blot or Select Sheer Powders, you know? I do like that it looks very natural, and it’s practically impossible to overdo. It doesn’t look powdery on the skin, even on drier areas of mine. The compact itself shares the same multifaceted look as the perfume pendant, but unlike the pendant, it is made out of hard plastic, rather than metal. It feels very lightweight when held, which makes it appropriate for traveling but less so if you want that luxury feel. In the past, this powder has always been housed in a heavier, sturdier compact. It will hold fingerprints like nobody’s business, though. I know the price tag always scares people every time MAC repromotes it, but keep in mind, it comes with a refill–each pan is 0.28 oz. for a total of 0.56 oz. for your $60. However, on that note, MAC’s Select Sheer/Pressed will set you back $22 for 0.42 oz., while the Mineralize Skinfinish Natural retails for $26 for 0.35 oz. After perusing through a variety of pressed powders from high-end brands, it seems like 0.28 to 0.35 oz. is the norm with prices ranging from $30 to 35. This is certainly not a steal of a deal, but it’s like you’re paying an extra $15 to 20 for the packaging and product (since it’s not available outside of the pricier compacts).

I must have been under a rock for the past year, but MAC now prints safety information on the back of the pigment box itself. There were no safety warnings for Follow Your Fancy or New Fixation. Madly Personal had a warning that it is not for use in the lip area . Go figure – the pink isn’t safe on lips!?! Follow Your Fancy is a rusted orange with subtle redness and a frosted sheen. Nicely pigmented, and it’s actually really fun to see, because I can’t remember such a rusty color in pigment form coming out. This is new and limited edition. Madly Personal is a medium-dark fuchsia pink with a pearly sheen. It is less cool-toned than Brash & Bold , but the two are close. It’s a darker, less frosty version of Fuchsia, too. This is new and limited edition. New Fixation is a medium-dark pinky-red with pearly sheen. I don’t own it, but it may be similar to Basic Red, except the finish is different and this seems like a less true red. This is new and limited edition. Violet is a shimmering violet purple with a frosted sheen. This is permanent. All four of the pigments were really smooth and pigmented. I also loved that MAC used more of a pearly sheen as a finish than a full-on frost finish – it adds more variety to the pigment range (even though these are limited, except Violet). MAC Stylishly Yours Collection is a limited edition launch (official information and photos here ) that is set to launch in-stores on December 26th in North America, January 2011 for international MAC locations.

"['MAC Marcel Wanders: Lip Gloss Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Nov 17, 2010 November 17, 2010 Lip Gloss : Aleydis, Beatrix, Gertruyd, Mary MAC Marcel Wanders: Lip Gloss MAC Marcel Wanders Lip Glosses ($22.00 for 0.09 oz.) include four new, exclusive, and limited edition shades: Aleydis (fuchsia), Beatrix (golden nude), Gertruyd (blackened red), and Mary (light gold). The texture of these is extremely similar to LORAC’s 3D Multiplex Lip Gloss . It is a smooth, creamy formula that’s not thick or thin. It’s non-sticky but doesn’t disappear instantly; I’ve been wearing Beatrix for three hours now (no eating/drinking), and it’s mostly there. They do not contain quite as much shimmer as the 3D Lip Glosses, though. The formula also reminded me of MAC’s 3D Lipglasses (ha, ha) that came out eons ago. They’re smoother than Cremesheen Glass, but they have a similar look–just more pigmented. They have a brush-type applicator. Aleydis is a semi-sheer, blue-based medium fuchsia pink with icy fuchsia micro-shimmer. As far as MAC permanent dupes go, though, Extra Amps would be the closest, but a bit more blue-based. Kind of like a low voltage version of Hot House. Very similar to Revenge is Sweet, too! Dead-ringer for Radiant Jewels/Creme Allure… (both are more pigmented). Beatrix is a semi-sheer beige base with melon gold shimmer. It reminded me of a sheerer version of Strange Potion Lipglass–not quite as pink. Also similar to Girl’s Delight. Gertruyd is a semi-sheer, reddened burgundy with light pink sparkle. It’s similar to Ornamental–not quite as copper, though. Mary is a sheer, almost milky nude with lots of melon-gold shimmer. It’s a little less yellow than Instant Gold. It’s a little more melon and less pigmented than NARS Albatross . The way the glosses feel as well as how they are packaged makes me lump them in with products like Dazzleglass, Cremesheen Glass, etc. For price comparison, I think it is appropriate to look at that category, too, and not Lipglass so much. (For the record, I do think that Dazzleglasses should contain more per tube–they are far under what I would expect.) Dazzleglasses are $18 for 0.06 oz., while Cremesheen Glasses are $18 for 0.09 oz. These are $22 for 0.09 oz. You are paying more, but the pricing does not seem as out-of-line as when you compare Lipglasses ($14.50 for 0.17 oz.) against them.

These shades are: The Family Crest (blackened bronze with pearl), Later (black with transforming purple pearl), and Moonlight Night (blackened teal with teal pearl). All three pigments have frost finishes. Later is a repromote from this spring’s Alice + Olivia Collection . The Family Crest is a darkened, plummy brown base with flashes of gold and violet shimmer. It’s a very fun and complex shade! It’s actually a little similar to Style Clan nail lacquer (which you can’t wear on your eyes, LOL!). I couldn’t think of a MAC dupe for this shade. Later needs moisture to look amazing. Do not just swatch it dry and forget about it, because you’re really not giving it a chance then. When applied wet, it’s a blackened-gray base with flashes of violet and deep blue-purple shimmer and sheen. About a million times prettier wet than dry. It is similar to My Dark Magic Mineralize Eyeshadow from Venomous Villains. It could also be replicated by layering Violet pigment over a black base. Moonlight Night is a darkened charcoal gray base with flashes of deep forest green shimmer and soft frosted sheen. I couldn’t think of a MAC dupe for this shade. Even when swatched dry, both The Family Crest and Moonlight Night swatched smoothly, but Later definitely needs to be used wet or patted over a sticky base to get the true color. I personally find MAC’s Mixing Medium (Water-Based) to work really well when using pigments wet, because it is slightly tacky, which makes the pigment hold together and wear all day. I’ve often used pigments as bases for other eyeshadows with this method. Though I like the look of the new pigment jars, I do find them a lot messier. I don’t know if it’s perhaps that I open these over a white table, but I feel like I get some smeared on the photo station every time I open them, which is quite annoying.

"['MAC Light Medium Sheer Mystery Powder Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Dec 04, 2012 December 04, 2012 MAC Light Medium Sheer Mystery Powder MAC Making Pretty has a Mystery–Powder That Is! MAC Light Medium Sheer Mystery Powder ($65.00 for 0.56 oz.) is a sheer, pressed powder. Each year, MAC launches it with their “couture” collection (typically at the end of the year), and this is one of three shades. Light Medium is likely a good bet for NC/NW20. It has a mostly neutral undertone, and when sheered out, matches my forearm pretty well (which is around NC20). It also is available in Medium Plus and Dark Secret . It can work as a finishing or setting powder. It has a lightweight, finely-milled texture that’s very soft and silky-smooth. Now, one aspect that must be mentioned is that you actually get a refill with your purchase (each pan is 0.28 oz.). To compare, MAC’s Select Sheer/Pressed Powder is $24.00/0.42 oz. I’ve used this many times in the past, and it helps to set or mattify makeup. What’s nice about the finely-milled powder is that it doesn’t look powdery on the skin, and it’s impossible to overdo. This collection is all about packaging, but I think it’s a let-down. Over the years, the Mystery Powder compacts have gotten lighter and lighter, and this year’s feels the lightest so far. It’s in the same style as this year’s holiday palettes, but instead of the pastel cushion, it has faux shagreen. It’s just the metallic edging is all plastic. It doesn’t feel like a $65 compact without some heft.

"[""MAC & Beth Ditto Shade & Smoke Shadow/Liners Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Jun 01, 2012 June 01, 2012 MAC Shade & Smoke Shadow/Liners MAC & Beth Ditto: Shade & Smoke Shadow/Liners MAC Shade & Smoke Shadow/Liners ($22.00 for 0.03 oz.) is a brand new product type for the brand that launches specifically in this collection. There was originally five shades in the collection, but one was pulled out of production (no reason given). According to the very nondescript blurb online, it’s a dual-ended product with an eyeshadow on one end and a Greasepaint liner on the other end to create “the perfect smoky eye.” If you read through the color description that MAC gives, it’s easy to figure out which side is supposed to be the shadow and liner. The four shades are: Beth Mask (reddish brown bronze liner / golden peach pink shadow), Beth or Glory (deep brown liner / bright blue shadow), Drag, Strip (smoky navy liner / pale blue shadow), and Little Miss Moffet (true black liner / true white shadow). Each dual-ended pencil has a side with a rounded tip, which is supposed to be the liner, and a slanted tip, which is supposed to be a shadow, based on the color descriptions. This is not a positive review, and this was an incredibly frustrating product to test. What I experienced with this product made me go, “Either it is one of the worst products MAC has ever launched to-date OR I’m doing it wrong.” The concept of using a product in such a wrong way that it doesn’t work is something I find very, very suspect–most of us are not new to the makeup game, and a lot of products are similar to ones we’ve used in the past. This product is called “Shadow/Liner,” so naturally, one would expect to use it as an eyeshadow and an eyeliner. This means actually applying it to the eyelid and on the lash lines. The results were so terrible (more on that in a second) that I decided I would reach out to MAC to ask them more about this product: what was it supposed to do and if they had any tips on how to use them. I was informed these are long-wearing and water-resistant. MAC Senior Artist, Keri Blair had these application tips: The tapered end is the “liner” so it’s better for more detailing and defining (I don’t recommend it for the water line) however the slant tip makes it easy to apply to the eye lid or inner corner of the eye. Use it to pop the lid and with a flip of the wrist you can use the rounded side to smoke out the outer and inner corner of the eyes. The rounded side is great for smudging and “smoking” out the eye. You can blend with your finger or a brush but work quickly because this long wearing, water resistant formula dries fast! My best advice is to work one eye at a time to achieve a perfect Smokey smudgy look. On occasion, I get to utilize a very interesting test: I ask long-time reader, guest writer, and makeup artist Dustin Hunter if he managed to find a way to make something work. If there is ANYONE who will find some use for a product, it’s him. Me, on the other hand, I’m less likely to bother finding really creative ways to make a truly awful product work–I don’t have the time, desire, or energy to do so. There are too many excellent products waiting to be discovered and reviewed! We had a rather long exchange on both Twitter and via e-mail on the difficulty in using and testing this new formula, because it just wasn’t working. The formula, regardless of which end, is dry. It is extremely dry, which results in poor color payoff and painful application. When I first tried applying Beth Mask to my lid (using the peach side as a lid color), it was so incredibly painful–there was so much tugging, pulling, and drag. For all of that, there was hardly any product on my lid, and what little there was ended up uneven and sparsely applied. I used several different tools in attempt to get color to transfer onto my lids: fingers, brushes (231, 208, 212, 316), and straight from the tube. I had the “best” results straight from the tube. Some shades were more difficult to work with, but they were all poor performers. I couldn’t use any of these as eyeshadows, and a few of them were better as eyeliners, but the wear wasn’t there. On the lid, I had creasing after five hours. As eyeliner, the ones I tried (Beth Mask, Beth or Glory, and Drag, Strip) were smudged after four hours. When I used them on the lid, blending was futile–because they start out so dry, it’s already immensely hard to blend them out, and they do dry further after being applied. Trying to apply them over a bare lid wasn’t working, so I tried applying over a primer (I used NARS’ Smudgeproof), and it was easier to apply, but it was only marginally better. The result really speaks for itself. I didn’t expect them to be as bad as they were, because when I swatched them, I was able to build up the color on most of the shades, but I did have to go back and forth several times with firm pressure–and that firm pressure just doesn’t translate well to the eyelid. When MAC has outstanding formulas like Shadesticks, Greasepaint Sticks, etc., how this product can fall so short, I’ll forever be baffled by. I’m also rather disappointed to see there was a measly 0.03 oz. in the product (the average regular eyeliner is 0.04 oz.). Beth Mask has a “liner” of burgundy red. MAC Cranberry is less brown, lighter. Maybelline Pomegranate Punk is more purple. MAC Idyllic is similar but has a stronger sheen. Chanel Grenat is a stronger red, but it is an eyeliner. Make Up For Ever #11 would also be similar. The “shadow” is a soft orange with subtle golden sheen. Chanel Eclosion is pinker. Inglot #407 has a stronger frost finish. Make Up For Ever #153 is very similar. Beth or Glory has a “liner” of dark brown with subtle warm, yellow undertones. Bare Escentuals Pumped is similar but has gold sparkles. MAC Make Your Mark is slightly lighter. Chanel Brun-Teak and MAC Brownborder would be comparable eyeliners. The “shadow” is a cobalt blue with a hint of purple. Sugarpill Velocity is bluer. MAC Cobalt is darker. MAC Atlantic Blue is bluer and darker. Drag Strip has a “liner” of blackened blue. It looked a lot like MAC Nautical Navy but blacker. It’s hard to really list dupes, because this was the worst performer of all the shades–I couldn’t layer the color or build it up at all. The “shadow” shade is a pale sky blue. Dior Swimming Pool is darker. Buxom Husky is slightly darker and shimmery. Inglot #367 is very similar. Little Miss Moffet has a “liner” of medium black with brown undertones. There’s nothing too special about it, so any medium black eyeshadow or eyeliner would work in its place. (Some shades can just be that basic!) The “shadow” is a bright white with a soft sheen. This shade performed the best, but it was still very uneven and hard to apply. Maybelline Too Cool is a cooler-toned white. Bare Escentuals Cheers is similar but has less of a sheen. This may be one of the worst products I’ve seen from MAC or any brand. There are flops, and then there are products that make you wonder what kind of testing happened. You want to read those reports. I know Big Bounce was a flop, but at least there was a way to use them that wasn’t too far off from how one might use them anyway (as an eyeshadow base–you just couldn’t use them alone). I might as well write my to-do lists with these, because you won’t see me ever going through the pain of using one of these again.

Feel free to share your first experiences, how you’ve grown, what you’ve learned, and what, ultimately, you found most helpful in learning how to apply matte eyeshadow. (And if you haven’t conquered it, hopefully some of these tips will help you get there!) Temptalia’s Tips Softer mattes can often be powdery and easily blended out – but sometimes they will blend to nothing all too soon! After you grab the color with your brush, lightly tap the brush handle against your forearm; this will help loosen any excess powder before you apply it to your lid. Then, pat, rather than sweep, the eyeshadow onto the lid, exactly where you want it. When using multiple matte shades together, I prefer to apply them first, then blend after I’ve determined where each shade is going. For firmer, stiffer matte textures, use a fluffy brush and lightly stab at the eyeshadow to loosen the color, and then grab the color and apply. Use very fluffy brushes to blend out these stiffer textures, too.']",db1b9d69371cd6b3cfc9b68bbbb736248a283da2,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/how-to-apply-matte-eyeshadow-tips-tricks/,['2012-12-04 00:00:00']

"['NARS Okinawa Trio Eyeshadow Review, Photos, Swatches (Holiday 2010) Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Oct 30, 2010 October 30, 2010 NARS Okinawa Trio Eyeshadow NARS Holiday 2010: Okinawa Trio Eyeshadow NARS Okinawa Trio Eyeshadow ($45.00 for 0.17 oz.) contains three shades: (as described by NARS) silver, deep cobalt blue, and black onyx. According to Sephora’s description of this trio, the eyeshadows can be used wet to double as eyeliners. The colors included in the trio are not unique, but they have a beautiful, smooth texture and rich, intense pigmentation that glides on with ease. There is a light silver-white with a frosted finish, medium-dark blue with subtle shimmer-sheen, and a medium-dark black with a satin sheen. These felt smoother and softer than the average NARS eyeshadow. The silver has the largest portion, while the blue is about half the size and the black a third. It makes sense to have the black be such a thin strip, since you really do not need much black in most looks, but it may be too thin for those who use bigger brushes (say the MAC 252). It’s not a major drawback, as most eyeshadow brushes should be able to maneuver in there, but it was worth noting. I’m not sure why this is a whopping $45, which is rather killer for a product like this, even for high end. A NARS Eyeshadow Duo contains 0.14 oz. of product and retails for $32, which makes the trio more per ounce (but a better value than the single eyeshadows). The quality is phenomenal, though!

"[""MAC Out for Fun Lip & Cheek Colour Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Jun 01, 2012 June 01, 2012 MAC Out for Fun Casual Colour Lip & Cheek Colour MAC Out for Fun Lip & Cheek Colour MAC Out for Fun Casual Colour Lip & Cheek Colour ($20.00 for 0.43 fl. oz.) is a muted, medium-dark orange with a little hint of red, so it has a coral-like tint. On cheeks, it looks like a peachy-tangerine, and it can be built up to a more intense shade of orange. MAC Optimistic Orange is more orange. It’s like a cream version of MAC Modern Mandarin . Make Up For Ever #5 is similar but matte. On the lips, it has a coral-orange appearance with opaque color coverage, but it definitely comes out more coral on the lips than when applied to the cheeks. Laura Mercier Kissed Lips is pinker. NYX Haute Melon is a smidgen pinker. Guerlain Nahema is darker. NARS Niagara is a touch pinker. Laura Mercier Tangerine is very close. MAC Crosswires is also quite similar! For an in-depth review of the formula, please see this post . The main takeaways were that as a blush, this yields a dewy finish that might be just the wrong side of dewy for some, but it may be the perfect recipe for those with drier skin; as a lip color, the finish is more like a satin matte, and it has a slightly clingy nature that works as a way to make the color lightweight and very natural-looking. Out for Fun is a great summer shade–it’s that warm pop of coral that so many brands offer during the warmer season. It looks more coral on the lipsthan on the cheeks, due to the natural pinkness often found on bare lips. As one of the darker shades in the launch, it’s flattering across the spectrum of skin colors, from light to dark and everything in-between. Those with warmer undertones will find it slightly more complementary than those with really cool undertones. When I wore this shade for testing, it lasted seven hours on the cheeks and five hours on the lips. 10 4 Out for Fun 10 4 Out for Fun A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 91% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"['MAC & Beth Ditto Shade & Smoke Shadow/Liners Reviews Jun 01, 2012 June 01, 2012 MAC Shade & Smoke Shadow/Liners MAC & Beth Ditto: Shade & Smoke Shadow/Liners MAC Shade & Smoke Shadow/Liners ($22.00 for 0.03 oz.) is a brand new product type for the brand that launches specifically in this collection. There was originally five shades in the collection, but one was pulled out of production (no reason given). According to the very nondescript blurb online, it’s a dual-ended product with an eyeshadow on one end and a Greasepaint liner on the other end to create “the perfect smoky eye.” If you read through the color description that MAC gives, it’s easy to figure out which side is supposed to be the shadow and liner. The four shades are: Beth Mask (reddish brown bronze liner / golden peach pink shadow), Beth or Glory (deep brown liner / bright blue shadow), Drag, Strip (smoky navy liner / pale blue shadow), and Little Miss Moffet (true black liner / true white shadow). Each dual-ended pencil has a side with a rounded tip, which is supposed to be the liner, and a slanted tip, which is supposed to be a shadow, based on the color descriptions. This is not a positive review, and this was an incredibly frustrating product to test. What I experienced with this product made me go, “Either it is one of the worst products MAC has ever launched to-date OR I’m doing it wrong.” The concept of using a product in such a wrong way that it doesn’t work is something I find very, very suspect–most of us are not new to the makeup game, and a lot of products are similar to ones we’ve used in the past. This product is called “Shadow/Liner,” so naturally, one would expect to use it as an eyeshadow and an eyeliner. This means actually applying it to the eyelid and on the lash lines. The results were so terrible (more on that in a second) that I decided I would reach out to MAC to ask them more about this product: what was it supposed to do and if they had any tips on how to use them. I was informed these are long-wearing and water-resistant. MAC Senior Artist, Keri Blair had these application tips: The tapered end is the “liner” so it’s better for more detailing and defining (I don’t recommend it for the water line) however the slant tip makes it easy to apply to the eye lid or inner corner of the eye. Use it to pop the lid and with a flip of the wrist you can use the rounded side to smoke out the outer and inner corner of the eyes. The rounded side is great for smudging and “smoking” out the eye. You can blend with your finger or a brush but work quickly because this long wearing, water resistant formula dries fast! My best advice is to work one eye at a time to achieve a perfect Smokey smudgy look. On occasion, I get to utilize a very interesting test: I ask long-time reader, guest writer, and makeup artist Dustin Hunter if he managed to find a way to make something work. If there is ANYONE who will find some use for a product, it’s him. Me, on the other hand, I’m less likely to bother finding really creative ways to make a truly awful product work–I don’t have the time, desire, or energy to do so. There are too many excellent products waiting to be discovered and reviewed! We had a rather long exchange on both Twitter and via e-mail on the difficulty in using and testing this new formula, because it just wasn’t working. The formula, regardless of which end, is dry. It is extremely dry, which results in poor color payoff and painful application. When I first tried applying Beth Mask to my lid (using the peach side as a lid color), it was so incredibly painful–there was so much tugging, pulling, and drag. For all of that, there was hardly any product on my lid, and what little there was ended up uneven and sparsely applied. I used several different tools in attempt to get color to transfer onto my lids: fingers, brushes (231, 208, 212, 316), and straight from the tube. I had the “best” results straight from the tube. Some shades were more difficult to work with, but they were all poor performers. I couldn’t use any of these as eyeshadows, and a few of them were better as eyeliners, but the wear wasn’t there. On the lid, I had creasing after five hours. As eyeliner, the ones I tried (Beth Mask, Beth or Glory, and Drag, Strip) were smudged after four hours. When I used them on the lid, blending was futile–because they start out so dry, it’s already immensely hard to blend them out, and they do dry further after being applied. Trying to apply them over a bare lid wasn’t working, so I tried applying over a primer (I used NARS’ Smudgeproof), and it was easier to apply, but it was only marginally better. The result really speaks for itself. I didn’t expect them to be as bad as they were, because when I swatched them, I was able to build up the color on most of the shades, but I did have to go back and forth several times with firm pressure–and that firm pressure just doesn’t translate well to the eyelid. When MAC has outstanding formulas like Shadesticks, Greasepaint Sticks, etc., how this product can fall so short, I’ll forever be baffled by. I’m also rather disappointed to see there was a measly 0.03 oz. in the product (the average regular eyeliner is 0.04 oz.). Beth Mask has a “liner” of burgundy red. MAC Cranberry is less brown, lighter. Maybelline Pomegranate Punk is more purple. MAC Idyllic is similar but has a stronger sheen. Chanel Grenat is a stronger red, but it is an eyeliner. Make Up For Ever #11 would also be similar. The “shadow” is a soft orange with subtle golden sheen. Chanel Eclosion is pinker. Inglot #407 has a stronger frost finish. Make Up For Ever #153 is very similar. Beth or Glory has a “liner” of dark brown with subtle warm, yellow undertones. Bare Escentuals Pumped is similar but has gold sparkles. MAC Make Your Mark is slightly lighter. Chanel Brun-Teak and MAC Brownborder would be comparable eyeliners. The “shadow” is a cobalt blue with a hint of purple. Sugarpill Velocity is bluer. MAC Cobalt is darker. MAC Atlantic Blue is bluer and darker. Drag Strip has a “liner” of blackened blue. It looked a lot like MAC Nautical Navy but blacker. It’s hard to really list dupes, because this was the worst performer of all the shades–I couldn’t layer the color or build it up at all. The “shadow” shade is a pale sky blue. Dior Swimming Pool is darker. Buxom Husky is slightly darker and shimmery. Inglot #367 is very similar. Little Miss Moffet has a “liner” of medium black with brown undertones. There’s nothing too special about it, so any medium black eyeshadow or eyeliner would work in its place. (Some shades can just be that basic!) The “shadow” is a bright white with a soft sheen. This shade performed the best, but it was still very uneven and hard to apply. Maybelline Too Cool is a cooler-toned white. Bare Escentuals Cheers is similar but has less of a sheen. This may be one of the worst products I’ve seen from MAC or any brand. There are flops, and then there are products that make you wonder what kind of testing happened. You want to read those reports. I know Big Bounce was a flop, but at least there was a way to use them that wasn’t too far off from how one might use them anyway (as an eyeshadow base–you just couldn’t use them alone). I might as well write my to-do lists with these, because you won’t see me ever going through the pain of using one of these again.

"[""MAC Silver Dusk Iridescent Powder Review, Photos, Swatches (Making Pretty) Reviews Dec 04, 2012 December 04, 2012 MAC Silver Dusk Iridescent Powder Is This Packaging Worth an Extra $41? MAC Silver Dusk Iridescent Powder ($65.00 for 0.51 oz.) is described as a “pinky beige with silver shimmer.” It’s a mix of soft pink and silver shimmer, though when applied to my cheek as a highlight, it read more like a delicate silver shimmer. It’s similar to products like Chanel Reverie . Lots of loose sparkle and shimmer, so depending on your threshold for sparkle, you may love or loathe this product. MAC recommends building it up gradually, and also notes that it is a multi-tasking product that can be worked into foundation, moisturizer, and so on. Oh, and if you don’t care about the packaging? You can purchase it in a plastic jar any time of the year for a mere $24 (you get 0.42 oz., which is a little less). The exterior of the bottom portion of the “jar” is made out of cardboard, while the lid is covered in faux shagreen and has a plastic metallic rose bow. It also contains a soft, fluffy pouf, which is great if you plan to dust it onto your body, but for smaller areas, it’s not practical. When MAC originally launched their couture collections, I was In. Love. Couture was back in ’06 I believe, and it culminated in me purchasing my first MAC brush (see it here ). There are always cheaper products that perform as well or better than products marked up five, ten, twenty times. I absolutely will and have paid this price or more for a beauty product. Like any brand name, I know that part of what I pay is for the name–especially with higher-end/luxury brands. MAC has already told me that it’s powder is worth $24, so for this packaging upgrade, they’re adding $41 (and giving you an extra 0.09 oz. of product). One of Guerlain’s bigger complaints in regards to their Meteorites was the use of cardboard (and a couple of years ago, they changed it to metal), though even Meteorites cost less and contain more (currently $58/1.05 oz.). I like Silver Dusk as a loose, iridescent powder. It’s a nice highlighter (though I like it better on cooler complexions), and it doesn’t emphasize pores. It’s worth checking out at $24. You don’t even have the ability to attempt to rationalize that the product is worth paying extra; you know, that the effect of it is just that much better and worth the steeper price tag compared to other iridescent powders, because you know you can get the exact same product for far less. Not a dupe, not close enough–exactly the same. If MAC wants to show us that they can do couture, they need to do it, because this is not it. 7 3 Silver Dusk 7 3 Silver Dusk A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The five glass vials are housed inside a tartan-decorated metal tin, and there is a plastic insert that keeps them standing together, but it’s removable, should you desire. I did find it curious that there were no inserts regarding uses (e.g. what’s eye/lip safe) in any of the sets, though. This set includes: Cheers My Dear (pale violet), Mauvement (cool taupe with gold pearl), Silver Fog (platinum silver), Softwash Grey (grey with purple pearl), and Reflects Pearl (very fine particle white glitter with a pearl sheen). Cheers My Dear is a pinked lilac with a frosted silver sheen. This is a new and limited edition shade to the set. It’s a cross between Pink Pearl and Kitschmas pigments–it’s not as cool-toned or as purple as Kitschmas, as it’s pinker, but it’s not nearly as pink or fuchsia as Pink Pearl. Mauvement is a bronzy taupe with a mauve undertone and champagne sheen. This is a repromote. Silver Fog is a bright silver with a nearly metallic shine. This is a PRO shade. Softwash Grey is a cool-toned, blue-purple gray with a slight metallic sheen. This is a repromote. Reflects Pearl is a glimmering silver-white glitter with no real color base. This is a permanent shade. I see this working more as a layering shade than alone, because it lacks a cohesive color base so it doesn’t hold together. I think the pigment sets are a good value, and they’re always worth a peek if you’re into loose color or pigments. You’re getting 0.45 oz. of product for $32.50, while a single, full-sized pigment contains 0.15 oz. of product and retails for $19.50–essentially, this is $60 worth of pigments/glitters.

"[""MAC Silver Dusk Iridescent Powder (Making Pretty) Reviews Dec 04, 2012 December 04, 2012 MAC Silver Dusk Iridescent Powder Is This Packaging Worth an Extra $41? MAC Silver Dusk Iridescent Powder ($65.00 for 0.51 oz.) is described as a “pinky beige with silver shimmer.” It’s a mix of soft pink and silver shimmer, though when applied to my cheek as a highlight, it read more like a delicate silver shimmer. It’s similar to products like Chanel Reverie . Lots of loose sparkle and shimmer, so depending on your threshold for sparkle, you may love or loathe this product. MAC recommends building it up gradually, and also notes that it is a multi-tasking product that can be worked into foundation, moisturizer, and so on. Oh, and if you don’t care about the packaging? You can purchase it in a plastic jar any time of the year for a mere $24 (you get 0.42 oz., which is a little less). The exterior of the bottom portion of the “jar” is made out of cardboard, while the lid is covered in faux shagreen and has a plastic metallic rose bow. It also contains a soft, fluffy pouf, which is great if you plan to dust it onto your body, but for smaller areas, it’s not practical. When MAC originally launched their couture collections, I was In. Love. Couture was back in ’06 I believe, and it culminated in me purchasing my first MAC brush (see it here ). There are always cheaper products that perform as well or better than products marked up five, ten, twenty times. I absolutely will and have paid this price or more for a beauty product. Like any brand name, I know that part of what I pay is for the name–especially with higher-end/luxury brands. MAC has already told me that it’s powder is worth $24, so for this packaging upgrade, they’re adding $41 (and giving you an extra 0.09 oz. of product). One of Guerlain’s bigger complaints in regards to their Meteorites was the use of cardboard (and a couple of years ago, they changed it to metal), though even Meteorites cost less and contain more (currently $58/1.05 oz.). I like Silver Dusk as a loose, iridescent powder. It’s a nice highlighter (though I like it better on cooler complexions), and it doesn’t emphasize pores. It’s worth checking out at $24. You don’t even have the ability to attempt to rationalize that the product is worth paying extra; you know, that the effect of it is just that much better and worth the steeper price tag compared to other iridescent powders, because you know you can get the exact same product for far less. Not a dupe, not close enough–exactly the same. If MAC wants to show us that they can do couture, they need to do it, because this is not it. 7 3 Silver Dusk 7 3 Silver Dusk A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4 Application 90% Total Read Full Review""]",79f3ca1a20e953912e8b58c9d0e8ec11c616a62b,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tag/mac-silver-dusk-iridescent-powder/,['2012-12-04 00:00:00']

They’re flakies almost. This is such a cool polish to see from MAC, and I don’t have any dupes in my stash for this one. It did apply a little streaky, though, so I recommend using a thin initial coat, followed by a thicker secondary coat–or else two medium coats instead of the thicker second coat for a total of three coats. (I’m wearing two coats in the photos.) It’s totally one of those “pretty ugly” kind of colors, too, because at first glance, you’re like, “oooh!” or “ewww!” and then you may flip-flop a few times on second and third glance!

"['MAC Cool Thrillseekers Pigments/Glitter Set Reviews Nov 04, 2010 November 04, 2010 Pigments: Cheers My Dear, Mauvement, Silver Fog, Softwash Grey; Reflects Pearl Glitter MAC Cool Thrillseekers Pigments/Glitter Set Each pigment/glitter set includes four pigments and one glitter, each contains 0.09 oz. of product, according to the tin. The five glass vials are housed inside a tartan-decorated metal tin, and there is a plastic insert that keeps them standing together, but it’s removable, should you desire. I did find it curious that there were no inserts regarding uses (e.g. what’s eye/lip safe) in any of the sets, though. This set includes: Cheers My Dear (pale violet), Mauvement (cool taupe with gold pearl), Silver Fog (platinum silver), Softwash Grey (grey with purple pearl), and Reflects Pearl (very fine particle white glitter with a pearl sheen). Cheers My Dear is a pinked lilac with a frosted silver sheen. This is a new and limited edition shade to the set. It’s a cross between Pink Pearl and Kitschmas pigments–it’s not as cool-toned or as purple as Kitschmas, as it’s pinker, but it’s not nearly as pink or fuchsia as Pink Pearl. Mauvement is a bronzy taupe with a mauve undertone and champagne sheen. This is a repromote. Silver Fog is a bright silver with a nearly metallic shine. This is a PRO shade. Softwash Grey is a cool-toned, blue-purple gray with a slight metallic sheen. This is a repromote. Reflects Pearl is a glimmering silver-white glitter with no real color base. This is a permanent shade. I see this working more as a layering shade than alone, because it lacks a cohesive color base so it doesn’t hold together. I think the pigment sets are a good value, and they’re always worth a peek if you’re into loose color or pigments. You’re getting 0.45 oz. of product for $32.50, while a single, full-sized pigment contains 0.15 oz. of product and retails for $19.50–essentially, this is $60 worth of pigments/glitters.

The color payoff is sheer and looks almost muddied when it is applied dry, and when it’s applied wet, the navy blue starts to bubble forth. Dry, it has a similar color as Dior Smoking Blue , though it doesn’t have the same shimmer/glitter. Make Up For Ever #147 is closest in terms of overall color but lacks the glitter component. This eyeshadow takes a LOT of work to get to work well (or decently, I suppose). It suffers from poor color payoff, poor blendability, and fall out (both during application and later on while it is worn). When I saw this, it looked so beautiful and shimmering in its compact, so I had to buy it. I thought it was going to be a finer shimmer application, but it’s fairly large, chunky glitter–the texture actually feels gritty to the touch. This is a product that I’d say is best used patted lightly on top of some other, better performing eyeshadow. It just doesn’t deliver enough pigmentation to be used easily on its own. The fall out is pretty bad, but I had the most frustration dealing with how difficult this shade was to blend. It is dry and stiff to work with, and when you finally manage to blend it out, there’s a really muddied look to it. It does not play well with others for that reason. Fall out during application is one problem, and there’s fall out because you’re heavier handed and then there’s fall out because the product is too powdery or doesn’t bind together well, but fall out that continues throughout the time you wear it is the kind I focus most on and am most concerned about. You will absolutely need to bring out your arsenal of tricks to use with the glitter-bomb–a sticky, adhesive base (like MAC Mixing Medium, Too Faced Glitter Glue, etc.) is a must. Revlon may describe this has having “rich, refined pigments” and a “velvety smooth texture” that “glides on smoothly, blends effortlessly,” but I didn’t find that any of those things were true. What is true is that yes, this will provide a really gorgeous dimension to the lid with the high sparkle content, but it will take some patience and additional products to get it to behave (which solves the fall out issue the most, but not so much the pigmentation or the blendability). It ends up being a novelty purchase for me; something to work with for a very specific type of look when you have enough time to prep and clean up after it. If you like a glittery effect and don’t mind the work to create the look, you may find this is worth checking out.

The compact itself is metal and includes a full-size mirror when you open it. The gloss has a metal lid that you can open, which is nice, because it helps to minimize any cross-contamination of the eyeshadow powder into the gloss. My first thought when I was photographing the palette was how lovely it looked. It’s heavy in a luxurious way (though not something I’d love to travel with!) with great detailing on the outside and inside. After swatching it, I was left disappointed. For all of Dior’s sleek packaging, this palette falls flat where it counts the most–quality. The eyeshadows are dry in texture so they drag and pull when applied, and the lack of pigmentation makes it difficult to apply even layers of color or to really utilize this palette in a meaningful way. For such shimmery colors, these were surprisingly chalky overall. The upper left shade (1) is a semi-sheer gray-blue with a subtle sheen. The upper right shade (2) is a purpled, navy blue with a sheen. It didn’t look anything like the pan–it leaned purple and lacked the vibrancy of the blue in the pan. The bottom left shade (3) is a semi-sheer black with multi-colored shimmer. The bottom right shade (4) was a silvered-gray with a hint of brown, and it was the most pigmented shade of the bunch. For better alternatives, consider: 1) MAC Prussian , 2) Inglot #332 , theBalm Risque Renee , or Make Up For Ever #81 , 3) theBalm Guilty Gwen , and 4) Inglot #444 , theBalm Sexy Stacey . You can also peruse the Blue Eyeshadow Gallery or Gray Eyeshadow Gallery . The lipgloss is a sheer peony pink with a subtly glossy finish; there isn’t much color to it, but it gives lips a brightened look. It didn’t quite feel like Dior’s Ultra Glosses, as this was thinner and a little tacky. Both the eyeshadows and gloss wear about average, but with the eyeshadows, it’s difficult to tell since everything looks faded as soon as it is applied.

"[""Tom Ford Burnt Topaz Nail Lacquer Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 22, 2012 April 22, 2012 Tom Ford Burnt Topaz Nail Lacquer Tom Ford Burnt Topaz Nail Lacquer ($30.00 for 0.40 fl. oz.) is a warm bronze with orange undertones and threads of metallic copper shimmer. It’s mostly opaque after two coats. China Glaze Mahogany Magic has a similar undertone but looks rather different otherwise. NARS King Kong is much redder. China Glaze Goin’ My Way is a bit darker. There was a tendency for it to pull a bit, which I suspect is due partially to the longer drying time. Not much longer than average to me, but the formula is less forgiving if you’re trying to get your swatches done! Because it has a metallic finish, brush strokes are definitely present and noticeable, though they’re subtler than you’ll typically find in this type of finish. The formula wasn’t too thick or too thin, and it applied decently, but it could have gone on a bit smoother. It also did this weird thing where it seemed to recede from the edge of the tips of my nails. I wore this shade to test wear (I’ve tested the wear of the cream finishes, but not of the metallic ones), and it lasted seven days without any chipping and had minor tip wear–just keep in mind that I can’t remember the last formula that did chip on me other than matte polish. 4 9 Burnt Topaz 4 9 Burnt Topaz B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Beautylish Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Cosbar Tom Ford 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 3.5 Application 87% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

You will need the following… Eyes : NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base (neutral eyeshadow base), MAC Lithe Pigment (golden nude beige), MAC Burmese Beauty Eyeshadow (brown with teal flash), MAC Skintone 2 Eyeshadow (muted gold), MAC Prized Eyeshadow (highlighter), MAC Marked for Glamour Superslick Liquid Eye Liner (silvered brown), MAC Smoky Heir Superslick Liquid Eye Liner (plum burgundy), Chanel Inimitable Intense Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder (translucent) Cheeks : MAC Darkly My Dear Blush (reddened nude) Lips : MAC Kittenish Lipstick (reddened wine), MAC Docile Lipglass (icy pink) Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Lithe = Naked (less golden); Burmese Beauty = Club; Skintone 2 = Goldmine (golder); Prized = Shroom; Darkly My Dear = ; Kittenish = Media; Docile = Cultured For eyes, start by applying Smudgeproof as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Apply Lithe pigment all over the lid with the 239 and mixing medium. Using the 239, apply Burmese Beauty eyeshadow on the lower third of the eye lid along the upper lash line. Lightly blend Skintone 2 eyeshadow above Burmese Beauty eyeshadow and above the crease. Blend Prized eyeshadow with the crease shade and highlight the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Smoky Heir liner on the lower lash line and Marked for Glamour liner on the upper lash line. Finish by sweeping lashes with Inimitable Intense mascara . For cheeks, apply Darkly My Dear blush on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Kittenish lipstick as a base color, then layer Docile lipglass on top for a complementing lip.

"['China Glaze Vintage Vixen Collection Review, Photos, Swatches (Part 1) Sample Reviews May 13, 2010 May 13, 2010 China Glaze: Classic Camel, Ingrid, Swing Baby, Goin’ My Way, Riveter Rouge, Foxy China Glaze Vintage Vixen Collection Review, Photos, Swatches (Part 1) Vintage Vixen includes twelve new shades of polish, ranging from a khaki beige to a midnight blue to a darkened teal. The collection starts shipping in early July. The formula on these was consistently good–I had no issues applying these right out of the bottle. As far as I’m concerned, if I don’t have to fuss over a formula and experiment with application, it’s a solid formula. It is a thinner consistency, but each coat still packed quite a bit of pigment. Most of these shades are two-coaters, but you can do three, too, if you so desire (which is usually what I do). The collection is made up of a mix between frost and microglitter finishes. The feeling is decidedly fall, so it’s perfect for the season (remember–this is China Glaze’s fall collection!). With twelve shades and sixty photos in total, I split up the two posts to help narrow the focus a bit. Of these six, my favorites are: Classic Camel (elegant with a twist) and Goin’ My Way (the way the light hits it is divine). I also liked Foxy (love the lava-ish look of it), but not quite as much as the other two–there weren’t any dud shades here, really. Classic Camel is a khaki beige with a stronger yellow undertone and golden yellow shimmer. I needed two thicker coats or three mediums coats with this shade. Ingrid is a softened deep, molten chocolate brown with ultra fine, light brown shimmer. I found two coats was optimum with this shade. Swing Baby is a metallic taupe brown with microglitter. I couldn’t get total coverage with three coats, but the microglitter spread pretty evenly overall. It dries down to a slightly bumpy surface–you can feel the microglitter a bit–but a thicker layer of top coat solves that issue. Goin’ My Way is a burnished copper flecked chocolate brown. I love the way this one catches light. It does show brush strokes just a tad, if you’re looking for them. Two coats was just right fro this color. Riveter Rouge is a deep red with flecks of silver migroglitter. Like Swing Baby, the surface can be a little gritty so using a thicker top coat helps to smooth it away. Two coats here was perfect. Foxy is a warmed up, lightened coppered brown with significant red undertones. It’s flecked with copper-orange shimmer throughout. I found two coats to work well here.

"['MAC Fabulous Felines: Leopard Luxe (Eyes) Reviews Aug 19, 2010 August 19, 2010 MAC Fabulous Felines: Leopard Luxe Review, Photos, Swatches (Eyes) Here’s part one of Leopard Luxe — part two coming soon! ? Leopard Luxe Eyeshadow Quad ($36.00 U.S. / $43.00 CDN) Wild By Nature is a medium-dark nude brown with a matte finish, though it seems like it has just a bit of satin to it. Reminded me of a lighter Soft Brown . Notoriety is a slightly sheer dirty brown with cool undertones and flecks of gold shimmer with a velvet finish. I really hate the pay off of Notoriety , even though it’s an interesting color. This is a repromote from Makeup Art Cosmetics. Style Predator is a gold-shimmered medium orange base with a veluxe pearl finish. It reminds me of a darker version of Straw Harvest (Spring Colour Forecast) and more of a gold sheen than Off the Page (Makeup Art Cosmetics). Furiously Fabulous is a deep, dark brown-gray with a veluxe pearl finish. This is the best textured eyeshadow of the three quads–it’s smooth and pigmented. I thought it was going to look like Knight Divine from an initial glance, but it’s very different. It’s like Brun and Satin Taupe had a baby. Superslick Liquid Eye Liner ($17.50 U.S. / $21.00 CDN) Pure Show is a true gold, and it seems a little less pigmented than the average Superslick liner — it’s more shimmery with a sheerer color base. It can be layered for a more intense, opaque line, though. Marked for Glamour is a darkened gray that almost looks taupe when used lightly. On the Hunt is a very deep, dark black. It has a very semi-glossy look even when dried, but it’s not wet looking (but not 100% matte/flat). Pigment ($19.50 U.S. / $23.50 CDN) Lithe is a lightly shimmered peach-nude. It reminded me of Dazzleray and Jardin Aires pigments (both limited edition)–the texture is much smoother and finer than either of those pigments, and Lithe isn’t as frosty. Old Gold is a green-based gold with touches of reddish brown. It flashes a green-gold overall. It’s a very interesting and complex shade; definitely worth a look if you haven’t acquired this previously. This is a permanent shade.

"[""Chanel Bel Ami Rouge Coco Shine Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jul 21, 2011 July 21, 2011 Chanel Bel Ami Rouge Coco Shine Chanel Rouge Coco Shine in Bel Ami Chanel Bel Ami (66) Rouge Coco Shine ($32.00 for 0.10 oz.) is a semi-sheer plum-berry that looks a little rosy, little brown-based when swatched, but on my lips, it appears more like a plum with a hint of red and silver shimmer. The color coverage is semi-sheer, but it applies evenly and smoothly, and it ends up looking like I’m not even wearing lipstick. It’s a little redder compared to MAC Capricious , while it is plummier than Cle de Peau #117 (and sheerer). Rimmel Burgundy is a few shades darker. I only get an hour and half to two hours of wear with Chanel’s Rouge Coco Shines, though, which is below average for a lipstick–and Chanel says these have “lasting moisturizing shine.” Rouge Coco shines feel more like lip balm when applied, because they have an emollient base that enables them to glide on, but I don’t find them very moisturizing. They are not drying, but they don’t impart quite as much moisture as you’d expect. I wish the product contained a bit more (like the Rouge Cocos), because the creaminess of the formula (combined with sheerer color and need for regular reapplication) makes it easy to overapply. 11 6 Bel Ami 11 6 Bel Ami B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Chanel Dillard's 8 Product 9 Pigmentation 10 Texture 6 Longevity 5 Application 84% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Cult Nails Enticing Nail Lacquer Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Apr 21, 2012 April 21, 2012 Cult Nails Enticing Nail Lacquer Cult Nails Enticing Nail Lacquer ($10.00 for 0.50 fl. oz.) is described as a “very sheer pale milky pink.” It’s also supposed to be “buidlable to an almost opaque finish.” It’s a soft pale pink with subtle yellow undertones. It’s semi-opaque after two coats with a hint of visible nail line. There’s also an incredibly fine white shimmer that almost disappears in natural light. I don’t have an extensive collection of sheerer shades, but my first instict would be to look in Essie’s catalog of colors. Essie French Affair is darker, cooler-toned. Nubar Pink Lily is a little starker, because it’s opaque, but the colors are quite close, though Pink Lily is a cream finish. China Glaze Encouragement is also similar–to me this is the closest–and the major difference is this has larger shimmer. China Glaze Something Sweet is a bit darker and is a cream finish. For sheer color, just one coat is appropriate, and if you want a little more color, two coats is appropriate. I imagine you could get to fully opaque color with a third coat, but I think the formula is just a little thicker, so three coats is where you may start to feel the thickness. There’s a subtle yellow undertone running through it, so it has a very soft, romantic edge to it and should work on both cool and warmer complexions. It’s a nice shade for springtime as well as for those seeking work-friendly colors. Cult Nails’ formula typically wears a full week without chipping and has only very minor tip wear. 11 3 Enticing 11 3 Enticing A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Cult Nails 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 98% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

They’re tiny, but a little goes a long way. I like these mixed with moisturizer and used on shoulders and legs. They can be used on the face, though, and I like using it as a shimmered base for a blush or along the cheek bones. Pink Rebel Lustre Drops is a slightly pink-toned peach highlighter. Lustre Drops are, essentially, liquid highlighters. You can use them on your cheeks, brows, decolletage… whatever. You can mix it in with your foundation or moisturizer for an all-over sheen. Naturally, this one suits those with pinker undertones, but it can easily work with warmer complexions as well. Sun Rush Lustre Drops is a golden peach highlighter. This one is definitely more suitable for those with warmer undertones, but if used sheerly (which is really the best way to use these anyway), it’s not so warm that it would turn orange on cooler undertones.

Just to recap, the formula rocks here. It may feel a little thin, but each coat packs plenty of pigment, despite the consistency. It’s easy to apply–I didn’t have to play around with application to get beautiful, even, and smooth color. Most of these are two-coaters, but they easily work with three, which is my preferred number. From these, my favorites are easily Emerald Fitzgerald (oh, it’s swoon worthy in its inkiness!) and First Class Ticket (so intense and rich in its color). I also loved the way Midnight Mission looked. Hey Doll is a rosy-brown with silver shimmer. This was a two-coater. Bogie is a darkened plummy mauve with silver and reddened shimmer. I don’t think I have any color quite like this in my personal stash. Two coats was perfect here. Emerald Fitzgerald is a deep, inky teal with lighter aqua-teal shimmer. Love, love this one. It’s distinctly teal, not black, but yet it’s so dark and delicious. I found two coats was just enough to give a nice, opaque look. Midnight Mission is a midnight navy blue base with silver microglitter. It’s exactly what you’d call midnight blue–with the silver as the twinkling stars over a darkened night sky. Like many other shades in this launch, two coats was just right with this color. First Class Ticket is a rich, lush violet purple with blue-violet shimmer. Absolutely stunning! I thought this was the best shade out of the bunch. It nearly glows. Just two coats with this one as well. Jitterbug is a stormy gray with silver microglitter. It has the same feel and texture as Swing baby, but I was able to get this one to go opaque with three coats. It has a grittier surface once it dries, so a thicker top coat works best.

"['MAC Viva Glam Lipglass — Cyndi & Gaga Sample Reviews Aug 22, 2010 August 22, 2010 MAC Viva Glam Cyndi Lipglass MAC Viva Glam Lipglass — Cyndi & Gaga Coming at you on September 2nd, MAC will launch corresponding lipglasses to February’s roll out of Viva Glam Cyndi and Gaga Lipsticks . Like the lipsticks, the lipglasses are only around for a limited time (six months) — both the lipsticks and lipglasses will be available until February 2011. Just like the same-named lipsticks, Cyndi is a coral with very subtle white micro-shimmer, while Gaga is a light pink with blue undertones and nearly imperceptible white micro-shimmer. Surprisingly, Gaga [lipglass] seems more wearable than its lipstick counterpart–it’s not as cool or blue toned, so its more flattering across skin tones. Cyndi feels like there’s just a little less red to it–maybe a touch more coral, more orange, but certainly feels at least a smidgen brighter. Both glosses are incredibly opaque for a gloss, which is nice–but they can, of course, be worn sheerly by simply using less. It doesn’t take more than two or three swipes (depending on how big your lips are!) for a nice, opaque look. When you’re looking for a lipstick/lipglass, Viva Glam is always a good way to go!

"['NARS Pure Matte Lipstick for Fall 2010 Year: 2010 Launches Aug 21, 2010 August 21, 2010 NARS Pure Matte Lipstick for Fall 2010 The NARS Pure Matte campaign, photographed by Creative Director and Founder François Nars, features Canadian model Heather Marks. Under Nars’s direction, makeup artist Diane Kendal designed a makeup look that emphasized a bold and matte lip. The end result is audacious, sultry and sophisticated. Kendal began by applying Siberia Sheer Matte Foundation to the center of the face and blended outward. Vanilla Concealer masked imperfections. Snow Loose Powder was pressed into skin and the Botan Brush buffed away excess powder. Using the Yachiyo Brush, she applied Desire Blush to the apples of the cheeks and blended up towards the temples. For the eyes, Abyssinia Single Eyeshadow was brushed onto the lids with the Eyeshader Brush, followed by Blondie Single Eyeshadow into the crease with the Large Dome Brush to achieve depth. The inner corners were highlighted with the left side of All About Eve Duo Eyeshadow using the Eye Contour Brush. Iceberg Eyeliner Pencil lined the inner membrane of the lower lash line and Nuits Blanches Eyeliner Stylo created an impactful upper lash line. Brows were defined by applying Blondie Single Eyeshadow with the Brow Brush. To complete the look, two coats of Larger than Life Lengthening Mascara were applied to the lashes. Jungle Red Lipliner Pencil was used to define the shape of the lips. To create the luscious matte hue, Vesuvio Pure Matte Lipstick was swiped directly onto the lips. Pure Matte Lipstick ($25.00) Volga Deep aubergine Bangkok Soft rose Tonkin Cinnamon plum Terre de Feu Black cherry Tashkent Nude beige Vesuvio Full bodied red Availability : September 2010 See more photos and Q&A with Francois Nars… Over 15 years ago, François Nars created a collection of 12 perfectly edited lipsticks. Since then, the brand has created many iconic products; however, Nars’s passion for lipstick never wavered. Introducing Pure Matte – the newest addition to the NARS lip category. This innovative, matte lipstick has intense, stay-true color, so lips look lush and vibrant. This exquisitely blended formula strikes the perfect harmony between optimal color, an ultra-matte finish and a hydrating lip treatment. Pure Matte’s luxuriously rich texture glides on effortlessly, without drag, cakiness or resistance. Defying the traditional challenge of long-wearing lipsticks, it won’t dry out lips. Rich in antioxidants, including Vitamin E and Acai Oil, Pure Matte nourishes and conditions lips. Wild Mango Butter’s advanced moisturizing properties work to repair lips from dryness and scaling, leaving lips feeling supple and soft. Each shade takes only one swipe to build the perfect kissable opacity. Pure Matte is distinguished by a soft-touch, modern, sleek slim stick component, delivering convenient application. When used alone or with other NARS lip products, it provides a high-drama payoff. Apply directly to lips or with the Retractable Lip Brush. Q & A WITH FRANÇOIS NARS What is the best way to wear a matte lip? A matte lip is very modern, whether nude or deeply pigmented. Try a color close to your skin tone for a universally flattering look. Pair darker hues with a fresh complexion and little makeup. But, always choose a formula that has hydrating ingredients to condition lips. How do I find the perfect lip color? There are no rules when it comes to finding the “right” shade of lip color. Go with what catches your eye! It’s like wearing jewelry or an amazing pair of shoes. I love when women have fun with color and experiment. How can I make my lips stand out more and make them look fuller? Wear a bold lip!!!! Applying a bit of gloss or shimmer to the center of the mouth will make the lips seem fuller and more three-dimensional. You can give the lips a fuller shape with lip liner, but make sure to blend so there is no obvious line around the lip. How often should women reapply lipstick? Every woman wears lipstick differently, so frequency will vary. Don’t apply lipstick too thick. The more you have on, the heavier it looks and the faster it will wear off. When creating Pure Matte, I wanted a formula that was long-wearing but also nourishing, so women don’t have to reapply so frequently!']",d7e1ee707e22341e5bbe0eed7fdaa3170ae5a760,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/nars-pure-matte-lipstick-for-fall-2010/,['2010-08-21 00:00:00']

"['The Tempting 10 — September 2013 Edition Sample Features Sep 03, 2013 September 03, 2013 September is the beginning of all things autumn for me. The temperatures have already started to cool down by me, though it’s still warm overall, the nights are cooling down. I’ve always been partial to September, as I am a September baby ? Usually, the real start of fall begins with my first sip of Starbucks’ Pumpkin Spice Latte, but they already brought it back (and it was delicious!). By this point, I’ve typically reviewed several fall color collections, which is perfect timing so I can include some of those favorites while they can still be purchased. This month’s Tempting 10 features more recently released shades from the fall collections, but I still wanted to highlight a few favorites that you can find all year-long. Dior Millenium — a shimmering warm-toned, pewter in a cream formula that can be used as a sheer wash or built up for more intensity. Sugarpill Cold Chemistry Palette — it is such a perfect mix of deep, smoky shades for fall with excellent color payoff across the board. Color Club Beyond — a deep, warm, smoky gray-black with holographic shimmer–like ash from a crackling fireplace with dancing, fiery bits of shimmer. Urban Decay Vice — a rich, plummy purple polish with a soft, shimmering pearl. Milani Purr-fect Purple — a vibrant, rich purple eyeshadow with shimmer–perfect for accenting the eye! Tom Ford Love Lust — it’s a warmer, more muted coral, so it’s a lovely transition shade from summer to fall Guerlain Madame Batifole — creamy, hydrating, incredibly pigmented, and long-wearing makes this a rich, fuchsia-shimmered berry-red a true joy to wear. Tom Ford She-Wolf — it’s pricey, but not only is it a palette I could easily see myself reaching for time and time again, it was a palette that readers gravitated towards. It was easily one of the most viewed products from all fall color collections! Benefit Rockateur — a rose gold blush is subtle, wears well, and reminds me of the colors of autumn; rusty in a way, but still warm and inviting. Too Faced Pretty Rebel Palette — ten glorious shades of bold, bright, eye-catching shadows with buttery, soft, and smooth textures and excellent color payoff.

"['Jurlique Lavender Hydrating Mist Review & Photos Affiliate Links Reviews Jul 21, 2011 July 21, 2011 Jurlique Lavender Hydrating Mist Jurlique Lavender Hydrating Mist Jurlique Lavender Hydrating Mist ($31.00 for 3.3 fl. oz.) is described as “a daily replenishing mist with the calming scent of lavender that tones and soothes the complexion. Ideal for dry skin types.” To use, shake the bottle and then gently mist the face (and closing eyes and month) “to fresh and tone.” The real downside to this product without having even tried it? Alcohol is listed as the second ingredient, and alcohol-based toners often do more harm than good, as alcohol can be drying. I looked through the ingredient lists for some of Jurlique’s other Toning Mists and found alcohol listed in those, too — and it’s unfortunate, because this particular formulation is touted as hydrating. Admittedly, I didn’t read the ingredient list before initially testing ( lesson: don’t assume anything, no matter the brand ), and after a week or so of using this before bed, I was wondering why the current skincare regimen I was using suddenly seemed less effective. This was the only product I changed-up, and my skin felt a little drier. It could be weather-related, too — I don’t think this product did all that much for me either way. Since my skin was feeling tighter and less hydrated, I stopped using it after that point. The spray concept is interesting, but it doesn’t distribute evenly. If you spray from too far away, the air around you gets most of product, while if you spray too close to your face, then you end up with a lot of product in a small area. It feels refreshing when sprayed, particularly after a walk outdoors and the like, but a spray of cool or room temperature water will do the same. The lavender scent is very earthy and herbal, pleasant without being synthetic or sweetened. See more photos!

Since MAC To the Beach is out in the UK already, I thought I’d try a look using some of the products from the faux peek earlier this week. I used True Chartreuse as a base with Lucky Green eyeshadow layered over it to fake “Sweet & Punchy,” so if you have your To the Beach goodies, try using that on the lid instead ? You will need the following… Eyes : MAC Soft Ochre Paint Pot (neutral beige base), MAC True Chartreuse Pigment (matte chartreuse), MAC Water-Based Mixing Medium (glue-based adhesive), MAC Lucky Green Eyeshadow (yellowed, shimmery green), MAC Humid Eyeshadow (dark green), MAC Shimmermoss Eyeshadow (teal), MAC Nylon Eyeshadow (champagne gold highlighter), Make Up For Ever #7L Aqua Eyes Liner (electric blue), MAC Gorgeous Gold Eyeshadow (green-toned gold), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder (translucent) Cheeks : MAC Sun Rush Lustre Drops (peach-gold liquid highlighter), MAC Hipness Blush (coral pink) Lips : MAC Thrills Lipstick (copper rose), MAC Sugar Overload Superglass (nude with flaky glitter) Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Sun Rush = Strobe Cream (not a dupe, but similar); Hipness = Benefit Coralista; Thrills = Lane + Fetish; Sugar Overload = Bare Necessity For eyes, start by applying Soft Ochre paint pot as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. With the 239 and water-based mixing medium (or water), apply True Chartreuse pigment all over the lid area. Using the 239, apply Lucky Greeneyeshadow on the lower lid. Next, apply Humid eyeshadow into the crease with the 226, lightly blending outwards and upwards to fade to the brow bone. With the 239, apply Shimmermoss eyeshadow into the crease directly and then blended towards the outer corner and lid. Blend Nylon eyeshadow with the crease shade and highlight the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying #7L eyeliner on the lower lash line and Gorgeous Gold eyeshadow lightly patted below the lower lash line with the 219 brush. Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Sun Rush lustre drops on the apples and upper cheekbones. Then, apply Hipness blush to the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Thrills lipstick first, and then layer Sugar Overload superglass for a complementing lip.

It’s a vegan lip gloss, which can sometimes be difficult to find–it uses carnauba wax and candelilla wax rather than beeswax to get its waxy base. To the Rescue also contains both shea butter and various other oils (like jojoba and castord). It does have a very slight minty scent and tingle (but very, very subtle) from the inclusion of peppermint oil. There are also some exfoliating crystals, but I honestly couldn’t tell you I felt any of those nor that my lips were any more or less exfoliating post-use. It’s also a product with a cause : all net proceeds from To the Rescue go to Pug Rescue (note the pug on the cover of the packaging!). I’m someone who advocates donating year-round, for whatever causes that are close to your heart, and not solely through purchasing products (especially since so many only donate a percentage)–unless you need or want the product, then it’s a nice bonus to have at least some of it go towards a cause. Ingredients : Simmondsia chinensis (Jojoba) Esters, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea Butter), Simmondsia chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor) Seed Oil. Copernicia cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Cannabis sativa Seed Oil, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Olea europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha piperita (Peppermint) Oil. Overall, it’s a nice lip balm that does a good job of keeping my lips moisturized for a few hours. It’s very thin, and if you’re not a fan of goopier, slicker or jelly-like kind of balms, this might be more up your alley. The product size is great, though the price tag is a bit steep–I’ve found better balms at lower price points ( Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm ), but the compact is convenient (nice, full-size mirror), and of course, the donation of net proceeds is also nice.

"['TheBalm theBalm to the Rescue Review, Photos Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Aug 21, 2010 August 21, 2010 theBalm To the Rescue Lip Balm Lip Balm for the Love of Pugs TheBalm theBalm to the Rescue ($16.00 for 0.25 oz.) is a large, mirrored compact full of lip balm. It’s a vegan lip gloss, which can sometimes be difficult to find–it uses carnauba wax and candelilla wax rather than beeswax to get its waxy base. To the Rescue also contains both shea butter and various other oils (like jojoba and castord). It does have a very slight minty scent and tingle (but very, very subtle) from the inclusion of peppermint oil. There are also some exfoliating crystals, but I honestly couldn’t tell you I felt any of those nor that my lips were any more or less exfoliating post-use. It’s also a product with a cause : all net proceeds from To the Rescue go to Pug Rescue (note the pug on the cover of the packaging!). I’m someone who advocates donating year-round, for whatever causes that are close to your heart, and not solely through purchasing products (especially since so many only donate a percentage)–unless you need or want the product, then it’s a nice bonus to have at least some of it go towards a cause. Ingredients : Simmondsia chinensis (Jojoba) Esters, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea Butter), Simmondsia chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor) Seed Oil. Copernicia cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Cannabis sativa Seed Oil, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Olea europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha piperita (Peppermint) Oil. Overall, it’s a nice lip balm that does a good job of keeping my lips moisturized for a few hours. It’s very thin, and if you’re not a fan of goopier, slicker or jelly-like kind of balms, this might be more up your alley. The product size is great, though the price tag is a bit steep–I’ve found better balms at lower price points ( Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm ), but the compact is convenient (nice, full-size mirror), and of course, the donation of net proceeds is also nice. I look at this as a product that lets me get my beauty fix while knowing that whatever I’m paying above your average lip balm is probably going to the cause. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 27/30 Value : 9/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 3/5 RECOMMENDATION: For mild to decently chapped and cracked lips, this balm could prove to be quite the champ to give you a smooth, extra kissable pucker.

I don’t have anything like this myself, and all I could think of was Zoya’s holiday collection last year , which featured pink, green, and blue horizontal bar glitter polishes. Zoya lists the opacity as three, which is in the middle of sheer (one) and opaque (five). That’s a very accurate assessment; after two coats, it has a fair amount of coverage, but you’d really need three to get mostly opaque coverage. I layered it over Zoya Storm first, and then over Zoya Blaze . What I appreciated most about Electra was the fluidity and how well the bars dispersed across the nail. I didn’t feel like I had to push and pull the glitter into place. I typically see a full week of wear with minor tip wear but no chipping with Zoya’s formula. 7 6 Electra 7 6 Electra A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beauty Brands Zoya 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 93% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It also includes a 0.05 oz. (half the size of the full-sized version) of Prime Time Eye Primer. Each eyeshadow is 0.035 oz., as compared to the average full-sized eyeshadow, which is 0.05 oz. (and bareMinerals’ Ready eyeshadows in the duos and quads are 0.05 oz.). In duos, they’re $20/0.10 oz.; quads are $30/0.17 oz., and 8-pan palettes are $40/0.28 oz.–which breaks out to $200/oz., $176/oz., and $143/oz. I love that they give you a little more as you buy larger palettes. Just to put those prices in context, MAC single eyeshadows are $300/oz., while their duos are $275/oz. and quads are $210/oz. VIP is a dark black with brown undertones and gold sparkle. It had excellent pigmentation and applied smoothly and evenly. Too Faced Licorice Latte is not quite as dark. Cinderella Cinders is similar. Dior Night Golds is lighter, browner. Tarina Tarantino Dreamy is similar but has a stronger red-tone. Bobbi Brown Black Gold is similar–more shimmer. Connoisseur is a deep, molten golden-copper. This shade was insanely pigmented; so smooth, buttery, and densely packed with color. bareMinerals Pret-a-Porter is lighter. Inglot #404 is lighter, less coppery. Inglot #430 is yellower, lighter. Dior Aurora is lighter, more orange. While not at all similar in color, MAC Campfire had a similar molten, metallic look and feel. Carte Blanche is a cool-toned white with a golden shimmer-sheen, which gives it a mostly warm-toned appearance. It had great color payoff and applied very smoothly and evenly. Make Up For Ever #101 is very similar. Bare Minerals One Hit Wonder is less warm-toned–the color is more like the base color without the sheen. Tarina Tarantino Wonderful is warmer, yellower. Ritzy is a warm bronze brown with a frosted sheen. The pigmentation was incredibly rich, while the texture was soft, dense, and smooth. Urban Decay Deeper is very similar. Urban Decay Snakebite is less warm. Bare Minerals Cognac is lighter. MAC Woodwinked is also lighter. MAC Bronze is comparable–perhaps a bit warmer. Inglot #406 is a touch lighter, more reflective. Kudos is a pale beige-brown with an olive green shimmer-sheen. It has a really subtle, but cool, duochrome. I was like, “ooh! look!” when I initially swatched it. The first thing it reminded me was Illamasqua Bacterium , which is a nail polish. MAC Jaunty is a bit lighter, no duochrome. Becca Quartz is similar in color without the green sheen. Giorgio Armani #1 Madreperla is similar (again, no sheen). Bragging Rights is a medium-dark orange-copper with a frosted sheen. The color payoff was nice, while the texture was soft and smooth. Guerlain Calligraphy is a bit more orange and not as coppery. Tarina Tarantino Dreamy is darker. NARS Isolde is similar, a bit darker. Elitist is a subdued khaki brown with a satiny shimmer-sheen. It had good color payoff and was very, very smooth. This is one of the “cooler” shades in the palette, though it is still on the warm side. MAC Soba is similar but more matte. theBalm Schitoz is more golden. Giorgio Armani #26 is similar–a bit browner. Dior Golden Savannah is warmer, lighter. Extravagance is a frosted orange-gold. This shade was really soft and buttery in one sense, but it was almost so soft that it became a bit crumbly. This was the only shade I had any problems with; the color payoff was fantastic, but it did have extra fall out during application. Guerlain Turandot is more orange. Milani Gold Dust is noticeably more orange. MAC Sweet & Sour is yellower. Le Metier de Beaute Goldstone is darker, more orange. There was only one miss, which was Extravagance , and it’s mostly problematic during application, because it had a fair amount of fall out while you apply it. I recommend lightly tapping off excess product before applying it to the lid and then patting, rather than sweeping, it on to minimize fall out. I didn’t have trouble with fall out during wear, so after cleaning up initially, I didn’t have to worry about it. Worth noting and an area for improvement, but it’s a minor infraction. If you like your colors warm-toned, fairly neutral, and shimmery, this is your palette from start to finish. When I tested out the palette for wear, they wore like iron–full ten hours without fading or creasing without a primer (with a primer, I had the same results). I wish there was one or two more matte finishes in the palette, though, and overall, the palette is a bit dupeable, depending on your stash of course. bareMinerals The Star Treatment Eyeshadow Palette Review, Photos, Swatches - Recommended We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""NARS Vendanges Lipstick Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 16, 2012 April 16, 2012 NARS Vendanges Lipstick NARS Vendanges Lipstick NARS Vendanges Lipstick ($24.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as a “sheer grape.” It’s a semi-opaque plummy brown with a subtly glossy shine–it is a little more pigmented than I would expect for a shade from the sheer range. MAC Sheer Plum is much browner. MAC One of a Kind is quite similar. Estee Lauder Plum Fizz is redder. Guerlain Galante is lighter and less plum. Benefit I Think I Love You is shimmery. MAC So Very Good is darker. MAC Offshoot is plummier. Chanel Bel Ami is similar. Vendanges is part of the Sheer Lipstick range, which is a formula that is supposed to be long-wearing with translucent color and “sophisticated shine.” The lipstick is scent- and taste-free (and no waxy scent either–it seems NARS has fixed any issues they had with that particular scent, because I haven’t come across one in a very long time). The consistency has just enough slip to yield that pretty shine in the finish as well as enables it to glide across the lips and deposit color evenly without being so slippery that it slides around. This kind of sheer is lovely–there is a translucency that is apparent but there is still a healthy amount of color deposited. It’s a deeper shade that’s not too vampy, so it’s easy to wear and doesn’t require a lot of maintenance. When I tested the wear of this shade yesterday, it wore well for four hours. My lips felt hydrated after wear, too, so the formula is on the moisturizing side. 22 13 Vendanges 22 13 Vendanges A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks Selfridges Macy's Net-A-Porter Barneys Harvey Nichols (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Space NK (UK) bluemercury Sephora (PL) Dillard's NARS 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 10 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 92% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""NARS Calabria Soft Touch Shadow Pencil Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 16, 2012 April 16, 2012 NARS Calabria Soft Touch Shadow Pencil NARS Calabria Soft Touch Shadow Pencil NARS Calabria Soft Touch Shadow Pencil ($24.00 for 0.09 oz.) is described as a “shimmering plum.” It’s a dark burgundy plum with softer plum shimmer. Bare Escentuals Passion is slightly redder, less frosted. Le Metier de Beaute Fig is very similar, perhaps a little warmer. Guerlain Boulevard de Montparnasse is plummier. Tarina Tarantino Fantastical is purpler. I have to emphasize how NARS markets the formula: “easy, portable, long-wearing application,” “functionality to shade the lid, line, or highlight the eye,” “an ideal base for layering with a powder shadow for increased color intensity,” “smooth, creamy, long-wearing formula.” Then, from the press release for this collection and specific shade, “This versatile, shimmering plum Soft Touch Shadow Pencil is the ideal complement for color on lids. Named for the region south of Naples, at the “toe” of the Italian Peninsula—it can be worn solo, as a base for powder shadows, or as a liner.” The reason why this pencil can’t make it past five minutes (let alone an hour) without creasing is that it never dries down. It remains glossy and creamy for as long as I wear it–after three hours, I removed it and tried using it as a base with powder eyeshadows over it, but it creased horribly after an hour. The areas where the product has creased and accumulated are very slick, while the color on the lid will transfer onto my finger even with the slightest tough. There’s always a fine line between too quick and too slow when it comes to a cream eyeshadow/base product, but this one takes “too slow” to new lengths. I used it as an eyeliner and set it with eyeshadow, but it was entirely smudged after two hours and I had to remove it. The consistency is very, very creamy, which means it doesn’t tug or pull on the lid or lash line when it’s used, but it has a tendency to apply unevenly as it slides around the lid. I am often asked why do I keep reviewing this formula only to give it a bad rating: would (or should) I stop reviewing new shades of a good product? I don’t think so. My policy is to review as many products as I can, whether or not they are good, bad, or just so-so. Aside from the idea that all shades are individual and may perform better/worse than other shades in the same formula, there’s still value in reviewing a product, even if it’s consistently good or bad. There’s opportunity to confirm that it is or isn’t consistent, how it may differ, the color, better alternatives on the market, and the like. I wouldn’t seek this product out, but if NARS keeps making them and sending them to Temptalia for review, I’ll keep letting you know how they perform. If you’ve been able to work these, I’d love to hear your thoughts! A review is always bolstered by reader comments – shared experience is what creates a fuller picture of how a product does and doesn’t perform. 1 4 Calabria 1 4 Calabria F Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks Selfridges Macy's Net-A-Porter Barneys Harvey Nichols (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Space NK (UK) bluemercury Sephora (PL) Dillard's NARS 0 Product 9 Pigmentation 5 Texture 0 Longevity 2.5 Application 37% Total Read Full Review""]",3ec3bbdc10ae5200edd553b654c0d68702f27868,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tag/nars-calabria-soft-touch-shadow-pencil/,['2012-04-16 00:00:00']

It’s mostly opaque in color coverage, but there is some translucency. The closest dupe I could come up with is Bobbi Brown Pink Sorbet , which is also a yellow-toned pink, though it reads a little beige-like compared to Sugar Pink, and it has shimmer. MAC Curvaceous is plummier. What makes it harder to dupe is the amount of color coverage it has–a lot of glosses are sheer to semi-sheer. This formula is supposed to have a high-shine finish with good color payoff. The texture is very smooth and slick; it slides onto lips easily with a slight tackiness (but not what I would describe as a full-on sticky gloss). There is some settling into lip lines, which is less noticeable from a normal viewing distance but visible upclose. It has a sweet vanilla scent but no discernible taste. It’s neither drying nor overly hydrating, though I would err on the side of slightly moisturizing. It’s comfortable wear while it lasts, which in Sugar Pink’s case was three and a half hours. The glossy finish does stick around for most of the time, which is longer than some other glosses. 18 7 Sugar Pink 18 7 Sugar Pink B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Beautylish Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Cosbar Tom Ford 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 8 Longevity 4 Application 89% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The color coverage is mostly opaque. It’s not quite as glossy or as shiny as other hues within the Velvet Gloss Lip Pencil range, though. MAC Naturally Eccentric is lighter. MAC Peachstock is darker, more orange. Guerlain Guerlinade is slightly darker. What I like about the color is that it’s more universally wearable–it’s not so pale and light that it becomes the kind of nude that can easily wash out complexions. There’s enough warmth, color, and opaqueness to give lips a lighter look without washing them out. When I wore Buenos Aires , it lasted for just over three and a half hours. There was a very slight tackiness after an hour or so–very subtle but still there. The texture is fairly lightweight and thin. While the formula is supposed to be moisturizing, I found it neutral; neither drying nor moisturizing. The tip of the pencil is soft and creamy, so it applies fairly easily and provides even coverage. The packaging is a bit of a bummer, because the softness of the pencil means a lot of it gets stuck in the sharpener, so there is a fair amount of loss every time you sharpen it. You can freeze the pencil to help minimize it, but it’s still a problem. 10 6 Buenos Aires 10 6 Buenos Aires B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks Selfridges Macy's Net-A-Porter Barneys Harvey Nichols (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Space NK (UK) bluemercury Sephora (PL) Dillard's NARS 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8 Longevity 4 Application 89% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""MAC Razzledazzler Lipglass, Lipstick, Nail Lacquer Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Apr 28, 2012 April 28, 2012 MAC Razzledazzler Nail Lacquer, Lipstick, Lipglass MAC Razzledazzler Lipglass, Lipstick, Nail Lacquer MAC Razzledazzler Lipstick ($14.50 for 0.10 oz.) has been such a top-seller that it has now inspired a Lipglass ($14.50 for 0.17 fl. oz.) and Nail Lacquer ($16.00 for 0.34 fl. oz.) to complement it. This shade is part of the Asia Pacific region of the collection, so it will only be available online for North American buyers. Razzledazzler is described as “light cream peach.” The lipgloss is noticeably lighter and pinker compared to the lipstick, which has a Lustre finish, so it has a sheerer, softer color. On the lips, the differences are still pronounced–you get a lighter, milkier coral-pink with the gloss but more of a peach-coral with the lipstick. The nail lacquer is much more orange in comparison–it lacks any pink-ish tone, so it comes off as more of a peachy-orange. When the lipgloss is layered over the lipstick, the resulting color is a pink-coral with a milky, creamy look and consistency. The gloss makes everything settle into lip lines, so it’s not the best look, even from a distance. Razzledazzler Lipglass is a light-medium milky pink-coral with mostly opaque color coverage. It has a tendency to settle into lip lines. MAC So Vain is darker and less pink. MAC Tour de Fabulous is a little pinker and shimmery. Benefit Spiked Punch is more orange. (8.5, 9, 9, 8.5, 4, 4; B) Razzledazzler Lipstick is a soft coral-peach with a nice sheen. It has a lustre finish, and while it’s permanent in Asia, it’s not here–though it came out as a limited edition shade in Raquel Welch (’07). The color coverage is semi-opaque, which is actually a lot of cover given the finish. Burberry Devon Sunset is very similar, though it’s a touch brighter. MAC So Vain is comparable, though a little warmer. MAC Flamingo is sheerer and pinker. MAC Ever Hip is pinker. (8, 9, 8.5, 7, 4, 4; B-) Razzledazzler Nail Lacquer is a lightened medium orange with a soft, peachy quality to it, but it still reads more orange rather than peach. It’s opaque in two coats, but it had a streaky initial coat that I did have to use a thicker second coat to cover. It’s noticeably more orange compared to the lipstick and lipgloss. Cult Nails Scandalous is a little darker and has a jelly finish. Essie Tart Deco is a bit lighter. (8.5, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4; B+) MAC Lipsticks are vanilla-scented but taste-free. Lustre finishes like Razzledazzler typically wear two to three hours on me, and this is one of my least favorite finishes, because I find it very, very drying. Even just wearing the formula for two hours leaves my lips needing hydration. MAC Lipglasses are also vanilla-scented but taste-free. They are very sticky and have a thick, borderline-goopy consistency. If you prefer gel-like, cushion-y glosses that feel lightweight on, I don’t recommend MAC Lipglass. Because of the tackier texture, MAC Lipglasses do tend to wear a full four hours on me, with some of the darker shades lasting up to six hours (with mostly the color lingering at that point). Note: I am reviewing each “set” together. After I’ve reviewed all sixteen sets, I will do round-ups for each product type (so all lipsticks together) to deliver an overall Glossover rating. This rating is more indicative of the product type, as the rating that follows this post is an average across three totally different types of products.

"[""Bobbi Brown Canary High Shimmer Lipgloss Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 14, 2012 April 14, 2012 Bobbi Brown Canary High Shimmer Lipgloss Bobbi Brown Canary High Shimmer Lipgloss ($23.00 for 0.24 fl. oz.) is described as a “pure gold with gold pearl.” I’d like to call it sparkling lipgloss gone absolutely, positively insane. This is quite possibly one of the most shimmering, glittering, glimmering, dazzling, so on and so forth glosses I’ve ever used. The base color is really a pale gold that yields little color, but it’s full of yellow gold, molten gold, and copper shimmer, so it brings the coverage up to semi-sheer to semi-opaque. The overall effect is very shimmery, metallic, and it gives lips a browner look. Though it appears “sheer,” there is a marked difference between my bare lips and this on. MAC Straight to the Head is very brown, there’s no real gold in it. Make Up for Ever M6 is bronze and the shimmer is finer. NARS LusteR is such a tame, tame version–it looks so flat in comparison. MAC Gold Dust is a bit better, but it still doesn’t catch the light as well. This is a shade that looks fine on its own, but it will be the perfect way to add glossiness and warmth to your favorite lipstick (try it over a red). I’m a big fan of Bobbi Brown’s High Shimmer Lipgloss formula–it has an amazing high gloss shine that’s ridiculously glossy, shimmery, and all-around dazzling. If you’re a fan of Chanel Glossimers or MAC Dazzleglasses, you really should check out this formula, because (and in my opinion only, of course) these are even better. The formula is lightweight, comfortable to wear, glide on easily but never slip around, and wear for four to five hours–and the best part? The shimmer never feels gritty and doesn’t travel. When I wore Canary earlier this week for a wear test, it wore for four hours. These are mint-scented, taste-free, and non-sticky. It’s moisturizing, though it won’t replace your lip balm. 26 14 Canary 26 14 Canary A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

This shade is part of the Asia Pacific region of the collection, so it will only be available online for North American buyers. Ravishing is described as “mid-tone neutral peach.” The lipgloss is a smidgen lighter and pinker compared to the lipstick, which has more orange in it and comes off brighter. The nail lacquer is just a bit more orange; it doesn’t have any coral or pink tones to it–just a barely-dusty orange. When the lipgloss is layered over the lipstick, the end result is a lightened medium orange with a hint of coral to it. You do have to be careful to apply this well, because the lighter gloss can look really obvious if it’s not blended well! Ravishing Lipglass is a darkened coral-orange with soft white micro-shimmer. It has semi-opaque color coverage, and it does settle into lip lines a bit. NARS Happy Days is similar but a little dirtier. MAC Strange Potion is lighter, pinker. MAC Whoops! is darker. MAC Viva Glam Cyndi is a little brighter. (8.5, 9, 8.5, 8.5, 4, 4; B) Ravishing Lipstick is a medium-dark coral-orange with a soft shimmer-sheen. It has a Cremesheen finish, and it is part of the permanent range. The color coverage is opaque. It has a slightly drier texture, so it does tug a bit when it is applied–it just doesn’t glide on effortlessly. Chanel La Ravissante is much darker, but it is in a similar vein. CoverGirl Rapture is a bit darker. (8, 10, 8.5, 8.5, 4, 4; B) Ravishing Nail Lacquer is a medium orange with a subtle dustiness to it. It has a cream finish that applied opaque in two coats, though the initial coat was a smidgen streaky. MAC Morange is brighter, more intense, darker. Nails Inc. Porchester Place is very similar. Illamasqua Gamma is brighter, more vibrant. (9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4; B+) MAC Lipsticks are vanilla-scented but taste-free. Cremesheen finishes like Ravishing typically wear three to four hours on me, with this kind of color wearing about three and a half. I’m not a huge fan of the Cremesheen finish, because I find it drier, so it’s more difficult to apply evenly, and it is also drying over time. MAC Lipglasses are also vanilla-scented but taste-free. They are very sticky and have a thick, borderline-goopy consistency. If you prefer gel-like, cushion-y glosses that feel lightweight on, I don’t recommend MAC Lipglass.

"[""NARS Marie-Galante Eyeshadow Duo Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 16, 2012 April 16, 2012 NARS Marie-Galante Eyeshadow Duo NARS Marie-Galante Eyeshadow Duo NARS Marie-Galante Eyeshadow Duo ($34.00 for 0.14 oz.) is described as an “iridescent orchid” and “regal blue.” The left shade is a pale pink lilac with a lavender iridescence. The color payoff is sheer and translucent. MAC Light Violet is a bit similar, though not as pink. Inglot #346 is also more lavender, less pink, and has a matte finish. Wet ‘n’ Wild We’re Blasting Off is similar, though perhaps a little pinker, and has more of a satin-like finish. The right shade is a darkened navy blue with a violet shimmer and sheen, which becomes more pronounced when applied (it looked less blue, more purple). The pigmentation on this is decent, but there is some sheerness in the swatch as well as when applied. Tom Ford Cobalt Rush is very, very similar–less iridescent. MAC Starless Night is much darker, deeper. MAC Imaginary is purpler. This eyeshadow duo creased after six hours over an eyeshadow primer ( NARS Smudgeproof , actually), and on top of the creasing, there was significant fading of both shades from this duo (the blue was on the upper half of the lid and in the crease while the lilac shade was blended above the crease). I have normal-to-dry lids, and NARS Smudgeproof is my go-to primer normally, and while NARS eyeshadows do, typically, have some minor creasing and/or fading when worn without a base after eight hours, the wear here was abnormal. The creasing became more apparent after eight hours, but the fading was surprisingly noticeable after six and steadily worsened as the day wore on. There was some minor fall out from the shimmer in the shades from this duo as well that occurred while it was worn (but I didn’t see any during application). The wear was just as bad without a primer–the creasing/fading just became noticeable at the four hour mark– I thought maybe the glaze-like finish would adhere better to bare lids but no dice. The texture of this particular eyeshadow duo is unlike anything I can remember seeing from NARS. It has a very glaze-like finish, that’s almost a little wet, but still a powder. If you’re familiar with Stila’s Sparkle eyeshadows, Tom Ford’s Sparkle eyeshadows, or Urban Decay’s Stardust eyeshadows, you may have a better grasp of that kind of texture–these aren’t quite as “wet.” The closest texture would be to Tom Ford’s sparkle-finish eyeshadows. The bluer shade looks really lovely when applied–wet and shimmering–but it actually seemed to disappear as I was applying it. I went back three times to darken the color before leaving it alone. The lilac shade was pretty soft and didn’t want to build up in color at all; the iridescence in it is a lot less noticeable compared to the blue (it just looked like a pink-lilac). I was exceptionally disappointed in the results of Marie-Galante . As far as wear went, it killed me with three major no-nos: creasing, fading, and fall out. It had issues with color payoff, too, which was really just icing on an inedible cake–like a cake that looks delicious but turns out to be made out of plastic.

"[""MAC Please Me Lipglass, Lipstick, Nail Lacquer Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Apr 28, 2012 April 28, 2012 MAC Please Me Nail Lacquer, Lipglass, Lipstick MAC Please Me Lipglass, Lipstick, Nail Lacquer MAC Please Me Lipstick ($14.50 for 0.10 oz.) has been such a top-seller that it has now inspired a Lipglass ($14.50 for 0.17 fl. oz.) and Nail Lacquer ($16.00 for 0.34 fl. oz.) to complement it. This shade is part of the Latin America/Middle East region of the collection, so it will only be available online for North American buyers and at select Macy’s. Please Me is described as “mid-tone warm pink.” The lipgloss is just a smidgen lighter compared to the lipstick in color, but they have similar undertones. The nail lacquer also matches fairly well, though it appears to have stronger yellow undertones, so it appears warmer in comparison. When you apply the gloss on top of the lipstick, what happens is you get a slightly lighter pink–not quite as light as the gloss on its own, but it’s not as dark as the lipstick alone. The two work together well without causing unevenness or streaking. Please Me Lipglass is a light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones. It yields opaque color coverage with a mostly even application and slight settling into lip lines. I couldn’t think of a dupe for this shade. The closest I could think of was MAC Splashing , which is darker, and it almost looks gray-ish in comparison. (9, 10, 9, 8.5, 4, 4; B+) Please Me Lipstick is a light-medium creamy pink with subtle yellow undertones. The finish is supposed to be matte, but it has a noticeable sheen to it, so it looks more semi-matte to me. It has a matte finish and is part of the permanent range. The texture is very creamy; it’s one of MAC’s better matte formulas. Giorgio Armani #507 is a little darker. MAC Mehr is a little darker, browner. MAC Chatterbox has a stronger yellow undertone and appears a bit darker. (9, 10, 9, 8.5, 4.5, 4; A-) Please Me Nail Lacquer is a medium pink with yellow undertones and a cream finish. It’s opaque in two coats, but it did have some slight streaking in the initial coat. I used a thicker second coat, which helped cover the majority of the streaks. MAC Angel is very close but lighter. Rescue Beauty Lounge Pepto PInk is cooler-toned. (9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4; B+) MAC Lipsticks are vanilla-scented but taste-free. Matte finishes like Please Me typically wear four to six hours on me, with lighter shades like this one wearing around four hours. MAC’s matte formula can be really nice to work with, but sometimes they can be on the drier side (often described as a “retro matte”), but Please Me has a creamier, less dry consistency that glides on more readily. MAC Lipglasses are also vanilla-scented but taste-free. They are very sticky and have a thick, borderline-goopy consistency. If you prefer gel-like, cushion-y glosses that feel lightweight on, I don’t recommend MAC Lipglass. Because of the tackier texture, MAC Lipglasses do tend to wear a full four hours on me, with some of the darker shades lasting up to six hours (with mostly the color lingering at that point). Note: I am reviewing each “set” together. After I’ve reviewed all sixteen sets, I will do round-ups for each product type (so all lipsticks together) to deliver an overall Glossover rating.

These will be available on September 10th at chanel.com, Chanel boutiques, and select department store counters. Each shade retails for $25.00. Edited @ 2:42pm : Added comparison photos of Khaki Vert against Sew Psyched, because I don’t think they’re dupes, but I’ve had a lot of questions asking if they are! Pics or shut up, right? I like Sew Psyched, too, but they are different enough on me that I wouldn’t call ’em dupes. Khaki Brun is a deep olive green-tinged brown. It’s a rather murky brown with just this touch of green to it; it’s distinctly brown but in natural light, the olive tones are pulled out more. Just two coats. Khaki Rose is a rose-tinged medium-dark brown. It has such a subtle rosiness to it that it’s almost not there, but yet you can’t say it’s not, because there’s something about how the rose warms up the brown. Two coats. Khaki Vert is a grayish-cast medium green. Not really murky, but it’s not bright or happy either; a rather neutral green, I’d say. It’s not quite camo green, because it doesn’t have strong yellow or live undertones. Two coats. I don’t think this is really similar to Essie’s Sew Psyched–this is much greener, while Sew Psyched pulls almost blue/teal in comparison. The formula on these was a bit thicker than usual, but it didn’t make for difficult application–quite the opposite! Application was nearly flawless with each coat being incredibly pigmented. One coat would have almost been enough on each one, but two coats created that smooth, opaque look. I always hate how these end up being B+ products, which is really due to the price, not the quality of the product (which is excellent). If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 29/30 Value : 6/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 RECOMMENDATION: All three had fantastic pigmentation and applied flawlessly, so if a color catches your eye and you don’t mind the price tag of Chanel, I definitely recommend trying it out.

"[""MAC Saint Germain Lipglass, Lipstick, Nail Lacquer Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Apr 28, 2012 April 28, 2012 MAC Saint Germain Lipstick, Lipglass, Nail Lacquer MAC Saint Germain Lipglass, Lipstick, Nail Lacquer MAC Saint Germain Lipstick ($14.50 for 0.10 oz.) has been such a top-seller that it has now inspired a Lipglass ($14.50 for 0.17 fl. oz.) and Nail Lacquer ($16.00 for 0.34 fl. oz.) to complement it. This shade is part of the Asia Pacific and Europe/Africa regions of the collection, so it will only be available online for North American buyers. Saint Germain is described as “light cool pink.” The lipgloss is slightly lighter, and because it’s not as opaque, the two definitely don’t look the same when applied. The nail lacquer is blue-based as well, and it’s just a smidgen darker than the lipstick and lipgloss, but it is pretty close. When you layer the lipgloss over the lipstick, the result is a slightly pinker color overall, because the lipgloss is just a bit lighter. The gloss creates a more uneven appearance, though; kind of looks like air bubbles in a way. Saint Germain Lipglass is a milky pale cool-toned pink. It is semi-opaque, but it applies fairly unevenly and settles into lip lines quite a bit. This is not a gloss that looks really good on its own, so it is best layered over a more opaque product. MAC Pink Nouveau is darker, not quite as cool-toned. NARS Coeur Sucre is darker. MAC Enchantee isn’t as pink or as cool-toned. (6.5, 8, 8.5, 8, 3, 4; C) Saint Germain Lipstick is a pale pink that’s very blue-based, so it almost looks a little lilac-pink. It has an amplified creme finish, and it is part of the permanent range. The color coverage is opaque. MAC Pink Friday is just a little darker. MAC Viva Glam Gaga is not as blue-based. MAC Snob isn’t as blue-based and almost has a gray-tint in comparison. MAC All Styled Up is pinker, not as cool-toned. (9, 10, 9, 8.5, 4.5, 4; A-) Saint Germain Nail Lacquer is a light-medium pink with blue undertones. It was mostly opaque after two coats, but the formula was incredibly streaky, even on the second coat. It was on the thicker side, so it did pool a little bit along the sides. Zoya Rory is similar in color but has a lot of shimmer/glitter. MAC Pinkly Fresh is lighter and not as blue-based. Essie French Affair is lighter, less blue-based. MAC Ice Cream Cake is the closest, but it’s a bit darker–it shares the same strength of cool undertones, though. (7, 8.5, 8, 9, 3, 4; C+) MAC Lipsticks are vanilla-scented but taste-free. I usually get four to six hours of wear out of Amplified Creme finishes, but Saint Germain is on the shorter end of that, because of its pale, light color. It tends to look a bit chalky as the wear goes on, as the subtle sheen wears away faster than the color does. MAC Lipglasses are also vanilla-scented but taste-free. They are very sticky and have a thick, borderline-goopy consistency. If you prefer gel-like, cushion-y glosses that feel lightweight on, I don’t recommend MAC Lipglass. Because of the tackier texture, MAC Lipglasses do tend to wear a full four hours on me, with some of the darker shades lasting up to six hours (with mostly the color lingering at that point).

"['MAC Fashion Sets: Lipglass Review Round-up Reviews Apr 29, 2012 April 29, 2012 MAC Girl About Town Lipglass over Lipstick; Nail Lacquer MAC Fashion Sets: Lipglass Review Round-up Of the sixteen Lipglasses in this launch, it ended up being a mixed bag. A lot of the common problems seen from the thicker formula of Lipglass came up, and these tend to be seen more often in lighter, milkier shades. These lighter shades tend to apply unevenly and settle into lip lines. Darker shades tended to be more opaque and less problematic, though the less opaque they were, the more unevenly they applied. Lipglass is a heavier, thicker, and very sticky formula (it is often my benchmark for how sticky a gloss is–many readers have experience with the formula, so it often works as a global reference point), which doesn’t mean that it’s bad, but I know that it specifically does not appeal to some for those very reasons. I think the thickness could probably be improved upon as more and more glosses have come out and have a lighter feel that’s more comfortable and wears just as long and as well–it’s more a sign of improved and more refined formulas in the past decade. MAC has shown it themselves with their gloss extensions and limited edition formulas. This opinion does not change or have any impact on the overall rating, which is about the product and its quality and relevant metrics in relation to quality. I don’t think the lipglosses are necessary if you own or love the lipstick version and do not typically wear gloss alone or are only really seeking out the gloss to pair with the lipstick. The lipsticks are very opaque on their own, so they do not need a semi-opaque or opaque gloss on top to help it along. What the glosses really do is add glossiness, which can be achieved with clear gloss. If you want to mix your favorite lipstick-now-gloss shade with other lipsticks or wear it on its own, then some of the shades can certainly be worth purchasing. The top-performing shades were: Girl About Town , Impassioned , Morange , Russian Red , and Spice (A- — no lipgloss received an A). Good but not great shades were: Angel , Please Me , Rebel (B+). The most under-performing shades were: Saint Germain (C); Chestnut and Myth (B-). Availability : Based on the information I have received from MAC, the distribution of these shades is regional. I cannot confirm the extent of non-regional shades being available online for your region (e.g. whether all of these will be available on the UK website). I can confirm only that for North America, all shades are available for purchase online. Only the North America-specific shades will be available in-stores on May 3rd, 2012. Select Macy’s will also carry Latin America & Middle East region-specific shades.

It applied beautifully–one of the best Chanel lacquers in terms of formula I’ve tried–and only needed two coats for complete opaqueness.

I’ve always had good luck with Chanel lacquers–no chipping issues for me. I always use mine with Zoya’s Color Lock System and that seems to keep everything on the up and up for about a week or so.

Rescue Beauty Lounge Nail Lacquers ($18.00) are a big splash amongst nail polish fanatics, and I didn’t even realize that they’re the same brand that does all the soaps I have in my house! (I love that they have a hand soap with the word Pamplemousse in its name! One of my favorite French words ever–say it ten times and you better be giggling!) Last week, I purchased several shades from the website to give ’em a spin for myself… No More War is an olive green cream. You could say it’s camouflage green or army green as well. It’s rich and goes opaque in two coats for me. Diddy Mow is a muted, gray-green cream with subtle silver micro-shimmer. The shimmer almost looks like grains of sand in the “water.” RBL describes it as “a putty green, the color of sand through sea water.” It was opaque in nearly one coat, though I swatched it with two. 360 is a played-down bluish teal cream with subtle silver micro-shimmer. Opaque in two coats for me — it’s pretty pigmented in one, but I find I need two for a good, overall result. This was my first time trying the brand’s polishes, and I really liked the formula. It’s rich, pigmented, and applies smoothly. There is no streaking, bubbling, or dragging. All three were nearly opaque in one coat, but I still preferred doing two coats for a completely opaque, smooth look. These colors seemed unique to me–perhaps its the subtleties of each one, where they’re not the typical shade and yet wearable. I just wish they weren’t so pricey.

"[""MAC Quite Cute Nail Lacquers Swatches, Photos, Review Reviews Mar 31, 2011 March 31, 2011 Ice Cream Cake, Little Girl Type, Mischievous Mint MAC Quite Cute Collection: Nail Lacquers MAC Quite Cute Collection ($14.00 for 0.4 fl. oz.) features three light shades of limited edition nail lacquer. They include: Ice Cream Cake (creamy blue pink), Little Girl Type (creamy pale lavender), and Mischievous Mint (creamy pale blue mint). Ice Cream Cake is a darkened cotton candy pink with a strong blue base with a cream finish. I used two coats. It is similar to Essie’s Splash of Grenandine–slightly more blue-based. Little Girl Type is a light lavender with a cream finish. I used two coats. It is similar to China Glaze’s Light as Air. Mischievous Mint is a bluish mint green with a cream finish. I used two coats. It is bluer but similar in lightness to China Glaze’s Re-Fresh Mint. This is much, much lighter than last year’s Peppermint Patti, and it is a blue-based mint green. my thoughts on the formula: The consistency was thick but watery–not terribly so, but noteworthy nonetheless. I used two coats on all, because it was difficult to get thin to medium-thin coats because of how the brush splayed out. In all three polishes, the bristles of each brush were a bit wonky, which made it more difficult to get really clean, even coats. I recommend being patient, because the slight wateriness in the formula will cause streaking if you apply before the coat dries down.

"[""MAC Chen Man Love & Water Collection: Nail Lacquers Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Feb 23, 2012 February 23, 2012 MAC Breezy Blue Nail & Pinkly Fresh Nail Lacquers MAC Chen Man Love & Water Collection: Nail Lacquers There are two MAC Nail Lacquers ($16.00 for 0.30 fl. oz.) in the new Love & Water Collection , and they include: Breezy Blue (dark blue) and Pinkly Fresh (mid-tone blue pink). Breezy Blue is a deep purple-tinted navy blue with a cream finish. I applied two coats (and three coats on the middle finger), but I wasn’t able to get complete opacity. Illamasqua Force is similar but a little lighter. shu uemura Bleu Splendor is darker. Deborah Lippmann I Know What Boys Like is very similar. The formula was watery and thin, so three coats is really necessary in order to eliminate visible nail line. Pinkly Fresh is a subtly blue-based pastel pink with a cream finish. Essie French Affair is very similar, perhaps a touch lighter. The formula is so, so thick on this one. The first coat was incredibly streaky, and only when I applied a really thick second coat was I able to get a streak-free result. Because of the thicker consistency, drying time seemed longer than average. I used two coats for swatches, though the second coat was deliberately thick, and it was opaque. I’m not keen on the formula on either of these. At this price point, the formula really needs to be immaculate or else the color out of this world to justify it. How many blue and pink creams are there on the market? P.S. — Apologies in advance: I’m super sick, and when I’m under the weather, my hands tend to get really dry, so they are rather tired-looking in these photos!

"[""NARS Coeur Sucre Larger Than Life Lipgloss Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Apr 03, 2012 April 03, 2012 NARS Coeur Sucre Larger Than Life Lipgloss NARS Coeur Sucre Larger Than Life Lipgloss NARS Coeur Sucre Larger Than Life Lipgloss ($26.00 for 0.19 fl. oz.) is described as a “shimmering vibrant pink.” It’s a medium cotton candy pink with blue undertones and a silver-white micro-glitter/shimmer. I couldn’t think of too many shades that came close to this. MAC Vanity Fair is much lighter and has no shimmer (more like a liquid lipstick formula). NARS Angelika would be much closer, except it’s not as opaque and applies fairly streaky. MAC Sassy Lassy is darker and brighter. The Larger Than Life formula is designed to give “intense color” with “brilliant shine” while being long-wearing. It also has moisturizing ingredients and “natural lip enhancers” that will plump lips. The consistency of Coeur Sucre isn’t too thick or too thin, and it’s not a gloss I’d call lightweight, but it doesn’t feel thick and goopy either. It has a gel-like texture initially, which is non-sticky, but after a half hour or so, it delivers a tackiness that gets rather sticky after an hour and a half (much as I experienced with Giorgio Armani Gloss d’Armani ). It delivers semi-opaque color and applies surprisingly evenly for a gloss in this color–there is some minor settling into lip lines that is barely noticeable because of the high-shine finish. Coeur Sucre wore for five and a half hours, which is longer than the average gloss wears (three to four hours; as little as two for lighter shades). I found the formula to be hydrating–sometimes when you wear just gloss all day long, your lips can easily show signs of dehydration, but even after twelve hours of wearing the Larger Than Life formula, my lips felt lush and lovely. I don’t see (or feel!) any plumping effect; the glossy shine does give lips a larger, more luminous appearance. Here is what I loathe about this product–and I don’t use the word lightly–the applicator. It is like applying lipgloss with a toothpick, or nearly so. It’s just absolutely miniscule, and if you have very thin lips, I think this may be the applicator you’ve been looking for, but even you may find it takes several pumps of gloss to get enough product to cover your lips. I get that NARS is hoping this applicator will give you the precision you want, but it’s unnecessarily small. You can maneuver around the lip lines with something double the size. In order to cover my lips, I had to go back five times for color. 8 5 Coeur Sucre 8 5 Coeur Sucre A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks Selfridges Macy's Net-A-Porter Barneys Harvey Nichols (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Space NK (UK) bluemercury Sephora (PL) Dillard's NARS 9.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Zoya Surf Collection Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 21, 2012 March 21, 2012 Zoya Surf Collection Zoya Surf Collection Zoya’s Surf Collection will make its official debut on April 1st, and each shade retails for $8.00 for 0.50 oz. All six shades have a foil metallic finish: Carly (thalia purple foil metallic), Kimber (magenta pink foil metallic), Rory (lotus pink foil metallic), Myrta (coral orange foil metallic), Meg (mermaid green foil metallic), and Zuza (aquamarine foil metallic). Carly is a rich eggplant purple with strong magenta-red undertones and magenta-pink and violet shimmer. It was almost opaque in one coat, but I used two for swatches. SpaRitual Shooting Star is actually very similar, but the shimmer is sparser and more golden. Milani Hot Metal is purpler, lighter. MAC So Rich So Pretty is less shimmered and purpler. Kimber is a coral-red with warm orange-gold shimmer. It’s opaque in two coats, though almost a one-coater. SpaRitual Lustress is similar but has pink shimmer. It reminded me of Zoya RIca , but it has a lot less gold shimmer, so the two do not look so much alike as they would seem. OCC Extravaganza is several shades lighter. Rory is a silver-shimmered cotton candy pink with strong blue undertones. It was opaque in two coats. The only previously reviewed shade that is similar is MAC Ice Cream Cake , which is darker and has no shimmer. Zoya’s Shelby from this launch would also be close but without shimmer. Myrta is a medium-dark orange with lighter orange shimmer. It was opaque in two coats. There’s a slightly dusty quality to this shade that isn’t present in a lot of other orange polishes. China Glaze Riveting is much brighter. MAC Oriele Orange is similar in base color, though a bit more intense, but it lacks shimmer. MAC Kid Orange is a bit darker and has no shimmer. Zoya Tanzy has a lighter orange base and way more gold shimmer. China Glaze Life Preserver is a bit darker and has no shimmer. Meg is a warm, lightened grassy green with chartreuse shimmer. It was opaque in two coats. This shade reminded me a lot of MAC’s Swimming eyeshadow. I couldn’t think of great dupes for this shade–it’s green, not chartreuse, and a lot of shades that might be similar ended up being chartreuses. Chanel Peridot will hint this shade at certain angles. Milani Hi-Tech is the closest I could think of, but it’s a bit lighter and has multi-colored shimmer. Nubar Meadow Sparkle is a bit darker and more translucent–more like a glitter top coat. Zuza is a blue-based aqua with silver shimmer. It was almost opaque in one coat, but I used two coats for swatches. Like Meg, this also reminded me of a MAC eyeshadow–Aquadisiac (though way better). MAC Salad Dressed is similar but less bright. MAC Ocean Dip is deeper, less blue-based. The foil metallic finish is always fun, because it dries down faster than your average polish. It does dry down to a more matte finish, though, so you’ll want a shiny top coat to finish it off. Like the Beach collection, the pigmentation on these was excellent. You could almost get away with one coat on some of these shades, though all swatches are with two. These were not as thick as the Beach collection; not watery (because it wasn’t streaky or sheer), but the consistency was thin.

"[""MAC Russian Red Lipglass, Lipstick, Nail Lacquer Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Apr 28, 2012 April 28, 2012 MAC Russian Red Lipstick, Nail Lacquer, Lipglass MAC Russian Red Lipglass, Lipstick, Nail Lacquer MAC Russian Red Lipstick ($14.50 for 0.10 oz.) has been such a top-seller that it has now inspired a Lipglass ($14.50 for 0.17 fl. oz.) and Nail Lacquer ($16.00 for 0.34 fl. oz.) to complement it. This shade is part of the North America, Europe/Africa, and Latin regions of the collection, so it will be available both online and in-stores. Russian Red is described as “mid-tone neutral red.” The lipgloss is a little brighter and appears slightly less neutral/less blue-based compared to the lipstick, which I find is almost neutral but leans a smidgen on the cool side. The matching nail lacquer is a very good match to both the lipstick and lipgloss; it’s a nice shade of medium-dark red that is very close to neutral in tone. When you apply the lipgloss over the lipstick, the result is a more opaque, slightly darker, richer looking red pout than if you were to just wear the gloss alone. Russian Red Lipglass is a rich cherry red that leans just a smidgen orange-red, but it’s very close to neutral. For me, it looks more orange-toned when it’s swatched next to the lipstick (which is neutral to slightly blue-based), but when I look at it by itself, it reads neutral. This is part of the permanent range. It has opaque color coverage. MAC Driven by Love is a deeper, darker red with shimmer. MAC Nitro:licious 2046 is a pinky-red. Illamasqua Succubus is a bit brighter. OCC Stalker looks almost warm in comparison. (9, 10, 9, 9, 4, 4; A-) Russian Red Lipstick is medium-dark red with mostly neutral undertones, though against my warmer skin, it reads just a little cool-toned. It has a matte finish, and it is part of the permanent range. Maybelline Very Cherry is lighter, more blue-based. MAC Runaway Red is darker, more blue-based. MAC Such Flare! is deeper. Guerlain Habit Rouge is lighter and more orange-toned. MAC Prolong is more blue-based. Guerlain Garconne is darker. (9, 10, 9, 10, 4.5, 4; A) Russian Red Nail Lacquer is a medium-dark red with nearly neutral undertones (leaning at most slightly blue). It has a cream finish, and it was opaque in two coats. I didn’t have any trouble with the formula, so it applied evenly and fluidly. Chanel Rouge Carat is a little lighter and has shimmer. MAC Get Noticed is a deeper red. Zoya Sooki is a little bluer-based. Butter London Pillar Box is very close. China Glaze Hey Sailor is bluer-based. MAC Asiatique is also close. (10, 10, 10, 9, 4.5, 4; A) MAC Lipsticks are vanilla-scented but taste-free. Matte finishes like Russian Red typically wear four to six hours on me, and Russian Red wears around six hours typically and will stain. I find the texture of Russian Red lipstick to be creamier than some of MAC’s drier matte formulas, but I don’t find it drying. MAC Lipglasses are also vanilla-scented but taste-free. They are very sticky and have a thick, borderline-goopy consistency. If you prefer gel-like, cushion-y glosses that feel lightweight on, I don’t recommend MAC Lipglass. Because of the tackier texture, MAC Lipglasses do tend to wear a full four hours on me, with some of the darker shades lasting up to six hours (with mostly the color lingering at that point). Note: I am reviewing each “set” together. After I’ve reviewed all sixteen sets, I will do round-ups for each product type (so all lipsticks together) to deliver an overall Glossover rating. This rating is more indicative of the product type, as the rating that follows this post is an average across three totally different types of products. You can also see the individual scores listed after each product, which are listed in the same order as they are in the Glossover.

China Glaze Champagne Bubbles is much yellower. SpaRitual Golden Gleam is more orange. Milani 3D is holographic and a little less orange. MAC Vice is Nice is a little more orange. Gold Fingers is almost opaque in two coats–if you want more of a “semi-sheer” look as Chanel describes, I’d recommend just one coat. I think it looks best with two coats, because it results in more even color coverage. The benefit to having it be slightly metallic and chocked full of shimmer and micro-glitter is that it dries down faster than the average polish. It has a consistency that’s just slightly watery but doesn’t seem to affect the application in any way. Chanel polishes typically last a week on me with minor tip wear but no chipping.

"['A Tale of Two Eyeshadows… Stream of Consciousness Looks Jun 16, 2010 June 16, 2010 A Tale of Two Eyeshadows… Stream of Consciousness I was really, truly determined to just two eyeshadows in this look (not including the highlighter, pfft !), but of course, I couldn’t leave well enough alone. I have a tutorial for this look, and it’s more like a stream of consciousness than a tutorial, because you’ll see me going through the whole process of wanting to keep it at just two but not being happy with it the way it turned out. I originally planned just Gorgeous Gold and Shimmermoss , but I wanted more oomph in the crease, so I then tried Winkle , which was a bit light, so I went to Atlantic Blue , which was lovely, but blending on top of frostier finishes (like Shimmermoss ) can be difficult. This is all to say that this is more like a “work in progress” kind of look. If I were to do it all over again, I would start with Atlantic Blue in the crease, skip Winkle altogether, and may even skip Shimmermoss –but definitely layer the matte shade on prior to the frostier shade. You will need the following… Eyes : NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base (neutral eyeshadow base), MAC Gorgeous Gold Eyeshadow (green-toned gold), MAC Winkle Eyeshadow (periwinkle blue), MAC Atlantic Blue Eyeshadow (matte dark blue), MAC Shimmermoss Eyeshadow (teal), MAC Orb Eyeshadow (highlighter), Urban Decay Flipside 24/7 Liner (teal), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder (translucent) Cheeks : Le Metier de Beaute Echo Blush (peachy-coral), Dior Amber Diamond Skin Shimmers (bronze shimmer) Lips : MAC Crosswires Lipstick (coral-pink), MAC Nymphette Lipglass (peachy-pink) Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 116 (dense blush brush) For eyes, start by applying Smudgeproof as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Using the 239, apply Gorgeous Gold eyeshadow all over the lower lid. Lightly blend Shimmermoss eyeshadow in the outer crease and third of the lid with the 226. Next, apply Winkle eyeshadow into the crease with the 226, lightly blending onto the outer lid. Define the crease with Atlantic Blue eyeshadow and the 226. Blend Gorgeous Gold eyeshadow with the crease shade and then highlight the brow bone with Gorgeous Gold eyeshadow . Bring everything together by applying Flipside liner on the lower lash line, then smudge with Gorgeous Gold eyeshadow . Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Echo blush on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116, then lightly pat Amber Diamond on the cheekbones. For lips, apply Crosswires lipstick first, and then layer Nymphette lipglass for a complementing lip.

"['Aveda Golden Jasper Eye Color Trio Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Jun 16, 2010 June 16, 2010 Aveda Does Eyeshadow Aveda Golden Jasper Eye Color Trio ($22.00 for 0.08 oz.) is an unexpected, but entirely pleasant, surprise from Aveda. I don’t know about you, but I always forget that Aveda actually has a full range of products–I always think hair when I think about the brand. There is one really fabulous characteristic about Aveda though, that spans their entire range, it’s that they really are eco-conscious. And they don’t make you hunt around for information on whether they’re truly looking to be a greener, more earth-friendly company. The eye trios are packaged in 100% post-consumer recycled clamshell and paper sleeve–it’s something that reader Dusty pointed out about EcoTools : the brushes are packaged in plastic yet there is no information on whether that plastic was recycled or not. Additionally, the eyeshadow trio doesn’t contain talc, mineral oil, or parabens. The trios are available in several other varieties : Blue Dawn, Plum Mist, Earth Rose, Aqua Pearl, Black Tulip, Sweet Grass, Copper Haze, and Gobi Sands. Each trio features three complementary shades, arranged from lightest to darkest, and it pretty much makes using them a no-brainer. Lightest on the lid, medium or darkest on the outer lid/crease. Golden Jasper consists of a soft, light beige with a satin shimmer; warmed up medium brown with a soft sheen; and chocolate brown with warm undertones. The eyeshadow is soft, smooth, and pigmented. It melts when applied to lid, and I actually wore them without a base, just as a test, for several hours (I’d say around six), and I didn’t encounter any creasing. (But to be clear, my lids are on the drier side, rather than oily!) I’m definitely interested in trying out some of the other shade varieties (perhaps Blue Dawn, Aqua Pearl, Sweet Grass, or Copper Haze ), to see how those hold up. But so far, I’m impressed by the spirit and story of Aveda and the delivery on the eyeshadow formulation based on Golden Jasper . You can either use your own palettes, keep them in their plastic sleeves, or pick up one of their Environmental Compacts (made of 30% post-consumer recycled and 20% post-industrial regrind aluminum). Have you tried Aveda’s eyeshadows before? If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 28/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : Next time you’re near an Aveda counter, you might want to check out their makeup range. I so infrequently hear about the range’s makeup and skincare, and maybe it’s time we check them out!

"[""MAC Quite Cute Lipstick Swatches, Photos, Reviews Sample Reviews Mar 31, 2011 March 31, 2011 MAC Quite Cute Lipsticks in Candy Yum-Yum and Quite Cute MAC Quite Cute Lipstick Swatches, Photos, Reviews MAC Quite Cute Lipsticks ($14.50 for 0.10 oz.) feature four shades new and limited edition shades, plus one repromote (Saint Germain). The shades included are: Candy Yum-Yum (matte neon pink), Quite Cute (creamy bright whitened lavender), Saint Germain (clean pastel pink), Playing Koi (creamy white peach pink), and Playtime (creamy intense violet). Candy Yum-Yum is a neon, magenta pink with a matte finish. It’s nearly glowing in its brightness. On me, the blue undertones seem to be pulled out. I feel like I’ve seen this color, but whenever I compare it to a possible dupe, it isn’t pink enough (purpler instead). It’s pinker than Madly Magenta cream colour base (from Stylishly Yours, ’10). It is surprisingly creamy and not at all clingy for a matte. The closest I found was Petals & Peacocks, which is several degrees brighter (Give Me Liberty of London, ’10). Quite Cute is a semi-opaque pale lavender with a semi-glossy finish. It has a cremesheen finish, and it has the same texture, but the finish seems glossier to me. It’s a paler, sheerer version of Blooming Lovely (Give Me Liberty of London, ’10). Pinker than Lavender Whip. On cooler skin tones, this is easier to work with, while warmer skin tones may want to pair with a more pigmented lipstick/gloss. Saint Germain is a really pale, cool-toned pink that is blue-based. It’s been released several times, and you can see an older swatch here . It is best suited for those with cooler skin tones. The closest permanent dupe is Snob, but I believe this was mad epermanent last year. Playing Koi is an opaque pinky peach with a satin finish. Honestly, this lipstick looked like garbage on my lips–it highlighted every single imperfection and amplified them ten-fold. I exfoliate my lips every few days, and for reference, I exfoliated right before doing this swatch! The color itself is like Angel and Hue had a baby. Playtime is a semi-sheer magenta purple with soft sheen and shimmer. It has a cremesheen finish. It’s similar to Style Curve (from Stylishly Yours), but this is purpler, less fuchsia. my thoughts on the formula: MAC Lipsticks are vanilla-scented but taste-free. I typically get four hours of wear, but some of the lighter lustre and glaze finishes tend to disappear by hour three. Amplified cremes and amplified finishes, however, tend to go beyond four. I find the formula comfortable to wear and not drying (but not moisturizing–a couple of the matte shades can be drying).

"[""Burberry Primrose Hill Pink Lipstick Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 21, 2012 March 21, 2012 Burberry Primrose Hill Pink Lipstick Burberry Primrose Hill Pink Lipstick ($30.00 for 0.13 oz.) is a brightened warm pink that borders on pink-coral. Make Up For Ever Folk is slightly more coral. MAC Watch Me Simmer is brighter, slightly less pink. NYX Haute Melon is a bit more orange but has a similar look. Guerlain Nahema is much more coral. MAC Ultra Darling is slightly redder. This kind of shade is flattering on both warmer and cooler skin tones, because it doesn’t have a lot of orange or coral in it. Burberry’s Lip Cover formula is supposed to be hydrating, yield full color coverage, and feel lightweight against the lip. It’s lovely during application–soft, smooth, which enables it to glide on effortlessly without pulling or tugging at the lips. It also is able to deliver nearly opaque color coverage in a single pass; you don’t have to go back and forth with this shade. The creamy consistency is very lightweight, though, and it gives the finish a luminous quality that makes lips look fuller. I love how hydrating the formula is–my lips always feel good even after this has worn off four hours or so later. 28 1 Primrose Hill Pink 28 1 Primrose Hill Pink A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Net-A-Porter Burberry (US) House of Fraser (UK) Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Escentual Sephora (PL) 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""MAC Sheen Supreme Lipglass Reviews, Photos, Swatches (Part 2) Reviews Feb 25, 2012 February 25, 2012 MAC Sheen Supreme Lipglass MAC Sheen Supreme Lipglass (Part 2) MAC Sheen Supreme Lipglass ($19.00 for 0.08 fl. oz.) is a new and limited edition formula releasing next Thursday, March 1st. This post features these shades: Fuji Pink (pale peach with low level pearl), Imperial Red (bright rose with pearl), Jasmine Honey (light cream beige), Mango Sheen (bright coral with pearl), Moon Beach (warm light beige with pearl), and Sweet Bean (cool beige with pearl). Fuji Pink is a milky peach with just a smattering of white shimmer. It lightens lips a bit. Shades like Bobbi Brown Bare Sparkle , Giorgio Armani #500 , and Guerlain Rose in Bloom are all similar (which is just naming a few). Imperial Red is a darkened pink with fine gold shimmer. The color coverage is semi-opaque and surprisingly even. MAC Totally Bang has a similar base color but the shimmer is different. MAC Radiant Jewels is redder. Jasmine Honey is a milky beige with white-beige shimmer. It is a little lighter than Fuji Pink, but the two are hardly polar opposites. Again, shades like Bobbi Brown Bare Sparkle , Giorgio Armani #500 , and Guerlain Rose in Bloom are all similar (which is just naming a few). Mango Sheen is an orange-red with gold-copper shimmer. This shade has more semi-opaque color, but it doesn’t apply as evenly as Imperial Red. Revlon Strawberry is similar but a touch pinker. MAC Geo Pink is more orange. MAC Double Dare is similar in color but doesn’t have the gold shimmer. Moon Beach is a sheer pearly beige. It’s mostly shimmer on my lips, so there are lots of sheer lipgloss dupes . Sweet Bean is a mix of coppery-red, rose, and white shimmer. MAC Superglass reminded me of the way this looks, sort of like confetti, but I don’t know of an exact dupe. This one gets a little gritty after it wears away. Please see part one for a review of the formula.

"['MAC Shop MAC, Cook MAC Lipsticks Reviews Feb 03, 2012 February 03, 2012 MAC Dish It Up Lipstick MAC Shop MAC, Cook MAC: Lipsticks The collection features six limited edition shades of MAC Lipstick ($14.50 for 0.10 oz.). These shades include: Dish It Up (berry pink), Innocence, Beware! (light yellow pink), Naughty Saute (bright pepto pink), Quick Sizzle (bright pink), Runaway Red (rich red-blue), and Watch Me Simmer (bright pink-orange). Dish It Up is a muted, medium-dark fuchsia-plum with semi-opaque color coverage and a natural sheen. It has a lustre finish, so it’s supposed to be semi-sheer and moisturizing. I don’t find the finish to be hydrating; I actually find it a bit drying. The color coverage is actually much more than anticipated based on the finish. MAC Plum Bright is much, much darker and less pink. MAC Hot Gossip is lighter and pinker. MAC Love Forever is brighter, pinker, bluer-based. MAC Something New was the most similar but still pinker and more vibrant. Innocence, Beware! is a pink-tinted pale, fleshy beige with subtle pink micro-shimmer and a natural sheen. It has a cremesheen finish and yields mostly opaque color coverage. MAC Naked Bliss is a few shades darker and less pink. Maybelline Born With It is a bit less pink. MAC Hue is less pink-toned. Naughty Saute is a vibrant blue-based light-medium pink with a good amount of sheen. It really does resemble Pepto Bismol. It has a cremesheen finish. It has a lot of glide and slip, so it doesn’t always apply evenly around the edges. MAC Viva Glam Gaga is much lighter. MAC All Styled Up is much lighter, less blue-toned. MAC Pink Friday is just as blue-based, but it’s lighter. Quick Sizzle is a bright blue-based fuchsia pink with opaque color coverage. It has a matte finish. It’s not one of the dry-type of mattes; it’s creamy and applies evenly without pulling at lips. Make Up For Ever #203 is slightly pinker, less blue-based. MAC Show Orchid is less pink, iridescent. Milani Rose Hip is slightly lighter. NARS Schiap looks about the same. MAC Candy Yum Yum is more magenta, less pink. OCC Pretty Boy is darker. MAC Rare Exotic is darker, pinker. MAC Pink Pigeon is more fuchsia. Runaway Red is a medium-dark blue-based red with a subtle fuchsia sheen. It’s mostly opaque on lips, but there is a hint of translucence. It has a satin finish. Make Up For Ever #48 and MAC Dark Side are browner. Guerlain Gwen is closer but not quite as dark. MAC Digna is similar but not as opaque. Watch Me Simmer is a vibrant coral that leans just a tinge pink but comes across as a truer coral. It has an amplified finish. MAC Ultra Darling is pinker and less vibrant. Wet ‘n’ Wild Hot Paris Pink is pinker. OCC Trollop is slightly pinker. Make Up For Ever #37 is a bit darker. Chanel Phoenix is a touch darker. Bite Beauty Rose is slightly more orange. MAC Full Speed is very similar. VS Be Mine is pinker. MAC lipsticks are vanilla-scented and tend to wear three to four hours on me on average. Finishes like lustres tend to disappear within two hours, but I suspect the more opaque Dish It Up should get to around three hours. Matte, satin, and amplified finishes tend to wear four to five hours, and some of the darker and more intense shades, like Quick Sizzle and Runaway Red, tend to last six hours or longer and typically stain the lips a little. P.S. — If you’re worried about not being able to snag some of the lipsticks, because some have sold out on MAC’s website, the collection is still due to launch at other retailers, like Nordstrom, Macy’s, etc. as well as in-stores.

The closest dupe I could think of was Zoya Tracie , which has subtle metallic shimmer running through it. It’s also a little yellower. Barielle Myrza’s Meadow is also a bit similar, though a touch lighter, and it has multi-colored flecks of sparkle. I love the yellow component to this, because it keeps it from being a cool, minty green that screams winter to me; the warmth gives it the freshness of springtime to me. Navigate Her was opaque in two coats. The initial coat was a little streaky, but it was opaque and even with the second coat. It had a well-balanced consistency that was neither too thick or too thin, so it applied fluidly and evenly without pooling or bubbling. I tested Navigate Her for wear, and it managed a full seven days without chipping and had minimal tip wear at the end of the week. 10 13 Navigate Her 10 13 Navigate Her A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Ulta Selfridges Amazon DermStore Target Kohl's Priceline FeelUnique Beauty Brands 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9.5 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Next, apply Blue Calm eyeshadow into the crease with the 226, lightly blending onto the outer lid. Blend Gorgeous Gold eyeshadow with the crease shade very lightly, and then highlight the brow bone with Mylar eyeshadow . Bring everything together by applying Deviant liner on the lower lash line, then pat Blue Calm eyeshadow to smudge and blend out with the 219. Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Sun Kissed bronzer on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116, then lightly pat Amber Diamond on the cheekbones. For lips, lightly pat on Morange lipstick very, very sheerly, and then layer Easy Lounger lipglass for a complementing lip.

"[""Deborah Lippmann Billionaire Nail Lacquer Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 14, 2012 March 14, 2012 Deborah Lippmann Billionaire Nail Lacquer Deborah Lippmann Billionaire Nail Lacquer Deborah Lippmann Billionaire Nail Lacquer ($16.00 for 0.50 fl. oz.) is described as a “moody hunter green” with a cream finish. This is a really murky, blackened green with more black than green. There’s a hint of olive-brown in the base, which contributes to the forboding look of the color. Chanel Khaki Brun has similar qualities, but it’s much, much lighter, so it appears green, rather than nearly black. Rescue Beauty Lounge Anne is closer in the overall color, but the shimmer in its finish makes it quite different. I couldn’t think of an exact dupe or even a shade that came close to it. Like the other shades from the fall collection (yes, fall ), Billionaire has an excellent formula that’s neither thick or thin. It applies fluidly and evenly without bubbling, pooling, or streaking. The color is opaque in two coats, though it’s nearly opaque in one. One of Deborah Lippmann’s strengths is the wear of the polish; I typically get a week of wear with minimal tip wear and no chipping. Billionaire applies flawlessly; it really has an amazing formula that’s not too thick or too thin, wonderfully pigmented, and applies without bubbling, streaking, or pooling. There’s a natural shine when it dries, though I advise a top coat for a glossy finish. I’ve had excellent wear with Deborah Lippmann’s formula–typically a week with very minimal tip wear with no chipping. 10 7 Billionaire 10 7 Billionaire A+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Cult Beauty Amazon Net-A-Porter Skinstore.com Barneys Harrods Harvey Nichols (UK) HSN Cosbar bluemercury Dillard's 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 100% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

With the exception of Smutty Green, these were originally limited shades that have been brought back for a stint as permanent products. At least once a year, MAC rotates in new mineralize eyeshadows that become permanent for a time, and these are five of ten shades that are now available. Blue Flame is a rich navy blue over a blue-black base. When it’s used dry, the black base is more prevalent, while when it is used damp, the blue sheen comes out. MAC Naval Blue is bluer with a lighter base. MAC Shop & Drop is similar but has a subtler sheen. MAC Blue Storm is bluer with a lighter base. Cinderfella is a brown-black with a silver-gray shimmer. When it is applied dry, it has a chalkier, sheerer look that makes it appear more muted, but when it is applied damp, it appears smoother, more intense, and the black stands out. Chanel Mirifique is the only dupe that comes to mind, though it is a bit different. Gilt by Association is a rich, dark olive brown with olive gold shimmer. Again, when it is applied dry, it has a softer, slightly muted look, but when it is applied damp, it looks much more intense and the metallic sheen comes to the forefront. MAC Golden Gaze is yellower and more golden. I couldn’t think of any other dupes. Smutty Green is a blackened-green base with green and dirty green shimmer. It has rather sheer, uneven color payoff when used dry, but it comes together better when applied wet. It seems awfully similar to MAC She Who Dares , perhaps with more black in it. Make Up For Ever #10 is similar in tone, but it’s not nearly as dark. Young Punk is a blackened-purple base with pink-toned purple shimmer and sheen. When it is applied dry, it looks like a sheer, chalky black with purple shimmer, but when it is applied damp, it looks much more purple and the metallic sheen comes forth. Urban Decay Rockstar is kind of similar but more eggplant-hued. Giorgio Armani #2 has a similar black base but has pink and red shimmer. I wish I could say this latest batch of Mineralize Eyeshadows was new and improved, but I still had issues with color staying true throughout the day and fall out both during and post-application. The textures of the shades that have been out previously did seem softer, smoother, so the color payoff was better overall. Even when I apply Mineralize Eyeshadows damp/wet and over a primer, the colors look faded after a few hours and any shade with shimmer or sparkles leads to fall out throughout the day. I did a test look using Gilt by Association and Smutty Green , and my under eye area looked like a disco ball.

"['Renee Rouleau Skin Drink Serum Review, Photos Sample Reviews Jun 11, 2011 June 11, 2011 Renee Rouleau Skin Drink Renee Rouleau Skin Drink There is something to be said about trying a multitude of products from a variety of brands, because it gives you a better appreciation for the qualities that make products great, good, just okay, and skippable. I originally reviewed Renee Rouleau’s Skin Drink ($33.50 for 0.50 oz.) back in 2008, but I’m reviewing it again here today after recently testing it. Skin Drink is a serum with hyaluronic acid, which is supposed to hydrate the skin. This is actually a product I keep in my carry-on for flying, because I find it so lightweight, refreshing, and effective in a short period that it works well for traveling. It also includes allantoin, which is a botanical extract with supposed calming properties. It feels like a cross between water and a gel; it’s nowhere near as thick as a gel, but it’s not quite like water. I use two pumps for my face, and depending on how dry my skin is, I might use it in the morning or evening. I use it before and after traveling, and I find that my skin reacts much less to changes in climate since adding this to my travel routine. The serum smoothes across the skin easily and absorbs instantly–no greasiness, burning or stinging sensations. It’s gentle and soothing, and it helps my skin get through winter when a moisturizer I’m testing out isn’t cutting it.

Studying several different art forms, Hunter’s creative background ranges from illustration and photography to fashion and interior design to music production and makeup artistry. He has worked for over a decade as a professional illustrator and his retail interior design concepts have been featured in nation-wide publications, receiving recognition for their uniqueness and creativity. Check out his blog and YouTube channel ! My Most Embarrassing Moments in Fashion and Beauty With every decade comes a birth of something… unnatural. An exaggeration of something that was once cool, twisted and warped into something truly horrific: massive shoulder pads and razor-sharp blush, “Hammer” pants (which is even embarrassing to type), and the HUGE wall o’ bangs fringe, platform Mary Janes and–one of my favorite love-to-hate moments–the Bobbi Brown look of the 90s. I actually experienced TWO trendy-at-the-time flashbacks recently. One of them, I am sad to report, was entirely my own doing. I had requested a specific haircut from my stylist (shaved on the sides and long on the top) that would allow me to style a nice pompadour, which looked great, except on the days when I didn’t style it, and I looked like Nick Carter from the Backstreet Boys circa 1998. Later on, during that week of bad decisions, I also began sifting through the boxes in my attic (re-organizing and making room for new piles of crap that I have decided I cannot part with but no longer want in my immediate vicinity) where I stumbled upon a relic from the Flintstones era: actual photographs! On paper! That’s when I noticed the hair. “Wow… that looks a lot like my hair right now,” I thought to myself as I looked over a photo of me from the late 90s. Flash forward a couple more Kodak envelopes and a few more years, and there it was: a wonderful gem of me with spiked hair (bleached tips of course) wearing one of those silver beaded necklaces that we all thought were somehow… good? Aye, I had my share of skater shoes and tight shirts (some with Lycra even), baggy pants and wallet chains, silver rings, and those bizarre necklaces. I would even routinely shave off all seven of my chest hairs in an attempt to look more like a model from an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog! Why?! Because I thought it was cool, that’s why! And no one ever thought to tell me otherwise. It made me wonder… what fashion and beauty trend will be next? What offensive thing am I wearing RIGHT now that will haunt me years later? Wait… hang on–my low-rise pants are riding a little too low and people are looking at me funny while I’m typing. What are your worst or funniest memories in fashion and beauty? Any trends that you actually miss and would love to see make a come-back?

The closest dupe I could think of was Zoya Tracie , which has subtle metallic shimmer running through it. It’s also a little yellower. Barielle Myrza’s Meadow is also a bit similar, though a touch lighter, and it has multi-colored flecks of sparkle. I love the yellow component to this, because it keeps it from being a cool, minty green that screams winter to me; the warmth gives it the freshness of springtime to me. Navigate Her was opaque in two coats. The initial coat was a little streaky, but it was opaque and even with the second coat. It had a well-balanced consistency that was neither too thick or too thin, so it applied fluidly and evenly without pooling or bubbling. I tested Navigate Her for wear, and it managed a full seven days without chipping and had minimal tip wear at the end of the week. 10 13 Navigate Her 10 13 Navigate Her A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Ulta Selfridges Amazon DermStore Target Kohl's Priceline FeelUnique Beauty Brands 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9.5 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total Read Full Review""]",ae0b0add28e71de6a39daed50611271a3d3d0596,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tag/essie-navigate-her-nail-lacquer/,['2012-04-09 00:00:00']

It’s a green-teal with lots of metallic shimmer that is opaque in two coats. I could see this leaning a little tealer on cooler complexions, but against my warmer complexion, I can see the green in it. I went hunting for dupes, but I could not find anything that’s quite like this in products I’ve reviewed. China Glaze Mistletoe Kisses is so green in comparison, while Zoya Bevin is lighter, not as intense, and has no shimmer. It’s like I saw hints of Chimera in other shades, but nothing came close enough. I like the recent bottle change–it’s very sleek, and the benefit to this type of packaging is they store really efficiently and easily. You can still see the color along the “shoulders” of the bottle when they’re standing up, which is great. This had a thinner consistency than I’m used to, but it still applied opaque in two coats, and while it seemed a touch watery, it wasn’t runny. It applied evenly and easily, and the metallic shimmer made dry down quicker than regular shimmer/cream polishes.

"['Burberry Lipstick in Hibiscus (20) Affiliate Links Reviews Jul 30, 2010 July 30, 2010 Burberry Hibiscus Lipstick Burberry Hibiscus (20) Lipstick ($30.00 for 0.13 oz.) is an intense shade of ruby red–though more red than ruby, I’d say! When I was picking out three lipsticks to purchase, I thought Hibiscus might be a deep pink, rather than red, but it’s most certainly in the red family. There is a very subtle shimmer strewn through the color, but it’s not obvious nor is the end result shimmery in the least bit. Burberry has created a solid lipstick formula–it’s creamy without being thick or slippery, and it’s moisturizing without sliding off in an hour. I picked only bold shades by chance, and Hibiscus was very rich and looked nearly opaque on my lips. It applied smoothly, evenly, and didn’t bleed on my lips (but very few lipsticks do). Being such a deep shade, it wore well–four hours and then left a stain behind. Each lipstick has an embellished check pattern on the lipstick itself, as well as the same gunmetal, check-covered packaging that the other Burberry Bauty products have. The lipstick has a magnetic closure, and I was rather amused by how the lipstick would spin into place, no matter how you slipped the lid back on–just drop the lid on and it will swivel into place!

"['Urban Decay Feminine Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Feb 10, 2011 February 10, 2011 Feminine Palette : Stray Dog, SWF, Midnight Cowboy, Aquarius, Darkhorse, Ecstacy Urban Decay Spring 2011: Feminine Palette Urban Decay Feminine Eyeshadow Palette ($34.00 for 0.34 oz.) includes six eyeshadows: Stray Dog (cool medium brown), SWF (light cotton candy pink with silver micro-glitter), Midnight Cowboy (pink champagne with lots of silver glitter), Aquarius (aqua green with shimmer), Darkhorse (bronze patina), and Ecstacy (bright purple with slight pink tint). Also included is Zero 24/7 Liner (black) and Eden primer potion (nude). Stray Dog is a cool-toned, taupe-tinged dark brown with a frost finish. This shade is part of the permanent range and available individually; it has also been in the Foreshadow palette. SWF is a pale cotton candy pink with a bright metallic-frost sheen. This shade is part of the permanent range and available individually. Midnight Cowboy is a gilded champagne bronze with flecks of champagne glitter. It has less fall out than Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, but it still has plenty of it to make one frustrated. This shade is part of the permanent range and available individually; it was also in the Cowboy Junkie set. Aquarius is a pale aqua green teal with a silver metallic sheen. This shade is part of the permanent range and available individually. Darkhorse is a darkened deep chocolate brown with flecks of bronze. This shade was in the Naked palette and is not available individually. Ecstacy is a brightened, medium cool-toned violet purple with a soft frost finish. This shade is part of the permanent range and available individually; it was also in the Book of Shadows, Vol. 2. By the by, marginally annoyed that ecstasy is misspelled–imagine it was deliberate but find it annoying nonetheless! It is spelled correctly in the actual BoS Vol. 2, though… my thoughts on the formula: Urban Decay’s eyeshadows are rich in pigment, apply evenly, and feel like butter. Generally speaking, their formula is excellent. I will warn and caution you against their shades with “glitter” or “sparkle” in the finish–some of these can be prone to fall out (for example, Midnight Cowboy Rides Again). In terms of value, the palette includes 0.18 oz. of eyeshadow ($61.20 value), 0.03 oz. of eyeliner ($12.75 value), and 0.13 fl. oz. of primer potion ($6.88 value). The total value of the palette is $80.83, while the retail price is $34. I think sometimes we lose sight of what the beauty industry and market are like as a whole — not every person purchases every palette or even much at all. Not everyone enters at the same time, so even though you may find yourself owning many of the shades, it doesn’t make it a terrible product – Urban Decay does some really excellent shades that you can get year round, but these sure make those shades more accessible and affordable to people who don’t have a lot of Urban Decay or have always wanted to try it. It would be great to see new shades, of course, but I recognize what value they may hold to others . If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 28/30 Value : 10/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 final thoughts: In this palette, only Midnight Cowboy is the finicky shade, while five of the six are lovely. Only Darkhorse is not available individually, but at least a couple shades here haven’t been in half a dozen palettes previously. As long as you love at least two shades (and like one or two others), then it works out to be a deal, since two eyeshadows will run you $34 if purchased individually. where to buy: Urban Decay Feminine Palette : Stray Dog, SWF, Midnight Cowboy, Aquarius, Darkhorse, Ecstacy Urban Decay Feminine Palette Urban Decay Feminine Palette Urban Decay Feminine Palette Urban Decay Feminine Palette Urban Decay Feminine Palette Urban Decay Feminine Palette Urban Decay Feminine Palette Urban Decay Feminine Palette Urban Decay Feminine Palette Feminine Palette : Stray Dog, SWF, Midnight Cowboy, Aquarius, Darkhorse, Ecstacy Feminine Palette : Stray Dog, SWF, Midnight Cowboy, Feminine Palette : Aquarius, Darkhorse, Ecstacy Urban Decay Eden Primer Potion Zero, Ransom (not included)']",ac5c1f1f29f7120d3c42d8e6e098bedd179ef336,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/urban-decay-feminine-palette-review-photos-swatches/,['2011-02-10 00:00:00']

It’s lovely and all things pretty, but at the end of the day, it’s one of those shades that every brand seems to have some iteration of. Some are pinker, some are more coral, and others are more orange. They’re often more universally flattering, and coral blushes are always sought after. I like having options, and there is always room for another coral blush in my heart, I can tell you that! Tarte’s variation is gorgeous on the skin, though it wears seven to eight hours on me, which is about average for blushes (definitely not the 12 hours the brand claims). The texture is fairly soft, though not quite as soft as their non-shimmery shades. It has nice blendability, and the way it lies on the skin looks natural.

It’s a luxurious texture–so soft and smooth and almost feels like velvet. This is a product that lives up to its claims–it wears all day without budging, creasing, or fading–and blends as well on its own as it does with other eyeshadows (or on top of an eyeshadow base). Giorgio Armani describes the Eyes to Kill Intense formula as neither powder nor cream but a hybrid that creates a “smooth, lasting color film” that can be applied wet or dry. Giorgio Armani explains, “Each shade is intensified with a second pigment for a multi-dimensional effect. In just one swoop, create a wet, shimmering smokey eye … Base color covers eyelid, and second pigment adds drama to the contour.” The texture of these feels almost like a cream eyeshadow, but it has the thinness of a powder eyeshadow while retaining some of the blendability of the hybrid cream-powder eyeshadow. It also works well with other eyeshadow ( see this look using #6 ). The intensity is insane–whether you use it wet or dry, they pretty much look the same. It’s almost like a really dense loose powder that’s been pressed down, because if you dig at it, it loosens. Though pricey, each shade comes with 0.14 oz. worth of product, which is a hefty amount (normal eyeshadow averages around 0.05 oz., no matter the price). The only aspect I didn’t love was the little black stopper inside the jar (once you unscrew the black lid), because my longer fingers felt awkward grabbing it (so I just unscrew it upside down so it falls into the cap). 82 2 #2 82 2 #2 A+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Harrods Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) Giorgio Armani Beauty (Canada) Beauty Brands Giorgio Armani Beauty 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 100% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

When I saw Maybelline use this during Fashion Week in February, it looked like it might be a dupe for Chanel Dragon . It’s not a dupe, though they’re both blue-based reds with deeper ruby tones, so there are definitely similarities worth noting. MAC Runaway Red is a touch brighter and less blue-based. MAC Ruby Woo is cooler toned. Guerlain Garconne is more of a neutral red in comparison. The Color Sensational range is supposed to deliver rich color with a creamy consistency. While their frostier finishes have a tendency to cling, the subtler finish of Very Cherry allows the formula to shine–it’s much creamier, so it applies evenly, easily, and doesn’t cling. It’s creamy but overly so, which means it doesn’t feel thick or heavy on the lips, and it won’t slip around while you wear it–this leads to excellent wear of six hours that can be stretched to eight hours as the red does stain the lips slightly. The scent of this range is rather synthetic and syrup-y sweet, which is the quality I like least about the formula, but the scent seems to disappear after six months of opening (without having to do anything). 73 7 Very Cherry 73 7 Very Cherry A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Drugstore.com Ulta Amazon Target Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Priceline Boots FeelUnique 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Guerlain Ombre Fusion Cream Eyeshadows Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jun 10, 2011 June 10, 2011 Guerlain Ombre Fusion Cream Eyeshadow: Bahia, Havana, Maya Guerlain Terra Inca Collection: Ombre Fusions Guerlain Ombre Fusion Cream Eyeshadows ($35.00 for 0.20 fl. oz.) are new for summer and come in three varieties. Guerlain claims they are heat and water-resistant that “will last from dawn to dusk.” Each shadow is housed in a square glass tube with a metal cap–the packaging is very reminiscent of lipgloss, even down to the doe-footed applicator. The packaging is a good mix of functionality and aesthetic appeal, but the glass makes these less portable. Bahia is a soft pinked peach with very fine gold micro-shimmer. This is definitely wear-and-go kind of shade; perfect as a brightening wash of color on the lid. Havana is a chocolatey khaki brown with olive green and gold micro-shimmer. Of the three, this is the most unique, as the color shifts from chocolate bronze to olive to khaki. Maya is a medium-dark bronzy brown with red undertone and gold and copper micro-shimmer. Depending on how much product you apply, you can get a sheerer layer of color or something richer and more opaque. Guerlain mentions an “illuminated effect” and “shimmering reflections.” I swatched both heavily and very lightly to show how sheer it could be blended out, if desired. It’s really all in the application of the user–a little goes a long way. Bahia was the one shade that I found took real layering to achieve a more opaque look, so I would describe Bahia as semi-sheer to semi-opaque, while the others are semi-opaque to opaque–all depending on how much product you choose to apply. They’ll go on more opaque generally, just because so little is required for a sheer effect that you have to be deliberate about how little you use. The texture of these is a very thin cream; I would consider them more liquid than cream, because they have the feel and spread of a thicker liquid. It enables these to blend effortlessly onto the lid, whether you use a brush or fingertip, but they act far more like a cream eyeshadow from there on. These dry down at just the right pace; not so quick that you rush to get it in place or so slow that it builds into creases. Once it set, it stayed on for twelve hours with no creasing, fading, or smudging. I took a hot shower while wearing Havana on the lid to no noticeable decrease in wear–it didn’t crease, and it didn’t disappear. I just patted my face dry with a towel, and it looked the same pre- and post-shower.

"[""Inglot Pearl Eyeshadows in #423, 452, 450, 399, 431 (Reds/Pinks) Reviews Jun 12, 2011 June 12, 2011 Inglot Pearl Eyeshadows in #423, 452, 450, 399, 431 Today, I wanted to take a look at a few of Inglot’s Pearl Eyeshadows ($4.50 to $7.00 each for 0.09 oz.). The Pearl Eyeshadows have a very fine shimmer with a brighter, pearly sheen. The pearl finish is probably my favorite of Inglot’s finishes, because it has the right mix of color payoff and texture. It’s soft, smooth, and very blendable. All of the shades featured in this post applied beautifully; really intense color delivered in a silky smooth formula. For the most part, the shimmer was incredibly fine and the sheen pearled. 423 is a smoldering burgundy-tinged brown with a pearl finish. 452 is a medium-dark burgundy-red with a pearl finish. It reminded me of MAC Cranberry. 450 is a medium-dark raspberry pink with a pearl finish. 399 is a muted, played down pink with a little mauve and in a pearl finish. 431 is a light, pastel pink with a bright, frosted white sheen. It is a pearl finish, but I found the sheen more metallic than pearly with this shade. When I decided that I would work through Inglot’s eyeshadow line and swatch through it, 20-pan palettes were the largest available, so that is what I went with. I like symmetry, so I’ll be sticking with those sizes. The 20-pan palette is a little larger than my hand–the palette measures 6 3/4? x 6?. The palette is sturdy and hefty with strong magnets to keep the eyeshadows locked in place along with the frosted lid, which is also held on by magnets. My biggest issue with the strength of the magnets is that it’s difficult to move the pans around once you’ve placed them in there. I have to use tweezers and be very, very careful around the edge (there is just not much room to work). You can use the magnetic part of the lid to remove, but for me, my hands are too shaky to do that. Pricing might seem confusing at first — if you intend to purchase a palette, then the pans are $7.00 each for 1-2, $5.00 each for 3-9, and $4.50 each if you purchase 10 or more. Online, you’re able to purchase as much or as little as you want, while in-store you have to fill whatever palette you purchase (which can be frustrating if you want to keep your finishes separate!). I did notice, though, if you intend to purchase more than one palette, you’ll end up paying the full price of the second palette and get no discount for filling it when you buy online. If you did this in-store, you would still get the discounted price of the palette ($5.00). Shipping is free both online and in-store for purchases over $150. You can also purchase the eyeshadows individually in round pots for $12.00 each. Both the pans and the pots contain 0.09 oz. of product. The palettes range from 2-pan to 20-pan online, but 40-pan palettes are available in-store. I expect the online store to eventually carry the 40-pan palettes in the next month or so. If you purchase in-store, be prepared to lay out $185 for a filled 40-pan palette.

"['Urban Decay Dangerous Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Feb 10, 2011 February 10, 2011 Dangerous Palette : Haight, Mildew, Virgin, Oil Slick, Rockstar, Gunmetal Urban Decay Spring 2011: Dangerous Palette Urban Decay Dangerous Eyeshadow Palette ($34.00 for 0.34 oz.) includes six eyeshadows: Haight (dark teal with shimmer), Mildew (deep green), Virgin (satin chamois), Oil Slick (black with silver glitter), Rockstar (deep red-purple with metallic base), and Gunmetal (gunmetal gray with silver glitter). Also included is Rockstar 24/7 Liner (eggplant) and Greed primer potion (gold). Edited @ 7:10AM: Images are fixed. Haight is a brightened medium blue with a frost finish that pulls just an itsy bit teal. This shade is part of the permanent range and available individually, and it also appeared in the Book of Shadows, Vol. 3. Mildew is a rich olive green with dirty bronze-brown lying underneath the richer green sheen. This shade is part of the permanent range and available individually and has appeared in the Show Pony, Preen, and Ammo palettes. Virgin is a pale beige with a satin-shimmer finish. It’s very, very light, but it’s such a beautiful neutral. It’s a little frosty for a highlighter, particularly on darker skin tones, but it would make for a great all-over wash or pop of light on the inner tear duct. This shade was in the Naked palette and not available individually. Oil Slick is a rich, deep black with silver glitter. The glitter is more of an overlay, so there will be fall out. It’s not as bad as ultra glittery shades like Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, but the fall out does occur. This shade is part of the permanent range and available individually and has appeared in the Alice in Wonderland, Ammo, and Sustainable palettes. Rockstar is a deep shade of eggplant purple with burgundy-red undertones and a shimmer-sheen finish. This shade was in the Book of Shadows, Vol. 3 and not available individually. Gunmetal is a dark gray with a deep silver sheen. Despite the glittre in the pan, it seems to disappear before you even apply it. I’ve had this shade for awhile, and I don’t find fall out to be an issue. This shade is part of the permanent range and available individually, and it has been in the Book of Shadows, Vol.2, Naked, and Vegan palettes. my thoughts on the formula: Urban Decay’s eyeshadows are rich in pigment, apply evenly, and feel like butter. Generally speaking, their formula is excellent. I will warn and caution you against their shades with “glitter” or “sparkle” in the finish–some of these can be prone to fall out (for example, Midnight Cowboy Rides Again). In terms of value, the palette includes 0.18 oz. of eyeshadow ($61.20 value), 0.03 oz. of eyeliner ($12.75 value), and 0.13 fl. oz. of primer potion ($6.88 value). The total value of the palette is $80.83, while the retail price is $34. I think sometimes we lose sight of what the beauty industry and market are like as a whole — not every person purchases every palette or even much at all. Not everyone enters at the same time, so even though you may find yourself owning many of the shades, it doesn’t make it a terrible product – Urban Decay does some really excellent shades that you can get year round, but these sure make those shades more accessible and affordable to people who don’t have a lot of Urban Decay or have always wanted to try it. It would be great to see new shades, of course, but I recognize what value they may hold to others . If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 27/30 Value : 10/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 final thoughts: Dangerous has shades we have all seen before, but ultimately, whether it’s a good value/purchase depends on just how many Urban Decay products you have in your arsenal. The palette itself is an excellent value, and if you like more than two shadows, it works out to be the same if you had bought then individually ($17 each). Oil Slick has a slightly fussy finish/texture, but the other five eyeshadows are really nice, especially Haight and Rockstar. where to buy: Urban Decay Urban Decay Dangerous Palette Urban Decay Dangerous Palette Urban Decay Dangerous Palette Urban Decay Dangerous Palette Urban Decay Dangerous Palette Dangerous Palette : Haight, Mildew, Virgin, Oil Slick, Rockstar, Gunmetal Dangerous Palette : Haight, Mildew, Virgin, Oil Slick, Rockstar, Gunmetal Urban Decay Dangerous Palette Urban Decay Dangerous Palette Urban Decay Dangerous Palette Dangerous Palette : Haight, Mildew, Virgin, Oil Slick, Rockstar, Gunmetal Dangerous Palette : Haight, Mildew, Virgin Dangerous Palette : Oil Slick, Rockstar, Gunmetal Urban Decay Greed Primer Potion Rockstar, 1999, Ransom, Lust (just Rockstar is included)']",39489d57f06790f8d6f744d5b254a7ebd4b6df7c,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/urban-decay-dangerous-palette-review-photos-swatches/,['2011-02-10 00:00:00']

"['Nubar Prisms Collection Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews May 18, 2010 May 18, 2010 Nubar Prisms Collection Nubar Prisms Collection ($59.95 for 8 shades) is a springtime release that features eight shades of holographic nail polish. These polishes do something fantastic when the light hits them and when your hands are in movement, so the flash photos best show-off the holographic effect when it comes to these holos. The formula on these varied quite a bit–some were thin, some were more jelly-esque in thickness–but they all dried on the quicker side for me. The majority of these were also on the sheer side, though, and I did three coats for nearly all of the shades here. Even with three coats, there was still some nail line showing, which doesn’t bother me that much since it’s hardly noticeable at a distance–just up-close. I’d also recommend a thicker top coat, because the majority of these do have a slightly gritty or noticeably uneven finish if left without a top coat! According to Nubar… Inspired by the colorful play of light through a prism, those bands of light and color are embodied in nubar’s Prism Collection. Each shade in the Prism Collection is filled with holographic glitter reflecting every color of the rainbow, with base colors just as varied, ranging from subtle neutrals to vivid pink to pale blue. Going a step beyond holographic nail lacquers, nubar’s Prism Collection is a celebration of color and light. As all nubar products, they are free of formaldehyde, toluene, and (DBP) phthalate, as well as vegan and cruelty free. Prize is a pinked red with holographic shimmer–lots of gold and purple stood out in this one. I needed just two coats here, and it applied smoothly and evenly. Essence is a metallic played down pink with holographic shimmer. This one came out a bit chunky, though it’s wearable, and I did see some brush strokes. Just two coats, though. Absolute is an aqua-blue with a holographic finish. With this one, you don’t really notice the effect until it’s out in the light–normal, indoor light just makes it look like silver shimmer. I found this one was a little on the sheer side–I used three coats and could still see some nail line. Treasure is a medium purple with red undertones and a subtle holographic effect. Like Absolute, it didn’t quite get to total opaqueness with three coats. Brilliant is a pretty in pink shade with holographic glitter strewn through it. It’s not completely solid color after three coats, but it comes close. Gem is a taupe gray with holographic glitter–it comes out a little murky and dark and forboding. The green and teal glitter really pop in this shade. Three coats here as well. Spark is a just slightly warmed up light brown with holographic glitter. I love the texture and feel of this one. Three coats and it looked pretty solid. Jewel is a deep, molten chocolate brown with holographic glitter. Like Gem, the green and teal glitter seem to pop. It has the chunkier texture of Essence, though. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 26/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : If you like softer color for your nails but still want the bling bling look of holographic glitter, you might enjoy the Prisms collection. If you’re more inclined towards brighter or more opaque shades, you’ll want to look at some of Nubar’s other shades.

It delivers good color coverage in a single pass, and it doesn’t pull or tug at the lash line during application. The consistency is creamy and soft, so it glides on easily across the lash line and water line. While some brown eyeliners are a softer alternative to black, the depth of this shade makes it nearly as powerful as a soft black eyeliner. CoverGirl Brown is similar, but not quite as intense. Estee Lauder has been putting out a lot of new products with impressive formulas, and the Intense Kajal Eyeliner is no exception. The creamy glide, rich color payoff, and long-wear make this a winner. It wears five and a half hours on my lower water line but lasts for up to ten hours on my lower lash line–there’s no fading, smudging, or migrating during those ten hours either! 14 5 Blackened Cocoa 14 5 Blackened Cocoa A+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Macy's Harrods Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) LookFantastic Boots Bloomingdale's FeelUnique bluemercury Sephora (PL) Estee Lauder Dillard's 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 100% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Inglot Pearl Eyeshadows in #397, 407, 393, 395 (Oranges/Peaches) Reviews Jun 12, 2011 June 12, 2011 Inglot #397 Inglot Pearl Eyeshadows in #397, 407, 393, 395 (Oranges) These are some of the more orange/peach shades from Inglot’s Pearl Eyeshadow ($4.50 to $7.00 each for 0.09 oz.) range. I wish Inglot would add color descriptions for their eyeshadows online, because I think it would enhance the buying experience and–at the very least–give us some indication of what to expect! Inglot’s Pearl Eyeshadows have a very fine shimmer with a brighter, pearly sheen. The pearl finish is probably my favorite of Inglot’s finishes, because it has the right mix of color payoff and texture. It’s soft, smooth, and very blendable. These four shades are true-to-formula, though I did find that #393 and 395 were much lighter swatched than they appeared in the pan. 397 is a warm, peachy beige with a pearl finish. 407 is a orange-coral with peachy gold sheen with a pearl finish. It’s like a much more orange version of NARS Orgasm or MAC Melon pigment. This shade has more dimension than the majority of Inglot’s line, just because it’s more of a mix of two colors. It is one of my favorite shades I’ve swatched thus far! 393 is a pale yellowed peach with a pearl finish. It looks more orange in the pan, but when swatched, it’s much yellower. It has a very noticeable white sheen, which is what seems to give it that lighter, more yellowed look. 395 is the palest of orange, because it has a high white shimmer/sheen so it looks really, really light. It’s more like white with a hint of peach-orange. Like #393, it looks more orange in the pan. For more information about pricing, please check out this post .

"[""Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 10, 2011 April 10, 2011 Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer (clockwise, from the top: Warm Beige, Natural, Natural Tan Hiding Shadows with Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer Kit ($32.00 for 0.11 oz.) is a launch of a familiar product–but it’s been tweaked and improved. They made the formula more concentrated–a little goes a long way–so you can something more opaque. It’s also less creamy, so it won’t settle fine lines. The shade range (both the concealers and correctors) was also been improved so they would match each person better. The compact was designed to be small and made that way for portability. This review is just for the Creamy Concealer–Bobbi Brown also has a Corrector (which I will review later), but if you want to go for the full arsenal, it is best to apply the color correcting product first, followed by the concealer, and finally set it with powder. I received three shades to test: Warm Beige, Natural, and Natural Tan. In the past, I’ve used the Light-to-Medium Tint of Bobbi Brown’s Tinted Moisturizing Balm, and both Beige and Warm Beige are recommended–but I’m definitely on edge of Light-to-Medium (Medium was only a touch too dark). Honestly, swatching the three together showed just how subtly each would change. Warm Beige definitely has those warm, yellow tones but it has a beigeness to it that isn’t as apparent in Natural, which almost seems lighter than Warm Beige (but yellower). Similarly, Natural Tan is a shade darker than Natural, but it starts to look almost orange on my skin (because it’s not a shade match). I settled on Warm Beige as my match, and I think it worked out well. It added some warmth to my under eye area, which has some shadowing from tired eyes. There are fourteen shades (ranging from Porcelain to Chestnut) to choose from in the Creamy Concealer range. All of the concealer kits, except Porcelain (which includes a White Powder) are paired with a Pale Yellow Powder. Bobbi Brown also put a step-by-step guide and video on their website . There is also an excellent shade guide for how to match the Corrector and Creamy Concealer shades, which I thought was well-done and helpful. I really liked the Creamy Concealer, which had a smooth, creamy consistency that applied opaquely and blended out easily. It was creamy without being like butter; there was some stiffness to it that enabled it to stay in place and instantly settle into fine lines. It is rather opaque but blends out slightly, though it seems like a heavier concealer overall. I did experience some creasing after five hours when I did not set it with powder at all; if I set it with powder (Bobbi Brown’s or something else), it lasted all day (twelve hours). I wasn’t won over by the Pale Yellow powder, though. It does help set the concealer, but I felt that it did seem to be too dry (or perhaps, not fine enough) of a powder to work well for my under eye area. It also kicked up a lot of powdery dust every time I went to use, and I didn’t like how some of the excess powder migrated into the concealer well. The kit is $32, while the concealer on its own is $22, but the concealer in the kit is 0.05 oz. while individually it is 0.06 oz. The included Pale Yellow powder is 0.06 oz., which is also available on its own at $34 for 0.38 oz. The value of the kit is $18.33 worth of concealer and $5.37 worth of powder–a total value of only $23.70. If you tote your concealer around regularly, perhaps the convenience aspect will be worth the $9 you pay to have them together, but it’s a rather hefty convenience charge. I will also concede that you cannot buy the powder for less than $34 on its own (since it doesn’t come in such a small size individually). I will note that online it states that there is 0.21 oz. worth of product, but the back of my compact says 0.05 and 0.06 oz. (and the size of the pan is the same as the individual ones).

"[""Tarina Tarantino Jasper/Agate Eye Dream Highlight Duo Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 22, 2012 March 22, 2012 Tarina Tarantino Jasper/Agate Eye Dream Highlight Duo Tarina Tarantino Jasper/Agate Eye Dream Highlight Duo ($19.00 for 0.26 oz.) is described as a “soft golden beige” and “muted light fawn.” The compact doesn’t seem too large, though it’s certainly bigger than most eyeshadow duo compacts, but each eyeshadow is over twice the size of your average full-sized eyeshadow at a whopping 0.13 oz. each. I can’t envision running out of either shade in a hurry! Jasper is a warm, yellowy beige with a frosted finish. The color payoff is good (even better on the eye, though still good in the skin swatch), and the texture is soft, smooth, and very blendable. Cle de Peau #207 is slightly pinker, less yellow. Urban Decay Skimp is less yellow, more beige. theBalm Hiii-Yaaa! is less yellow, more peach. Agate is a light-medium brown with warm undertones and a frosted finish. It has the same soft, smooth texture I’ve come to expect from the brand, along with good pigmentation. MAC Arena is similar but a little darker. MAC Sweet Satisfaction is similar, a little less frosted. Chanel Eclosion has a slight pink tinge to it. MAC Grain is similar in color but not frosted. Undoubtedly, this is a straight-forward eyeshadow duo–it’s not particularly unique or inspiring, but it is extremely useful for anyone who reaches for neutrals often. I think of all duos/palettes, the neutral ones tend to be the most successful, because they’re easy to use and versatile. I absolutely love Tarina Tarantino’s eyeshadow formula–it is one of the best on the market–so having go-to neutrals with such amazing textures is worth having. It’s not a must-have if you rarely wear neutrals or have a ton already, but if there’s a gap of neutrals in your stash, this is worth checking out. Without a base, these two wore for eight hours without creasing/fading but did have some slight fading after ten hours. With a primer, I didn’t have any issues.

The finish is a soft frost, and I didn’t have any of the texture issues with Cherry Blossom that I had with Mitsouko . Guerlain’s description of the Rouge Automatique line describes the color as non-opaque, light, and luminous, so while this may be on the sheerer side, it still seems in line with the range–it definitely gave a visible color difference when worn, but this shade seems to embody what Guerlain described as “luminous, clear and pure color.” ( Nothing in Guerlain’s description of the new formula would make me think these are rich, pigmented lipsticks. ) my thoughts on the formula: Rouge Automatique lipsticks tend to have a very creamy, smooth consistency without being thick (in fact, I’d describe them as thin). They glide on with ease, and the majority of shades seem to deposit semi-opaque to opaque color. Wear for darker shades ranges from six to eight hours, while light to medium shades from four to six hours. It’s an excellent alternative to the luxury Rouge G lipstick–the formulas are comparable (and certainly so with a $11 price difference!), while the packaging gives up the luxury heft of Rouge G, it makes up for in the practicality. It’s a creamy, moisturizing, long-wearing formula with the subtle nuances and finishes I expect from Guerlain. 11 7 Cherry Blossom 11 7 Cherry Blossom B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Cosbar Escentual Sephora (PL) Dillard's 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

You can go as heavy or as light as you want, but it often looks subtler because most of the time your eyes are open–so it just peeks out. I’m so anxious for final samples of Jealousy Wakes, because I want to swatch it against Black Emerald (which is definitely darker), but I think they could make a nice gradient of color. You will need the following… Eyes : NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base (primer), Le Metier de Beaute Blonde Amber Eyeshadow (wheat gold), Le Metier de Beaute Bronze Topaz Eyeshadow (bronze), Le Metier de Beaute Black Emerald Eyeshadow (blackened emerald green), Make Up For Ever #20L Aqua Eyes Liner (forest green), Hourglass Film Noir Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Guerlain Les Violettes Mineral Powder (03) Cheeks : theBalm Betty Lou-Manizer (golden bronze) Lips : Bobbi Brown Pink Tulle High Shimmer Lipgloss (multi-color shimmered coral) Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 222 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pencil brush), 188 (small, circular stippling brush) For eyes, start by applying Smudgeproof all over the lid and above the crease with the 242 to lay down your eyeshadow base. Layer Blonde Amber eyeshadow all over the lower lid with the 239. Then, apply Black Emerald eyeshadow into the outer crease, bringing it just over halfway into the crease with the 222. Next, apply Bronze Topaz eyeshadow lightly on the outer third of the lid with the 239. Apply Blonde Amber eyeshadow very lightly on the brow bone to highlight with the 239. Next, apply #20 liner on the lower lash line, and then smudge with Blonde Amber eyeshadow . Coat lashes with Film Noir mascara to finish the look. For cheeks, apply Betty Lou-Manizer on the apples of the cheeks and sweep towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Pink Tulle lipgloss for a complementing lip.

NARS Christina is redder and has a golden shimmer. Guerlain Rose Bengale is slightly brighter and has pale pink shimmer. MAC Red Dwarf is more berry, less pink. MAC Positively Dashing is slightly darker and pinker. MAC Deliciously Forbidden is brighter and pinker. Hourglass Nocturnal is very similar but a little redder. Dior Ruby is a touch darker. MAC Offshoot is browner. MAC Craving is very similar. Maybelline Bit of Berry is a little lighter and pinker. As you can see, there are numerous shades that are similar to this one; some shades are a little redder, others are a bit pinker, and a few are fairly close. Casablanca has good color coverage, as it applied opaque and hides my lip freckle quite well. It has a creamy, smooth consistency that enables it to glide on evenly and easily. Even though it has opaque color and a creamy feel, it doesn’t sit heavily on the lips. It’s comfortable to wear, and it wears well–a solid five hours–while lightly moisturizing the lips. Tom Ford’s lipstick range is vanilla-scented but doesn’t have any discernible taste. It comes in a square tube with gold metal accents and brown “paneling” on the exterior of the tube. I like that the outer tube doesn’t hold fingerprints, and there’s a satisfying click when you close the lipstick, so it stays together better if you toss it around in a bag.

You will need the following… Eyes : NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base (primer), Le Metier de Beaute Blonde Amber Eyeshadow (wheat gold), Le Metier de Beaute Bronze Topaz Eyeshadow (bronze), Le Metier de Beaute Black Emerald Eyeshadow (blackened emerald green), Make Up For Ever #20L Aqua Eyes Liner (forest green), Hourglass Film Noir Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Guerlain Les Violettes Mineral Powder (03) Cheeks : theBalm Betty Lou-Manizer (golden bronze) Lips : Bobbi Brown Pink Tulle High Shimmer Lipgloss (multi-color shimmered coral) Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 222 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pencil brush), 188 (small, circular stippling brush) For eyes, start by applying Smudgeproof all over the lid and above the crease with the 242 to lay down your eyeshadow base. Layer Blonde Amber eyeshadow all over the lower lid with the 239. Then, apply Black Emerald eyeshadow into the outer crease, bringing it just over halfway into the crease with the 222. Next, apply Bronze Topaz eyeshadow lightly on the outer third of the lid with the 239. Apply Blonde Amber eyeshadow very lightly on the brow bone to highlight with the 239. Next, apply #20 liner on the lower lash line, and then smudge with Blonde Amber eyeshadow . Coat lashes with Film Noir mascara to finish the look. For cheeks, apply Betty Lou-Manizer on the apples of the cheeks and sweep towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Pink Tulle lipgloss for a complementing lip. Check out more photos!

"[""Bobbi Brown Ultra Nude Eye Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 23, 2012 March 23, 2012 Bobbi Brown Ultra Nude Eye Palette Bobbi Brown Ultra Nude Eye Palette ($45.00 for 0.30 oz.) includes six shades of neutral eyeshadows. These include: Chino (light cool beige), Praline (nude with golden pearl), Pink Chandelier (warm pink with golden pearl), Stone (neutral grey brown), Champagne Truffle (warm pink beige), and Cocoa Berry (rich brown plum). Chino is a soft, gray-tinted light-medium brown with a mostly matte finish. This has a matte finish (officially). It was smooth and soft with good color payoff. Chanel Beige Lame is similar but has shimmer. Urban Decay Naked is browner. Praline is a warm medium brown with a champagne-gold shimmer and sheen. This has a Shimmer Wash finish. As such, the color payoff is good but there is an underlying sheerness that’s intentional with this finish. The shimmer seems to be more integrated with the base color, so it didn’t have a lot of fall out issues. MAC Love Connection is darter, more coppery. Urban Decay Chopper is more of a coppery-orange. Wet ‘n’ Wild Dancing in the Clouds is darker. MAC Moleskin is close but doesn’t have shimmer. Pink Chandelier is gold and copper shimmered beige. This has a Metallic finish. For whatever reason, this shade was horrible. The color payoff was beyond sheer, and the texture was dry and gritty. Absolute miss! I couldn’t even give you a dupe, because it’s hard to determine what this color is actually supposed to be. Stone is a medium-dark brown with subtle warm undertones. This has a matte finish. MAC Lie Low is a bit darker and redder in tone, plus it has a shimmery finish. MAC Texture is darker, more yellowed. Inglot #357 is the closest, though slightly warmer. Champagne Truffle is a medium coppery brown. This has a Shimmer Wash finish. It has good color payoff overall. Wet ‘n’ WIld Comfort Zone is slightly darker. Urban Decay Blaze is similar. Cocoa Berry is a burgundy-brown with a satiny sheen. This has a Shimmer Wash finish. It’s very, very dry and difficult to work with, because it doesn’t want to apply. It’s supposed to be sheer, so even though it looks awful in the payoff department, that’s what it’s supposed to be! Inglot #378 is a bit darker and matte. Chanel Ebloui is similar but more burgundy. The palette starts out on a good note, but once you reach the third shade, it starts going downhill. Pink Chandelier and Cocoa Berry were both troublemakers, though the former was truly an awful shade to work with. These eyeshadows all felt a little drier than Bobbi Brown’s usual formula. Ultra Nude is a decent palette but with two under-performers, it’s not the best bang for your buck or one of the top five neutral palettes on the market. When I test drove this palette, I used Chino , Praline , Stone , and Cocoa Berry together, and they wore fairly well with only minor fading after eight hours when applied without a primer–with a primer, there were no problems with the wear. Cocoa Berry made me want to tear my hair out, because it was so difficult to blend.

The eyeshadows come in a swivel out compact with a flip-top mirror. It’s fun, functional packaging that’s travel-friendly and sturdy. Each eyeshadow is approximately 0.12 oz., which is over double the average eyeshadow (MAC eyeshadows contain 0.05 oz. each). There are four shades, which makes each shade $23.75 a pop. Their individually available eyeshadows are $30 each (and 0.13 oz.). The cost per ounce is $193.88/oz. for Le Metier de Beaute’s kit, as compared to MAC (which is not–technically–a comparable brand, as Le Metier de Beaute is a luxury brand), which comes in at $290.00/oz. Blonde Amber is a soft, gold shimmered wheat with a subtle metallic sheen. Pale Satin Amethyst is a rich, cool-toned lavender with a pearly sheen. Bronze Topaz is a metallic, toned-down bronze. Black Emerald is a luxurious jewel-toned blackened emerald green that maintains depth without becoming dirty. All four shades had excellent color payoff with buttery textures that applied smoothly. The texture is so finely milled, which is what I noticed when I initially swatched these. There are times when I’m photographing and swatching where I have a moment of awe, and they aren’t all that often, but as soon as I swatched this kit, I couldn’t wait to write about it. The silky texture made these a cinch to work with, because they lay down so easily and blend effortlessly. They’re definitely some of the best eyeshadows I’ve worked with ( theBalm eyeshadows come pretty close to these–very similarly textured).

"['Le Metier de Beaute Nouvelle Vague Kaleidoscope Eye Kit Sample Reviews Oct 10, 2012 October 10, 2012 Le Metier de Beaute Nouvelle Vague Kaleidoscope Eye Kit A Palette Inspired by the French Cinema Le Metier de Beaute Nouvelle Vague Kaleidoscope Eye Kit ($95.00 for 0.49 oz.) consists of four eyeshadows inspired by “the spark present throughout the French cinema New Wave.” The colors can be worn alone or layered over each other (part of the brand’s methodology). Nouvelle is described as a “sheer mink negative.” It’s a warm peach with a frosted finish and a kiss of pink. The color payoff is rich and opaque, not quite the sheer color they described it as (so for some, this is probably a good thing!). It had a lovely soft, finely-milled texture that felt buttery and smooth. Chanel Complice is similar but less reflective, a smidgen darker. theBalm Stubborn is warmer, less pink. Urban Decay Scratch is fairly close, though a little pinker. Gamine is described as a “satin pink celluloid.” It is a blue-based cotton candy pink with a soft frosted finish. The color payoff was fantastic, and the texture was soft, smooth, and blendable. MAC Dynamic Duo 4 is sheerer, less frosted. Guerlain Boulevard du Montparnasse is similar, a smidgen darker. MAC for Miss Piggy is sheerer, less frosted. MAC Feather Pink is cooler-toned, almost lilac. Icon is described as a “silky matte Parisian mauve.” It’s a soft pink-tinged mauve with a matte finish. It had a soft, smooth, and finely-milled texture that yielded rich color. Inglot #399 is frosted. Guerlain Boulevard du Montparnasse is similar but satiny. MAC Neo Nebula is shimmery. Urban Decay Bordello is darker and frosted. Fin is described as a “smoldering black carbon.” It’s a rich, deep, dark black with a fine dusting of multi-colored shimmer (which you don’t really notice when it is applied). The pigmentation in this is so, so rich. The texture is soft, smooth, and not a bit powdery. As far as comparably rich in pigment black eyeshadows go, Urban Decay Blackout is similar but has a more matte finish; Milani Pitch Black is also similar; and Make Up For Ever #4 is entirely matte and has no shimmer at all. The palette is high quality from top to bottom, and really, the only reason it lost any points was because of Nouvelle , which was described as sheer but is, in fact, quite pigmented–for most, this will be received as great news. When I tested these shades for wear, they wore for eight hours with no fading or creasing. Each eyeshadow is just over 0.12 oz., which is double the size of most eyeshadows. To put it into perspective, a MAC quad is the equivalent of paying $200/oz., and the Kaleidoscope is $194/oz. Note: my packaging is sample packaging, while retail versions are packaged in the brand’s signature black; the packaging rating reflects the retail packaging.

"[""Urban Decay Gilded Baked Bronzer Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Apr 08, 2011 April 08, 2011 Urban Decay Gilded Bronzer Urban Decay Gilded Baked Bronzer Urban Decay Gilded Baked Bronzer ($26.00 for 0.26 oz.) is described as “bronze shimmer with veins of gold.” It’s a baked powder with swirls of gold and bronze within a warm, orange-peach base. Gilded is a gold shimmered orange-tan. When applied, despite the more glittery look of the powder, it has a much more refined part-shimmer, part-sheen finish on the cheeks.I was worried the apparent shimmer would translate into a “Stop! Look! I have pores!” effect, but it was a gorgeous glow of golden warmth. I think it looks better in person than in photos–there is some subtlty that is lost. Though it was beautiful once applied and looked delicate but delectably bronzy, it did not wear all day–it made it to six hours and by the eighth, it was mostly gone. At first glance, it seems like the price is around average, but in comparison the previous Baked Bronzer, it’s not. The original Baked Bronzer contained 0.35 oz. and retailed for $24. The newly packaged and relaunched Baked Bronzer line only contains 0.26 oz. but retails for $26. I checked the ingredients for this version against the previous version, but they are the same. I don’t expect most to rocket through the bronzer, whether it is 0.26 oz. or 0.35 oz., but it is always disappointing when a product relaunches and quantity gets decreased. I felt like someone was try to pull a fast over on me!

It’s a really green-teal with a finish that looks like a cream to me. MAC Ocean Dip is much more of a blue-teal. Essie Turquoise & Caicos is closer but lighter. There was nothing that I could think of that came close enough to this to even be considered similar, let alone a dupe. Chlorophyll was opaque in two coats, though it was almost opaque in one for me. It has a balanced consistency–not too thick or too thin–that allowed for even, streak-free application without bubbling or pooling. OCC’s formula wears a week on me with minor tip wear and no chipping. Of the shades launching for their upcoming collection, Chlorophyll was one of my favorites. 20 5 Chlorophyll 20 5 Chlorophyll A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Beautylish Cult Beauty Urban Outfitters LookFantastic Beauty Bay (UK) OCC 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 98% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Essie A French Affair Collection Swatches, Photos, Review Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 11, 2011 April 11, 2011 Coat Azure, French Affair, Nice is Nice Essie A French Affair Collection For Spring, Essie has launched six shades ranging from blue to nude in their A French Affair Collection . Essie can be found at various etailers and salons, but also through beauty.com ($8 per bottle). Coat Azure (breathing taking medium blue with shimmer), French Affair (sophisticated soft lavender pink), Nice is Nice (whimsical light lavender), Sand Tropez (soft sandy beige), Topless & Barefoot (barely there soft beige pink), and Kisses & Bisses (kiss of pink shimmer – perfect to layer over any color). Coat Azure is a dusty cornflower blue with soft microshimmer. I used two coats. China Glaze Sky High Top seems similar but brighter. French Affair is a pale pink with cool undertones and a cream finish. I used three coats. It is cooler-toned than Essie Neo Whimsical. Nice is Nice is a pinked lavender with a cream finish. I used two coats, and there was a hint of visible nail line. It is similar to MAC’s Little Girl Type, but darker and not as cool-toned. It’s also more pigmented and less cool-toned than Essie Lilacism. Sand Tropez is a muted, beige with a touch of gray in a cream finish. I used three coats. It seems a bit similar to Essie Body Language. Topless & Barefoot is a warmed over light-medium beige cream. I used two coats. I couldn’t think of a possible dupe for this one. Kisses & Bisses is a sheer, warmed white base with a duochromed, opalescent shimmer that flashes pink and gold. I used three coats in the swatches. Essie recommends it for layering, and if you’re not into sheer polishes, it would work well as a layering polish. I did like it on its own; it gave a soft, sheer look but the duochrome finish of the shimmer added interest. Zoya Bailey seems similar, perhaps not as much of a duochrome. my thoughts on the formula: Essie’s spring shades is a good mix of soft colors and pastels with a formula that applies easily and none of the pastel shades have a chalky look to them. I found about half needed two coats, but overall, three seemed like the ideal amount. The formula wasn’t too thick or thin, and it flowed evenly onto the nail. With a base/top coat, I had only minor tip wear after a week’s wear of Essie’s formula.

It is a very blackened eggplant-y purple with flecks of plum and silver shimmer shot through. It dries slightly shiny, but I would still say you need a top coat to really make it gleam. I used two coats and there was some underlying streakiness in areas that were more visible in natural light than I expected–I photographed with two coats. I would recommend three coats for opaque, solid coverage. The formula seemed thin, too, which I imagine contributed to the lack of opacity in two coats as well as the streaky second coat. It doesn’t seem consistent with the rest of Butter London’s range (that I have tried, of course), so it was disappointing. I typically get a week of wear with Butter London’s formula with a proper base and top coat. 11 2 Branwen's Feather 11 2 Branwen's Feather C+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Amazon DermStore Net-A-Porter Skinstore.com b-glowing LookFantastic FeelUnique Beauty Brands Butter London 7 Product 7 Pigmentation 7 Texture 10 Longevity 4 Application 78% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Column One The Browbone is a warm beige with a soft, frosted finish. It is a little less beige compared to MAC Ricepaper . The Eyelid is a rosy copper with a frost finish. It is similar in color but darker than MAC Jest . The Crease is a warm, medium-dark golden brown with a pearly sheen. It is a touch lighter than MAC Soba . The Definer is a dark, burgundy and copper shimmered brown with subtle red undertones. It is very similar to MAC Smut . Column Two The Browbone is a pale, dirty gray-pewter with a white, frosted sheen. Urban Decay Ruthless is a touch warmer but similar. Inglot #350 is a little grayer and has more of matte finish. The Eyelid is a subdued, springy green with a golden sheen. It is more subdued with less yellow tones than MAC Juxt . The Crease is a charcoal brown with a pearly sheen. Milani Melange is similar but has a more shimmered appearance. The Definer is a red-brown with a teal duochrome and frosted finish. It is similar to MAC Club and Urban Decay Lounge . The color payoff was excellent across the board with the exception of two shades–the green shade in column two was still good but a little sheer, while the smoky brown in column two was a little sheer as well. The latter shade also felt dry and stiff, so it wasn’t as easy to blend out as many of the other shades. Texture on these was also nice, other than the exception mentioned–soft, smooth, and blendable. Sometimes I have issues with the wear of Wet ‘n’ Wild’s eyeshadows (typically, nothing too concerning, though), but this palette wore really well without fading or having residual fall out at the end of the day.

When applied, it’s very much a black gold–it has that really dark black-brown color base with khaki and bronze shimmer on top. This shade applies much sheerer when used dry, while applied wet, it has much more intense color pay off. Milani advertises these as luminous (marketing for soft/sheerer color–more like a wash) when used dry, so it’s actually as described. (Many of the other shades were closer in payoff, though.) I did find that this shade had a faint amount of fall out when used dry; it seemed to have a lot more shimmer than some of the other shades, and the shimmer sat on top of the color more than weaved within it. I do wish they’d ditch the sponge/brush applicator, though, because the bristles are splayed and scratchy, while the sponge is thin and surprisingly scratchy. I did like the switch to a black interior, over the champagne gold from the Runway Eyeshadows. The lid is also quite secure, and I had to pry it open with my nails. 8 1 Melange 8 1 Melange B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Drugstore.com Ulta Amazon Target Beauty Bay (UK) 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It has good color payoff, but the color itself is more muted than it appears in the pan–there is a very soft, dusted quality to it and the way the shimmer plays with the color makes it almost seem tinged with purple. The color reminded me of theBalm Feisty Felicia . The “sky” is a creamy white–it’s warm but still white, with a shimmer-sheen. It has a lovely buttery texture that’s dense and luxurious–very blendable and soft. It’s similar to theBalm’s Envious Erin . As a cheek highlighter, it reminded me of MAC Too Chic , which has more of a peach color. Givenchy did an outstanding job on the packaging–the outer packaging reflects what you should expect to see inside, while the product itself is practical in size so that both sections can be used as intended. There is a pull-out drawer with three sponge-tipped applicators, and while they’re softer than super cheap sponge-tipped applicators, they aren’t noteworthy. I’d rather them omit those and make the compact even slimmer. Inside the compact is also a mirror.

"[""TheBalm BalmShelter Tinted Moisturizer Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 07, 2011 April 07, 2011 TheBalm BalmShelter Tinted Moisturizer TheBalm BalmShelter Tinted Moisturizer TheBalm BalmShelter Tinted Moisturizer SPF 18 ($25.00 for 2.25 oz.) is designed to give “long lasting moisturizer” with a polished look while skin feels “silky.” Immediately, I wished there were more shades available–there are only three: Light, Light/Medium, and Medium. I tested out the Light/Medium shade, which I found to be a pretty good match, though perhaps a hair light, for my complexion (I’m NC25/30 in MAC, Punjab in NARS). Tinted moisturizers are great for days when you want a little coverage but not a lot of makeup. Hallmarks of a great tinted moisturizer are sheer coverage, creamy consistency, and hydrating. BalmShelter provides enough coverage to even out my skin tone (especially around the cheeks, where I am a bit blotchy) and helping to give my face a uniform color (I’m darker around my hair line than anywhere else). It has a natural finish, so it’s not matte but not too dewy. I did find it more dewy than not, and if you have oilier skin, you may find it even more necessary to finish with a setting powder. I do, normally, set even tinted moisturizer with powder, though. What I really liked about BalmShelter was its very creamy consistency; it was thick without being goopy and spread really well and evenly. It definitely felt like a lotion, which made it even easier to blend and cover my face during application. It comes in a squeeez tube, and there is no problem getting just what you need out. I wasn’t as keen on its ability to hydrate, though; it was decent but I felt like I needed to layer moisturizer underneath. I couldn’t just use BalmShelter in lieu of a moisturizer. For oilier skin types, it may be enough, but for my normal-to-dry skin type, it wasn’t quite enough. It wears for six to eight hours before I notice it has sheered out in some places (like my t-zone).

Under his supervision, makeup artist Diane Kendal created the season’s look on model Mariacarla Boscono. The Italian beauty was chosen for her sophistication and chameleon-like ability to become the character she is made up to portray. Diane began by creating an immaculate complexion, applying Siberia Sheer Matte Foundation to the center of the face with her fingertips, blending outward, and setting with Snow Loose Powder. To add contour to the cheeks, she brushed Oasis Blush just below the cheekbone and blended the color toward the temple. Mariacarla’s eyelids were prepped with PRO-PRIME Smudge Proof Eyeshadow Base, blending with a fingertip for a fresh finish. Diane then applied Outremer Single Eyeshadow to the lid, layering the color to build intensity. To create a winged effect, she extended the color to the inner corner of the eye and up along the outer corner toward the brow bone. Next, she swept the sheer white side of Pandora Duo Eyeshadow on the brow bone, blending it softly into the bold blue hue. She lined the upper lash line with Rue Saint-Honoré Larger Than Life Long-Wear Eyeliner Pencil and the lower lash line with Rue Bonaparte Larger Than Life Long-Wear Eyeliner Pencil to open the eyes. The silvery taupe shade of Grand Palais Duo Eyeshadow was blended along the lower lash line, extending the color into the inner corner of the eye. Brows were defined with Bali Single Eyeshadow, and lashes were curled and finished with two coats of Larger Than Life Volumizing Mascara. Lastly, Diane lined and filled the lips with Fantasia Lipliner Pencil—blending with a finger to soften the color—followed by Striptease Lip Gloss topped with Pago Pago Lipstick. The Fall 2011 collection is resolutely avant-garde. Daring shots of color are tempered with softer, subtler tones. Eyes range from bright true blue to silvery taupe, dazzling peach and matte dove gray. Lips run the gamut from statementmaking matte red to sophisticated plum and sparkling champagne pink. A stormy gray nail color adds a mysterious finishing touch. The effect is confident, edgy and intense.

It had a drier texture than I’d like to see, because drier textures often make for more difficult blending and application. For something that is described as “intense,” I also expected better pigmentation. It reminded me of MAC Later , and I imagine a comparison could be drawn to MAC Contrast as well. The sky shade is a pale, yellowed gold with a fair amount of sheen in its finish. The texture of this shade is much better–it’s smoother, softer, and silkier. It blends out better and doesn’t have the dryness of the darker shade. It looks a bit like theBalm Mary-Lou Manizer when blended out. It’s darker than MAC Nylon . Givenchy did an outstanding job on the packaging–the outer packaging reflects what you should expect to see inside, while the product itself is practical in size so that both sections can be used as intended. There is a pull-out drawer with three sponge-tipped applicators, and while they’re softer than super cheap sponge-tipped applicators, they aren’t noteworthy. I’d rather them omit those and make the compact even slimmer. Inside the compact is also a mirror.

Vanity is a warm-toned palette with a mix of browns and golds. You can see a look I did with this palette here . The three matte finished shades are: a soft, barely-there beige, dirtied light-medium tan brown, and deep, dark brown with burgundy-red undertones. These mattes were much better than the ones found in the recently launched spring palettes–much smoother, more pigmented, and applied better. I felt they swatched better than they applied, but they still applied decently. The beige shade is surprising, because for as light as it is, it wasn’t chalky at all. The three frost finished shades are: a pale whitish-gold, bright yellow gold, and rich chocolate bronze. I found the pale gold to be rather sheer, and it easily disappeared when applied, so it did not apply evenly. The pigmentation and texture of the gold and bronze, though, is much nicer–both have good color pay off and are pretty soft, while the bronze is the best in the palette overall. Vanity is housed in standard fare packaging for Wet ‘n’ Wild; a clear flip top with a black base. It’s sturdy enough for keeping at home, but it might not travel as well (if it’s tossed around a lot). It should stand up to some wear and tear. What I liked most was how well it secured closed. I didn’t find the included brushes to be worth using; they were scratchy and rather splayed.

All three are varying degrees of sheer, but in general, they are on the sheerer end of the spectrum. Glossimers are designed as a sheerer formula often recommended for layering. Though the range varies from sheerer to more opaque, these don’t seem to deliver quite as much oomph as other Glossimers–perhaps because the base color is nearly invisible or the mix of shimmers does not stand out as much. I love Chanel’s Glossimers for their highly reflective shimmer and comfortablep-to-wear formula. I typically get three to four hours of wear with them, but they are not sticky, which is rather noteworthy wear for a gloss without a tacky base. Pensee (277) is a coral-orange with pink and gold shimmer. On my lips, it adds mostly glossiness and shimmer without much color. Pink Peony (267) is a rosy pink with multi-colored shimmer, though predominantly pink and silver. Like Pensee, it is mostly just shine and shimmer when worn. Aurore (287) is a pink and melon gold shimmered peach. It is highly reflective and almost a duochrome gloss.

This compact contains a ton of product–it’s double the amount of your average blush. I can’t fathom ever finishing this, because you need so little to get that shimmering glow. It’s a soft, shimmering champagne with subtle gold tones. It’s not the subtlest highlighter, but it’s not glittery, heavy, or overly shimmery either. It seems to have a combination of noticeable shimmer and subtle, glowy sheen. I think it’s a very pretty shade–ultra flattering on most skin tones–but it is absolutely gorgeous on warmer skin tones. (Again, this should work beautifully on cooler skin tones, too!) On my cheeks, I just tap the tiniest amount on the tops of my cheeks using a tapered face brush, and then I blend it out. I will say that this is a product where blending is necessary–if you just tap it on, it will look obvious and accentate pores, but a few quick swishes of a brush will turn you into a glowy goddess.

Am I alone when I look at the swatch and read the description and feel like it’s not really fitting? It’s a semi-sheer plummy pink with flecks of gold shimmer and a high-gloss shine. This shade was originally part of a Sephora-exclusive set of blush-inspired glosses and has made a reappearance in the fall collection. NARS Lipglosses are supposed to be comfortable, glossy, and non-sticky. I don’t find these completely non-sticky; I wouldn’t go out of my way and say they’re sticky, but there is a little tackiness there. They are comfortable to wear, and the texture spreads evenly across the lips. Though in the past, these glosses have smelled plastic-like, I didn’t notice any scent or taste with Oasis.

Lighthouse is a bright, sunshine yellow gold with flecks of metallic gold sparkle. This shade just seems so fun and positive, and it’s gold, which means I’m all over it. I used two coats, and there was some nail line showing, so I think a third would make it opaque. It is a richer, more vibrant version of Cowardly Lyin’ –well, that is the closest dupe I could come up with, and I wouldn’t say they’re that similar. Pelican Grey is a soft, cool-toned gray with very faint white micro-shimmer. It is slightly bluer (and has shimmer) than Zoya’s Dove. I used two coats. Sea Spray is a pale baby blue cream with silvery-blue micro-shimmer. I used two coats. I couldn’t think of a dupe for this one. Starboard is a brightened grass green cream with a shiny dry down. I used two coats. It’s kind of like Four Leaf Clover–but with a yellow base (which makes them quite distinguishable from each other). Sunset Sail is a warmed up, peach beige with soft beige micro-sparkle. I used two coats. It reminded me a bit of China Glaze III–lighter and more opaque. White Cap is a gold-tinged white shimmer-glitter. It doesn’t go on opaque, and it actually reminded me a lot of Chanel Pearl Drop , but obviously the finishes are entirely different. Though the formula on these seemed to be a bit thicker than average for China Glaze, application was still even and smooth. I ended up with at least two coats on all of these, though some I did three with. China Glaze is one of my personal favorite brands, because of their color and finish range–I really feel like they bring out a little something for everyone in each of their seasonal collections.

In the pot, it looks black as midnight, but when swatched, the shimmer is just barely visible. It is a blue-based black, and photographs tend to pull blue out of it, but in person, I found it really just looked black. It’s a nice, rich jet black, and if you’re a fan of the all-black smoky eye, it would be lovely as the star! I used it as eyeliner on the lower lash line in this look . This is a product that lives up to its claims–it wears all day without budging, creasing, or fading–and blends as well on its own as it does with other eyeshadows (or on top of an eyeshadow base). Giorgio Armani describes the Eyes to Kill Intense formula as neither powder nor cream but a hybrid that creates a “smooth, lasting color film” that can be applied wet or dry. Giorgio Armani explains, “Each shade is intensified with a second pigment for a multi-dimensional effect. In just one swoop, create a wet, shimmering smokey eye … Base color covers eyelid, and second pigment adds drama to the contour.” The texture of these feels almost like a cream eyeshadow, but it has the thinness of a powder eyeshadow while retaining some of the blendability of the hybrid cream-powder eyeshadow. It also works well with other eyeshadow ( see this look using #6 ). The intensity is insane–whether you use it wet or dry, they pretty much look the same. It’s almost like a really dense loose powder that’s been pressed down, because if you dig at it, it loosens. Though pricey, each shade comes with 0.14 oz. worth of product, which is a hefty amount (normal eyeshadow averages around 0.05 oz., no matter the price). The only aspect I didn’t love was the little black stopper inside the jar (once you unscrew the black lid), because my longer fingers felt awkward grabbing it (so I just unscrew it upside down so it falls into the cap). 18 1 #13 18 1 #13 A+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Harrods Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) Giorgio Armani Beauty (Canada) Beauty Brands Giorgio Armani Beauty 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 100% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Chanel Bronze Corail Soleil Tan de Chanel Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links Reviews Apr 20, 2011 April 20, 2011 Chanel Bronze Corail Soleil Tan de Chanel Chanel Summer 2011: Bronze Corail For summer, there are two variations of Chanel Soleil Tan de Chanel ($50.00 for 0.49 oz.) — the first I’m reviewing is Bronze Corail (and I will review Bronze Rose later). It is a striped palette with four shades: a warm, medium-dark tan with subtle gold shimmer; warm beige with shimmery sheen; deeper tanned brown with a satin sheen with red undertones; and a pop of coral-pink with a subtle sheen. Swirled together, the resulting color is a sheer, soft bronze with a champagne sheen. Chanel describes the product as, “Worn alone or blended together, they highlight or ‘tan’ skin for a subtle, natural glow.” It’s definitely a product that is hard to overdo, because it is sheer and soft–certainly subtle. It will be a nice bronzer for light to medium skin tones, but darker skin tones will find it more a highlighter than a bronzing product. The included brush does enable one to use the shades on an individual level better than your average blush brush (which is more useful to swirl and blend the shades together). You can use all four shades to add more pinkness to the cheeks, or you could use the top three for a more traditionally bronzy look. The softest shade is very much like a highlighter, so it, too, could be used on its own as such. Though the powder is soft as silk and each shade is seemingly pigmented, I felt like once applied, it looked somewhat powdery on my cheeks. There is a fair amount of powdery dust within the compact after using a brush (whether the one included or something separate). Normally, I’m a big fan of the Soleil Tan de Chanel editions, because they can create more multidimensional looks from the different variations in color–you can go lighter, darker, pop of color all bronze–but the product could have laid down more naturally over the skin. The good news, though, is it lasted all day long (12+ hours), and you get one brick of a bronzer (0.49 oz.) for your money.

"['Best Bronzers Over $30 Reviews Mar 31, 2009 March 31, 2009 Get Sunkissed Without the Risk: Best Bronzers for Over $30 Chanel Soleil Tan de Chanel Bronzing Powder ($65.00) contains four shades that go from light to dark. They can be used together, swirled, or alone for personalization, which is definitely nice. The compact is large enough where you can feasibly use one or two shades alone, rather than all four. What I love about this bronzer is it feels silky and smooth, very finely milled. It feels weightless, and it looks very, very natural. It has a subtle shimmer sheen when applied, but the shimmer isn’t overly so. It falls into the category of “sophisticated” shimmer–the kind that doesn’t accentuate facial flaws. Guerlain Terracotta Mineral Loose Powder ($65.00) is a sheer-to-medium buildable, loose bronzer. It’s new for the spring/summer season, and included with the bronzer pot is a miniature kabuki brush. It is available in three shades: Light, Medium, and Dark. Light is probably going to be too light for most; this shade is most suitable for those who want just the faintest (and I mean faintest!) hint of color on them–perhaps as an allover powder vs. where the sun hits. Medium is a more universal shade that doesn’t go on glowing orange. It didn’t feel like there was any shimmer in it to me, and I did find it fairly blendable. The biggest downside is that it can get messy. Being a loose powder means that you may find a cloud of bronzer poof when you open the container, and you may get more powder than you’d like on your brush. Dior Bronze Collagen Activ Bronzer ($48.00) is a new bronzer from Dior that is designed to help smooth and fill fine lines. It’s not just makeup, it’s makeup with skincare ingredients in it. The bronzer also has SPF25, which is nice, though not necessary (I’m already going to wear SPF all over my face, so my bronzer doesn’t have to have it). The new bronzer comes in four shades: Healthy Tan, Honey Tan, Amber Tan, and Spicy Tan. It’s near matte in finish, and it gives you a glowy, sunkissed look that looks very natural–no orange glow here. I found this particular bronzer very blendable upon application, and it felt softer and less powdery, too. What’s your favorite bronzer?

"['NYC Union Square Eyeshadow Palette Reviews Apr 25, 2011 April 25, 2011 NYC Union Square Eyeshadow Palette NYC Union Square Eyeshadow Palette NYC Union Square IndividualEyes Custom Compact ($4.99 for 0.33 oz.) is an excellent choice for an affordable, neutral-themed palette. Though it’s marketed as for “brown eyes,” I think it would work well with a variety of eye colors and skin tones. It contains four eyeshadows, an illuminator, and eyeshadow base. The eyeshadow base worked a treat when I wore it under these eyeshadows — no creasing or fading for the twelve hours I tested the product out for. The texture was creamy without being slippery and the product more opaque than not, so it worked well to create a solid base for the eyeshadows. I didn’t find the illuminator as useful, as it is a little glittery and almost tacky, so it was a miss for me. Both of the products are cream-based, so you may find that excess powder from the eyeshadows travels over as a result of the palette’s design. All four eyeshadows were really pigmented and soft to the touch. They were a touch stiff to blend, but I was still able to blend them out for the most part–not perfect but good. The shades included are: an eggplant purple with red undertones and soft silver sparkle, bronzy brown with a golden bronze shimmer-sheen, medium-dark neutral brown with a matte finish, and warmed ivory beige with a satin sheen.

"['Chanel Rouge Coco: Sneak Preview with Sample Reviews Feb 16, 2010 February 16, 2010 Chanel Rouge Coco: Sneak Preview Rouge Coco promises to be one of Chanel’s biggest launches this year. According to Peter Philips’, Global Creative Director of Chanel Makeup, “Rouge Coco fascinates me, because I’ve never seen a texture this comfortable and easy to apply. It’s the ready-to-wear lipstick. Just one sweep over the lips colours them and covers them in a melt-away balm … I like the idea that women from the gloss generation, who are afraid of lipstick, can return to this essentially feminine beauty step with Rouge Coco.” I’m a big fan of Chanel’s lip products. It took me awhile before I came around, but once I did, woo, boy! Those Rouge Allure Laques just made me fall head over heels in lurve . I remember first reading about Rouge Coco in WWD back in January, and I was all over it. I was like, “When? Where? I WANT!” Rouge Coco comes in a metal case, but it’s still housed in sleek, black packaging with signature Chanel details. Funny enough, according the press materials, engineers opened and closed hundreds of tubes of lipstick to settle on just the right “click.” Each lipstick is lightly scented with a vanilla rose scent (also supposed to have a “fruity raspberry accord,” but I didn’t catch it–my nose is far from sophisticated!). When asked, “How do we apply Rouge Coco?” Peter Philips says, “[It] stands out by the freedom that it offers women. It allows you to adjust the intensity of the colour, even though the very first coat offers dense lip pigmentation.” I wanted to give you the back story behind Rouge Coco , because I know that I enjoy reading about the inspiration behind a new product or collection. It just makes it come alive to me! There is just something special about really seeing and envisioning all of the work that went into a product, whether you buy into the back story or not. But now, let’s move away from the press release and onto the real deal — do they deliver? what are they like? Based on the back story, Rouge Coco is designed to be a hydrating, satin lip color that can deliver smooth, pigmented color. After testing five shades, I can confirm that back story for you. Perle (02) is a soft pinky-brown with subtle champagne sheen. It gives good coverage without being heavy. Mademoiselle (05) is a medium pink with a brown edge. It’s pink without being bubblegum-pink or pale or frosty. This was one of the richer colors of the five I tried as well. I didn’t feel like this shade had any noticeable shimmer; it had a slight sheen, but it wasn’t frosty or glossy. La Pausa (08) is an orange-based coral with coppery orange shimmer. It applied smoothly and provided good color coverage, though it had a frostier finish than the other four I tested out. I’m not sure why this is put in the “Beige” family, since I wouldn’t say it’s anywhere near beige. Legende (11) is a raspberry pink with a pearl shimmer. It applies evenly to lips and is rich in color. It had less of a satin finish as it did frost. There was a noticeable sheen once applied. What I did like about this particular shade is it could be blotted down for a lighter, more of a pink-stained lip for less intense color. Cambon (31) is a rich, raspberry-tinged red. This one is wickedly pigmented; it’s a vibrant, glowing red. The color didn’t bleed on me, but I would use a lip liner (in practice) just to give it a more defined edge. Cambon had a light sheen, almost a glossy look to it, though still definitely a lipstick look. Rouge Coco is a surprisingly pigmented, subtle, and smooth formula. Way better than Hydrabase (which it is replacing). I wouldn’t even describe these as creamy lipsticks (like Rouge Allures can be), but they apply smoothly, richly, and feel incredibly lightweight. I tested the wear with two colors, once with Mademoiselle and the second time with Cambon –I got a solid four hours of wear with Mademoiselle before it looked faded (but it persisted decently for another hour); with Cambon , I experienced only minimally fading after five hours of wear with no bleeding (but note, lip color doesn’t tend to bleed on me). These don’t surpass my Rouge Allure Laques (but they’re almost a completely different animal, let’s be honest) as an all-time favorite Chanel lip product, but they hold their own in the Chanel lip color range. The wear is excellent, because the color hugs lips without sucking the moisture from them. I think this is why it’s the bridge between lipstick and gloss–because it feels lightweight, soft, and smooth. But it’s not a lip balm. It doesn’t feel slick or move all over your lips. Overall , Rouge Coco is a good step-up from Aqualumieres and not overshadowed by Rouge Allures . It’s like the middle ground–pigmented enough for medium-to-full coverage but light enough for sheer. I like the new formula quite a bit but not quite in love with it yet… perhaps my heart is just waiting to be swept away by that perfect shade. The Rouge Coco line includes four color families with a total of twenty shades (at least, that’s what the press book listed), each retailing for $30. I believe there may be up to an additional ten shades that rotate internationally. The lipstick will launch February 25th , both online and on-counter. You’ll definitely find me at Nordstrom first thing on the 25th to check out the other shades! See the range of shades, plus photos, swatches, & lip swatches!

Carthage Pure Matte Lipstick is also great –the hot pink color is so fresh and the matte texture is unexpected for summer. Q: When creating each campaign, what are you trying to achieve? A: I keep the image of NARS strong, edgy and fashion-forward, but still classic. NARS is a timeless brand. It is not a fashion moment that disappears. We keep the image ageless for a reason. I like trends but you can’t build a company on trends alone. The brand should be everlasting. Q: Why did you choose Iris for the Summer 2011 campaign?

"['MAC Warm & Cozy Collection: Lipsticks , Lip Swatches Reviews Dec 23, 2009 December 23, 2009 MAC Lipsticks: Spiced Tea, Warm Me Up, Siss MAC Warm & Cozy Collection: Lipsticks I was pleasantly surprised by the texture and coverage of both Siss and Warm Me Up. Siss is permanent, by the way, so you don’t have to rush out and purchase that one if it catches your eye and you’re on a budget. (I didn’t own it previously, though, so I still picked one up.) My favorite was easily Warm Me Up — it’s totally a shade I’d gravitate towards, and the finish is truly lovely. Spiced Tea was definitely the disappointing one of the three. Siss is a fleshy-beige with a peachy undertone. It reminded me of the color of foundation (well, a darker foundation than my own, I suppose). It’s not flattering on my lips, and I doubt I’d wear it alone — perhaps layered with a coral gloss or even a red. Warm Me Up is a creamy medium pink with a little warmed-up yellow in it. I know MAC says it’s a neutral pink, but I think it has a lil’ warmth in it still! It has a nice amplified finish, so it’s rich in pigmentation and goes on smooth. It reminded me of a much pinker version of Brave New Bronze for some reason… Spiced Tea is a semi-sheer coppery bronze with an orange warmth to it. It has a golden shimmer in it. I thought it wasn’t so bad at first, but on my lips, it looks a little splotchy. I just found it really trying to get an even finish/color with this particular shade. See more photos and swatches!

Obviously, since everything was behind class, I couldn’t quite get all up in Surf Baby’s business for the very best of shots nor have a swatch session. I do not know when I will have products to review or swatch , but I will, of course, review the collection as I do each MAC collection. Trust me — if I have something new I can share, I do so immediately, and that goes for any brand. If you wonder why you see something elsewhere but not here, it means that Temptalia will likely be subject to legal action if we did, despite other websites posting the same information. It’s one of those unfortunate growing pains but our motto is that it’s better to spend time on swatches/reviews than in legal battles to post mere photos a couple of weeks early!

"['Chanel Baroque Rouge Coco Lipstick Reviews Dec 26, 2010 December 26, 2010 Chanel Baroque Rouge Coco Lipstick Chanel Baroque Rouge Coco Lipstick Chanel Baroque (30) Rouge Coco Lipstick ($30.00 for 0.12 oz.) is a lightly berried brown with hints of red and ruby micro-shimmer. The shimmer is incredibly light and almost invisible to the eye but the effect is lightly reflective. It is a new and limited edition shade from the Cote d’Azur Collection , which is online-only at this time–but you never know if it’ll pop-up in-stores (as SoHo eventually did, at least at select locations). This is a surprisingly wearable shade, despite its initial dark tone, but it’s not bold or so deep that you have to worry about what you can or cannot wear with it. Rouge Coco is a slightly drier formula, because most of the shades are frost finishes, but I don’t find it drying–it’s just not moisturizing. It has a light vanilla-rose scent that’s rather faint but still detectable. It doesn’t seem to linger, though. On average, Rouge Cocos last four hours on me. I like the formula overall, and the shade range tends to be very wearable with a wide variety of colors from pinks to browns to reds. Pigmentation ranges from semi-sheer to semi-opaque, with a few shades being quite opaque and a couple on the sheerer side. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 27/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 FINAL THOUGHTS: There’s enough depth and color for this to be a great autumn/winter color without being too bold or vampy. The Rouge Coco formula is most suitable for those with relatively healthy lips; if your lips are dry and cracking, I would recommend opting for a more moisturizing formula (perhaps Rouge Allure, if you want to stay within Chanel).

"['Renee Rouleau Triple Berry Smoothing Peel Review, Photos Reviews Apr 12, 2011 April 12, 2011 Renee Rouleau Triple Berry Smoothing Peel Renee Rouleau Triple Berry Smoothing Peel Renee Rouleau Triple Berry Smoothing Peel ($85.50 for 1.7 oz.) is, quite possibly, the most deliciously scented facial product I have ever come across–but I am a fiend for raspberries. It’s a sweet, deletectable berry scent (I caught a lot of raspberry myself, but it also contains several other fruits). It is a chemical exfoliant, so it doesn’t have any beads, particles, or the like, that will scrub off dead skin. It looks like raspberry jam, including seeds, and the texture is rather jam-like, as well, but it’s a little looser than the average jam. But I tell you, if you don’t get the urge to taste it at least once… (I managed to resist, but I do wonder!) I use this peel every three to four weeks, and I’ve been using this for about four months now. I keep it on for about ten minutes, but it can be worn for less and be just as effective. Essentially, if it tingles a lot, you probably don’t want to keep it on for a full ten minutes–go with what feels right for your skin. My skin always feels ridiculously soft–almost so soft that it has a plumper feel to it–after I rinse off the peel with water. It’s honestly like a super skin treat each month when I use it. I’ve had a couple of facials, which are always enjoyable, but this is the next best thing for those of us who don’t have a budget that allows for regular facials. I find that my skin looks and feels smoother, brighter, and glowy (and stays that way for three to four days after). I love that this doesn’t irritate or redden my skin post-rinse, which means I don’t have to plan ahead about when to use it. I do personally like to use it on a Friday night, an hour or two before bed, as an end-of-the-week indulgence. The jar I purchased several months ago is still quite full, like 85%, (you don’t need much for each peel, and it’s a product that you only use a couple of times a month), but even so, when there was a deal for 50% off, I had to pick up another. I always think about having my mom try it, but I fear she’ll get hooked and I want my backup jar! It wouldn’t even surprise me, because of all the moisturizers I’ve given my mom, her favorite is La Mer. See more photos!

Despite NARS saying it can be applied to the lid and blended with a fingertip, it only lasts for a half hour or so, and even then, I’m not exactly sure what look NARS was going for. Queen contains chartreuse glittery bits suspended in a colorless base–there is no color whatsoever, just glitter. It’s not a very densely-packed glitter, either, because it applies sheer and doesn’t seem to be buildable at all. The glitter is large and chunky, and though it didn’t feel quite like sandpaper, it wasn’t soft or smooth when used against the lid. I could definitely feel the grit and unevenness of the glitter as I attempted to apply it on my lid (I applied it directly, using the pencil against the lid). When I used my fingertips to “blend,” I ended up with half the glitter on my finger with the rest on the lid. Just like several other shades I’ve tried, it creases within an hour (faster, too, but I just took a photo after an hour). The glitter migrated into the crease and collected with its friends. There was even some that had traveled beneath my lower lash line. I attempted to apply it over an eyeshadow look to add glitter, but it made the look crease, and even before it creased, the glitter didn’t seem to apply evenly or smoothly at all. I also applied it over a clear eyeshadow base, and I still experienced the same creasing and migration of the glitter as without a base. When applied to the lower lash line, it travels down to cheeks and with the sheerness of the product (you can’t get a really dense, rich line of glitter), it just doesn’t apply well. 0 7 Queen 0 7 Queen F Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks Selfridges Macy's Net-A-Porter Barneys Harvey Nichols (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Space NK (UK) bluemercury Sephora (PL) Dillard's NARS 0 Product 3 Pigmentation 5 Texture 0 Longevity 2 Application 22% Total Read Full Review""]",fa5a2640514cbb3691759b431b14f87877313cb7,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tag/nars-queen-soft-touch-shadow-pencil/,['2011-05-09 00:00:00']

"[""MAC Surf Baby Suntint Lip Balms Swatches, Photos, Reviews Sample Reviews May 06, 2011 May 06, 2011 MAC Surf Baby Suntints MAC Surf Baby: Suntint Lip Balms MAC Surf Baby Suntint SPF 20 Lip Balms ($15.50 for 0.33 oz.) include three shades: Full of Grace (soft sheer rose), Lilt of Lily (soft creamy pale pink), and Pink Tinge (clean bright yellow pink with gold pearl). Full of Grace is a sheer watermelon pink. Lilt of Lily is a sheer, milky pink-lilac shimmered with iridescent pink. Pink Tinge is a sheer, yellow-based pink with gold shimmer. These are lip balms, and they’re designed to be sheer–this is exactly what they are: tinted lip balm. If you have naturally pigmented lips, these will add mostly gloss for you. Those with paler natural lips may find that Full of Grace deposits some color. Lilt of Lily has the least amount of color, while Pink Tinge has the most shimmer. Earlier today, I was actually lamenting doing lip swatches for these, because they’re so similar when worn, and ironically, I didn’t do lip swatches when these first launched (back in 2009 with Baby Blooms) for the same reason! We’re on that border again; it’s expected to be sheer, but at what point is sheer too close to clear and therefore unpigmented? Full of Grace enhances my natural lip color by making it pinker and rosier, so it seems near our target. Lilt of Lily does a little but to a lesser extent. Pink Tinge adds shimmer and makes my lips look a little lighter than normal, and the sheerness is closer to Lilt of Lily but there is a little more here. It seems like pigmentation is where it should be for Full of Grace (like 9/10), while Lilt of Lily is lacking (5/10), and Pink Tinge falls somewhere between there (7/10), which averages out to around 7. Suntints have a thicker, jelly-ish consistency and feel a little like gel lips. They’re sticky (less so than Lipglass), and they have a light vanilla scent to them. I get only two to three hours of wear with these as a lip balm, but they are somewhat moisturizing. They seem to do a good job of locking in moisture, but I don’t feel like they add much to lips, because once it’s gone, so are most of the moisturizing benefits. The Suntints come in squeeze-tube packaging, and each tube holds a surprising amount of product (0.33 oz.).

"[""Hourglass Jett Script Precision Liquid Liner Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jun 14, 2011 June 14, 2011 Hourglass Jett Script Precision Liquid Liner Hourglass Script Precision Liquid Liner Hourglass Jett Script Precision Liquid Liner ($32.00 for 0.028 oz.) is a felt-tipped liquid liner that’s specially designed with a really fine tip. The formula is described as long-wearing with a quick dry down to prevent smearing and transfer. It’s available in only one shade–Jett–which is black. Like many black liquid eyeliners, it does have a tendency to photograph brown in swatches, though it does look like a medium black in real life. It’s not an ultra deep black, but it’s not a soft black either; it’s a happy medium of the two. It applies smoothly, gliding on with ease, and the color is distributed evenly without dragging. There’s no patchiness in the color, so you won’t have to go back over the same area twice. When swatched on my arm, it did bleed around the edges, but I did not notice any bleeding until I was cropping the swatch photograph. I didn’t spot any bleeding eyeliner when I tested it on my eyelid, but it does make me want to note that it might do so if you have more wrinkly eyelids. It’s budge- and smudge-proof, and I’d even go so far as to say it’s very nearly waterproof. It had no problem lasting through a shower. I do need a more robust eye makeup remover like Lancome Bi-Facil to remove it, but it doesn’t require elbow grease to do so. The lines you can draw with this are quite thin and precise, and you can curve around the lash line easily in one motion. The thinness and smallness of the tip may require a few practice runs, but you’ll hit your stride with little work–especially if you are a liquid liner pro. Because of the slight bleeding on my arm swatch, I did take that into account for the rating. While I did not experience it personally on my actual eyelids, there are several liquid liners that I’ve swatched in the past month or so that did not have any inkling of bleeding even on the arm, so it is something to consider depending on the texture of your natural lids (mine are fairly smooth). 6 4 Jett 6 4 Jett A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Hourglass Space NK Bergdorf Goodman Net-A-Porter Barneys Sephora Brazil Space NK (UK) 8.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 10 Longevity 4 Application 93% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Inglot’s Pearl Eyeshadows have a very fine shimmer with a brighter, pearly sheen. I had a good experience with these five eyeshadows–they were easy to work with, nicely pigmented, and had the soft, smooth textures I’ve come to expect from Inglot’s Pearl eyeshadows.

It has a subtle red undertone. 409 is a dark, bronzed chocolate brown with a pearl finish. This is a cooler-toned brown compared to #422. 402 is a muted, taupe-ish brown with a pearl finish. 421 is a medium-dark coppered brown with a pearl finish. 406 is a golden bronze with a pearl finish, though it reads more metallic than pearl.

"['MAC “Pop Colour” Collection Reviews Jan 15, 2010 January 15, 2010 MAC “Pop Colour” Collection: Review, Photos, Swatches Debuting today in-store are eight eyeshadow shades, permanent extensions to the freestanding and PRO store eyeshadow ranges. They will only be available in limited quantity and duration at counters (department stores), though. They’re also available online and should be online for as long as they’re permanent (think of online as much like a freestanding store). These are, thus, available in palette form when you purchase through freestanding/PRO stores or through the MAC website. Four shades were already PRO shades, two were previously limited edition shades, and two are brand new. Temptalia’s Recommendations Must-have: Lucky Green, Atlantic Blue, Winkle Nice-to-have: Free to Be, Vibrant Grape Skip: — I found the texture and pay off to be pretty good across the board. The mattes tended to needed two or three layers to build up the intensity and make them smooth without a proper base, but since I’ve owned a few of these previously, I can say they work well in practice. I don’t think any of them are poor in quality to merit skipping them based on that; it comes down to whether or not you like a particular shade (e.g. I don’t know if I’m going to love Goldenrod on me). Sunny Spot is the only one of the eight that has a similar shade already in the permanent line (Bitter), but it’s not a dead-on dupe. Eyeshadows Red Brick is a brick red — that’s really what it is. It’s an orange-y red with a matte finish. It can be pigmented, but it requires building up the intensity and/or a good base. Red Brick has been a PRO color for as long as I can remember. As far as I know, it is pretty much the closest to red eyeshadow I’ve seen from MAC (with the exception of Mi’Lady mineralize eyeshadow). Free to Be is a satin-y coral-pink. It can go on pink, or it can go on more coral; it will depend on what you use it with or your natural skin tone. Thanks to Sarah, she pointed out that the Free to Be from 2005 is actually a dusky gray-green. It is also going to be released as a limited edition shade (and in special packaging) in Give Me Liberty of London in March, as the description is a coral matte (fits). Goldenrod is a brightened golden yellow with a little orange thrown in. It’s much darker and more orange than Chrome Yellow. Like Red Brick, I can’t remember when this wasn’t at PRO. Lucky Green is a golden shimmered yellow-based green. This is one of my all-time favorite shades by MAC, and I’m really happy to see it become part of the permanent range. It was originally released with Belle Azure (2005). It has an amazing texture and goes on so smooth and pigmented, but it is a veluxe pearl, so I’ve come to expect that from my VPs! You can looks I’ve done with it here . Sunny Spot is a matte textured chartreuse shade. It’s a very yellowed green. It’s decently pigmented (more so than similar permanent shade Bitter–also yellower, by the by), but I’d have rather seen Sour Lemon from the PRO line (though that isn’t matte, to be fair). This is one of two brand spankin’ new shades to debut at both freestanding and PRO stores as an extension of the permanent line. Vibrant Grape is a medium dark reddened purple. This one definitely needs a base underneath it to go on smoothly. I’ve used it in practice, so I can tell you it’s easier to use than it is to swatch. It’s been a PRO shade for sometime now, but it will now be permanent at freestanding stores in addition to PRO stores. It was also released in limited edition packaging in Style Warriors last year. And if you’re looking for ideas on how to wear, we have a Look Book for it! You can see the original launch images here . You can see a look with it here . Atlantic Blue is a gorgeous shade of deep ocean blue with kind of a violet twist to it (because it’s not just plain ol’ blue, nor is it a navy blue). I love this shade, and I really love that it’s matte. Works excellently in the crease! This was originally part of the PRO line, but it is now permanent at freestanding stores, too. Check out a few reader-submitted ideas on how to use this shade in our Look Book . Here are a few looks I’ve done with it: here , here , here . Winkle is a softened sky blue with an edge of periwinkle. It’s not quite periwinkle (not nearly enough purple), but it’s not quite a true sky blue either (check out the PRO shade Sky Blue if that’s what you’re looking for). This is the second of the two brand new shades. Any favorites for you? What are you getting? (Or not getting?)

It looks redder in the pan than it is when swatched–there is a coppery orange that is much more pronounced when applied. It reminded me of MAC Coppering, but obviously in a baked form. Milani’s Baked Metallic Eyeshadows can be used wet or dry–wet for more intensity, dry for more luminosity (which, given the context, must mean sheerer color). Given the nature of baked eyeshadows, I Heart You does apply smoother and more evenly when applied wet than dry, but still, it is quite pigmented when used dry. The texture is fairly smooth and soft, but when applied, there is a touch of fall out. It’s not unforgivable, but I did notice it. I do wish they’d ditch the sponge/brush applicator, though, because the bristles are splayed and scratchy, while the sponge is thin and surprisingly scratchy. I did like the switch to a black interior, over the champagne gold from the Runway Eyeshadows.

It’s a dusty, gray-blue with pale silver-white shimmer. It seemed most comparable to Rescue Beauty Lounge’s Concrete Jungle–but Lady Muck has pale silver shimmer. (You can compare this shade against other blues in the Swatch Gallery .) It was opaque in two coats, and it had a natural sheen to it, though I think the majority will still prefer a shiny top coat on top. Butter London’s formula on this one has a really even flow, smooth application, and drying time wasn’t long at all. I typically get a week of wear with Butter London’s formula with a proper base and top coat. I’ve always thought of periwinkle as something a little deeper, with more purple in the mix, compared to this dusty, grayed blue. Googling showed a lot of results, some more to what I always imagined as periwinkle, but there were a few variations that leaned bluer, closer to Lady Muck. Don’t you wish there was some standardized language we beauty enthusiasts could converse in? Butter London negates a lot of the traditional view of periwinkle, because it adds powdery, blue, and grey on top of it, which really does seem like what Lady Muck is all about (so no points taken off for color inaccuracy). 17 1 Lady Muck 17 1 Lady Muck A+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Amazon DermStore Net-A-Porter Skinstore.com b-glowing LookFantastic FeelUnique Beauty Brands Butter London 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 99% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"['Milani I Heart You Baked Metallic Eyeshadow Sample Reviews Apr 18, 2011 April 18, 2011 Milani I Heart You Baked Eyeshadow Milani Baked Metallic Eyeshadow: I Heart You Milani I Heart You Baked Metallic Eyeshadow ($7.49 for 0.05 oz.) is a coppery red with a shimmery, metallic finish. It looks redder in the pan than it is when swatched–there is a coppery orange that is much more pronounced when applied. It reminded me of MAC Coppering, but obviously in a baked form. Milani’s Baked Metallic Eyeshadows can be used wet or dry–wet for more intensity, dry for more luminosity (which, given the context, must mean sheerer color). Given the nature of baked eyeshadows, I Heart You does apply smoother and more evenly when applied wet than dry, but still, it is quite pigmented when used dry. The texture is fairly smooth and soft, but when applied, there is a touch of fall out. It’s not unforgivable, but I did notice it. I do wish they’d ditch the sponge/brush applicator, though, because the bristles are splayed and scratchy, while the sponge is thin and surprisingly scratchy. I did like the switch to a black interior, over the champagne gold from the Runway Eyeshadows. The lid is also quite secure, and I had to pry it open with my nails. 15 2 I Heart You 15 2 I Heart You B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Drugstore.com Ulta Amazon Target Beauty Bay (UK) 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 88% Total Read Full Review']",e705d05835892b04b1582e0ff5d436d81205cb45,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tag/milani-i-heart-you-baked-metallic-eyeshadow/,['2011-04-18 00:00:00']

There are also a fair amount that seem to only be available in individual pots, rather than refills (which I do not have). Inglot’s Pearl Eyeshadows have a very fine shimmer with a brighter, pearly sheen. I had a good experience with these six eyeshadows–they were easy to work with, nicely pigmented, and had the soft, smooth textures I’ve come to expect from Inglot’s Pearl eyeshadows. #440 is the only one that I felt wasn’t true-to-pan in color; it was a few notches lighter, because of the heavy white pearl. 446 is a rich, jewel-toned plum purple with red undertones in a pearl finish. 445 is a softened, medium-dark plum with a pearl finish. 440 is a frosted, cool-toned lilac with a pearl finish. Like some of the other lighter pearl shades, the white pearl really reflects and comes through, almost washing the shade out. 420 is a grayish mauve with a pearl finish–it almost looks metallic. 439 is a rich, jewel-toned violet purple with a pearl finish. 441 is a medium-dark violet with a pearl finish.

"['Butter London Lady Muck Nail Lacquer Affiliate Links Reviews Jun 14, 2011 June 14, 2011 Butter London Lady Muck Nail Lacquer Butter London Lady Muck Nail Lacquer ($14.00 for 0.4 fl. oz.) is described as a “powdery periwinkle blue, slightly on the grey side and infused with pearl pigment for a soft, sexy sheen.” Whew, talk about a description ! It’s a dusty, gray-blue with pale silver-white shimmer. It seemed most comparable to Rescue Beauty Lounge’s Concrete Jungle–but Lady Muck has pale silver shimmer. (You can compare this shade against other blues in the Swatch Gallery .) It was opaque in two coats, and it had a natural sheen to it, though I think the majority will still prefer a shiny top coat on top. Butter London’s formula on this one has a really even flow, smooth application, and drying time wasn’t long at all. I typically get a week of wear with Butter London’s formula with a proper base and top coat. I’ve always thought of periwinkle as something a little deeper, with more purple in the mix, compared to this dusty, grayed blue. Googling showed a lot of results, some more to what I always imagined as periwinkle, but there were a few variations that leaned bluer, closer to Lady Muck. Don’t you wish there was some standardized language we beauty enthusiasts could converse in? Butter London negates a lot of the traditional view of periwinkle, because it adds powdery, blue, and grey on top of it, which really does seem like what Lady Muck is all about (so no points taken off for color inaccuracy). 17 1 Lady Muck 17 1 Lady Muck A+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Amazon DermStore Net-A-Porter Skinstore.com b-glowing LookFantastic FeelUnique Beauty Brands Butter London 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 99% Total Read Full Review']",dabe12461bd7083ec510a52cf045f5e0c26bd581,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tag/butter-london-lady-muck-nail-lacquer/,['2011-06-14 00:00:00']
"['Urban Decay 24/7 Shadow Pencils (Part 2) Sample Reviews Dec 04, 2010 December 04, 2010 24/7 Shadow Pencils : Clinic, Narc, Clash, Delinquent, Morphine, Barracuda Urban Decay 24/7 Shadow Pencils: Part 2 For spring, Urban Decay’s launching a brand new product: 24/7 Glide-On Shadow Pencils ($20.00 for 0.10 oz.), which come in twelve different shades. There are six included in this post: Clinic (deep peacock green with fine green sparkle), Narc (mossy green sheen), Clash (bright electric blue with fine silver sparkle), Delinquent (deep jewel purple with fine purple sparkle), Morphine (iridescent lilac), and Barracuda (black with fine silver sparkle). Clinic is a rich, jewel-tone teal with green-teal sheen and light silver sparkle. It is similar to Covet 24/7 Liner , but Clinic seems more green-based. Narc is a darkened grassy green tinged with olive dusted with gold sparkle. It compares best with Mildew 24/7 Liner , but it is noticeably greener and warmer. Clash is a brilliant bright blue with silver sparkle. It is extremely similar to Electric 24/7 Liner –if I look closely, it seems like Clash is slightly brighter. Delinquent is deep purple violet with lilac sparkle. It’s such a stunning jewel-tone shade. It is completely different from Lust 24/7 Liner , and it doesn’t compare to Ransom 24/7 Liner either. Morphine is an iridescent cool-toned bluish-lilac with some fuchsia in its base. I thought it might compare to Asphyxia 24/7 Liner , but it’s much, much lighter, more iridescent, and really does not have much in common with Asphyxia . Barracuda is a darkened black with silver sparkle. I couldn’t distinguish it from Oil Slick 24/7 Liner , and it is slightly darker than Uzi 24/7 Liner . Of this set, Delinquent and Morphine are the most unique, while the other four have similar shades in the 24/7 Liner line. This is predicated on you already owning the liner counterparts and not feeling the need to spring for jumbo-sized versions to use as an eyeshadow base. The 24/7 Liners are still much easier to use as eyeliners, because they are smaller and therefore more precise and suited for the lash line. However, you do get significantly more bang for your buck with the 24/7 Shadows, so if you don’t own one of the 24/7 Liners that compares but always wanted to, perhaps the 24/7 Shadow version will serve you well. These really do feel like jumbo-sized 24/7 Liners–they are smooth, creamy, and glide across the lid with ease. I will say that these seem more pigmented than the 24/7 Liners. You really get true color with one stroke, and even lighter shades go on opaque. I wore Clinic (to-be-reviewed) on one eye and Midnight Cowboy on the other eye for twelve hours yesterday, and I didn’t experience any creasing. I wore them both all over the lid and above the crease, applied with the pencil itself, and straight on the lid (no primer). I later wore just Rehab all over the lid and above the crease, blended out with fingertips, with Rehab over Urban Decay’s Primer Potion on one lid and by itself on the other. This test was more about blendability and how it would work over a base. It dries down quickly; it’s smudgeable and blendable for 15-20 seconds, but you’ll want to work pretty fast if you’re blending two or more of the Shadow Pencils together. Lighter shades like Sin, Lit, and Midnight Cowboy are beautiful all-over lid shades–for those mornings where all you have are two minutes to spare. They are shorter than 24/7 Liners (just over 5.5?), but they are definitely fatter–they also contain over twice the product (.10 oz. vs. 0.04 oz.) and only cost $3 more ($20 vs. $17). In terms of high-end products, they compare to NARS Shadow Pencils in look (doesn’t migrate), but they perform well, like MAC Shade Sticks (creamier, though). I’m pleasantly surprised at how the price/quantity worked out here. All in all, I’m liking these so far, and they make excellent colored eyeshadow bases that can also double as eyeliner. So far, I’ve found they adhere well to the lid without creasing or fading. P.S. — I have to see what NYX pencils I have, but I will try to do some comparisons later this weekend (school all day). If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 29/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 5/5 RECOMMENDATION: If you like Urban Decay’s 24/7 Liners, I think you’ll like these. Whether you use these as eyeliner or as an eyeshadow, they work as well, if not better, than the 24/7 Liners–since they’re more pigmented.

I’m missing a few that I expect will be in this range (specifically, one pink and two oranges), so I left blank spots for them that way I do not have to rearrange everything when I eventually buy them. 382 is a medium-dark blue-based red with a matte finish. This shade seems comparable to Make Up For Ever #158 (slightly brighter) and #99 (bluer undertones). 362 is a bright, just-darker-than bubblegum pink with a matte finish. 319 is a pale cotton candy pink with blue undertones and a matte finish. 359 is a muted rosy beige with a matte finish. 356 is a lightened rose-tinted beige with a matte finish. These are really soft mattes; they have a really buttery feel to them, where you can feel the powder loosening as you swatch. They aren’t particularly powdery, though they’ll kick up a little dust if you are heavy handed with your brush. A little product goes a long way, so there’s no reason to jab at the eyeshadow with a brush (something you might have done with past matte eyeshadows). The softness and give allow these to apply smoothly and evenly; there is no patchiness or drag with these. The only downside to these is if you really pack on the color, you might find that it fades (ever-so-marginally) after eight hours; it’s a very minimal drawback, resulting in 0.5 point reduction in longevity. Overall, these five shades had excellent color payoff and lovely textures. Even the lightest, #356, applied smoothly and never looked chalky.

"['Make Up For Ever Aqua Liner Launches Year: 2011 Launches Apr 26, 2011 April 26, 2011 Make Up For Ever Aqua Liner Launches Staying true to our belief of never having to sacrifice color for performance, MAKE UP FOR EVER introduces another vibrant addition to our award-winning Aqua range – new Aqua Liner. This eye-catching, highly pigmented new collection of waterproof liquid eye liner was developed to outperform even in the most extreme environments. Aqua Liner was created to provide make up artists with the ultimate liquid liner that boasts precision, a 100% waterproof formula and a bold assortment of colors. As the official make up sponsor of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Swim in Miami, MAKE UP FOR EVER put artists to work at the top 2011 swimwear shows testing Aqua Liner on models backstage. Their challenge was to create bold, show-stopping make up looks that wouldn’t melt or fade while on the runway under hot lights, performing in the water, or in the humid Miami climate. The end result? Aqua Liner guaranteed intense weather, tear and sweat-proof color that lasted through the shows. Aqua Liner is formulated with acrylic copolymer, a hydrophobic macromolecule that forms a flexible film to lock water out. It contains 50% more polymers than traditional eyeliner formulations to ensure a long-lasting, waterproof result, as well as essential amino acids derived from apple juice for high-color intensity and bold pay-off. Available in 15 vibrant shades with matte, iridescent and diamond finishes, Aqua Liner can be used to match all moods and styles. The long and dense, yet flexible applicator is designed like a make up brush handle to ensure easy application, with a specialized foam tip that delivers the ideal amount of texture for drawing an ultra precise line with a buildable result. Aqua Liner goes on evenly and dries quickly for a look that lasts all day and all night long. #1 Diamond Gold #3 Iridescent Emerald Green #4 Diamond Lagoon Green #5 Diamond Turquoise Blue #6 Iridescent Navy Blue #7 Diamond Black Purple #8 Iridescent Electric Purple #9 Iridescent Fuchsia #10 Iridescent Red #11 Diamond Burgundy #12 Mat Mocha #13 Mat Black #14 Diamond Multicolor Black #15 Iridescent Anthracite availability: Sephora , $23 each Check out face charts and step-by-step liner tutorial! Make Up For Ever’s National Educator, Jessie Powers, gives a lesson in Liquid Liner 101 with these four steps: 1. Draw a thin line of liquid liner centered on the upper lash line directly above the pupil. 2. To create the liner “tail”, choose the end point of your tail slightly above and outside the natural lash line. Then, with your eyes open and focused forward, draw a line from the tail’s end point down toward the outer corner of the lash line. 3. Next, with the eyes open and focused forward, draw a line from the end of the tail connecting it to the liner on the center of the upper lash line. Continue these strokes until the tail is completely filled in. 4. Finally, draw a liner from the inner corner of the upper lash line to the middle of the upper lash line, connecting the two sections.']",fb3fe4036d0aaa25f125e3b7499330d24814c545,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/make-up-for-ever-aqua-liner-launches/,['2011-04-26 00:00:00']

"[""MAC Green is Green Zoom Lash Mascara Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Apr 26, 2011 April 26, 2011 MAC Green is Green Mascara MAC Colored Zoom Lash Mascara Though MAC’s Flighty Collection has stirred up buzz over the Big Bounce Shadows, there are also four shades of colored Zoom Lash Mascara. I have Green is Green ($14.00 for 0.28 oz.) to review for now (the rest to follow once I have them–probably not late this week or early next). This shade is described as “jade green,” and it’s a dark, cool-toned green with a little hint of teal. The actual tube is similarly colored. Zoom Lash is supposed to “build density,” while the “ultra-sculpted brush has three-sided fibres to embrace and separate each lash.” My favorite MAC mascara is Plushlash, but I used to use Zoom Lash for quite a bit (because Plushlash didn’t exist). I like how it’s a really thick formula–thick as in it really coats each lash really well in the formula but without clumping. Zoom Lash, being a thicker consistency, will clump if you start going beyond two coats, though. (In my experience, you shouldn’t need more than two.) Zoom Lash separates and defines lashes while thickening them for me. I didn’t have any issues with the mascara flaking or smudging on me. Green is Green is rather similar in color to Army of Amazons , which launched in Wonder Woman. The color of Green is Green seems a little richer in color, more depth. The Zoom Lash formula works better than Opulash for the color, though, because with colored mascara over black lashes (which mine are), I need the thickness of the Zoom Lash formula to really have a chance of my lashes looking green. They look green from up close and afar, but the effect is still subtle from afar. Colored mascara will also stand out more with a lighter background–like neutral/light eyeshadows on the lid. You can also use a white-colored lash primer to enhance colored mascara. The color coverage here is good but not totally opaque over my black lashes.

"[""MAC Fashion Flower Lipgelees Swatches, Photos, Reviews Sample Reviews Apr 27, 2011 April 27, 2011 MAC Fashion Flower Lipgelee MAC Fashion Flower: Lipgelees The collection features three shades of Lipgelee (each $14.50 for 0.10 oz.) — Budding Beauty (pale coral with pearl pigment), Fashion Flower (pale pink with pearl pigment), and Now in Season (pale yellow with pearl pigment). Budding Beauty is a coral melon with pink and gold shimmer. It has more of a shimmery finish than the glittery texture of Fashion Flower and Now in Season. When applied, it has a very milky melon look–semi-sheer for sure, though. Love Nectar lustreglass seems like the closest permanent dupe. Fashion Flower is a pink-tinged gloss with lots of pink and silver glitter. It’s a lot like the previous launches of Lipgelees (Lillyland, Cham-Pale) — super glittery, little color, lots of sparkle. I’d say it’s most like Luxure, but applied, Fashion Flower pulls pinker. Now in Season is a pale yellow gold with multicolored shimmer of teal, gold, and silver. This felt so sticky, which is uncharacteristic of lipgelees. When worn, it doesn’t deliver much color, just lots of shimmer/glitter. It’s surprisingly similar to Bubble Lounge when worn, since the color base doesn’t show up. my thoughts on the formula: MAC Lipgelees are moisturizing, easy to apply, and last three to four hours on me. They are a thicker formula, more like a gel, and come in squeeze tubes. They have a non-sticky texture, are vanilla-scented, and a sheer formula, but these are noticeably sticky. There is some glitter migration (maybe four or five flecks), but it didn’t seem like rapid migration nor did it stray into the far reaches of my face or hair or somehow wander to my feet. I have always loved that the Lipgelees come with 0.5 oz. of product–nearly double even large-sized glosses. After they wear away, they can sometimes feel gritty, because of the abundance of glitter.

"[""Benefit Cha Cha Tint Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Apr 26, 2011 April 26, 2011 Benefit Cha Cha Tint Benefit Cha Cha Tint Coming in June, Benefit Cha Cha Tint ($29.00 for 0.42 fl. oz.) is described as a “mango-tinted lip & cheek stain.” It has the same feel and formula as Posietint (in contrast to Benetint, which doesn’t look creamy or milky). Though it looks rather bright and orange when you initially remove the applicator, it’s a much subtler color when used. It’s a very gentle blushing of peach with orange underpinnings (no pink here!). I patted the color on my cheeks with about three light pats, then lightly blended with my fingertips. This is a great product for summer months when the weather gets hot, activities head outdoors, and traveling picks up. It wears all day (12 hours) as a soft, peachy flush and really does look natural–just as a stain should. What’s nice about Benefit’s Cha Cha Tint formula is that there is just enough to blend it out without having to worry about waiting for it to dry. It works well over or underfoundation as well as on bare skin. If you plan to wear it under foundation, just remember you’ll want to build the color up to slightly more than what you want, as foundation over it will mute some of the color, depending on the coverage level of your foundation. The texture is that thickened water–it’s relatively thin and liquidy. The color is buildable by layering the color or applying more (again, I used three soft, tiny dots of color on my cheeks). It won’t get quite as intense as the color looks in the heavier swatch, but the formula is supposed to be sheer and add just a flush to skin. It can also be used on lips, and it works well there–better than Posietint for me. It added a surprising amount of color to my lips, though; kind of a brighter, apricot pink. Because of my natural lip color, the color it tints my lips isn’t quite the same as my cheeks! It wore well on lips, too–about eight hours. 30 15 Cha Cha 30 15 Cha Cha A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Boots Sephora (Australia) HSN FeelUnique Escentual Sephora (PL) Benefit (UK) Benefit 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 4 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It’s not quite as deep as Urban Decay Loaded , but the colors are similar–Loaded just has a blacker base, while NARS Rajastha n is bluer. The packaging is simple cardboard, which makes these easy to stack and store, plus a little more eco-friendly than plastic, though it may not stand up to wear and tear as prettily as plastic. I think the cardboard is plenty durable, but you may get a couple dents and scratches over the months/years. my thoughts on the formula: theBalm’s eyeshadows are soft, silky smooth, and packed with pigment. They apply evenly, blend out beautifully, and aren’t powdery at all (sometimes a side effect of really soft eyeshadows). I find they are so easy to use, because they apply without fall out and blend with other shadows effortlessly. Worth noting, too, is individual eyeshadows come with 0.12 oz., which is just over double the average eyeshdaow–and at a rather affordable price tag.

"['Sugarpill Heart Breaker Eyeshadow Palette Sample Reviews May 19, 2012 May 19, 2012 Sugarpill Heart Breaker Eyeshadow Palette Sugarpill Heart Breaker Eyeshadow Palette Sugarpill Heart Breaker Eyeshadow Palette ($34.00 for 0.56 oz.) includes four new shades from the brand: Acidberry (vibrant lime green, matte with slightly pearl sheen), Velocity (vibrant matte royal blue), 2AM (matte purple with a slightly pearl sheen), and Mochi (matte mint seafoam with a slightly pearl sheen). Acidberry is a green-chartreuse with golden yellow undertones and a very fine sheen. It has pretty good color payoff and a soft, dense texture but is a little powdery. Illamasqua Pivot is a smidgen darker and totally matte in finish. MAC Lucky Green is yellower, very frosted. MAC Swimming is darker. Make Up For Ever #304 is lighter and yellower. Make Up For Ever #171 is lighter and frosted. Sugarpill Absinthe is darker, less yellow. Velocity is a medium-dark vibrant royal blue with a matte finish. It has good pigmentation but is a little powdery. Sugarpill Royal Sugar is similar but has a slightly bluer base and lots of sparkle. Milani Runway Eyes is bluer, darker. Tarina Tarantino Violet Storm is very similar but frosted. NARS Outremer is darker. MAC Cobalt is purpler. MAC Atlantic Blue is darker. 2AM is a brightened eggplant purple with a dusting of lilac-white shimmer. The color payoff was actually really good applied to the lid, though it swatches a smidgen sheerer. Bobbi Brown Ultra Violet is similar but more muted. MAC Power Boosted is purpler and frosted. NYX Violetta is more muted and has gold sparkle. Bare Escentuals Boudoir is pinker. MAC Vibrant Grape is much darker. Urban Decay Purple Haze is purpler. Make Up For Ever #89 is more fuchsia. Mochi is a light-medium aqua with a satiny sheen. It was more pigmented when I applied it to my lid, and it was the easiest shade out of the four to work with. MAC Aqua is lighter, greener. MAC Aquadisiac is darker, slightly greener. Make Up For Ever #302 is darker, grayer. Milani Caribbean Sea is frosted and bluer. Inglot #345 is greener. I did a super quick look with this palette yesterday, because I’ve been anticipating it all week! My favorite shade was Mochi , because it was really intensely pigmented when I applied it, and it was soft and smooth. I did have some powder excess that kicked up when I was working with Acidberry and Velocity , but Velocity had very little, and Velocity is the type of color that never swatches half as good as it performs during application. I’ve consistently seen this type of blue shade become beautiful, rich in color, and blendable on the lid, and Velocity is true to this, though it swatches decently. Acidberry also didn’t want to adhere to my lid nearly as well as the other shades! 2AM was soft, smooth, and it wasn’t powdery at all–it also had much better color payoff when applied to the lid. Purple-based eyeshadows can be horrendous, but 2AM proves that with enough skill, an excellent purple can be made. I wore all four shades on one eye with a primer and on the other eye without a primer. It held up well both ways with no creasing after eight hours, but there was some slight (but noticeable) fading around the edges when worn without a primer. The palette is made out of heavy-duty cardboard with a semi-matte black finish and then Sugarpill’s logo and the like on the front and back. It can withstand a lot more dropping and tossing around than a product in a plastic compact. It stays closed with a magnetic on the edge of the palette. There’s a full-sized mirror on the interior of the lid. The only thing you may find annoying is that the palette always lies flat once you open it–the mirror portion doesn’t stand up at an angle at all (I’m holding it up in the photo to get it to look that way). Each shade is also available individually for $12.00/0.14 oz.–buying the palette saves you $14, which is like getting one shade for free, so as long as you like at least three shades in the palette, I’d opt for the palette. If you only like one or two shades, then I’d go the individual route.

I actually found that Green is Green did the best at coating lashes, with Blue Charge close behind. Plum Reserve and High Esteem didn’t coat my lashes as effectively and didn’t give them much color. Blue Charge is darker than Themyscira, while Plum Reserve is darker and purpler than Victorious. I think you’ll notice less color difference when they are worn, though, but swatched, their differences are easily seen. my thoughts on the mascara formula: Zoom Lash is supposed to “build density,” while the “ultra-sculpted brush has three-sided fibres to embrace and separate each lash.” My favorite MAC mascara is Plushlash, but I used to use Zoom Lash for quite a bit (because Plushlash didn’t exist). I like how it’s a really thick formula–thick as in it really coats each lash really well in the formula but without clumping. Zoom Lash, being a thicker consistency, will clump if you start going beyond two coats, though. (In my experience, you shouldn’t need more than two.) Zoom Lash separates and defines lashes while thickening them for me. I didn’t have any issues with the mascara flaking or smudging on me.

It is such a gorgeous duo that’s wearable and so perfect for fall. I love that it’s not a smoky plum but a charcoal black smoked out base with layers of metallic and navy blue all woven together. It may look a little on the cooler side, but warmer beauties will have no problem turning this into something lovely on the eyes. The pigmentation is spot-on–it looks just like it does in the pan–while the texture is exactly what you’d expect from NARS: smooth and buttery.

"['MAC Cosmetics Dame Edna Collection Review Reviews Dec 23, 2008 December 23, 2008 OVERALL , Dame Edna’s lipsticks stand out the most for me, because they are ultra-pigmented and extremely creamy in texture. They almost have a matte-look, but because of their sheen, not quite so. The lipglasses are not as pigmented as the lipsticks, but on the other hand, they complement the lipsticks well. The eye trios disappointed me, mostly because I felt that too many of the shadows had a chalky texture, which I just can’t jive with. Another downside to this launch is the fact that MAC has, yet again, used stickers on their packaging. On the eyeshadow trios, the stickers are covered with plastic/something so they shouldn’t come off (at least not easily), but everything else is just a flat sticker. It’s nothing special, and you can certainly peel it off if you desire. The high-light powders, while pretty to look at, are not nearly as special once you get past the shimmer overspray–I felt duped with these; it reminded me of lipsticks that had a gold overspray and then regular lipstick underneath. The collection is definitely worth a look or two, but I wouldn’t say you have to rush out on the 26th–not worth skipping out on your holidays and festivities and family fun yet! Individual reviews of the products … Wisteria Eye Trio Wisteria is a pretty medium blue, not quite as bright as it looks in the pan. It has average pay off, but it is buildable enough that over a base, so it should give you the color you see in the pan. It’s a little chalky, but it’s not so much that it puts me off. Divine Night is yet another kind of chalky black that’s not really super-intense-wow-black. You have to really get a few passes of it to get a richer black color. It reminds me of Mont Black from Chill, which just came out. I wasn’t ready to see it again! Fineshine is a bright shimmery silver shade, kind of like Electra, but brighter. It’s a nice color to brighten up a gray/silver smoky eye. Royal Tour Eye Trio Royal Tour is a light purply-pink shade–it’s like a pinker version of lavender. It’s matte/satin (I don’t remember exactly), but it doesn’t have any shimmer in it. Dame’s Desire is a nice medium purple with a little bit of fuchsia tone to it that has a nice sheen to its finish. It reminds me of Stars ‘n Rockets, but not as intense (or as fuchsia). Climate Blue is a rich purple-blue shade. It came out with Cool Heat, during this past summer, so it is a repromote. It has a chalky texture, so it’s not my favorite just because of that. Lipstick Kanga Rouge is a deep matte red, but it is very creamy and has a nice subtle sheen. Coral Polyp is an intense creamy coral-orange-red shade. It’s not an easy color to just wear, because it is very bold and dramatic. Gladiola is a fuchsia-toned purple, and it again, has an essentially matte finish with the same creamy texture as the other two lipsticks. It reminds me a little of Up the Amp lipstick. Lipglass Splendid is a very shimmery/glittery coral color–it’s very similar to Possum Nose Pink, though it’s a little paler. I would also say it probably has better color pay off on the lips. Hot Frost is the medium pink-based lipglass with lots of multi-colored shimmer. It’s pretty, but when I put it on my lips, I didn’t notice a huge difference–I really wanted to like this one. Possum Nose Pink is a brighter coral shade with pink and multicolored shimmer in it. It goes on fairly sheer from when I swatched it on my lipss. It’s kind of like a pink-based Pink Grapefruit or less shimmery Lychee Luxe. High-Light Powder What a Dame! is a peachy-bige shade that’s pretty much matte after you get the top layer of shimmer/spray-on sheen off. It reminds me of previous beauty powders (I think maybe from Fafi or Heatherette). It feels a little more pigmented, but these were pretty heavy swatches so I’m not 100% sure. Spectacle is a pretty pale pink shade. The thing with the high-light powders is that the sheen/shimmer is just an overspray. It doesn’t actually penetrate the product. The actual product is flat or matte and feels very powdery. This shade reminded me a lot of Alpha Girl. Nail Lacquer Varicose Violet is a purpler version of Stars ‘n Rockets, but in nail lacquer form. I like it, and i do think it’s a rather pretty shade with its blue-shimmer. It doesn’t apply as pigmented as I like for my polish, but with three thin coats, you can get there. Asiatique is a deep cream red shade with a lot of natural shine to the polish afterwards (the swatch for it doesn’t have any top coat), which is nice.']",e10ebdd6c478236b775a6be521987405e2c33fb3,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-dame-edna-collection-review/,['2008-12-23 00:00:00']

"['Bobbi Brown Orchid Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 04, 2010 March 04, 2010 Bobbi Brown Color Strips: Orchid Palette Bobbi Brown Orchid Palette ($60.00) is an eye, cheek, and lip palette from Bobbi Brown’s Color Strips Collection , which includes three palette variations. I’m typically wary of any palette that has lip wells in them, but I was excited, for these aren’t just the typical lip color, these are Pot Rouges, which are designed for cheeks and lips. Pot Rouge Powder Pink is a creamy rosy pink that can be layered for an opaque look on lips or sheered out for an everyday blusher on cheeks. Pale Pink is a cool-toned blue-based pink that feels creamy and goes on fairly opaque. Sand Pink is a creamy coral-beige shade. I don’t see a lot of pink in this, but it’s a muted, played-down coral that will work well on warm skin tones in particular. Eyeshadow White is a matte white. It’s a muted white, so it’s not a bright, totally unwearable white. Dusty Plum (Metallic) is a mauvey-plum with a shimmery finish. It has that “metallic” feel, like it’s almost wet you swatch it. Orchid Sparkle is a sheer, sparkly lilac–very light, very sheer, and prone to fall out. Mulberry is a richly pigmented royal purple with a matte finish. Like a lot of mattes, it applies better when you use a brush than anything else. I don’t have a shade quite like this. Caviar is a dark black-brown with a matte finish. Oddly enough, my favorite part about this palette are the Pot Rouges. After trying Cabo Coral last month, I was curious about the other shades of Pot Rouge, and this is a good way to try out three new shades. All three were very creamy and pigmented, and they’re wearable on both cheeks and lips, so they do double-duty. The eyeshadows didn’t get me too excited–I really liked Mulberry , though–I’m not sold on these five together. I can see a few combos, but usually I see a lot of combos in Bobbi Brown’s palettes and that wasn’t the case here. Orchid Sparkle is a throwaway shade for me, just because I know it’s a pain in the butt to use and it’s incredibly sheer; to make it work, try wearing it over a dark, metallic base. Dusty Plum Metallic would be my other shade favorite, because it’s smooth, pigmented, and versatile. I like Bobbi Brown’s palette packaging, because the palette itself is sleek, but it’s practical, too. The cheek/lip shades are separated from the eyeshadows quite well, and each palette also has a clear lid that flips up to further protect the shades from dirt and dust.

"['How to Take Great Photos with Makeup Features Apr 26, 2011 April 26, 2011 How to Take Great Photos with Makeup I’ve had several questions and requests regarding what makeup to wear for special occasions such as prom and weddings, so here are some tips! Wear What You Love Confidence is totally killer when it comes to pulling off any makeup look, whether it’s eyes done to the nines or just a bit of foundation. It’s important to wear products and colors that you’re comfortable wearing. Don’t let anyone push you into wearing more (or less!) than you feel happy wearing. If you don’t wear a lot of makeup and hate the way it feels on the skin–don’t think you have to wear full coverage foundation just to look good in photos. I also recommend, if you feel like you’re going a little out of your comfort zone, wearing the look prior to your special occasion to really see if it works for you. Perfect the Skin One of the things most often noticed first in photograph is skin, which really does round off any look you wear–it’s all about having a great canvas to work off of. Keep in mind that products that promise dewy finishes do not always work well in photographs, particularly flash photography, because they can give skin an oilier look. Another product to watch for is sunscreen, such as those with physical sunscreens, because they reflect light back, and this is what gives you a washed out look in flash photography. You may also want to test out any translucent powders you use, too, which can sometimes give a white cast in photos. If you’re not sure, try taking a few photos at home with flash and seeing how it goes. Whether you apply eye makeup before or after foundation, make sure to remove any excess fall out, because you do not want any additional shadowing on the under eye. Eye brightening products and concealers are good for adding lightness to tired eyes, too, which can often be apparent in photos. However, make sure you really pay attention to blending so that the transitions between products and shades is natural and seamless. Long Days, Longer Prep For special occasions that span hours, such as weddings, proms, and the like, make time for proper prep to ensure longer wear out of your makeup. A lot of this entails layering products, which helps products adhere and stay on better and longer. Begin with moisturizer and allow it plenty of time to really sink in (typically 20 to 30 minutes), and then follow with a foundation primer, which will help smooth the surface of skin. Many primers also help combat oiliness, but it can depend on the formulation. Depending on your skin type, you may also want to consider using a cream or gel blush, and if you really want to go the extra mile, set it with powder (or a similar colored blush). Foundation should also be set with powder (loose, pressed, translucent, whatever!), and for long days, carry around a pressed powder compact for touch-ups. It is with great hope that you won’t need to touch-up, but oilier skin types may still find it necessary. Just a slight application of more powder can help take down any oiliness and give skin a fresher look. Lips can go through a layering process, too, or you can simply reapply as necessary. Exfoliate lips the night before, and apply a good lip balm to moisturize lips about an hour before you go to apply any lip products. Before you apply colored products, gently remove any excess balm that didn’t absorb (I usually just kiss the back of my hand). At this point, you can fill in your lips using lip liner in a shade that matches your natural lip color or that of your lipstick. Using a brush tends to provide more precise color application but also helps to cover lips in a very even layer. For longer wearing lipsticks, opt for matte, semi-matte, or satin finishes. Drier finishes tend to cling more to lips and therefore last longer. Similarly, darker colors (such as reds) tend to last longer than lighter colors (such as nudes). When in Doubt, Test! Whenever feasible, consider testing out your look at home or at some point in time before the special occasion takes place. If you have a camera, you can take your own photos to see how everything looks and make adjustments as necessary.']",342bf550c4835c7ef2cdf49267c35638b015a5c8,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/how-to-take-great-photos-with-makeup/,['2011-04-26 00:00:00']

Chanel Destinee is similar but a little darker, touch more red in it. MAC Deliciously Forbidden is deeper, darker. MAC Positively Dashing is darker, less bright. MAC Red Dwarf is much darker.

I’m a huge fan of Bobbi Brown’s Rich Lip Color–the formula really resonated with me when it initially debuted. The formula is supposed to be long-wearing, moisturizing, and yield “pure, crisp color.” It’s a lightweight lipstick with rich, opaque color payoff. The look is creamy, but there’s not too much slip once applied yet it applies easily and glides over the lips for full color coverage in a single pass. While not all the formula’s shades wear as long, this deeper shade wore well for just over six hours and needed a reapplication after eight hours.

The oil-free, longwearing formula provides a seamless finish that never looks heavy. Apply with the patented ergonomic sponge that contours the face for a flawless application and you are ready for the spotlight! I’ve yet to try this product, but I’m definitely intrigued. I say this because only recently I have had some foundation woes about my foundation *not* matching my face in certain lighting (mostly when I spy myself in the flip-down mirror in my boyfriend’s car!). It is designed to make your skinless flawless in high-def TV (think Cargo blu-ray collection). It is a long-wearing, buildable foundation that keeps skin looking natural in all light. It is also supposed to minimize the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and pores (gimme!). It’s also oil-free, fragrance-free, and non-acnegenic according to Prescriptives.

Update (3/4/10): Everything is now reviewed and all that! ? The Mineralize Blush Duos are soft, smooth, and have kind of a “dirty” look to them, overall. I’m not a big mineralize blush fan because they have a tendency to break me out, so I rarely wear them. I also find that they fade faster than a typical powder blush, so they’ve just never been worth the breakout-potential! Rhapsody in Two is the only one I really liked, as the others just felt too “dirty” for my personal preference. I’d say Bi-Tone might be my second favorite, if you made me pick one! Mineralize Blush Duos ($23.00) Bi-Tone is contains a pinky plum and a coppery gold. Together, they create a muted, coppery coral-red with golden shimmer. Buddy Up is a mix of muted plum and brightened pink. When swirled, they create a muted reddened plum shade that goes on fairly sheerly and doesn’t have too much glitter. Chic Couple is a duo of peachy-copper and neutral brown with gold-green shimmer. The two mix to form a very bronzy brown with orange undertones and gold shimmer. Rhapsody in Two is a mix of light yellow-pink and light peach-orange with a frost finish. The two create a a lightened, played down pink champagne, almost. I think may end up being a favorite for many, though I see it being used primarily as a highlighter. This is the only one that really caught my attention. Sun & Moon is predominantly beige-y brown with pink-brown chunks within it. Together, they swirl to form a peachy copper brown with pink and gold shimmer. When used lightly, it can look very soft and pretty, but intensified, and I think it may feel too orange. Two Virtues is a mixture of a cool-tone, blue-based frosty medium pink with violet-purple pieces. Together, they make a light medium pink with silver shimmer. The violet doesn’t really come through that much. It can be layered on more heavily for a pinker look, but it’s fairly sheer.

"[""Bobbi Brown Ultra Violet Sheer Color Lip Gloss Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Feb 19, 2012 February 19, 2012 Bobbi Brown Ultra Violet Sheer Color Lip Gloss Bobbi Brown Ultra Violet Sheer Color Lip Gloss ($23.00 for 0.24 fl. oz.) is described as a “sheer violet pink.” It’s a sheer pop of purpled pink with cool, berry-like undertones. This formula is supposed to be sheer, so the color is just right; it’s noticeable but not dominating and lets the natural lip color come through. I couldn’t think of a perfect dupe for the color, though. Illamasqua Move has similar coloring but it’s opaque, so it looks very different. The formula feels non-sticky initially, but there is a subtle tackiness that develops over the two-and-a-half hour wear time (which never amounts to enough tackiness to call it sticky, though). The gloss adds a little color with a lot of shine–the real selling feature of the gloss is that juicy shine it gives off. It has a thinner consistency, so it feels lightweight once applied to lips. Like Bobbi Brown’s other glosses, it has a mint scent and comes in a square tube with a doe-foot applicator. 1 2 Ultra Violet 1 2 Ultra Violet B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 8.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 7 Longevity 4 Application 86% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Cremesheen glass is vanilla-scented and a non-sticky gloss that tends to be sheerer when applied to lips. I was pleasantly surprised to see a few more pigmented shades included in the launch (and now added to the permanent range, from what I have been told), like Double Dare. These are packaged in the lengthened tube like Dazzleglass, and they don’t contain nearly as much product as traditional lipglass and lustreglass do (0.08 oz. vs. 0.17 oz.) and are $4 more. Update: Loud & Lovely review, photos, swatches, and so forth now included! ? 3/4/10 My favorites are Double Dare and Richer, Lusher! What are yours? Cremesheen Glass ($18.00) Partial to Pink is a yellow-pink with subtle gold shimmer. On my lips, it looks like a milky baby pink with decent coverage but still a bit sheer. This is a repromoted shade. Double Dare is a slightly toned-down creamy red with no real shimmer. Once applied, it looks like an almost coral-red with a very glossy finish. Kind of makes me think “juicy.” Just Superb is a neutral pink that might lean just a smidgen blue-pink, but it’s fairly neutral. It looks a lot like Partial to Pink, but more muted, on my lips. Richer, Lusher is a creamy, peach coral. Despite looking so rich when swatched on skin, once on my lips, it gives them a very light, pinky-peach look, but definitely nothing like the tube! Fashion Scoop is a sheer, shimmered icy blue-pink. When I applied this to my lips, it gave me a paler, milkier pink lip with noticeable shimmer (this is one of the more shimmery shades of Cremesheen Glass). This is a repromoted shade. Over Indulgence is a creamy, kind of milky, slightly warmed-up brown. Though it looks rather brown in the swatch, on my lips it’s surprisingly wearable–it’s like a muted peachy-brown on my lips. Boy Bait is a creamy peachy nude. I know this is a favorite amongst fans of Cremesheen Glass, but it doesn’t do much on my lips — kind of a creamy look, but seems to emphasize my lip lines. This is a repromote. Deelight is a milky, muted plum. This looks very natural on my lips, because my lips are naturally a pinked plum with a little bit of corpse thrown in. Loud & Lovely is a brightened medium-deep pink that goes on semi-sheer–it’s not an opaque gloss (I was kind of anticipating coverage like Double Dare), but it does give more color than the average Cremesheen Glass.

"['Urban Decay’s New Spring 2009 24/7 Liners: Graffiti, Flipside, Underground, Ransom Reviews Jan 09, 2009 January 09, 2009 A week or so ago, I posted about Urban Decay releasing four new shades of their coveted 24/7 Eye Liners . They are every bit as amazing as the shades before them! Graffiti is a brighter, grassy green. Flipside is a fun, bright poolside blue with an aqua sheen. Underground is a revved up medium-to-dark brown with subtle sheen. Of the four, Ransom is absolutely worth getting. Ransom is a stunning, decadent jewel-tone royal purple. If you only get one, get Ransom for sure! And if you’re only getting a few 24/7 liners, it should be in your top three. It’s truly just that stunning; it’s rich in the color, but it’s so pretty. The blue-purple sheen it gives off is so glam! I stopped by the Urban Decay counter yesterday to chat up a lovely artist, and she let me know that these lovelies wouldn’t be hitting the market until early to mid February. I know UrbanDecay.com has a preview of their spring products, so hopefully they won’t hold out on us too much longer! I adore the 24/7 liners immensely–seriously, I’m in the process of collecting them all! See watches of the new fab four !

They’re currently available at UrbanDecay.com, as well as Sephora (at least, in-store for me). The new colors are Catfight (bright pink), Groupie (light pink), Midnight Cowboy (beige-gold), and Stagedive (teal). And yeah, they’re pretty much amazing! If you’re into glitter liners, then I urge you to check out these. I don’t wear glitter liners that often, but I really love Urban Decay’s Heavy Metal Liners, just because they go on easily, the glitter is always the color it looks, and it lasts all day. The glitter is the colored part, while the base is clear (which is what helps the glitter adhere to wherever it’s applied). Catfight and Stagedive are my favorites; they’re both bright and fun! Midnight Cowboy is more wearable, because you can easily add it to any neutral look to kick it up a noth without going over the top.

I played with Palette d’Artiste for the Complexion ($62.00), Gloss Pur #4 (Pure Raspberry), Rouge Pur #146 (Romantic Pink), and Nail Touch #5 (Tender Pink Touch). I’m really lovin’ the Gloss Pur formula–it’s creamy, pigmented, and not sticky at all. I love me a good pigmented gloss! I’m not positive whether all of the Gloss Purs have no shimmer, but it’s nice to see a gloss that’s just gloss and shine without the shimmer. The creaminess of the lipstick is lovely, and the shade is a more wearable shade of bubblegum pink. The Nail Touch #5 is an interesting product, as it was my first time trying out a nail polish pen. I liked the experience, and it makes for a great on-the-go nail polish.

"['Dior Vintage Pink (#839) Blush (Dior Spring 2010 Collection) Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jan 13, 2010 January 13, 2010 Dior Spring 2010: A Lacy, Floral Confection Dior Vintage Pink (#839) Blush ($40.00) is a prettily designed blush duo from Dior’s Spring collection . Nearly all of the powder-based products from Dior’s Spring collection feature a raised lacy, floral embellishment. The design is fitting for the blossoms of spring, but it does fade away quickly once you start using the product. I am sure there are at least a few who will be buying just to admire, though! ? Vintage Rose is a blush duo that I’d likely wear swirled together, but you could apply from either side to pull the color one way or the other. It’s not a huge compact, but a brush can fit on each side for the most part (though opt for a smaller brush-head!). The darker side is a medium-dark pink with just a lingering of peach in it and no real shimmer. The lighter side is much more of a peach with a little pink to it–this side reminded me of a softer, more finely milled NARS Orgasm (maybe a little pinker, too). Together, they merge and create a pinker, slightly shimmered, but still lighter than the darker side color. Whether you use one side, the other, or them together, the result is lovely–but seriously, when I have I said “Stay away!” to a peachy-pink blush? Please, this had my name all over it! (Although, personally, I thought it was going to be rosier and not so warm, but it worked out for me.) I’m a really big fan of Dior’s cheek products. I think they are particularly adept at creating and delivering very useable, universal shades of color that work on a variety of skin tones and ages. You won’t find disco-ball glitter here, but you will find a smooth, silky product with buildable coverage and fine, subtle shimmer. As far as price goes, Dior is slightly cheaper ($150/oz. vs. $156/oz.) than NARS blushes, because they give you plenty of product for your money. Whether you want to plunk down $40 on one blush is another story, of course! I can’t imagine using this up unless it’s one of just a few blushes you use, but even then, you’ll have plenty to get through. I’m hoping to check out the rest of the collection in person at Nordstrom later this week! If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ?

"['Stila’s Precious Pearl Palette Kicks Off Spring with a Bang! Reviews Jan 05, 2009 January 05, 2009 Stila’s Precious Pearl Collection definitely got a lot of buzz from you guys–namely the stunning palette encased in a “mother of pearl” kind of case with six lovely shades of eyeshadow. Can I just say that the promo photos didn’t do the palette justice? The Precious Pearl Palette will be available this February for $40, and it features the following eyeshadow colors: White Gold Soft creamy white with gold shimmer Soft Pink Pristine light pink with pink and white shimmer Mid-tone Pink Neutral pink with warm undertones and pink shimmer Gold Deep gold with yellow and gold shimmer Green Intense mermaid green with blue and green shimmer Deep Blue Dark navy with black undertones and blue shimmer Too often, promotional images tell one story while swatches/actual photos tell another story–one that’s disappointing. This is certainly not the case with Stila’s palette for spring. The palette itself is prettier in person than it is in the photos, especially because Deep Blue is so much bluer and brighter than the promo photo made it look. But you know what really makes this palette awesome? It swatches like a dream! The shadows are smooth, velvety to the touch, and each shade is well pigmented. There is no chalky mess here; no misleading colors. Colors are true to appearance, and I think this bunch of colors offers a nice palette for the spring season. White Gold is a gorgeous creamy white shade with gold shimmer. I bet it would look stunning all over the lid or as a highlight (though darker skin tones may have to use a light hand so it doesn’t look OTT). Soft Pink is a frosty purple-pink shade; kind of reminds me of MAC’s Pink Opal, but deeper in color. Mid-tone Pink is really that: a medium pink; a little subdued and has less frosty shimmer and more of a nice sheen. Gold is a bronzy antique gold shade, very color-rich with the same soft sheen as Mid-tone Pink. Green is a soft greenish color with gold sheen and shimmer. Deep Blue is a rich navy blue with an almost purple-blue sheen, lightly shimmered. All in all, Stila’s Precious Pearl Palette is a delightful surprise and a great way to kick off spring. I love the textures and color pay off of every shadow, and each color is one I can see myself using. They didn’t waste your dollars by throwing in a boring or unusable shade–and they didn’t make any of them chalky or poorly pigmented. Well-done, Stila! Color me impressed. What do you think? Has the palette continued to live up to your expectations? Is this going on your to-buy list or are you passing? Check out close-up photos and swatches of the palette!

"['Barbie Loves Stila – Barbie and Stila Partner for 2009 Year: 2009 Launches Jan 09, 2009 January 09, 2009 Looks like Barbie (Mattel) and Stila will be partnering this spring. Stila will also sponsor Mattel’s Barbie runway during NYFW during February 2009. 50 designers have agreed to show Barbie-inspired fashion during the runway show. Charlotte Tilbury, makeup atist, is the show’s lead makeup artist. The limited edition line is slated to launch exclusively at Sephora in February, only at Sephora’s Fifth Avenue store in NY, international Sephora locations, and sephora.com. Expect a larger offering of Barbie-Stila branded products later, during fall 2009. The collection includes 4 “Decades of Beauty” cans ($40 each) with a booklet inside describing the beauty and fashion wardrobes for each doll. The first, #1 Ponytail Doll, celebrates the first Barbie, launched in 1959. It includes a red lipstick called Ponytail, a liquid eyeliner and a three-pan paper-wrapped compact with two eye shadows and a cheek color. Malibu Barbie, which highlights the doll of the same name that launched in 1971, has a pale pink Lip Glaze called Malibu, a black mascara and a compact with two eye shadows and a bronzer. Foxy Doll, which depicts the African-American Barbie launched in 1980, includes a Lip Glaze called Foxy, mascara and a compact with two eye shadows and a cheek color. The final offering, Jewel Doll, is based on the 2000 Barbie of the same name and includes a bright pink Lip Glaze called Jewel, a Multi-Effect Mascara and a compact with two eye shadows and a cheek color. “Stila is a brand which at the core is about fun and innovation,” said Richard Dickson, Mattel’s general manager and senior vice president for the Barbie brand, during a phone interview earlier this week from Shanghai, where he is readying the brand’s new House of Barbie flagship. “The combination of Barbie and Stila felt right.” Source : WWD']",3be620313ba3734ca838df3424651f0e44a680a3,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/barbie-loves-stila-barbie-and-stila-partner-for-2009/,['2009-01-09 00:00:00']
"['The Spring Season: Cle de Peau #2 Lip Gloss Series Jan 13, 2010 January 13, 2010 Cle de Peau #2 Lipgloss The Spring Season: Cle de Peau #2 Lip Gloss Cle de Peau #2 Lip Gloss ($47.00) has been a favorite of mine since I first swatched it on the back of my hands at Barneys (in Vegas). I still can’t believe I plunked down the bucks for this one without even trying it on! I don’t regret it, though, because it’s such a stunning golden-peach flecked gloss. I don’t know if I’d go so far as to say it’s worth every penny by any means, but I’m happy with the purchase, even over a year out. It’s mostly non-sticky, but it doesn’t have the jelly feel that a lot of non-sticky glosses have. It’s a fairly thick gloss that has decent pigmentation (particular for this kind of shade) and really stands out amongst all the Cle de Peau Lip Glosses (IMO!). I remember swatching several shades and none of them grabbed me like this one. It has an almost duochrome nature to it; it’s peachy, gold, green, apricot… Love it. It comes with a wand applicator, has little to no scent (I didn’t notice anything myself). The only shade I’ve found that’s truly comparable to it has been Le Metier de Beaute’s Payapa Creme ($36). Sheerer and not nearly as reflective dupes might include shades like MAC Nymphette Lipglass ($14) or NARS Orgasm Lipgloss ($22). It’s a pricey gloss, so it’s not going to be something just anyone will buy or will want to buy, and that’s fine. If you like indulgent buys or the ultra luxe, this is definitely one of my favorites. Is this the right spring gloss for you? Would you wear it? The Spring Season is a series of posts featuring my favorite soft beige, coral, and pink lipsticks and lipglosses — all perfect for the first blossom of spring — that runs through March 2010.

Each eyeshadow has three stripes of color. It is part of Barbie Loves Stila for Fall . MAKE A MAD DASH TO GET THIS PALETTE. LIKE… YESTERDAY! I’m a seasoned beauty addict–I’ve seen and tested and loved a plethora of products. It takes a lot to *truly* knock my socks off these days. There are a lot of great products–even amazing products–but there are fewer absolutely, positively excellent products. Stila’s All Doll’d Up Palette is one of those rare gems beauty addicts live to uncover. Not only is it a stunning combination of shades and colors chocked full of quality shadows, but it holds tremendous value. You get ten fold what you pay for. Shade rundown… Trio #1: Soft champagne with shimmer; coppery brown with a softer sheen/shimmer; a cool-toned pink with an iciness to it Trio #2: A bold lightly shimmered teal; deep grayish-brown with shimmer; iridescent violet with fuchsia undertones Trio #3: Periwinkle blue with soft shimmer sheen; a dark black-brown with silver sparkle; dirty champagne taupe with gray Trio #4: Pop of peach with gold shimmer; brown with a greenish cast; springy green with pale green-gold shimmer Every shade is silky smooth with excellent color pay off. There is not a single fussy shade; no shade that does not earn its keep and position in this packed palette. The colors are diverse and the different looks one could create are immense. I love that each trio is almost a look in itself, but you can also mix and match the shades as you please. It is just so rare to find a palette that is consistent from shade to shade and there’s no shade that feels like it was just thrown in. I absolutely recommend this palette to everyone, even the color-shy. It’s available at an incredible price, so even if you only want to experiment with color, this is a chance to get twelve high-quality shades without paying an arm and a leg. Truthfully, I would have purchased this quad for $40, easily. I wouldn’t have batted an eye!

"['NYX Goddess of the Night Lip Gloss in Deep Bronze Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Nov 16, 2009 November 16, 2009 NYX Goddess of the Night Lip Gloss in Deep Bronze Lipgloss on a Budget: NYX Deep Bronze Lip Gloss NYX Goddess of the Night Lip Gloss in Deep Bronze ($5.00 for 0.53 fl. oz.) is just one of sixty shades (from what I counted on NYX ‘s website) available in the Lipgloss with Mega Shine collection. Deep Bronze is part of the “Goddess of the Night” collection. It’s a deep plum burgundy with burnt burgundy and copper shimmer through it. The formula has a very glossy, almost frosty look, and it goes on semi-opaque–it’s not completely opaque, but it certainly is noticeable. I consider it pretty pigmented for a lip gloss, so that was a pleasant and happy surprise! The gloss itself is non-sticky, thick without being gooey, and it doesn’t feel drying when you wear it. The shade range is incredible, and you’re sure to find at least one or two that catches your eye. I wish NYX represented their colors with more true-to-life photos (rather than flat, graphical color swatches), because it would make purchasing online easier. I did notice that it didn’t last as long as the average gloss does on me; it went about two hours before I felt I needed to reapply, as opposed to my typical gloss wear-time of four hours. I also found that, at least in this deeper shade, the color did have a tendency to settle into the lines of my lips. I like these glosses, and I think that aside from the wearing time, the formula and product are certainly well worth the five dollar price tag. It’s not a big deal to reapply, because it does fade evenly and doesn’t leave any rings behind, so reapply and be on your way. (However, if you need long-wearing lip color, these won’t meet that need.) For me, the only part I really had trouble with was the very synthetic, almost plastic scent of sweetened cherries. I know that they were going for a cherry scent, but it just read synthetic and almost as if it went bad. The scent doesn’t linger, thankfully, though so just breathe through your mouth while applying! ? I have also noticed that my NYX glosses and lipsticks don’t last as long on the shelf as my other lipsticks (they noticeably change in smell/texture after a year or so)–I had some NYX glosses from a year or so ago, but Deep Bronze is new. I also wish the applicator grabbed more product, because I felt like I had to get a few swipes to get the amount I needed for the best coverage. Bottom Line: These are good glosses and worth checking out, partially because they are so affordable. The formula itself (aside from wear-time and the scent) wears well, feels nice on lips, and packs some pigmentation. If they only last a year, it’s not a big deal to chuck it and replace it the next (if you find yourself wanting it again), since they’re so inexpensive. It’s also a nice way to play and experiment with colors without blowing your budget–not to mention there’s an extensive selection of shades to choose from! NYX is one of my favorite brands if you’re on a tight budget (and certainly worth looking into even if you aren’t on a tight budget!). NYX also regularly has these ridiculous blowout sales where you can nab a ton of product for 50-80% off the original price. For example, right now they’re offering a bundle of sixty lipsticks for a mere $48. Seriously. $48! The sales change regularly, so you never know what they might offer next!

"['MAC Cosmetics Little Darlings Collection Review Reviews Nov 06, 2008 November 06, 2008 OVERALL , Little Darlings is less about offering innovative and brand-spanking-new shades as it is about great gifts to give and receive for less. Each gloss set contains five mini-sized versions of popular past and current lipglasses/lustreglasses. The case is cute, and the cover can later be used to hold glosses or brushes, too! Plus, the pigment sets are great way to collect pigments without spending a fortune–whether you’re new or experienced when it comes to MAC. You can get official collection information here , as well as product photos here . Swatches are here . See the detailed review… Little Darlings: 5 Coral Lipglass/Lustreglass Underage (permanent) is a peachy nude with a little pink in it (from what I can tell), and it doesn’t have a shimmer finish like the other four of the glosses in the set. Ola Mango! (repromote) is a fun orange-peach color, which makes it stand out from the permanent line. Pink Grapefruit (repromote) is one of my favorite coral-reds with orange-gold shimmer, though it is similar to Lychee Luxe. Wonderstruck is shimmery pink confection, while Budding is a deeper, brighter pink with less noticeable shimmer. Little Darlings: 5 Pink Lipglass/Lustreglass Fleur Delight is an iridescent opal-white color with shimmer; it is a pretty sheer color, which would be nice layered over raspberry/berry-colored lipsticks. Magnetique (repromote) is one of my favorite fuchsia-berry colors. It has a nice level of purplish shimmer to it. Flashmode is a shimmery muted hot pink with subtle shimmer. Little VI is a little darker, more of a mauve-berry color with a lot of shimmer. Song and Dance is almost an opaque, subdued dirty pink with no real shimmer. Little Darlings: 5 Neutral Lipglass/Lustreglass C-Thru is a semi-opaque nude beige with little shimmer, and it is part of the permanent line. Mouthwatering is a pinker nude with more noticeable shimmer in it; this has come out in the past. Languish is a rich, deep brown with gold shimmer in it. Love Nectar is a peach-pink, almost a watermelon meets peach color. Beaux is a slightly pink brown with subtle multi-colored shimmer. Little Darlings: 5 Warm Pigments/Glitter Gold Dusk is one of my favorite pigments ever (the only pigment I ever got a back-up of!). It’s a light gold color, which makes an excellent base, but also perfect for highlighting. Gold Mode is a brownish-gold with a metallic finish. Melon (permanent) is a peachy-gold kind of color; it’s very much what you’d think of with a name like “Melon.” Gold Stroke is a burgundy-brown color almost; it’s rich and metallic in its finish. Reflects Antique Gold is a fun shade of micro-fine glitter with lots of shimmer and shine. Little Darlings: 5 Cool Pigments/Glitter Frost (permanent) is an incredibly frosty/shimmering silver-white color. Quietly (repromote) is a stunning shade of lavender–lighter than Violet. Pinked Mauve (repromote) is a nice shade of dark pink with a little mauve/purple to it. Teal (permanent) is one of my favorite pigment shades, because it is so pigmented and exactly as it is named–teal. Reflects Blackened Red is a blackish-brownish glitter with a red cast to it. Little Darlings: 5 Softsparkle/Eye Pencil Peacocked is a teal shade with a greenish cast to it. Mint & Olive is a cross between a yellowed gold with green-gold shimmer. Fab Orchid is an intense shade of deep purple. Chocolight is a warm brown with coppery-gold shimmer in it. Black Funk is an intense black color.']",998876743729002a139ed7fcdae65d3a10c193f2,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-little-darlings-collection-review/,['2008-11-06 00:00:00']
"['Look – Dame Edna Wisteria Trio Eye Looks Dec 28, 2008 December 28, 2008 Quick Dame Edna look for y’all today! ?

"['Look – Royal Tour Trio Eye & Gladiola Lipstick Looks Dec 30, 2008 December 30, 2008 I thought I better do a Royal Tour trio look before I returned it! I’m spending the day with my sister, and I’m pretty sure we’ll be heading to the mall at some point in the afternoon, so I’d like to return some Dame Edna stuff–I just really was disappointed by some items I bought. We’re going to see Marley & Me, so I only wore this look briefly, because I just know I’ll be crying like a baby at least once during the movie–no need to have violet streaming down my face, LOL. Oh! Oh! I would like to say that the lips I used in this look are far brighter than I’d normally pair with this bold of an eye. I really wanted to do *some* lip combo using the Dame Edna products, thus you have it ? You can also blot down the lipstick so it’s more of a stain before you put the gloss over it to make it less in-your-face. What are you all doing for New Year’s Eve?! I ask today, because I know there are several international readers, so I’m sure your NYE is coming up just a lil’ faster than mine ? You will need the following… Eyes : Violet pigment (violet base), Dame’s Desire eyeshadow (light purple), Royal Tour eyeshadow (medium purple with fuchsia), Climate Blue eyeshadow (blue-purple), Femme-fi eyeshadow (highlighter), Urban Decay Lust 24/7 Liner (purple), (Plushlash mascara (black) Cheeks : Don’t Be Shy blush (cool pink) Lips : Gladiola lipstick (purple-fuchsia), Hot Frost lipglass (medium pink) Brushes : 266 (firm, angled brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 129 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Dame’s Desire = Beautiful Iris; Royal Tour = Satellite Dreams; Climate Blue = Contrast; Femme-fi = Shroom; Don’t Be Shy = Well Dressed; Gladiola = Up the Amp + Girl About Town; Hot Frost = Cultured Directions: Define brows using a coordinating powder shadow applied with the 266 brush. Apply Violet pigment all over the lid as the base with the 249. On the inner lid, apply Dame’s Desire eyeshadow using the 239. Apply Royal Tour eyeshadow to the middle of the lid. Darken the outer lid using Climate Blue packed on and drag into crease using the 239. Darken crease with Climate Blue eyeshadow using the 239. Sweep Femme-fi underneath the brow bone to highlight.

"['YSL Spring Look 2009 Collection Review, Swatches Reviews Jan 22, 2009 January 22, 2009 Gloss Pur: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 YSL’s Spring Look 2009 Collection is fun to review, because it is so different from many of the other spring launches this season. Do you remember how we had a lil’ sneak peek a few weeks ago of what was to come? Sure, you have some pastels typical to spring, but then you have such an intense, vivid black that totally negates how spring it is! Temptalia Recommendations: Must-haves: Gloss Pur in Pure Raspberry, Pure Lipstick in Romantic Pink, Ivory Beige/Deep Black Nice-to-haves: Glosss Pur in Pure Fuchsia, Pure Lipstick in Silky Apricot Skip: Collector Powders (Complexion and Eye), Oatmeal/Petroleum Blue See a review breakdown of each product AND swatches … Gloss Pur ($29.00) Gloss Pur are supposedly like YSL’s Golden Gloss (love, love, love!), without the shimmer (but that’s what makes Golden Gloss so phenomenal!). Gloss Pur is a creamy, non-sticky formula with a high, glossy shine scented with mango. I find Gloss Pur lasts a good three or four hours on my lips, and it doesn’t leave any faded ring around my lips like some glosses do. N 1 Pure Nude is a creamy, milky pale beige-peach color. It’s very pale, and on me, probably would wash me out. On someone more porcelain or paired with a shamelessly dark smoky eye, it could be stunning. N 2 Pure Rose is a milky, warm-toned pink. I’d actually really love to see this one on! N 3 Pure Coral is an orangey-coral color that is just borderline coral, as far as I could tell. It had a lot of orange to it, which made me not fall head over heels in love with it. (C’mon, me and corals? There is no better relationship!) N 4 Pure Raspberry is almost a hot pink, but not quite. It’s toned down in its depth, so it’s not really a fuchsia or overly bright. I’d say it’s a more wearable take on a bright pink gloss. N 5 Pure Fuchsia is a deep raspberry-fuchsia color. I think this is the one next on my list to buy. N 6 Pure Plum is a brownish, reddish plum color. It’s very burgundy plum, versus mauvey plum. Since it’s so dark, this gloss is no doubt the most pigmented of the six released. Palettes Collector Powder For the Complexion ($62.00) is a semi-matte peachy shade, when they’re all brushed together. I find that the easiest way is to wear it that way, because the strips of color are not wide enough to make it all that practical to use one at a time. I wasn’t in love with this, and with the price, you’re better off getting one of YSL’s blushes and somethin’ else. Collector Powder For the Eyes ($62.00) features those springy pastels I mentioned earlier, though they’re more subdued than some other brands’ launches. I found the yellow shade to be a little chalky, and it’s almost a greenish yellow than a yellow, yellow. The pink is a soft, cool pink, while the dark purple stripe turns into a soft plummy burgundy shade. The last strip is a gray-teal shade–not really a color I see often, but it wasn’t worth getting the whole palette for. Coral Sand Blush ($44.00) is a soft, mostly matte peach shade with subtle golden sheen. It’s very light, and while I know it would look stunning on warm tones, it doesn’t grab me at as a must-have. Pure Lipstick ($30.00) Pure Lipsticks are pretty much without shimmer, but they are most certainly not without shine and sheen. All of the lipsticks from the spring launch are ultra pigmented (even the nudes) and irresistibly creamy. If you felt Rouge Volupte was a bit too creamy, these might be more to your liking. N 143 Blazing Red is a bright pop of creamy red. It looks like a blue-based red to me, just FYI. N 144 Silky Apricot is a golden, peachy color. This would look absolutely fabulous with Pure Coral! But if you want a cheaper dupe, think Ravishing by MAC. N 145 Paradise Pink is a bright, cool-toned pink with fuchsia undertones. It’s pretty, but I have plenty of these shades in my collection already, so I found it skippable. N 146 Romantic Pink is one of the most gorgeous pinks I have ever swatched! Talk about a great mix of softness and brightness. It’s not an in-your-face pink, but it isn’t too cool or too warm either. It’s not quite neutral, but I can’t determine which way it leans! I imagine it may lean more towards whatever you are when you wear it. I’m pretty sure I’ll be going back for this one. N 147 Hazelnut is a browned-down peach color. It’s not super brown, but it’s got some terracotta to it. N 148 Tea Rose is a soft, nude pink color. It reminds me al ittle of MAC’s Hug Me, but more pigmented. Eyeshadow Duos Ivory Beige/Deep Black is beyond delightful. Deep Black is exactly that–a RIDICULOUSLY dark black. I always thought Carbon by MAC was black, but I was wrong. THIS is the black I’ve been looking for all my life. When YSL launches at my local Nordie’s, I’m definitely picking this up. (I swatched everything 30 minutes away at Neiman’s, and I didn’t want to chance any returns!) Even the Ivory Beige shade is appreciable, for its soft peachiness and matte texture. It’s not like it’s a bum shade, and Deep Black has to carry it. Oatmeal/Petroleum Blue is similar in texture to the other duo, but it’s just not as fab. It’s pretty hard to compete with Deep Black, to be honest. I found Oatmeal to be too pale, cool-toned gray and a little on the chalky side. Petroleum Blue is very intense and it’s almost black, but you can still see the blue tone to it, which I was impressed by. Coral Sand (1st swatch); Eyeshadow Powder (last four swatches) Blazing Red, Silky Apricot, Paradise Pink, Romantic Pink, Hazelnut, Tea Rose Blazing Red, Silky Apricot, Paradise Pink, Romantic Pink, Hazelnut, Tea Rose Ivory Beige/Deep Black; Oatmeal/Petroleum Blue']",8a0b62257c0bae1c8e9015a92f64491cb993b0f3,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/ysl-spring-look-2009-collection-review-swatches/,['2009-01-22 00:00:00']
"['Chanel Wild Rose Glossimer Review & Swatches Reviews Jan 22, 2009 January 22, 2009 Chanel Wild Rose Glossimer ($26.00) is the perfect color if you’ve been looking for a gloss that just subtly enhances your natural lip color by adding a slicked pinked blush and just-barely-visible shimmer to reflect light. When I first swatched Wild Rose, it looked absolutely gorgeous and lush on the back of my hand. It also looked way more pigmented, so when I actually went to use it… it was not what I was expecting. My immediate reaction was “return, stat!” but since I don’t go to the mall too often, it’s still in my possession. After wearing it a few times, I’ve decided that it makes a nice go-to gloss for everyday wear aka when I’m too lazy to wear any makeup. I just brush this on and my lips look more alive, and my face is a bit brighter. I like my-lips-but-better (MLBB) colors from time to time, and I do think everyone should have at least one gloss and one lipstick that fits the MLBB criteria. They are colors that will never go out of style, date you, make you look older or younger… they are natural and sophisticated. Exactly what we all need every once in awhile! ?

"['Kiehl’s Launches CLassic Essence Oils for Spring 2009 Year: 2009 Launches Jan 21, 2009 January 21, 2009 Kiehl’s has recently relaunched their classic essence oils, which date back to the early 1920s. These are concentrated, essence oils packaged in amber glass in a roller ball vial. Right now, they’ve launched Musk 1921, Coriander 1946, Vanilla 1968, and Grapefruit 1976. They will be launching six more over the year. Each 0.23 oz. vial retails for $25.00. Available now! MUSK 1921 This is Kiehl’s first essence oil and still today, most beloved by customers who often refer to it as the Original Love Oil. The use of musk dates back more than 1,300 years when it was used by rulers of early Chinese dynasties for its herbal medicinal properties. Until the late 19th century, the natural musk was used extensively in perfumery until economic and ethical reasons motivated the adoption of synthetic musk, which are used almost exclusively today. CORIANDER 1946 Coriander was first used at the original Kiehl’s Pharmacy as medicinal oil for its soothing and healing properties. This aromatic stimulant and spice has been cultivated for over 3,000 years and used by the Egyptians as an aphrodisiac. Known as cilantro or Chinese parsley, Coriander is considered both an herb and a spice, since both its leaves and seeds are used as a seasoning condiment. VANILLA 1968 Many Kiehl’s customers have shared their layering suggestions over the years, but an overwhelming majority mix Vanilla with Musk. Originally cultivated by Pre-Colombian Mesoamerican peoples, Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes is credited with introducing both the vanilla spice and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s. The Spanish and Portuguese sailors and explorers brought vanilla into Africa and Asia in the 16th century. GRAPEFRUIT 1976 A customer favorite for decades, Grapefruit delights Kiehl’s customers with its fresh and citrusy scent. Grapefruit was first described on Barbados in 1750 and was also called the forbidden fruit because it was seized upon by those searching for the identity of the original tree of good and evil in the Garden of Eden.']",6987117b0c046012df5b86da30316adea397a321,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/kiehls-launches-classic-essence-oils-for-spring-2009/,['2009-01-21 00:00:00']

"['MAC Cosmetics Passions of Red Collection Review Reviews Oct 23, 2008 October 23, 2008 OVERALL , some of the palettes offer long-time MAC fans colors they haven’t seen before. As always, the warm palette suckered me in, though I’ll use it once or twice and it’ll get forgotten–I just know it! The lip palettes were surprising, because I’ve never been too drawn to them before, but I found two shades I really wanted to have. I only succumbed to the Coral Lips palette (again, bad move on my part), but the Plum Lips is tempting. Ironically, the Plum Lips is probably more wearable for me than the Coral Lips palette! Quick review of the brush sets : The brush sets are $35 at Nordstrom’s. Yes, $35, down from $49.50. I do not know why, but I only know that this was confirmed by the Nordstrom MA. So get your brush sets at Nordstrom’s if you can! The brush sets are just like previous years’ sets–the handles are just a different color. This year the handles are a shiny bright holiday red with darker, metallic ferrules. You can get official descriptions here as well as product photos here . Detailed reviews… Devoted Poppy: 6 Classic Eyes Sweet Eyes is a soft, satiny light beige with a touch of gold in it. Amorously is a rich, coppery color with a nice metallic sheen. It’s similar to Amber Lights in color, but not as frosty or shimmery. In Awe is very matte-like in texture. It’s a very dark brown, almost with a touch of black. It reminds me of Smut, but with a semi-matte texture. Young Thing is a soft light peach, very pale and low in shimmer. Awaken is a glittery pale, pastel green. It reminds me of one Lustreleaf. Fall Deeply is a mid-tone bule crossed with periwinkle for a very nice shade of blue not currently available in the permanent line. Intriguing Scarlet: 6 Warm Eyes Sweet Joy is a soft, pale peach-gold color. Obviously the highlighter of the bunch! Well Spiced is a warm-toned mid-tone brown. It reminds me a lot of Arena or Texture (permanent colors). Real Drama is a burgundy-toned dark brown, so I can appreciate the dimension in the shade. Warm Suede is an antique gold with flecks of green, making it both colors depending on the lighting. Gentle Heat is a soft golden taupe-gray. It’s hard to describe. It’s brown, and yet there’s gray in it and flecks of gold. Grand Entrance is a dark, satiny forest green. It’s got darkness and intensity, but the green is still visible. Infatuating Rose: 6 Cool Eyes Satisfy is a chalky whitish-pink color. It’s not frosty, though, just very pale and pigmented. Bonfete is a pale frosty pink; it reminds me a lot of Pink Freeze, but with better color payoff and texture. Feast is a pretty shade of berry-pink. I don’t know if this shade has been done before. Cavort is a purpler Stars ‘n Rockets. It has some of the dimension that Stars ‘n Rockets has, but this is clearly a bright lavender purple. Platonic is a grayer purple with a periwinkle base to it. It’s like a lighter Cinders (an old holiday shade). Deep Feelings is an intensely rich blue-black-purple kind of shade. I guess that makes it indigo, but I think it has a little more purple to it. Fascinating Ruby: 6 Smoky Eyes Scant is a satiny beigey-peach shade. It’s a little chalky to me, though not in a bad way – just a way where I’d have to be careful with it on my brow bone. Satin Taupe is a permanent color, but this seems a lot lighter than what I already have. Dark Devotion is a matte-ish dark brown. It doesn’t stand out in a crowd, that’s for sure. Gorgeous is a silvery-white shimmer shade. It reminds me of Electra, but maybe a shade or two lighter. Ambiance is a semi-matte textured mid-tone gray with silver flecks. Carbon is a matte black, and if you don’t own it, you should. That’s really all there is to say about Carbon! Devoted Poppy: 3 Coral Lips Transparent Love is a peachy-orange color; more of a coral-peach thank anything. It has soft multi-colored shimmer in it. Devoted is a cherry-toned coral. It’s kind of like red and orange, but more pink-red still. Soft Talk is a more intense version of Devoted (not sure why they’re so similar!). It’s richer, more pigmented, and it has brighter gold shimmer in it. This shade is stunning! It reminds me a little of Red Flame/Orange Flicker prolongwear. Intriguing Scarlet: 3 Cool Pink Lips Sheer Vision is a frosty pale baby pink that goes on pretty sheer. Make Me Melt is a blue-based mid-tone pink with soft fuchsia shimmer. Overjoyed is a muted pink with yellow undertones. Fascinating Ruby: 3 Plum Lips Mutual Attraction is a rosy-berry sheer shimmer gloss with some color, but not a lot. Insinuate is the stunner of this palette. It is a light raspberry shade with the most gorgeous gold shimmer. Marvel is a sheerer version of Insinuate in a sense, but the shimmer is less gold and more pink.']",3cf9ac06bfcc1b0496ad3f7e9d49bf8f63013526,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-passions-of-red-collection-review/,['2008-10-23 00:00:00']

This palette includes Rockstar and Ocean long-wear cream shadow as well as Black Ink and Thunder Storm long-wear gel eyeliner. I am a big fan of Bobbi Brown’s long-wear gel eyeliner; I find it’s a bit creamier than most gel liners, but they’re still pigmented enough to give me the darkness I crave. Rockstar is a silvery shade with a touch of blue undertones, while Ocean is a shimmery midnight blue. Black Ink is pretty much just that – a matte black. Thunder is a dark brownish-gray color. These colors go on just the way they appear, which is great, because I love it when products are true-to-color! I haven’t yet tried out the cream shadows to see how they wear, and I imagine I’ll more likely wear them as liner than as shadows ?

"['Kings & Queens Sultan of Granada Lemon Flower Showergel Review Reviews Oct 24, 2008 October 24, 2008 Kings & Queens Sultan of Granada Lemon Flower Showergel ($9.00) pulled me in with its citrus-lemony scent dusted with a woodiness. It’s not the lemon scent of your dish-washing soap, but something gender-neutral and reminds me a bit of fading summer and the beginning of fall. It’s hard for me to choose between using this and Philosophy’s Caramel Apple in the morning these days, but lately I’ve been reaching for this. At $9.00 for 10 ounces, I feel like I can definitely indulge on this, whatever the economy may be at the time. This particular product is vegan (all of the Kings & Queens line is supposed to be vegan, except the body butters, which contain beeswax), and it’s mineral-oil and paraben free. I’m not too picky when it comes to shower gel–I want a good lather and a pleasing scent. I love perfume-y scents as much as food-based ones when it comes to my shower gel.

When you first open the palette, it reveals four lip colors (Berry Mauve, Pink Sequin, Dusty Mauve, and Ruby). The eyeshadows slide out from a drawer beneath them. You will find metallic eyeshadows in Champagne Quartz, Gold Dust, Golden Bronze, and Galaxy. Enclosed in the palette are a mini eyeshadow brush and a mini lip brush with a cap. Being known for natural and subtle shades, this palette follows the same philosophy. The metallic shadows are soft with hints of color and lots of metallic sheen, which helps add some pop and sizzle to them. The lip colors are sheer, creamy, and inherently glossy. Berry mauve was my favorite shade, because I found it to be a light plum-mauve lip on me–just a shade or two deeper than my normal pout (and pinker). Are you a Bobbi Brown palette fan?

Seriously, if I can get out of Nordstrom without spending $100+, it’s been a very good day! They’ve just created a set of their awesome shower gels for guess what… $8! Yes, eight bucks! (And yes, I know it’s cheaper by the oz. to purchase one shower gel alone, but who doesn’t like to try scents out to find the one you really love first?) Anyway, Kings & Queens is also carried at other major retailers like Beauty.com (which is where you can find this set). I absolutely adored the scent of Sultan of Granada (as did my boyfriend, who I think ended up using most of it). This is a great way to try other scents without breaking the bank.

"['Reader Feedback: Some Results, Solutions, & Plea! Site News Oct 17, 2009 October 17, 2009 Last week, we asked for your feedback via a survey, and all of the responses we received were really great and just helped us develop a picture of where we are and what we need to change up in the future. Here are some findings/explanations, just because the audience is split on some things, so I don’t want half of you to think we’re ignoring your suggestions–because the other half loves what you hate! (I think the adage “you can’t satisfy everyone” applies!) Drugstore vs. high-end : about 15% of readers seemed to want more coverage of beauty products available at a lower price point, while 75% were happy that there isn’t a lot of coverage of drugstore brands. Solution: Money-Saving Mondays — the theme is to cover and feature products that are more affordable, at least on a once-a-week basis. MAC vs. non-MAC : about 10% of readers feel like this blog is all MAC and nothing but, while 20% of readers say there aren’t enough posts about MAC (and about 5% say skip other brands and only write about MAC). The majority of readers (about 75%) are satisfied with the level of non-MAC to MAC ratio. Solution : keep on keepin’ on. If MAC keeps putting out a zillion and one collections per year, we’ll be there to cover it. We’re still trying to do our best and cover other brands’ releases, too. We can’t always get to all of them, but we certainly give it a go! Reader Participation: about 20% of readers dislike at least one or two of participation-based posts ( The Hit List, Rant & Rave, Temptalia Asks You, etc.), but the overwhelming majority loves to participate in these. Solution: we’re going to take a look at our schedule and likely ditch Project Revamp (that’s your call to save it, if you wish) and potentially scale back others so that there’s some but not too much. Sales/Deals: several readers commented on not wanting sales/deals clogging up the front page… Solution : we already adjusted this about a month ago so that the majority of sales/deals are only posted on the deals page. We’ll, of course, still feature some deals on the main page, depending on whether we think it’ll interest you, as well as the weekly deal round-up on Mondays. Guest Posts/Submissions: some readers commented that they’d like to see guest posts/reviews/looks/tutorials. Solution: we’ve actually always welcomed and asked for submissions — we just rarely get any! We will try to make more “call to submit” posts throughout the year. Rating System: there seems to be a fair amount of confusion over the rating system — some love the addition of it, others think it’s pointless. Solution: at this point, I’m probably going to get rid of it. It seems like it requires more explanation to avoid the confusion, which seems like it’ll clog up the post. But to clarify here: I don’t actively seek out products I dislike, which is why I don’t have a lot of “terrible” reviews. I try and buy what I think I’ll like. A “C” product is average – not bad, but not great; a “B” product is good, but I think there’s something better out there; and an “A” product is great, and it’s something I’d buy again. Disclosure: a few readers were curious about how Temptalia will work with the FTC’s disclosure requirement. Solution : we have had a site-wide disclosure and policies page up for about a year now — in general (in the past), if I didn’t say I bought it, I probably didn’t. But since the revisions came out (so about two weeks now), we’ve also implemented a post-by-post disclosure system. ( Anyone notice it? Here’s an example .) We don’t do paid reviews, we don’t promise positive reviews–hell, we don’t guarantee we’ll review anything, period. Bottom line, I review stuff I like/love or products I think readers are interested in. There’s one major area that we could use further feedback on: NAVIGATION. It definitely seemed like a fair number of readers experienced some issues with navigating the site. Because we are, quite obviously biased, we have no idea what’s wrong with it. We can navigate the site just fine, darn it! So to help us understand where you’re coming from, could you tell us what problems you’re having? What’s not working? Maybe an example of a navigation that would work for such an unwieldy site such as Temptalia? Any insight on making your site experience better, more streamlined, and just more enjoyable would be most appreciated. This is the time of the year where we start working on our layout and redesign, so all of your feedback is vital to the process. (If you want change, you gotta speak up!) Thanks so much for participating in the quarterly reader feedback survey! ( And, of course, if you have any additional feedback, suggestions, comments, or questions, you are always welcome to post them — whether on the blog or via email . )']",d9683d85ef87654a96a782b8818cb3916801c880,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/reader-feedback-some-results-solutions-plea/,['2009-10-17 00:00:00']

After trying #52 in Red Pink , I wanted to see how the other shades stacked up and if they were as opaque as that one (which was already a darker gloss). #33 Nude is a semi-sheer peachy-nude with golden copper sparkle. This one was just okay – there’s nothing really special that drives this color. It looks blah on my lips, and it’s the sheerest Korres’ lipgloss I’ve tried. It’s not a bad shade, it’s just not one I’d actively seek out. #25 Natural Purple is a creamy, semi-opaque played down pink with no shimmer. I actually liked this one the most out of the three shades, because it gave me full color, lots of glossiness, and it looked natural. I don’t know why it’s called Natural Purple , but it’s definitely an easy, wearable shade. #54 Fuchsia is a semi-opaque medium fuchsia with softer pink fuchsia sparkle. This one settled a bit into lines and applied streaky, so some care needs to be used to apply it and get a more even look. It’s a fun pop of pink, but I’ve seen this color before. Korres’ Cherry Full Color Gloss is a moisturizing, non-sticky gloss with a high-shine glossy finish that tends to be more pigmented than the typical gloss. Not all shades are created equal, so some shades are more opaque than others. The gloss has a faint scent of cherry, but it’s hardly noticeable (which may or may not be a good thing for you).

"['Holiday Makeup: Office Party Neutrals Looks Dec 11, 2009 December 11, 2009 So here’s a tip about using all matte eyeshadows (or matte products in general): make sure you’re exfoliated and well-moisturized.

The same thing is true if you have drier skin and opt for a matte finish foundation; it doesn’t always go so well!

"['MAC Magic, Mirth, & Mischief Collection: The Round-Up Reviews Oct 16, 2009 October 16, 2009 MAC Magic, Mirth, & Mischief Collection: The Round-Up MAC Holiday is always a bit of an overwhelming event, just because of the sheer size of the offerings. Each year, MAC puts out a holiday colour collection , but they also have several separate, yet related, launches of more giftable items. From eyeshadow and lip palettes to mini-sized sets (which are due out November 5th), MAC has you covered. There are also some store exclusive sets , too. To help make sure you haven’t missed anything, here’s a compilation of all of the reviews for holiday: Colour Collection Mineralize Eyeshadows Mineralize Blushes Nail Lacquers/Softsparkle Pencils Lipsticks Dazzleglasses Cremesheen Glasses Kits & Palettes Smoke & Mirrors Eyeshadow Palette Devil May Care Eyeshadow Palette Mystic Cool Eyeshadow Palette Sorceress Eyeshadow Palette Face Kits (Hocus Focus / Fab-racadabra) Lip Kits (Possessed by Pink! / Heavenly Dish) MAC also released lip, eye, and brush gift sets , which I won’t be reviewing in detail (if you’re looking for a review, this is all you’re going to get–sorry!), because it includes mostly repromoted or permanent products. Each lip bag does feature one new, limited edition lipstick. They’re all good bang for your buck — you’re probably getting more than you would if you purchased the items separately, so they make good gifts or opportunities to pick up permanent items you may have skipped over in lieu of something limited edition. On MAC Holiday Brush Sets: The holiday brush sets are machine-made rather than man-made (or handmade) as the full size brushes are. This is primarily what accounts for the difference in quality between brush sets and full size brushes. I do recommend the brush sets inasmuch as you’re on a budget and you think you’ll use the majority of the brushes included in the set. I started off just owning a holiday brush set, but I’ve since gone on to replace all my brushes with full sized versions. I’m disappointed that the eye brush set doesn’t contain the 239, which I think is one of the most vital, must-have eye brushes ever. The brushes themselves are sleek handled and look really nice, though they do feel a little scratchier/rougher than the full size versions do.']",0c678e137b5175c2f19d5a00a7e99da8cd00828f,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-magic-mirth-mischief-collection-the-round-up/,['2009-10-16 00:00:00']

"['The Ingredients Guide – Comedogenic, Irritating Ingredients To Watch For zArchived Mar 03, 2008 March 03, 2008 Last week, I asked how many of you paid attention to the ingredients list on your beauty products–what was the majority answer? No, not at all; it is not a concern for you. As a beauty junkie, I have (and probably will not any time soon) not become an ingredient wizkid, simply because all of those scientific names never stick in my brain. However, I do think that is it vital to understand the importance of ingredients, especially for those with skin problems. I like to keep certain no-no ingredients in mind when I find a product that works really well, in addition to when I find a product seems to compound existing skin issues. This guide is by no means a be-all, end-all of cosmetic ingredients, nor is it a full resource on what each ingredient does. I strongly advise you to check my sources, as well as head over to Savvy Skin , run by reader Jeni, because she is a skin care fanatic. Bad ingredients are pretty much classified as either comedogenic or irritating . Comedogenic means it causes acne (hence why products are touted as non-comedogenic). Based on researching ingredients and the following sites, these ingredients are often found to irritate skin and/or cause acne. When ingredients are tested for their comedogenic or irritating level, they are ranked on a scale of 0-5. 0 means that the ingredent is non-comedogenic and non-irritating, while an ingredient that receives is a 5 is the worst in terms of comedogenic/irritating levels. It is important to note that people with less sensitive skin may use highly comedogenic or irritating ingredients without any adverse effects. These ingredient lists tend to be more helpful for those that struggle with skin imperfections or troubles, and elimination or reduction of certain known harsh ingredients may inevitably pave the road towards healthier skin. As with all ingredient lists, they are listed in order of amounts–e.g., the first listed ingredient is highest percentage-wise (like water-aqua in 25%) with the last listed ingredient having the least amount percentage-wise (like 0.05%). So if you find a product that you love, and you see it has a potentially irritating ingredient towards the end, it is less likely to be the actual cause of your skin problems. If you use many products that use a particular poor ingredient, even if small amounts on a per product basis, it may add up to a larger dosage overall, though. Keep an eye out!

"['MAC Magic, Mirth, & Mischief Review: Smoke & Mirrors Eye Shadows Photos, Swatches Reviews Oct 16, 2009 October 16, 2009 6 Smoke & Mirrors Eye Shadows MAC Magic, Mirth, & Mischief Review: Smoke & Mirrors Eye Shadows A good smoky eye palette is never a bad thing to have on hand. It’s useful, easy to travel with, and it’s classic. I’m not loving this year’s version of the smoky eye palette, because it’s more of a brownish eye, and I’ve always felt the classic smoky eye is monochromatic. I still hold that last year’s was better. (And I still contend that you can make your own smoky eyeshadow quad with permanent MAC eyeshadows just as well.) 6 Smoke & Mirrors Eye Shadows ($36.00 U.S.) Fire In Her Eyes is a super soft, slightly sheer beige with a light frost finish. In the swatch, you can tell it hardly shows up on my skin without a base. It’ll make a nice highlight, though. Wide-Eyed Wonder is kind of a taupe-y brown with a reddish touch. There’s nothing about this shade that makes it jump off the page for me. Black Magique is a velvety smooth deep dark black with brown tones. It has slight gold shimmer, but it’s hardly noticeable. Spell No. 9 is a satiny neutral pink. It’s sheer, and it doesn’t do much for me. Deception is a sheer, glittery copper bronze. Even though it’s a frost finish, it had more of a lustre feel to me. Smoke & Mirrors is a cool-toned chocolate brown with a little gray sheen. I”m not sold on this year’s. It reads more like a neutral eye palette than a smoky eye palette to me. It’s useful, and the colors are easily worn by many, so in that aspect, it’s a solid choice for those looking for a go-to palette.

This year’s collection is Baroque Boudoir , which is in clear packaging with filigree in semi-opaque white overlayed (but to be sure, they’re not stickers). This year’s collection contains a whopping nine items to covet: three lipsticks, three lipglosses, two shades of Sheer Mystery Powder, and a clutch. The lipglosses are creamy, hydrating, and they’re non-sticky. They do feel a lot like MAC’s Cremesheen Glass, to be honest. They’re about as sheer, too! The glosses themselves are quality and feel very nice on the lips, but my big issue with these is that they’re just out of sync with MAC pricing (which is part of the point of their luxe collection, I’m sure). They’re not any better or worse than MAC’s Lustreglass (these are completely non-sticky, Lustreglass is mostly non-sticky), which is priced at $14. I will also point out that this year’s shade range is less unique than years’ past, which is a little disappointing. Pretty colors, but you can find decent dupes or similar shades in the permanent range. P.S. – I will do lip swatches this afternoon! Baroque Boudoir Lipgloss ($22.00 U.S. / $26.00 CDN) The Lap of Luxury is a sheer, peachy-melon nude with pink shimmer. On my lips, there’s really not much too it: glossy lips with a little bit of peach and pink shimmer. This shade reminded me of Enchantress Lipglass or Love Nectar Lustreglass. Preciousness is an icy pink with a little bit of lilac in it. It is fairly sheer and sort of gives my lips a milky look to them, but it doesn’t add much color, mostly pinky-purple sparkle from the shimmer. This reminded me a lot of Cultured Lipglass or a slightly more purple Luminary Lustreglass (though it’s less noticeably different when applied on lips). D’Nouveau is a raspberry-ish color base with lighter pink and copper flecks of shimmer throughout. It was the most pigmented of the three, but I’d still consider it fairly sheer. It brightened up and added a rosier look to my lips along with the shimmer. I was immediately reminded of Star Nova Lustreglass. This is also kind of like a more berry version of Love Alert Dazzleglass. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 28/30 Value : 6/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 5/5 Recommendation : If you’re a fan of the packaging or love non-sticky, creamy glosses like Cremesheen Glass, you might find these worth the splurge.

This year’s collection is Baroque Boudoir , which is in matte silver with shiny silver and black filigree overlay. This year’s collection contains a whopping nine items to covet: three lipsticks, three lipglosses, two shades of Sheer Mystery Powder, and a clutch. The lipsticks are creamy, contain no shimmer, tend to be a little more pigmented, and apply more opaquely on lips, though this year’s are less pigmented than some of the previous years’ launches. Like the Lipglosses, I felt like these shades weren’t particularly special or standout. I’m am surprised, yet again, to not see a really excellent holiday red launched. And again, the price on these? Really obscene. They’re definitely not better than MAC’s lipsticks at $14 a pop; you could say these are, perhaps, a little more moisturizing, but not any more so than MAC’s Amplified Creme finish. P.S. – I will do lip swatches this afternoon! Baroque Boudoir Lipstick ($22.00 U.S. / $26.00 CDN) Prive is a blue-based medium pink with a light sheen. It’s creamy, and it goes on so-so, not totally opaque, but still adds plenty of color to my lips. It reminded me of a more subtle Speed Dial Lipstick. Baroque Boudoir is a plummy brown with a light sheen. It’s semi-opaque (you can kind of tell in the swatch) both on the skin and on the lips. I think it’s similar to Spice It Up! (a little redder) or Sheer Plum (a little browner) Lipstick. Treasured is a creamy, semi-opaque neutral beige. MAC says it’s warm, it seemed neutral on me. It really didn’t jump out at me as warm (I almost wanted to say it was cool!). It reminded me of Jubilee! or even a more pigmented Fresh Brew Lipstick. Let me also give you a quick run-down of the Sheer Mystery Powder, which I chose not to spend solely for the sake of photographing it. My bottom line is I don’t think it’s a particularly good pressed powder, and therefore not even close to being worth the $60 price tag attached to it. The compact is very similar to the Hello Kitty Kouture compacts, just with different embellishments. It’s also similar to Monogram’s from last year. It has some heft to it, but it’s not too heavy (unlike Couture and Stylistic’s compacts). Sheer Mystery Powder is an extremely lightweight pressed powder. I find it a little too dusty and chalky to really enjoy it, and the shade range is incredibly limited. As NC30, I felt too dark for Light Medium and yet too light for Medium Plus. If you love the packaging, there’s no shame in purchasing it for the compact alone! If it makes you happy, it makes me happy! (Please note, the rating below is only for the lipsticks. For the compact, I’d give it an overall score of C for an average product housed in an overpriced compact.) If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ?

"['MAC Eyeshadow Swatches – Browns (Part 1) Reviews Jul 10, 2011 July 10, 2011 MAC Tete-a-Tint Eyeshadow MAC Eyeshadow Swatches – Browns (Part 1) As promised, here are even more brown MAC Eyeshadows ($14.50 for 0.05 oz.) — I have a few more palettes to work through, including more neutrals (which include more browns, too). Tete-a-Tint is a soft, medium-dark peach-brown with a Matte2 finish. It is now discontinued. Inglot #337 is similar but less warm–more of a brown than tinted with burnt peach. Amber Lights is a rich, warm-toned coppery bronze with a frost finish. Inglot #405 is similar, perhaps more bronze than golden. Soft Brown is a muted, medium-dark tan brown with a matte finish. Inglot #337 is closer to Soft Brown than it is to Tete-a-Tint. Bamboo is a soft, yellowed brown with a matte finish. Motif is a pale yellow with a duochrome of pink iridescence. It has a frost finish. Arena is a softened, medium beige-brown with a satin finish. Illamasqua’s Furore is similar but a little more orange. Espresso is a neutral, dark brown with a matte finish. Mystery is a cool-toned, gray-brown with a satin finish. Smut is a cool-toned, charcoal brown with burgundy shimmer and a velvet finish. Satin Taupe is a dark taupe with a frost finish. Bare Escentuals Meteorite is similar. Romp is a medium-dark, golden brown with a frost finish. Urban Decay Rush is similar to Romp, but it’s less golden. Shades like Amber Lights, Romp, and Satin Taupe are some of MAC’s standout eyeshadows within their entire permanent range. Whether the colors are ones you’d wear or not, these are highly pigmented, smooth-textured, and so easy to blend. I have found that the neutral range of mattes is a cinch to work with; they really aren’t fussy–not powdery, chalky, or poorly pigmented. Soft Brown is one of MAC’s bestselling eyeshadow shades. Arena works so lovely as an all-over lid color because it has a subtle sheen but still remains rather sedate. Mystery and Smut are nice browns for those with cooler undertones. The only shade that falls a little short is Motif, which has a slightly gritty texture and less than perfect color payoff.

"['American Apparel: Nail Lacquers — Review, Photos, Swatches (Part 1) Sample Reviews Jan 30, 2010 January 30, 2010 Pinto, Berry, Downtown LA Poppy, Rose Bowl, Coney Island American Apparel: Nail Lacquers, Part 1 American Apparel launched eighteen shades of cream nail lacquers. I’ll be showing you fourteen of the eighteen shades (all but Dynasty, Hunter, Mount Royal, and Passport Blue) spread over two posts (there are forty-two photos–too many for one post!). NOTE , American Apparel has recalled all bottles of their nail lacquer due to a defect in the packaging itself — the glass is prone to breaking, so the brand has done a voluntary recall so that they can rollout a second run with safer, more durable packaging. There is nothing wrong with the formula itself. American Apparel is offering customers the following: bring in your old bottle or a receipt and receive two new bottles or a $10 gift card. They expect to roll out the new and improved bottles in the next week or two. The nail lacquer is free of DBP, toluene, and formaldehyde. Each bottle retails for $6 or you can purchase a three-pack for $15. They’re currently sold exclusively in American Apparel store locations and online at americanapparel.com (expect them to be back online in a week or two). The formula is really good, actually. I wasn’t quite sure how an apparel brand was going to do polish, but they did an exceptional job designing a formula that is richly pigmented, easy to apply, and wears beautifully. Even without a base, I experienced no chipping over four days and only minor tip wear. With a base, no chipping, minor tip wear, and it looked nice and glossy with a top coat of Seche Vite. All of the shades are cream finishes and, overall, have a nice consistency that’s thick enough to get bold color with just one coat, but not so thick that it’s goopy. Each shade, without a top coat, has a lightly glossy finish, but they all look better with a nice and shiny top coat (I like Seche Vite with these). Pinto is a reddened brown cream. It goes on opaque in just two coats. Berry is a deep raspberry-burgundy cream that goes on opaque in really just one coat, but I did two just ’cause. Downtown LA is a bright orange-based red cream. I’m sure this one is dupe-able, but it has a great formula and consistency. It’s surprisingly orange-based without being flat out orange. Poppy is a bright orange cream. It’s not quite neon orange, but it gets pretty close. It has just a smidgen in red in it that keeps it from being neon, I’d say. You only really need one medium-thick coat to get good opacity, but I did two. Rose Bowl is a pretty, played-down yellow-based pink. It’s muted and paled a bit, but it’s not boring. This is one of those easy-to-wear more neutral shades. It found two coats was perfect to get the right color and thickness. Coney Island is a light, airy cotton candy pink. It’s definitely a cool-toned, blue-based pink, so warm skin tones may find it a little hard to wear. I found two coats was almost enough, but three would get you totally opaque. I found my Coney Island seemed a little thinner in consistency than the majority of the American Apparel polishes, as well. Any of these catch your eye?

"['SamyPure – Smooth & Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Review Reviews Mar 03, 2008 March 03, 2008 SamyPure All Natural Smooth & Shine Shampoo/Conditioner ($5.99 each) Sometimes I am skeptical about natural products, because I haven’t had the best experienes in the past with this genre of products. I am happy to say that SamyPure’s Shampoo and Conditioner system works as well as my last reviewed shampoo set by Herbal Essences. I actually found the shampoo lathered quite nicely! The scent is a pleasing spring-floral blend with just a touch of fruity sweetness underlying it (very, very subtle–not at all overwhelming). I liked the way it felt in my hair, and it left my hair silky and smooth, which is always desirable (duh). I didn’t notice any change in my normal hair texture (I don’t have any hair problems, so I judge hair products’ effectiveness more on whether they give me hair problems), so I give this set a thumbs up. I was thinking that it was a salon product, but in fact, it’s a drugstore product. Why did I think it was a salon product? Because it is a 100% Vegan product, which means no animal testing, no animal by-products, etc. I know several readers absolutely abhor animal testing, and some make sure that their products are Vegan-approved. What’s great about drugstore products is you can often find a detailed list of ingredients and information about them online, like Walgreen’s has everything you need to know about this conditioner.']",7c3ebea5993be1146871bdcbc9204930fbb688ae,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/samypure-smooth-shine-shampoo-and-conditioner-review/,['2008-03-03 00:00:00']

"['MAC Magic, Mirth, & Mischief Review: Lip Kits Photos, Swatches Reviews Oct 16, 2009 October 16, 2009 Possessed by Pink! Lip Kit MAC Magic, Mirth, & Mischief Review: Lip Kits I cannot tell a lie: I hate lip palettes with a passion. There are many reasons why I passionately dislike lip palettes, and lest you be swayed by packaging and pretty shades, I’ll enumerate my top three for you. 1. They’re messy. If you even think about sticking your finger into the palette, you’re going to get a messy, germ-tastic palette. 2. They’re never as pigmented as a regular gloss/lipstick. Lip palettes always feel like pale imitations of the real thing. 3. They’re a pain in the butt to use. To keep it clean, you need to use a lip brush every time, and I consider that a pain. I also consider the little lip brush they include a pain in the butt to use, because the handle is so tiny, it’s difficult to hold (at least in my hands). Possessed By Pink! Lip Kit ($22.50 U.S.) Sweet Smile is a sheer, rosy-pink gloss confection. It has a lot of multicolored shimmer. Laugh A Lot is a sheer medium rosy pink with a glossy sheen and not much shimmer. Tickled is a dark, plummy brown with a glossy sheen. Heavenly Dish Neutral Lip Kit ($22.00 U.S.) Barely Visible is a sheer, glossy nude with lighter gold shimmer. Heavenly Dish is a sheer, pale, light pink with a glossy finish. Floating Lightly is a sheer dirty brown-beige with a glossy sheen. I would never purchase these lip palettes if it wasn’t to review for the blog. I wholeheartedly don’t recommend purchasing them. On occasion, MAC will put one or two stunning shades into their lip palettes, and I, inevitably, cave, but this year is a total miss. Skip the palettes. If you want a deal, buy one of the lip bags instead. Or just buy one or two lipsticks/glosses you really like instead. At least MAC only put out two kits this year, as opposed to the three or four they normally launch. I know there are some of you who love lip palettes, so if that’s you… take my review with a grain of salt. ?

I’m warm-toned, and I naturally gravitate towards warmer shades. Give me gold and I’m a happy lady! This year’s warm eyeshadow palette isn’t my favorite, but I like half of it a lot. The other half is just so-so, but I’ve been known to purchase a palette for just one color… so I suppose half isn’t bad! I think the reason I don’t love half of the palette is that it doesn’t feel very “warm” to me. 6 Devil May Dare Warm Eye Shadows ($36.00 U.S.) Oh My Darling is a soft, slightly warmed up beige with a frost finish. I like that this color is included, if only because it’s a very nice shade for a highlight. It’s not too frost or white, so it will work well on the brow bone. Dare Ya! is a medium pink with kind of a peachy tone to it. It went on a bit sheerly on me, though. Sorcery is a reddish-toned eggplant purple with a soft finish. Gold Tease is a gorgeous shade of gilded gold with a metallic sheen. It reminded me of the Rushmetal pigments a bit, actually. Prankster is an antique gold; kind of like a green-gold that’s played down. Again, gold, so of course I love it. I told you – three shades rocked my world! Devilishly Dark is a warmed-up light chocolate brown with gold shimmer. I would have bought this palette just for the two gold shades, but I have an unhealthy obsession with gold eyeshadow.

They’re currently sold exclusively in American Apparel store locations and online at americanapparel.com (expect them to be back online in a week or two). The formula is long-wearing, easy to use, and richly pigment. All the characteristics I look for in my nail polish! Palm Springs is a soft peach cream. This one reminded me of a lightly more muted China Glaze Peachy Keen. Cotton is a slightly yellowed white. I found this to be the worst of the fourteen shades — it was a little runny and it would take at least three solid coats to go opaque. It’s not super difficult to work with, but it wasn’t stellar like the rest. Manila is a bright goldenrod yellow. It’s not quite traffic-stopping yellow, but it’s not totally goldenrod either. Two coats was good on this one. Office is a pale minty green Cream. I actually really liked this shade a lot, definitely a favorite out of the bunch. I found two coats was perfect for this shade. Peacock is a dusty medium-deep blue. It’s kind of like a muted ocean blue, because it’s not ultra vibrant, but it still has plenty of color in two coats. Mouse is a taupe-gray cream. It reminded me of Chanel’s Particuliere and OPI You Don’t Know Jacques. Factory Grey is a purple-toned gray cream. It was opaque in just two coats. Hassid is a rich, inky black. Super black. This looks so stunning with an ultra glossy top coat on it, too. Opaque in two coats, like the majority of these shades.

"['Bright Makeup: Lotsa Teals Looks Jan 26, 2010 January 26, 2010 Bright Makeup: Lotsa Teals Here’s a quick look I did using two of the new Benefit eyeshadows, plus one of Urban Decay’s new Stardust eyeshadows (to be reviewed in full later). Really loving the way Dolce & Gabbana Nude Blush looks, though. Pain in the behind to photograph a swatch of it, but boy is it gorgeous on. Is it really only Tuesday? I feel like it should be Friday. Not that I want time to go by that quickly, but it’s been a tiring week… and it’s only Tuesday! You will need the following… Eyes : MAC Soft Ochre Paint Pot (neutral beige base), MAC Teal Pigment (teal), Benefit Shamrocker Eyeshadow (mint), Benefit Mermaid Eyeshadow (green-teal with gold), Urban Decay Atmosphere Eyeshadow (teal), MAC Gorgeous Gold Eyeshadow (green-gold), MAC Femme-fi Eyeshadow (neutral highlighter), Urban Decay Binge 24/7 Liner (dark blue), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Bobbi Brown Extra Tinted Moisturizing Balm (Light-to-Medium Tint) Cheeks : Dolce & Gabbana Nude Blush (soft beige-pink) Lips : Cle de Peau #26 Lipstick (coral), Benefit Zone Out Lip Gloss (sheer gold) Brushes : 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : N/A For eyes, start by applying Soft Ochre paint pot as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. With the 239 and water-based mixing medium (or water), apply Teal pigment all over the lid area. Using the 239, apply Shamrocker eyeshadow on the inner third of the eyelid. Next, apply Mermaid eyeshadow on the middle third of the eyelid and lightly blend with the inner corner. Darken the outer third of the lid with Atmosphere eyeshadow with the 239, gently brushing it into the lower crease. Lightly blend Atmosphere eyeshadow , with the 239, on the outer corner and lid. Lightly tap and brush Gorgeous Gold eyeshadow directly above the crease to soften. To finish the eyeshadow look, sweep Femme-fi eyeshadow as a highlighter on the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Binge eyeliner on the lower lash line and Gorgeous Gold eyeshadow lightly patted below the lower lash line with the 219 brush. Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Nude blush to the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply #26 lipstick first, and then layer Zone Out lipgloss for a complementing lip. Check out more photos!

I wish the color was bolder and more opaque, because it is rather subtle and sheer. It does, however, significantly tint and add redness to my lips, and it wears well, because it has a tendency to stain a little rather than sit on top of lips like a typical gloss. It has the faintest bit of shimmer, but it’s hardly noticeable on lips. What about you? Would you wear this red? The Scarlet Season is a series of posts showcasing and featuring my favorite shades of red lips–from glosses to lipsticks that runs through December 2009.

"['Kiehl’s Lavender Gently Exfoliating Body Scrub Review, Photos Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Nov 25, 2009 November 25, 2009 Mmm… Body Scrub: Kiehl’s Lavender Gently Exfoliating Body Scrub Kiehl’s Lavender Gently Exfoliating Body Scrub ($25.00 for 6.8 fl. oz.) is pretty much my new favorite body scrub. A part of me is struggling with how to describe what exactly I’m loving about it in such a way that truly conveys how much I adore it, but obviously, I’m going to give it a shot or else this review wouldn’t be here! This totally does its job! I don’t know about “gentle” exfoliation, but it has a nice level of grit/abrasiveness that makes it effective without being too harsh. I’ve used other scrubs touted as gentle/sensitive, and they are definitely much less abrasive than this one, so I just don’t know if I’d really call this gentle . I’d consider it more of a happy medium between what I’d consider gentle (which I think of as more of sand-sized exfoliating grains) and the average body scrub (that likely has sugar or salt particles for exfoliating). It’s for your body, and I personally find this to be a good level of abrasiveness. I couldn’t tell you what exactly they use for their exfoliant other than they’re “natural exfoliation particles.” Surprisingly, the body scrub was also really hydrating post-application, too. It both exfoliated, but it didn’t take any moisture out, and I felt like it even added a little to it. I know Kiehl’s website does point out that one of the “key ingredients” is aloe vera, so perhaps that’s where the moisturized feeling comes from. I do feel like the scrub delivers on its promise to “leave skin silky-soft, refreshed and primed for moisturization.” It’s also a body scrub that is creamy and lathers up a bit, so it almost feels like both a body scrub and a body wash. I am a little partial towards body scrubs that also have a more lathering base, because I do find that they’re more moisturizing on the whole and easier to use. I’m satisfied with the pricing on this product, too, because you get a good amount that will yield plenty of usages. I found about a nickel-sized dollop was a good amount per leg, and I didn’t feel like I was being skimpy, either–it was just enough to be rich and effective without feeling like I was trying to conserve the product. There are, obviously, cheaper body scrubs available, but if you’re a Kiehl’s fan, it is a bit on the top line of their price range, but it’s a solid product. I’d say that after seeing the pricing on Kiehl’s other body washes and scrubs, it’s about where I’d expect–cheaper than Creme de Corps, but a little pricier than their Ultra Moisturizing. (I haven’t tried either of those, but now I’m curious!) The one I tested out has a very lovely lavender scent–there’s nothing to it, it smells exactly as lavender would smell, and I love that. I do find the scent of lavender to be particularly relaxing, so I often use lavender-based products at night. I’ve been using this in the shower at night, and then layering a lavender-scented lotion afterward. It’s soft, not at all overwhelming, and smells very natural. They also have the scrub in Coriander, Grapefruit, and Pear Tree if Lavender isn’t your thing. Bottom Line: This is definitely one of my favorite body scrubs of all time, and it’s my new go-to since I started using it. I’m going to take a sniff at the other scents next time I’m near the Kiehl’s counter, but I have a feeling Lavender is the best scent for me.

It’s a semi-opaque lipstick that gives decent coverage, but more pigmented lips may find it isn’t full coverage enough to mask their natural pigmentation. (If you have naturally reder lips, this will only subdue the red to more of a raspberry-ish pink.) What I like about Exquise is how warm it is; it’s not easy to find neutral or warm-toned pink lipsticks, as most are blue-based. Since it is a Rouge Allure Lipstick, it also wears well, keeps lips hydrated, and has a slightly glossy sheen. Is this the right pink for you? Would you wear it?

It’s not the most cohesive palette MAC has put out, but if you’re just looking to boost up your color collection and aren’t so concerned with a palette that works together easily, you shouldn’t mind. It’s not to say that there aren’t color combinations to be created from the palette, but it just requires a little more thinking than your average eyeshadow palette where there are so many obvious combinations to work with. 6 Mystic Cool Eye Shadows ($36.00 U.S.) Cool Incantation is a frosty golden-white with an almost gray tinge to the white base. It reminded me a little of Nanogold but yellow. Blue Enchantment is a deep turquoise with subtle shimmer. Surprisingly, MAC doesn’t have a shade like this in their permanent line. It’s almost as if Shimmermoss and Bottle Green had a baby. Deep Secret is a shimmery, jewel-toned indigo-blue. It’s incredibly pretty, and it reminded me of a darker Cinders eyeshadow (one of my all-time favorite limited edition shades). Shhh, Don’t Tell is a satiny pale neutral pink that goes on like a dusty rose pink. It was hard to get it to show up really well on my skin tone without a base. Rose Potion is a frosty rose. It’s a fairly simple shade, but it’s not one I’ve seen often by MAC either. Violet Vow is a cool-toned, dark brown with kind of a purple edge to it. I found this one harder to work with, and I felt like it wasn’t as pigmented as it could have been. I didn’t fall head over heels in love with this palette, but I did like it. I think there are some great colors in this palette, but long-time collectors may find they have similar shades (at least, similar enough) in their stash already.

It’s an eggplant-y plum with a soft, mostly matte appearance. It’s richly pigmented and goes on opaque in one swipe. It’s creamy and easy to work with, but it does dry down after about thirty seconds or so. It doesn’t budge, fade, or smudge throughout the day, and it really holds its own amongst the gel eyeliner heavyweights.

The Eye Quartet includes a soft, shimmery milky pink, high-sheen peachy-gold, subdued taupe brown with subtle gold shimmer, and a richer, chocolate brown with just a smidgen of gold specks in it. It also has a black-brown cream liner included with the palette. All four shades are pigmented, and the eyeshadows themselves are smooth to the touch. They blend easily, and this combination of shades is actually very easy to use, because they work so well together. It’s not quite a neutral quad–almost like a neutral quad with a kick, I suppose. It’s perfect for the holidays, but it’s a palette you could easily continue to use throughout the year. The packaging is stunning; it’s a heavy metal-ish compact that looks like gold. I may even go as far as to say I like the packaging more than the contents! It’s just particularly lovely and well-done, and I am happy that the insides didn’t disappoint. I only found one drawback for this eyeshadow palette, and it’s the price. The price is really tough to swallow, even for Clarins. Even though you are getting 0.17 oz. of eyeshadow in the palette, it still works out to be $388.24/ounce–which prices it above MAC and NARS, but around the level of Givenchy and Chanel. They sell eyeshadow quartets as part of their regular line-up at $40 each, so I do think you are paying quite a bit on top of this for the packaging itself.

"['MAC Magic, Mirth, & Mischief Review: Sorceress Eye Shadows Photos, Swatches Reviews Oct 16, 2009 October 16, 2009 6 Sorceress Eye Shadows MAC Magic, Mirth, & Mischief Review: Sorceress Eye Shadows I’ve always liked MAC eyeshadow palettes, because I do feel like they represent a chance to get multiple eyeshadows at a more affordable price point, and MAC has put out some great limited edition shades in holiday palettes in the past. This year’s palettes actually reminded me of a bit of the Ornamentalism palettes from a few years ago–which is a good thing. The packaging is better, though, this year, as it’s sleek, functional, and feels like it has more quality than the last few years’ palettes. 6 Sorceress Eye Shadows ($36.00 U.S.) White Rabbit is a frosty silver-tinged white. It’s not a particularly unique shade, and I’d say it’s a little too frosty to work well as a highlighter for most. Hold My Gaze is a gray-green base with golden-green shimmer. This is actually a very unique shade, and I’m not sure I’ve ever seen an eyeshadow of this color before (which is pretty surprising). It has decent pigmentation. It’s just a very unusual shade. Edge of Dark is a charcoal gray with silver gray shimmer, and I had some issues getting it to go on smoothly. It doesn’t have the best texture, but it is a lustre, so I’m not surprised. Magnetized is a frosty white-purple. It kind of reminded me of a lighter, whiter Beautiful Iris eyeshadow. Hypnotizing is a grayed down mauve. It’s dark yet light, because it’s not an intense shade. Altered State is a dark, almost jewel-toned purple with slight reddish brown tones. I liked this shade a lot. I liked the combination of colors MAC put into the Sorceress combination, and I was pleasantly surprised by Hold My Gaze.

It’s an eggplant-y plum with a soft, mostly matte appearance. It’s richly pigmented and goes on opaque in one swipe. It’s creamy and easy to work with, but it does dry down after about thirty seconds or so. It doesn’t budge, fade, or smudge throughout the day, and it really holds its own amongst the gel eyeliner heavyweights. I like this with neutrals, but it especially pops with a healthy dose of sparkling gold eyeshadow, too! I don’t think I own any other gel eyeliners in this particular color, so that’s a huge deal for me — love it when that happens!

"['Make Up For Ever HD Blush — Nip Slip, Star Struck, First Kiss — Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 29, 2010 March 29, 2010 Make Up For Ever #5 Nip Slip HD Blush More on Make Up For Ever HD Blush A few weeks ago, I reviewed Make Up For Ever’s HD Blush in three shades ( #3 Truth or Dare, #4 Walk of Shame, and #6 Quickie ). Today, I’m sharing with you three more shades and a run-down of them, but this is less a review as it is simply showing you what three other shades look like in real life. I did, however, receive a full-size sample of #5 Nip Slip (can you believe they got away with that name?!), so I can confirm what I thought previously: the pump delivery system does pump out way too much if you simply do one pump. You really have to be careful and squeeze out just the tiniest bit. It’s better to go under than over, because you’ll end up wasting a good bit otherwise. I actually think I may prefer using them out of the 5-gram sample jars, just because I don’t have to worry about getting too much at once! Nip Slip (#5) is a neutral, slightly yellow-toned pink that would look beautiful and fresh on both cool and warm skin tones. I think this is a good shade for light to medium to dark skin tones, too — it’s very buildable, so you can achieve that brighter pop of pink if you so desire. Star Struck (#14) is a soft apricot peach that goes on more orange-apricot when blended and smoothed onto skin. Despite having a stronger orange tone, it’s not overly warm. It almost reads neutral to me, but I’d err on the side of warm. First Kiss (#12) is a brightened orange with a soft shimmer/satin-y sheen built-in. It’s not neon orange, but it’s not quite the “bright apricot” that Sephora describes it as (even when it’s been blended out). This is definitely one of the more pigmented shades, so go easy if you want softer, sheerer color. It’s easier to intensify than it is to mute! Other shades include: Innuendo #1 (vibrant plum), Caught in the Act #2 (bright raspberry), One Too Many #7 (peachy beige), PDA #8 (pinky nude), In the Spotlight #9 (nude), Skinny Dipping #10 (light orange brown), Mistaken Identity #11 (redwood brown), Smooth Talker #13 (vibrant pale pink). I previously reviewed Truth or Dare #3 (hot pink), Walk of Shame #4 (bubblegum pink), and Quickie #6 (salmon pink) here . Make Up For Ever’s HD Blush wears well throughout the day. It’s easy to use, because it blends and softens without a lot of work, making it harder to make mistakes as long as you use less. You do not need to use a lot–I can’t stress it enough–we’re not even talking a pea-size of product. We’re talking about a pin-drop-size! One bottle will last you quite awhile, I’d imagine.

This review is one of those short and sweet kind, because the product itself is really simple. Like many Aveeno products, it’s not about frills, it’s about meeting a need. If I had to compare this to another high-end brand, I’d consider this similar to Philosophy’s Purity Made Simple (Foaming). This one comes in a bottle-shaped container with a pump to distribute the foam cleanser. I find one or two pumps is all I need to feel clean. It is advertised as a makeup removing cleanser, not just a cleanser, and it’s unfortunate, because it doesn’t quite remove all makeup. Whenever I have a makeup remover, I test it against the long-lasting power of MAC Fluidline. This removed some, but it didn’t remove all. It does remove the majority of my makeup (eyeshadow, non-waterproof mascara, foundation), but it’s not necessarily the best choice for heavier or more long-wearing products. I do, personally, prefer to remove heavier makeup with an oil-based makeup remover (like Lancome’s Bi-Facil) before I do my nightly cleanser, so it’s not a big deal for me. It’s just something that does take away from this product’s score, since it doesn’t completely live up to its claims. It smells like something soft and clean and a little sweet–it reminded me of baby shampoo, to be honest. When I was trying to describe it, all I could think of was baby shampoo as my descriptor. Bottom Line: This is an affordable cleanser that works well for daily dirt and grime and light to medium makeup. If you’re looking for a cleanser to remove heavy eyeliner, you may want to look elsewhere. I actually really liked it, and I was pleasantly surprised by it overall. I’ll probably be switching over my boyfriend over to this from Philosophy’s Purity Made Simple when he runs out. (Well, I’m going to have to see if Aveeno offers a foaming cleanser in this product line that doesn’t have “makeup remover” on it!)

What about you? Would you wear this red? The Scarlet Season is a series of posts showcasing and featuring my favorite shades of red lips–from glosses to lipsticks that runs through December 2009.

Vegas Volt lipstick is a bright, orangey-coral shade with lots of color pay off and a super creamy finish. This is definitely named well! See two more ! Ravishing lipstick is a soft, peachy coral shade with lots of creaminess and pigmentation. It looks almost matte, with just a slight sheen to the finish.

"['MAC Cosmetics – Slimshines 2008 Review and Swatches Reviews Feb 07, 2008 February 07, 2008 OVERALL , the launch is great because it offers twenty shades of Slimshines that are all permanent to the MAC Cosmetics line. This means that you can happily have a favorite that you can repurchase again and again–not to mention you don’t have to rush out and buy all twenty for fear of them selling out and missing out! The Slimshine formula is very creamy and smooth, more moisturizing than most lipsticks, and the color pay off is fairly decent. I personally find that Slimshines do not last nearly as long as a typical lipstick, because of how creamy they are, you tend to put on more product and it seems like you get less than in a tube of lipstick. The texture/formula is non-sticky, and they are quite glossy/high sheen, which is a plus for those who have no love for lipglass because of its tackiness. My personal favorites were Grenadine, Intimidate, Rock Out, Voile, Gaily, and Scant. Assertive is a rose with red and peach undertones and gold shimmer that goes on fairly sheerly. Bare is a smooth pale gray-pink with little shimmer but lots of shine. I would consider this in the same family as Blankety lipstick. Cocoamour is a warm brown with gold shimmer with decent color but is still buildable. I like the golden shimmer in this, though I think the brown color is still too dark for my lips (alone, at least). Funshine is a warm medium pink with no real shimmer but is incredibly glossy with fairly good color pay off. The name is true–this color just seems fun. Gaily is a coral-red with little shimmer and lots of high sheen; it’s pretty and I think those who find true reds too bold, this may be a nice subtler red. Grenadine is a deep raspberry red with little shimmer and good color pay off. This is a definite favorite of mine, but when am I not attracted to this color family? Lovey Dove is a sheer strawberry peach kind of color with low level shimmer (gold sheen perhaps). Nice, but not a stand out color for me. Intimidate is a pink with purple-gray undertones with good opacity. It is a nice color, kind of an easy-to-wear shade for casual days. Long Stem Rose is a gorgeous shimmery medium pink with golden sheen that goes on sheerly but is somewhat buildable. I like this as a great color for light makeup days. Missy is a warm orange-peach kind of color, more wearable than say Vegas Volt, but still one of the bolder colors of the twenty. Most Wanted is a very dark burgundy with red and gold shimmer–more shimmer than most of the other Slimshines. I liked it, but I think it may be too vampy for my skintone. Mousse is a glossy warm caramel brown with little to no shimmer. It’s not a color I could wear (honestly, browns and I don’t seem to get along!), but I think it’s a great color for others. Pleasing is a mauvy kind of color, fairly light and sheer, with subtle golden pearl reflects. It’s a nice everyday shade. Prudeaux is a lovely glossy burgundy color–much like Most Wanted–without a lot of shimmer. It does go on more sheerly than Most Wanted, as well, which may make it a better option for the majority. Rock Out is this year’s “Kissable.” It is a bright fuchsia pink with subtle golden-pink shimmer, and the color pay off is decent. Scant is a deep red-plum with gold shimmer and lots of sheen. I like that it has a lot of color when it goes on, which is always a good thing in my book. Think Tan is a dark brown with red shimmer in it that goes on fairly sheerly. I’d love to see someone wear this, just because I can’t imagine it on me. Ultra Elegant is a darker coral/peach color with brown undertones. I think this may make a great base underneath brighter lipglasses or glosses. Urgent! is the “red” of the launch, but it is a very sheer, glossy red (seems blue-based to me). Pretty, but since it isn’t opaque, I’m not that interested in it. Voile is one of my favorites, because it so pretty swatched. It is a pale yellow with lots of golden shimmer. It seems more like a gloss than a lipstick, since it doesn’t provide much color on its own.

"['Best Gifts for the Girl Who Has Everything zArchived Nov 24, 2009 November 24, 2009 Holiday 2009 Gift Guide: Best Gifts for the Girl Who Has Everything I have to admit; when I was putting together this selection of gifts to give (or receive!), I considered and chose a lot of gifts that I thought would make sense for me–because beauty wise? I am kind of this girl. I don’t think it’d be honest to try and downplay that I have a respectably sized beauty stash, so let’s not sugarcoat it: I don’t really need more makeup (in fact, need has long as since been replaced with want ). So I thought to myself, “What could others give me that would still excite me?” I am also notorious for my lack of patience, so when there’s something I want (beauty or otherwise), I tend to buy it myself if I really want it. What are your picks for the girl who has everything? My picks: Holiday Cookbook ($35.00) is a six-piece shower gel set (each with 2 oz.) housed in a cardboard “cookbook.” It contains the following scents: Red Velvet Cake, Cinnamon Buns, Spicy Pear Cobbler, Pumpkin Spice Muffin, Gingerbread, and Double Rich Hot Cocoa. Delicious! You can find this gift at: Nordstrom , Philosophy.com , Sephora . Urban Decay Show Pony Shadow Box ($30.00) contains six shades of eyeshadow – a good mix of funky, brighter shades with more neutral toned shadows, plus a miniature-sized 24/7 Eye Pencil in Zero and Eyeshadow Primer Potion. The shades included in this palette are Snatch, Mildew, Flash, Painkiller, Smog, and Toasted. I do have this already, but it’s a palette that some beauty buffs may overlook in lieu of the BoS II. Urban Decay Book of Shadows Vol. II ($48.00) is a palette that’s big on value and big on color. For the person who’s been extra good this year, you may find yourself wanting to give this collection of sixteen eyeshadows to them. It includes new/exclusive shades: AC/DC, Nylon, Mushroom, Sphynx, Jinx, Homegrown, Misdemeanor, and Perversion; as well as existing/best-selling shades: Sellout, Gunmetal, Ecstasy, Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, Twice Baked, Half Baked, Flipside, and YDK. Also included are miniature-sized Zero and Bourbon 24/7 Eyeliner Pencils and a travel-size Eyeshadow Primer Potion–all three fit nicely within the palette to boot. Like the Show Pony Shadow Box, there are some of us who felt like we just couldn’t justify the price tag on this palette or felt it was “too similar” (though I don’t think it is!) to last year’s. Urban Decay 24/7 Super Stash ($36.00) is a superb collection of miniature-size eyeliners in a variety of bold shades. If you’ve been reading the blog for a bit, you’ll know that I favor these liners quite a bit–they’re often my go-to liner. I absolutely adore their holiday sets, because practically speaking, most of us won’t finish an entire pencil of blue, but half the size and cheaper? Yes, count me in! The set contains nine different shades: Binge, Corrupt, Eldorado, Graffiti, Oil Slick, Ransom, Rockstar, Stash, and Zero. Everyone can use more eyeliner! Smashbox Wish For The Perfect Pencils ($32.00) includes five, full-sized and stunning limited edition shades of pencil eyeliner (Celebrate, Dream, Hope, Love, and Wish). Smashbox did a tremendous job formulating these eye pencils–they are definitely a top formula and wear so well. These are so fantastic in quality and only available for the holiday season that I think the seasoned beauty shopper would appreciate this surprise. See more picks. .. Bliss Softening Socks ($48.00) are these awesome socks that pretty much come with this gel lining that soothes and moisturizes your feet while you wear them. Bliss says that a pair of socks lasts for up to fifty uses (not too bad!) and you wear ’em for about twenty minutes. (You can even get them in a nifty holiday gift box at Bliss .) You can also give the same technology, but for hands (gloves, rather than socks, duh!). This kind of an indulgent gift, so it may be something that would appeal to beauty addicts, but not something you’d cave in regularly, so it’s something nice to receive! Godiva Candles ($22.50 for 7 oz.) have some very aromatic scents that burn for apporixmately sixty hours. I don’t burn candles religiously, but I really love receiving them as gifts, because they’re something I do enjoy but don’t always feel compelled to actually purchase (though that’s been changing, ha!). BURN Candles ($60.00 for ~100 hours) come in amazing, complex scents that really waft throughout the room/rooms. I’ve found that I’ll burn one in the office, and the scent will be in the living room/kitchen and even in the bedroom. The scent is just enough to enjoy without being overwhelming. For the holidays, they’ve added the following scents: Firewood Embers, Grenadine Pomegranate and Sugar Pine Balsam. If you’re finding the price tag a little gift-giving prohibitive, they also have their BURN VOYAGE line, which are smaller-sized candles for $25.00 each that burn for approximately 35 hours. (On the other side, they also have candles that burn for approximately 150 hours for $95.00 a pop.) You can also find BURN at Barneys . Tom Ford Private Blend Eau de Parfum ($180.00 for 1.7 oz.) is an ultra elegant, so luxe gift to give (and uhh, receive? Oh, yes, please!). While I haven’t yet caved on any of Tom Ford’s amazing scents yet, I do take a sniff and test them whenever I’m at Nordstrom! Everyone I know who’s purchased a bottle hasn’t been disappointed. Seriously, I can’t think of many (or any that I know) who would be distraught to receive a bottle of Tom Ford. Clarisonic PLUS Skincare Brush Set ($225.00) is the latest Clarisonic, with a detachable body brush in addition to the facial brush. Like some other more price-heavy beauty items, it’s something a lot of beauty lovers lust after but can’t commit to purchasing–the exact reasons why it makes for an excellent gift to receive! Guerlain Le Rouge G de Guerlain Lipstick ($45.00 for 0.12 oz.) is a creamy, smooth, pigmented lipstick formula that applies and clings to lips without drying them. It has the most subtle, yet noticeable, shimmer that really shines without being garish. It’s really a top formula, but the price tag definitely slots it into the luxury bag. I think I’ll go as far as to say that everyone should own at least one shade of Rouge G (I think that the line offers many, many holy grail potential shades–for the right person), but that price tag makes us all think twice… or ten times. MAKE UP FOR EVER Aqua Eyes Collector Set (Value $425) Aqua Eyes Collector Set ($249.00) includes twenty-five shades of Make Up For Ever’s famous Aqua Eyes Eyeliner. The included shares are: Aqua Eyes in Champagne 23L, Fuschia Pink 13L, Purple 11L, Black Purple 6L, Shimmering Plum 4L, Burgandy 18L, Pearly Brown 2L, Light Brown 19L, Light Taupe 24L, Bronze Green 5L, Bronze 10L, Gold 9L, Pistachio 17L, Green 16L, Forest Green 20L, Turquoise 7L, Blue With Green Highlights 12L, Majorelle Blue 15L, Iridescent Navy Blue 3L, Mat Black 0L, Star Black 1L, Dark Grey 21L, Grey 22L, Silver 8L, White 14L. It’s a value set, even if it is a heavy investment. I love Aqua Eyes, and I can definitely tell you this set tempted me on more than one occasion (I managed to resist my staring at the dozens and dozens of liners I have sitting in a drawer already). T3 Bespoke Labs Evolution Dryer ($300.00) will cut your gift recipient’s blow drying time in half, most likely! This is one of those products often overlooked in lieu of sparkly new makeup, but it is an absolute essential if you blow dry your hair regularly.']",eec567150e1995686a022df1f084e3727369c536,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/best-gifts-for-the-girl-who-has-everything/,['2009-11-24 00:00:00']

"['Guerlain Perle de Lune KissKiss Gloss Review, Photos, Swatches, Lip Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Oct 30, 2009 October 30, 2009 Guerlain : Perle de Lune KissKiss Gloss Guerlain Perle de Lune KissKiss Gloss ($29.00 for 0.17 oz.) is one of three new, limited edition shades of KissKiss Gloss from Guerlain’s Holiday Collection . Perle de Lune is a sheer, milky pale pink (it’s almost colorless, so soft the pink is!) with a large dose of pink, gold, and bronze shimmer. This is a particularly glittery shade of KissKiss Gloss, but it doesn’t feel gritty, so I do like that. I’d also say that this is definitely a shade you’d layer on a lipstick rather than wear alone, but for some, it’s a nice way to add sparkle without adding a lot of color. KissKiss Gloss is a non-sticky, moisturizing gloss that lasts about four hours or so on me. I love the way it sparkles and glitters on my lips, and they always look fantastic layered over lipsticks. The scent is sort of a sweet rose, which isn’t always loved by lipgloss fans alike, so you may want to give it a whiff before making the leap for this shade. This particular holiday shade reminded me a lot of Chanel’s Holiday Aqualumieres , which also very sheer but had lots of sparkle–almost a mix of Canari and Colibri . Bottom Line: If you’re a fan of sparkly glosses and don’t need a lot of color in your gloss, Perle de Lune may be right up your alley. It’s a bit of a splurge at $29 and you only get 0.17 oz., so it’s not the cheapest gloss around. The packaging of this limited edition shade is also very pretty.

"['Guerlain’s Summer Splash Collection Review, Photos, Swatches May 01, 2009 May 01, 2009 Guerlain’s Summer Splash Collection is the latest offering from the ultra luxe brand. It features several products from waterproof mascara to eyeshadows to a quad to loose powder kohl. I wasn’t able to try everything out, but I did get to try several items, and likely the more “hot ticket” items, so hopefully it’ll help you when you’re trying to make your hauling decisions! ? Perles des Mers Eyeshadow Palette ($58.00) is the item that caught my attention the most when I first learned about the collection. It’s not quite as head-turning in person (it’s just not quite as bright), but it’s still a good interpretation of what it is. I’d say the only color that wasn’t quite as bright as I expected was the teal shade. The lightest shade is a soft white with a pink undertone. The second lightest color is a frosty, white-peach shade. The third lightest color is a dirty bronzy-gold shade, kind of like a light antique gold. The final shade is the teal color, which is a teal-blue with green sheen/overlay. It’s an interesting mix of teal and noticeable green. I think these shades work well together, and I like that there are some lighter shades to mix with the teal. I’m not 100% sold on the quad yet, but I think it’s definitely worth taking a peek at. Continue reading the review, plus see swatches and more photos ! Nacre des Mers (Pressed) Meteorites ($65.00) is sheer, lightly shimmery warm-toned white-beige. It’s extremely sheer, but it does show up as a soft powder on me. Meteorites always amuse me, if only because their scent reminds me of Mr. Bubble (the bubble bath)–which isn’t a bad thing–but it brings back interesting memories. If you’re looking for a Meteorite with more color, this isn’t your best bet. For me, this is definitely a highlighter, though a glorious one at that. This is sophisticated shimmer at its best, because it ends up looking a lot like a gentle glowy sheen than anything else. Terracotta Pearly Shell Illuminating Sun Powder ($65.00) is a slightly warm, almost neutral dirty brown-orange bronzing color. It actually goes on my skin (NC20/NC25) really well. I thought it would be too dark, but applied with a light hand, it gives my cheeks just the faintest bronzed look. The shimmer seems like mostly an overlay with very little shimmer in the actual powder. Lagon Bleu Terracotta Loose Powder Khol ($34.00) is a blue-green with yellow-green sheen powder khol. It’s an interesting product, and I’m curious to see how I end up using it. The color isn’t quite as blue as I was thinking it would be, but I like the shade nonetheless. Bleu Cruise LE2 Waterproof Mascara ($35.00) I haven’t tried on lashes yet (I keep forgetting!) but I did swatch it, at least, and it is a nice shade of subdued blue with just a faint green tone. Corail des mers KissKiss Stick Gloss Extreme Shine ($30.00) is an absolutely STUNNING shade of summery coral-pink. I can see myself wearing this alone for everyday wear, when I want some color on my lips. It goes on fairly pigmented; it isn’t sheer, but it feels sheer. It has that glossy finish and light texture.

Mendel, & Behnaz Sarafpour zArchived Feb 07, 2008 February 07, 2008 BADGLEY MISCHKA | Tom Pecheux designs the look that focuses on a multi-layered colored eye that goes from brow to lid. It goes from burgundy to brown to golden bronze with golden pigment just above the pupils. In fact, it was a rose pink, a new MAC pigment for fall, nameless thus far. “Then I put a bit of green inthe corners of the eye — just for fun!” he added. Lips were beige and glossy, rather late seventies a la Lauren Hutton. Look Breakdown | MAC Select Moisturecover was worked into the skin to help hydrate the skin, followed by a dust of Invisible Set Powder to create a soft, matte finish. Salsa Rose and Devil Powder Blushes were brushed high on the cheek bones with MAC Brush 116. MAC Tarnish Eye Kohl and Chocolate Brown Pigment were mixed and applied with Brush 275 onto lid in an almond shape. Copper Pigment and Reflects Gold was layered on top to add a touch of shimmer. MAC Newly Minted Eye Shadow was patted into the inner corner of the eye, followed by Mystery Eye Shadow dusted over the lids to finish the look. Lashes were coated with Zoom Black Mascara. MAC Wildly Lush Plushglass was applied to the lips. “Mixture of texture and style – colourful, rich, young and playful,” says Tom Pecheux. MONIQUE LHUILLIER | Val Garland created a look with a full-court, all-color eye socket using a pigment in a heavy grey blue that melded into inky blue, purple, and burgundy. She described it as, “Quite reflective” and “quite liquidy.” The rest of the face was neutral bare, with a sheer vino lip. Look Breakdown | MAC Face and Body Foundation was used to prep the skin, followed by Bamboo Créme Colour base brushed with MAC Brush 188 to lightly shade the cheeks. MAC Smolder Eye Pencil was applied to bottom lash line, as well as inside the water line of the eye. Indigo Eye Pencil was used as a base on the inner and outer corners of the lid, blended up from lash line to brow. Using 239 and 224 Brushes, Blue Pigment was layered on top. MAC Plumed Violet Créme Colour Base was applied to the centre of lid with Brush 272, followed by Violet Pigment layered on top with a 239 Brush. Reflects Blue Pigment was applied to the inner and outer corners of the lid to intensify the colour. Night Moth Eye Pencil was applied to the bottom lash line and blended out with a 239 Brush. Beauty Marked Eye Shadow was pressed into the Night Moth with a 239 Brush to define the eye. MAC Night Moth Lip Pencil was applied to the lips and blended with Brush 318. “Marbleizing of three colours – inky blue, rich burgundy and intense purple. Dramatic, but poetic at the same time. The look is a Lolita Lempika painting mixed with a Deborah Turbeville photograph,” says Val Garland. RODARTE | Kate and Laura Mulleavy’s clothes are froty couture-like confections–completed concotions that are always colorful and textural wonderlands. James Kaliardos chose a frosted winter lip, using sheer layers of matte and sheen throughout the plains of the face, working with light and texture. Look Breakdown | Skin was paled down with an application of Face and Body Foundation, followed by White Paintstick. Luna Créme Colour Base was applied with fingers to the bridge of the nose and cupids bow. Paintsticks in White and Pink Vivid were applied to the lid, followed by Underage Lipgloss. Fuchsia Pigment was brushed onto the outer corners of the eye and under the lower lash line with Brush 210. Lips were prepped with an application of PRO Lip Erase, then Desire Lipstick was brushed onto the lips. “Japanese horror movies; ethereal, dark and dreamy – transparent, pale skin, hardcore vamp lips, accentuated cheeks and delicate eyes,” says James Kaliardos. J. MENDEL | Mendel’s girls are chic, svelte, smart, social, and rich. Gucci Westman kept their faces matte and clean with a caramel cheek and lip tones with bronze pigment on the lids with just a touch of gray. Look Breakdown | Makeup artist Gucci Westman used MAC Cosmetics to create a metallic eye to represent the richness of Mendel’s clothes, as well as the legendary site of the show. “I am very inspired by the Plaza. It is fitting for Gilles [Mendel]’s clothes, with the rich textures in the environment and its gold gilding. Gilles has a lot of brown and gold in the collection and I wanted to extend that into the makeup.” Westman covered lids with a smoky, metallic brown shade and lined eyes with a gold liquid liner. Natural skin and lips kept the focus on eyes, which were without mascara. ( Source : WWD) BEHNAZ SARAFPOUR | With Gucci Westman at the helm, she did two-thirds of the models in a gray eye from lid to brow, with the other third in either lime green or fuchsia purple from lid to lash. She even used the respective colors to “flock” the lashes instead of contrastign with dark mascara. Look Breakdown | MAC Select Moistureblend Foundation was blended with a 217 Brush where needed. MAC Canary Yellow and Bitter Eye Shadows were applied with a 252 Brush from lash line to just above the crease and also along the lower lash line. The eye shadows were blended in a round shape, around the eye with a 224 Brush. MAC Myth Lipstick was applied with fingers. “It’s a fun season to be bold and get your rocks off as an artist. It’s all about enjoying colour, textures and freedom of expression,” says Gucci Westman. Check out more beauty shots from the shows! BADGLEY MISCHKA Monique Lhuillier RODARTE J.

When applied to lips, they can have a decent amount of slip. They almost seem to sit on lips and take quite awhile to sink in. The more pigmented ones (e.g. Florida) will stain lips if left on for long enough. I put about two or three layers of product on with a lip brush to get these, then I blended with my finger. So Sweet, So Easy looked the worst, because it came off frosty and showed off lip lines, while Joie-de-Vivre and Florida seemed to look the best. My apologies in advance for the ultra close-up of Optimistic Orange — it was the only photo that was remotely in focus, and I didn’t want to keep delaying this post so hopefully it still gives you an idea of it on lips, even if it is uber close. The taste is borderline tasteless to slightly plastic-y. It’s not delicious by any means, and there’s no real scent, but I probably wouldn’t recommend licking your lips with it. It’s not as bad as some of MAC’s Tinted Lip Conditioners , which definitely have a sunscreen taste to them.

"['New York Fashion Week Fall 2008 – Backstage Beauty with Gucci Westman at Thakoon zArchived Feb 07, 2008 February 07, 2008 THAKOON | Makeup artist Gucci Westman and designer Thakoon Panichgul partnered for the fourth season to create yet another inspired look for Fashion Week. Gucci wanted makeup that was sweet but tough to complement Thakoon’s extensive color palette of greens, burgundies, yellows and fuchsias and interesting layers and patterns. Gucci focused on a beautiful wash of color that when seen on the runway blossomed on the models’ faces. “As a makeup artist, I love the look of artists’ pastels,” says Gucci. Using a mixture of pink and lilac blushes, Gucci created a soft cheek. Placement of the color was important as she didn’t want a traditional blush look. After applying the color higher up than normal, just below the eye, Gucci made sure the blush was not too severe or too low on the face by blending with a foundation brush. Working her way up to the eyes, Gucci layered and blended deep gray light gray, white and soft purple shadows on the lids. Gucci curled the lashes and lightly dusted them with powder. Everything about the look was matte except the lips. Combining cream blushes and a boysenberry gloss from the Fall 2008 collection, “Maharani Jewels,” Gucci created a mauvey lip stain with a bit of sheen, which perfectly complemented the pale palette of the face.

"['How to Get Perfectly Pouty Lips: Smoothe, Moisturized Lips Features Jan 05, 2010 January 05, 2010 How to Get Perfectly Pouty Lips One of the more frequent questions I get asked is, “How do you keep your lips looking nice?” I’ll share my own routine, any secrets I have that I use on my own lips, and additional beauty tips to keep your lips in tip top shape. The Perfect Pout Toolkit It is important that you have the right tools in your beauty stash to help your lips stay pretty, so you should make sure to have these on hand at all times… Exfoliator/Scrub Product Suggestions: Jojoba Oil + Sugar, Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment ($23), Sara Happ The Lip Scrub ($24) Daily Lip Balm Product Suggestions: Yes to Carrots Lip Butter ($3), Rosebud Lip Balm ($7), Smashbox Lip Treatment ($15) Nightly Lip Balm Product Suggestions : Carmex ($3), Vaseline ($5), Philosophy Kiss Me Intense Lip Therapy ($20.00) The Perfect Pout Routine In the morning, check to see if your lips are dry, cracked, or flaking. If it seems minor, putting a little toner on a cotton pad and wiping lips always helps me. (For this, I love NARS Hydrating Freshening Lotion ($36), because it’s very lightweight and never pulls moisture from my lips; it also has grape seed oil and aloe in it.) You can also take a soft-bristled toothbrush and a little warm water or an oil like jojoba oil and softly brush against lips for an easy, at-home scrub. If it’s not a big deal, go easy and just be gentle; you want to get dead cells off, but you don’t want to over-do it. I usually don’t find myself needing to do this step daily, but I might do it before I do several lip swatches or as needed. To-do list : gentle, morning exfoliation when lips seem to need it During the day, apply a good daily lip balm every few hours. You shouldn’t have to reapply hourly, and your lips shouldn’t feel like the moisture has been sucked out of them after a few hours, either. You want a lip balm that helps to protect your lips and retain moisture. The more emollient a lip balm (often oil-based or with a waxy base), the more likely it is to create a better, thicker barrier against the elements. If you’re going outdoors or into cold weather, opt for a thicker lip balm and slick it on more often than you think you need to. Make sure you’re drinking several glasses of water/liquid throughout the day; it’s good for, well, pretty much everything beauty-wise, but it also helps keep lips from drying out. T o-do list: apply a moisturizing lip balm three to four times a day, protect lips from harsh conditions and cold weather At night, I like to do a more intensive exfoliation or scrub down two or three times a week. I personally use The Lip Scrub by Sara Happ ($24), which is a sugar-based scrub that you gently work onto lips and then wipe away with a tissue. I also use a warm washcloth that’s been wrung out to remove the scrub, though. Gently remove it, though – you don’t want to violently wipe away any bits! You can always make your own scrub using any thick lip balm or oil (again, jojoba oil is my favorite to use) and add in some sugar. To-do list: exfoliate/scrub lips once to three times weekly Before bed , apply a thick lip balm. The thicker the better! I often use Vaseline ($5) or Philosophy’s Kiss Me Intense Lip Therapy ($20), and don’t be shy about how much you use. To-do list: apply a thick, emollient lip balm or treatment before bed When You Wear Makeup Before you apply lipstick or gloss, make sure your lips are moisturized. I like to apply a jellyish lip balm on my lips about a half hour before I apply lipstick, then I kiss the back of my hand to remove any excess, then apply lipstick or gloss as usual. If you’re applying a gloss, I’ve found that you don’t need to remove as much excess beforehand; with lipstick, the oil from lip balm often breaks down the product faster, which is why removing excess is important. It is also important to use lipsticks and glosses that don’t dry out your lips! I know I’ve personally found that many lipglosses dry out my lips and cause them to peel, which is both painful and ugly to go through, so I often go for lipstick (even something sheer) underneath my gloss so that doesn’t happen. Tips & Tricks Sunscreen is always helpful in a daily lip balm, so consider picking up one that contains SPF — there are a lot more on the market nowadays compared to a year or two years ago. If you don’t feel the lip balm, it might not be enough for you. Lip balm is often more of a protectant than anything else, so if it’s so sheer and invisible, it might not be doing the job you want it to. During the day, I like something thick enough to feel, but not so thick that it’s like a coat of jelly on my lips (e.g. Vaseline is too much during the day, but perfect at night). Lip lines can be aggravating, particularly if color regularly sinks into them. Consider a lip plumper or line filler for use on the lips (I like MAC’s Prep + Prime Lip or Line Filler). A lip plumping gloss or lipstick can also help make lines look less noticeable and lips appear fuller, but be prepared for a sting if you do (it will vary from person to person, depending on their tolerance and sensitivity). Soothe cracked lips by gently exfoliating away dry parts and by using very emollient, rich, and thick products — you may even find a rich cream works better than your average lip balm. Avoid licking, biting, or peeling lips, because these are all behaviors that exacerbate the problem rather than curing it. If you have a tendency to lick your lips, avoid flavored lip balms and glosses. I personally find MAC Tinted Lip Conditioner to taste like sunscreen, and maybe that’s a way to cure your desire to taste!

"['CoverGirl LashBlast Length Review, Comparison, Photos Sep 02, 2009 September 02, 2009 CoverGirl LashBlast Length Goes Long CoverGirl LashBlast Length Mascara ($7.49) is the newest mascara launch from CoverGirl. With the popularity of LashBlast solidified, CoverGirl’s LashBlast Length is a lengthening mascara. CoverGirl touts that it makes lashes “80% longer looking vs. your bare lashes” (on average). LashBlast Length indeed delivers–and does it well–when it comes to lengthening lashes. I felt like my lashes were significantly lengthened with just three quick coats of mascara. I saw instant lengthening and darkening of my natural lashes. I wouldn’t say it added any thickness/volume to my lashes, though (which, sadly, I definitely need!), but this is one of the better mascaras I’ve tried in terms of lengthening prowess. The mascara also stays true to the advertising: it does not smudge or flake during the day. In fact, it did such a great job at lengthening my natural lashes that when I tried a few other mascaras during the week, I felt like they gave me rather stumpy lashes! The length might be so much more dramatic than the average mascara that I just might not worry so much about a mascara that lengthens, thickens, and volumizes all at once. My only issue is you really should stick to two or three coats, and don’t try to make your lashes look thicker with this mascara — you’ll only end up in Clump City with nowhere to turn! The packaging is much slimmer compared to the original LastBlast (huge plus!) and the brush is easy to use. It has a plastic (I do believe, it certainly looks so) applicator that grabs onto lashes well–I didn’t feel like it left too many lashes behind. The brush itself is fairly long and very thin/narrow. Those with smaller eyes may find it a bit unwieldy, though I didn’t personally experience any trouble using the wand (I’d say I have medium-sized to small-sized eyes). LashBlast Length officially launches and debuts in mass retailers around the nation in September, but limited quantities are available for early purchasing at select retailers online (Amazon, CVS, Drugstore.com, and Walgreens). Product : 8/10 Value : 9/10 Ease of Use : 8/10 Packaging : 7/10 Overall : 8/10 Recommendation : At just over $7 a pop, it’s a good, budget-friendly option for the mascara maven looking for long, wondrous lashes.

"['Too Faced Spring 2010 Eyeshadow Duos Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jan 05, 2010 January 05, 2010 Too Faced Teddy Bear & Heaven Eyeshadow Duo Spring Makeup: Neutrals from Too Faced For spring, Too Faced introduces four eyeshadow duos ($17.00 each) all in shiny black packaging with clear lids that snap shut. Teddy Bear & Heaven is a duo a dark, cool-toned grayish brown and a silky smooth pale beige-nude. They’re both matte in texture and have good pigmentation. Cocoa Puff & Honey Pot is a beautiful duo of a dark, rich chocolate brown with bronze brown undertones and golden shimmer and a metallic copper bronze with a high level of metallic-frost in its finish. I really loved the deep shade (I presume Cocoa Puff) — very intense, lovely, and easy to work with. Honey Pot is very flashy and has a great deal of metallic sheen. Erotica & Silk Teddy is like a cool-toned version of Cocoa Puff & Honey Pot, actually. It’s a cool-toned taupe chocolate brown with gold and green shimmer paired with a champagne pink with a bright metallic sheen. Like Honey Pot, Silk Teddy is very, very high in sheen. Sexpresso & Peach Fuzz has a dark, cool-toned espresso brown with a matte finish and a light peachy orange with gold flecks (but the base color felt rather matte with more of the glitter/shimmer as an overlay). According to Too Faced, the eyeshadow duos were their way of giving you the ability to repurchase your favorite shades from their Natural Eye Palette. I actually reviewed the Natural Eye Palette back in August when it first debuted. The shades they didn’t put into duo form were Velvet Revolver, Push-up, and Nude Beach (and by the way? Nude Beach is no loss, seriously!). I think it’s cool that Too Faced–at least it seems that way–listened to their fans and made sure they wouldn’t run out of their new favorite shades. I personally prefer the eyeshadow duo packaging — more durable, less messy, and I like being able to tote just one or two around, rather than entire palette. The palette was cute, though. This is also a nice way to maybe grab one duo instead of the entire palette if you were looking for a particular shade. The palette retailed for $34 and contained three larger sized shadows (0.07 oz. each) and six smaller sized shadows (0.03 oz. each), and the duos are a good size — 0.08 oz. for each duo (I imagine it’s split pretty evenly down the middle). You get a better bang for your buck with the palette, but you might prefer the set-up and convenience of the duos (or maybe only want one!). Bottom Line Smooth, buttery, and pigmented — these eyeshadows are particularly lovely, high quality, and they’re all easy to use neutrals. I actually much prefer these over the Fun in the Dark Palette and would put my money towards these instead! If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ?

"['Guerlain Terracotta Collection Review, Photos, Swatches Apr 29, 2009 April 29, 2009 Paradise Sand, Jungle Dust Guerlain’s Terracotta Collection was an early summer sleeper collection. It consisted of products from bronzing powders to lip balms to mineral eyeshadows. Here’s a review of several of the products from the collection! ? Paradise Sand and Jungle Dust Mineral Eyeshadows ($35.00 each) are loose, mineral eyeshadows kept in a convenient package. You twist the top off, and when you pull it out, there’s a wand attached to it, and it is the wand that picks up the color. This packaging makes it so I don’t get a big puff of mineral makeup all over my sink counter, for which I am quite happy! I absolutely LOVED the Gloss Cashmere Velvet Matte Glosses ($28.00 each). They came in Rose Pondichery, Beige Bengali, and Rouge Sultan. These are really the stand out products from the launch. Rose Pondichery is a rosey-beige; Beige Bengali is a deeper brownish-beige shade; and Rouge Sultan is an unforgivably scarlet red. I did also try High Shine Soothing Lip Balm ($30.00 each) in Coeur Caramel and Cocoa Love. Both shades are extremely sheer, but they are emollient and hydrating on lips. I can’t say that they’re worth $30 a pop, but they’re nice if you’ve got the money to spend. I’d much rather put my budget towards the glosses from this launch! See more photos and swatches !

"['Summer Makeup: Sunny Grass – Yellow, Chartreuse, and Green Looks Jan 12, 2010 January 12, 2010 Summer Makeup: Sunny Grass – Yellow, Chartreuse, and Green Here’s a fun look for all the green lovers out there! Oh, you say Lucky Green is not permament? Well, let me fill you in on a little something MAC has slipped under the radar this season… On January 15th, MAC Freestanding stores will have Lucky Green… permanently. Oh, yeah! (I actually have a fairly decent amount of pan showing on my Lucky Green, love it so!) Along with Lucky Green, PRO shades such as Atlantic Blue and a few additional shades will all be added the permanent eyeshadow range at freestanding stores. I don’t have much more information, but you can expect me to be at MAC first thing on the 15th to purchase one of each! ? From what readers and artists have told me, all MAC counters will get these shades in, but counters will only have them available until their stock runs out. It’s pretty much the equivalent of C-Shock in terms of shades — they’re bright, colorful pops of color. I won’t be able to tell you anything about quality ’til Friday, sorry folks! Here are the shades: Winkle Mid-tone cornflower blue Sunny Spot Light acid green yellow Lucky Green Frosted mid-tone lime Vibrant Grape Bright magenta violet Free To Be Bright true coral Atlantic Blue Bright violet blue Red Brick Orange red Goldenrod Bright marigold yellow You will need the following… Eyes : MAC Soft Ochre paint pot (neutral beige base), MAC Golden Olive Pigment (olive green), MAC Bright Sunshine Eyeshadow (PRO) (yellow), MAC Sour Lemon Eyeshadow (PRO) (chartreuse), MAC Lucky Green Eyeshadow (medium spring-y green), MAC Bio Green Eyeshadow (PRO) (medium green), MAC Humid Eyeshadow (forest green), MAC Bottle Green Eyeshadow (PRO) (dark green-teal), MAC Nylon Eyeshadow (golden highlighter), MAC Blacktrack Fluidline (black), Urban Decay Honey 24/7 Line r (gold), Make Up For Ever 20L Aqua Eyes Liner (green-teal), Chanel Exceptionnel Mascara (black) Cheeks : MAC Optimistic Orange Cremeblend Blush (orange) Lips : Maybelline Caramel Kiss Lipstick (caramel brown), Guerlain Champagne Pearl (#847) KissKiss Gloss (sheer beige) Brushes : 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 214 (smudge brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Optimistic Orange = Rich Coral CCB For eyes, start by applying Soft Ochre paint pot as your eyeshadow base all over the lid with the 249. With the 239 and water-based mixing medium (or water), apply Golden Olive pigment all over the lid portion. Using the 239, apply Bright Sunshine eyeshadow on the inner third of the eyelid. Next, apply Lucky Green eyeshadow on the middle third of the eyelid and lightly blend with the inner corner. Darken the outer third of the lid with Bio Green eyeshadow with the 239, gently brushing it into the lower crease. Lightly blend Humid eyeshadow, with the 239, on the outer corner and lid. Next, define the crease by applying Bottle Green eyeshadow with the 226. Lightly tap and brush Bright Sunshine eyeshadow directly above the crease to soften. To finish the eyeshadow look, sweep Nylon eyeshadow as a highlighter on the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying #20L eyeliner on the lower waterline, Honey eyeliner on the lower lash line, and Sour Lemon eyeshadow lightly patted below the lower lash line with the 219 brush. Finish by applying Blacktrack fluidline on upper lash line and then sweeping lashes with Exceptionnel mascara . For cheeks, apply Optimistic Orange cremeblend blush to the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Caramel Kiss lipstick first, and then layer Champagne Pearl lipgloss for a complementing lip.

This is one of two ultra-wearable shades of Rouge Allure Laque (the other being Ming). This is probably the one I reach for the most, because it’s particularly flattering on my warm skin tone. I love that it stays on for a good five or six hours, with the glossiness fading after two or three, but the color still lingering. I will say that it’s not quite as long-lasting as the majority of the Rouge Allure Laques, though. I’m so glad they’re permanent, though, because this is the shade I’m most likely to finish!

Both the Pearlmatte Eyeshadow and Face Powder are lovely to look at with their floral design, but the product itself is just okay. Pearlmatte Eyeshadow This is basically three eyeshadows in one, and the pieces are big enough that you can get your brush into each. It consists of a lightly shimmered white, a soft yellow-green with gold shimmer (think Juxt), and a medium blue-based pink with light shimmer (think Da Bling, but blue-based). The design dusts off pretty fast — I could barely see any of the floral portions once I did swatches. The shadows themselves are decently pigmented, but they’re not ultra rich. They also felt a little powdery, which I wasn’t thrilled with. Nice design, just an okay product. Pearlmatte Face Powder This contains four different shades within the compact, but realistically, as a face/cheek product, you’re going to end up with a swirl of colors, not just any of the four. In particular, the orange shade is incredibly small, so good luck wearing that alone if you’re brave enough to try! Nonetheless, I did swatch the four individual shades, and then I did a swirled swatch. The individual shades are: a yellowed, shimmered gold, mostly matte/satin peachy orange, sheer, deep pink, and a neutral tan-brown with no real shimmer. Swirled together, I ended up with a rather bronzy shade — it ran a little orange and had the yellow-gold shimmer in it. I don’t know if I’d use this as an all over face powder myself, because it seems more like a bronzer based on playing around with it so far. Coconut Ice Nail Lacquer I’d like to know why they named this Coconut Ice. Maybe I haven’t consumed enough coconut ice in my life, but I just envisioned a lightened shade — based on the name. I’ve read the description previously, so I wasn’t misled, but the name seemed off to me. This is a brightened peachy-coral kind of shade. It’s like Seasonal Peach with a lot more pink. It has a creamy finish, and I’d say it needs two to three coats to look right. It kind of reminded of an old, old nail polish called Pink Radar, except lighter and less pink. I liked it, but I like corals, so this wasn’t much of a surprise. See photos and swatches!

The middle shade is a dark pink with a subtle pearled sheen. The bottom shade is a pink-tinted white with a frosted shimmer-sheen. Together, they create a shimmery light-medium pink with subtle cool undertones. NARS New Order is cooler toned. MAC Blonde is similar in the pink tones, but not quite the same together. I feel like there are more dupes, but I couldn’t think of anything else. This shade produces much more color on the cheeks compared to Flower Fantasy . It has the same shimmery finish, which may or may not be what you’re looking for. If you want a softer finish, use less of the bottom shade, which contributes most of the shimmer as well as lightens the overall color. I wore this shade to test out the wear, and it managed to hang on for around six and a half hours before it started to fade and look patchy.

It’s a hot fuchsia pink with cool undertones and a matte finish. It has just a touch of sheen, but it really is quite matte. Illamasqua’s matte lipsticks are some of the least drying matte lipsticks around, but they may be more drying than some are used to (if you haven’t tried out mattes before — most of them can be a smidgen drying). Avenge is easy to apply, goes on creamy and doesn’t stick in places, so it gives lips even, opaque coverage without much fuss. The only downside?

These shades include: Midsummer’s Dream (pale pink lilac) and Play Day (pale milky coral). Midsummer’s Dream is a pale, milky pink with subtle cool undertones. It’s not quite opaque in two coats, but it’s more coverage than semi-sheer. It’s a little thick, and it is rather streaky on the initial coat. It’s very similar to China Galze Something Sweet . Nubar Pink Lily is warmer and brighter. Play Day is a peachy orange with a cream finish. Like Midsummer’s Dream , it is a bit streaky and takes awhile to dry, and it will pull if you apply a second coat and it hasn’t had enough time to dry down. It’s not quite opaque after applying two coats of polish, so you may want to do three if you dislike visible nail line of any kind. Chanel Peche Nacree is lighter and pearled. Essie Haute as Hello is more coral. Essie Tart Deco is a few shades darker. Barielle Blossom is a little more coral and darker. MAC nail lacquer usually leaves me underwhelmed. I haven’t had issues with wear, such as chipping, but not much does chip on me, so it’s rarely a problem. I tend to have difficult with the formula, though, which is terribly inconsistent. Sometimes it’s beautifully fluid and opaque, and other times, like here, it’s thick, halfway to goopy, and streaky. Funny enough, neither color description seemed to fit the actual shades.

"['Skin Care Expert Renée Rouleau Reviews the Clarisonic! Reviews Jan 18, 2010 January 18, 2010 Temptalia is extraordinarily pleased to be able to bring you an exclusive review of the Clarisonic by renowned skincare esthetician and expert Renée Rouleau ! It’s a very informative and thorough review and read with invaluable information for improving your skincare routine and ensuring it is doing the most for your skin. You can visit her blog for more skincare advice and tips! Is Clarisonic harmful or helpful? Renée Rouleau gives a review…. Let me start by saying that I normally don’t do reviews of other skin care products. I use my blog as a place to talk and share my thoughts on what I know to be true about skin from being an esthetician for 22 years, but I leave product reviews for all of the great beauty bloggers out there. My reason for doing a review on Clarisonic is because I have observed changes in my client’s skin that use the brush, and some of the changes have not been beneficial to the health of their skin. Since my goal is to offer helpful skin care tips to allow you to become a smarter skin care consumer, I feel that this is important information to share. Read all about proper exfoliation and how to use your Clarisonic to avoid damaging your skin! What is Clarisonic? Clarisonic is a skin care tool sold at specialty beauty stores that uses a soft, gentle brush that oscillates back and forth over the skin and claims to remove six times more makeup than cleansing by hand. Despite being promoted as a tool that “removes six times more makeup than cleansing by hand”, to me, Clarisonic is really an exfoliating tool to physically lift off dry skin cells and, in the process, remove dirt and makeup. My problem with Clarisonic is not the brush itself, because the exfoliating benefits are very important. I do have a serious concern with how often they recommend using it. They say it’s gentle enough to use twice daily, but it is my belief that this is way too much when combining with other exfoliating products you are probably already using. While it may feel gentle enough to use twice a day, you have to understand exfoliation. Clarisonic, facial scrubs, acids, enzymes, wash cloths or whatever form you gets yours in can cause skin damage and may lead to aging if used too frequently. Over-exfoliation can cause dryness. Exfoliating too aggressively and too often can cause dryness and disrupt the skin’s lipid barrier. This allows moisture to seep out of the cells more easily, causing them to get dehydrated. Many of my clients who I see monthly for facial treatments started complaining of dryness and irritation when their skin had been so perfectly hydrated and balanced with their Renée Rouleau products. Come to find out, the dryness started to occur once they introduced the Clarisonic brush! I had already had my clients set up on a very thorough exfoliation routine, but once they added in the Clarisonic, their skin was getting too much exfoliation and that’s why the dryness and irritation occurred. Over-exfoliation can cause chronic inflammation. Exfoliating too aggressively and too often can create inflammation (even if not visible) setting off a response to create free radicals. A major cause of aging is chronic and prolonged inflammation, associated with tissue destruction, active inflammation and attempts at healing which is why it’s essential to eat foods high in antioxidants and use skin care products with stable antioxidants, like Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C). Skin trauma is good….occasionally. You don’t want to exfoliate to the point of destroying healthy cells. When you give the skin trauma, the skin goes into repair mode and stimulates cellular regeneration. This can be very beneficial to the skin, but if you create trauma too often by over-exfoliating, then it’s continually setting up a cascade of free radical damage that triggers premature aging. Over-exfoliation might stimulate melanin activity resulting in increased skin discoloration. You must use caution with physical exfoliants like Clarisonic, washcloths and facial scrubs. For skin that is extremely reactive to stimulation (skin of color and for those prone to severe discoloration) you need to treat your skin gently to avoid post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation resulting in increased skin discoloration. Read my post on why you shouldn’t rub your face vigorously with a washcloth. Clean skin is good…to a certain point. Since Clarisonic markets it as a cleansing tool to remove dirt and makeup, I’d like to make this point. You do want your skin hygienically clean, but not clean like you want your kitchen floor. There is a certain amount of good bacteria that the skin needs to keep it healthy and functioning well so you don’t want to strip it by over-using your Clarisonic brush. This is also why I suggest using non-drying, sulfate-free cleansers. What’s the right amount of exfoliation? I suggest using an alcohol-free Glycolic acid serum applied to the skin nightly for seven nights in a row. After a week, go off of it to give your skin a break (remember, you don’t want to over-exfoliate). Now, you want to use a hydrating serum for the next seven nights to bathe those new cells in hydrating antioxidants. Then repeat, so you’re only using an exfoliating acid every other week. I also recommend using a facial scrub OR your Clarisonic brush 2-3 times a week—and that’s it. The idea here is that using a Glycolic Acid serum will dissolve the dry skin cells while a physical exfoliant like a scrub or Clarisonic will lift off the dry skin cells. They both work differently but both are beneficial. A professional chemical peel should be performed every other month and an at-home professional-strength peel ( Renée Rouleau Triple Berry Smoothing Peel ) should be used once every three weeks. Bottom Line Many people really like using the Clarisonic brush and I’m certainly not telling you not to use it. I simply want to inform you that using it twice daily, combined with other exfoliating products, may be harming your skin’s overall health. And just for the record, I actually did purchase a Clarisonic brush and have used it on my skin. For me, it was too stimulating and caused some breakout activity so I’ll stick with mild facial scrubs for my physical exfoliation. But if you love it and it works for you, then by all means, use it!

It really gave my lips a juicy look–that’s the best description I could think of–and it felt incredibly weightless. I found it wore well and got about four to five hours of wear without much fuss, too. I think what surprised me about this particular formula and lipstick was just how rich in color and high the pigmentation was–I just wasn’t expecting it to be so true-to-word. What about you? Would you wear this red? The Scarlet Season is a series of posts showcasing and featuring my favorite shades of red lips–from glosses to lipsticks that runs through December 2009.

Acid Washed is more shimmer than it is color; the base seems nearly clear to me, while it has pale white and gold-tinged white shimmer, plus a slight pink iridescence. It has a glaze finish. It is similar to Tanarama , just less beige. Pretty, Please is a frosted pale pink with white shimmer that goes on semi-sheer. It has a lustre finish, and it is part of the permanent range. Riveting Rose is a rich red-berry with purple and plum frost. It has a frost finish. It’s similar to Hang Up, but it is more berry (less red). my thoughts on the formula: MAC Lipsticks are vanilla-scented but taste-free. I typically get four hours of wear, but some of the lighter lustre and glaze finishes tend to disappear by hour three. Amplified cremes and amplified finishes, however, tend to go beyond four.

Rodeo Pink features very pink-themed shades, whereas Bel-Air Beige is more about corals and beiges. Additionally, there is also a Shimmering Loose Powder that can be used with either look. I ended up trying out the Sunset Coral Blush, Hollywood Gold Lip Sheen, and Starlet Peach Lip Gloss from the Bel-Air Beige look , as well a the Shimmering Loose Powder . The packaging for the Very Hollywood Collection is a pleasant reprieve from Estee Lauder’s typical packaging–it’s a nice update and take on something still more sophisticated and in line with the brand but yet doesn’t feel old. Sunset Coral Blush ($26.00) is really more of a pink-coral. It has just a hint of coral, but it turned out pinker than I imagined it would be. It’s a nice shade, though I’d say more summer-appropriate than necessarily for spring (but that’s just if you go by seasons, which I don’t myself!). It has a very matte finish and texture with good pigmentation, so you can definitely get a good pop of color on your cheeks with this one. Shimmering Loose Powder ($32.00) is a pinky-peach with golden sheen. It’s almost like a pink beige flesh-toned powder. It’s very finely milled and can be used lightly or more heavily, depending on what kind of look you’re going for. Used with a very fluffy brush and a light hand, it could definitely be used as an all-over powder or just to highlight parts of the face. Hollywood Gold Lip Sheen ($22.00) is a sheer, peachy-coral with a golden sheen. It took several layers to build up the color on the swatch alone, so this is most definitely a product that’s aptly named–lip sheen. If you like ultra pigmented lipsticks, I’d look elsewhere. If you like just a sheer wash of color on your lips, lip sheens may be up your alley. Estee Lauder released four other shades (Bungalow Pink, Honey Blonde, Starlet Peach, and Starlet Rose), though two are sold out online. Starlet Peach Lip Gloss ($20.00) is a sheer, peachy-orange gloss with champagne shimmer. It looks quite orange in the tube, but it’s really sheer, so it ends up looking much more peach in practice. It’s a non-sticky gloss that goes on sheerly and lasts a few hours on me. It has a strawberry-ish kind of scent, which took a little getting used to, but wasn’t bad overall.

"['Make Up For Ever HD Invisible Cover Foundation Review Reviews Jul 11, 2009 July 11, 2009 Make Up For Ever HD Invisible Cover Foundation ($40.00 for 1.01 oz.) is easily one of the more famous products produced by the brand. It is designed to create a “soft focus” effect when used while providing medium-to-full coverage for a flawless look. It is touted as an oil-free liquid foundation that works to make you look your best in even the harshest lighting. Funny enough, I’ve had this foundation for a few months now, and I didn’t like enough to actually use it more than a handful of times after I initially purchased it as a local Sephora. To me, it didn’t do anything that my MAC Studio Fix Fluid wasn’t already doing. (Studio Fix Fluid is a good deal cheaper — $26.00 for 1.0 oz.!) In the spirit of 30 Days of Make Up For Ever, though, I figured I should give it another shot! For reference, the shade I was matched with and own is #140, which is described as “soft beige, for medium skin with dark yellow undertones.” In MAC, I am typically NC30. There are twenty-five shades available, so there is a good range of skin tones covered. Read on for the review ! I do want to note that my skin has much improved in the past two weeks compared to the past few months. So some of the skin-looks-better is because it really does look better as far as skin itself goes; it’s not all foundation. Just want to be upfront about that! ? (Thanks Kate Somerville !) Despite the hype, I’m still not overly impressed by the foundation. I guess that is more to say that it didn’t live up to the hype, but it is a good, solid foundation and I’d recommend to anyone looking for a semi-matte, medium-coverage, liquid foundation. (Particularly if you dislike or can’t tolerate MAC foundations.) The finish on this is nearly matte, but it seems just a touch dewy (that’s probably the “soft focus” coming into play). It gives medium coverage without much product, and you can layer it as necessary to get fulle coverage if you need it. You can always sheer it out by spritzing your brush or sponge with water, too. I think the most impressive part of Make Up For Ever’s HD Foundation is that is photographs extremely well. It does make skin look better than it actually is. The photo above is me wearing this foundation, and I was pretty surprised at how good my skin appears in it. HD does a good job of lasting all day, and I feel like I don’t get that oily-at-the-end-of-the-day feeling so much when I use this compared to some other foundations I’ve used. While it is a medium to full coverage foundation, it feels lightweight. It actually feels fairly weightless to me, but I’m a lot more used to foundation, too, so I’m going to stick with lightweight as the descriptor. The packaging is great, since they provide you with a foundation pump. I find that I dispense one and half to two pumps on the back of my hand, and then I use MAC’s 109 brush (spritzed first with water) to apply it to my face. This seems to give me the best results, and it is the technique I used in the photo above as well. The reason I like pump dispensers is you can figure out exactly how much you need through trial and error, and then you just use that much consistently. Without a pump, it just involves a bit more eyeballing! Overall , HD is a good foundation, and I do prefer it over their Mat+ Velvet foundation. I think Mat+ Velvet may be a bit too matte in finish for me at times, so HD offers a happy medium where I can get a nearly-matte look with just a touch of soft dewiness — without the dewiness making me look oily or shiny. A bottle should last you a good six months, depending on how much you use and how often you use it, but there’s plenty in there, so while the price is a steep investment, it’s definitely worth it in the long-run if you like the results.']",943af8d04255c700eb8191292c0ec4dd441b6c12,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/make-up-for-ever-hd-invisible-cover-foundation-review/,['2009-07-11 00:00:00']

"['Stila Jewel Eyeshadow Palette for Spring 2010 Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jan 20, 2010 January 20, 2010 Beautiful, Glittering Eyes with Stila’s Jewel Eyeshadow Palette Stila Jewel Eyeshadow Palette ($32.00) is a mysteriously glittering, shimmering palette. When I saw the promotional images for the palette, I was definitely curious — who doesn’t love some glitter? (OK, I know a few of you don’t, but shh!) I find myself at a loss as to how exactly to describe the texture and feel of these eyeshadows. They feel almost wet, but not really creamy and certainly not powdery. They apply fairly sheerly when used, though they can be layered for a slightly more intense look. Since it has a bit of a creamy feel (but it’s sooo not a cream shadow!), I patted the Golden Topaz shade all over my lid, just to see what kind of fall out we were looking for. I wasn’t even concerned about staying power, because it wasn’t over a base, so I expected it to crease. Well, it didn’t. It didn’t crease after just having patted it on my lid for over an hour. There was also very, very minimal fall out (like I saw three or four sparkles). Typically, I find myself having to strategically apply foundation over glittery bits and doing all sorts of tricks to make sure my undereye area isn’t more sparkly than my eyelid. Golden Topaz is a soft peachy-brown with champagne shimmer/glitter. Amethyst is a medium dark purple with red undertones and soft golden glitter. Black Diamond is black with silver glitter. Rose Quartz is a light-medium rosy pink with silver glitter. I was pleasantly surprised at Stila’s newest palette for the spring season. I just wasn’t expecting it to knock my socks off, and I admit I was totally expecting the glitter to fall everywhere. But you know what’s REALLY awesome about this? It looked like my lids were wet. The color really does look like shimmering water. Gorgeous!

"['5 Tips to Look Gorgeous This Summer Features Jun 20, 2009 June 20, 2009 5 Tips to Look Gorgeous This Summer Monday will kick off the summer season, and if you live in an area where summer means heat… you know your makeup routine tends to change. Between heat, humidity, enjoying the outdoors, and for many, vacation, here are some of my favorite tips on adjusting your makeup for summer! Tinted moisturizer is your friend! Whether you mix your own by mixing your existing foundation with your favorite moisturizer or you invest in a specific tinted moisturizer, it is a great alternative to regular foundations (especially if you tend to wear liquid foundation!). It’s lightweight, melts on the skin, and it still gives you just a little coverage while still looking extremely natural. Many tinted moisturizers also include SPF–which is a must when the sun is shining (and even when you don’t think it is). A-hoy waterproof mascara! Keep those lashes looking long and luscious without worrying about flaking, smudging, or budging while you’re enjoying the day by investing in a good waterproof mascara. One tip I have is to use your regular mascara first, and then do one coat of waterproof mascara. If you have any issues removing waterproof makeup, try an oil-based makeup remover like MAC’s Cleanse-off Oil or shu uemura’s Cleansing Oil–or even just plain ol’ olive oil. Three more tips… Say hi to lip tints! Pucker up and color those lips with lip tints, stains, and long-wearing lip color. I love having a little bit of added color to my lips, particularly to brighten them up and not look so corpse-ish, so lip tints come in handy for easy color that wears throughout the day. If I’m out for the day at the beach or hiking, the last thing I want to deal with reapplying a gloss (not to mention, who wants sand in their lipgloss?). Instead, I opt for staining products like Benefit’s Benetint to give me a boost in lip color without the hassle. Learn to love layers! Hot or humid, layering your makeup will yield you longer-lasting, better-wearing makeup. This means setting foundation with transparent, loose powder. Apply a cream blush or stain, then set with a powder blush to prolong wear and prevent migration. Use primers for the skin, lashes, and lips if desired (this step is most useful for the face). If you have an oily zone, keep a compact of blotting powder or a few blotting sheets with you for on-the-go quick fixes. Sunscreen from head to toe! It doesn’t matter if you’re pale or tan, you should be wearing sunscreen on your face, neck, and the rest of you, too. Remember to apply sunscreen about a half hour or so before exposure to the sun, and be sure to use one that covers both UVA and UVB. It is also important to use a high enough SPF to give you the kind of protection you need. Don’t forget sunglasses — squinting causes a lot of those fine lines! Happy summer! Hope your weekend is a blast!']",2673188a45d3446e5a3ae41c58bab502e686dd2c,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/5-tips-to-look-gorgeous-this-summer/,['2009-06-20 00:00:00']

"['Maybelline Eye Studio Give Me Gold Color Plush Silk Eyeshadows Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Jan 20, 2010 January 20, 2010 Drugstore Treats from Maybelline’s Eye Studio Collection Maybelline Eye Studio Give Me Gold Color Plush Silk Eyeshadows ($9.99) may be a mouthful to say, but it’s a surprising treat to be found at your local drugstore. Each of the Color Plush Silk Eyeshadows can be found in a palette with four shades in each, and there are twelve different varieties currently on the market. I’m often left wanting more from mass makeup, but Maybelline really knocked it out of the park with their Eye Studio collection. (I’ll be reviewing two shades of the Marbleized Eyeshadows and Lasting Drama Gel Eyeliners later this week!) I’m a tough one to impress when it comes to “drugstore makeup,” and I’m just really glad I had the opportunity to try these so I could share a new find with you. Give Me Gold includes four shades: a silky champagne-white, a yellow gold with shimmer, a copper-bronze with gold shimmer, and a chocolate brown with a little bit of gold shimmer. I particularly liked this palette because the shades really work well together; they complement and you can get some nice neutral-ish eyeshadow combinations out of it. I’m pleased to report that all four of the shades were well-pigmented, felt soft to the touch, and applied very smoothly. The only real downside to this palette was the packaging, which looks so-so, but it does feel a little cheap and flimsy. It may not last if you carry it around in your makeup bag on a daily basis, but if you just take it with you for travel from time to time (and leave it at home most of the time), I think it’ll be fine. I found the cover of this one snapped off, but I was able to snap it right back on. Other than the packaging not wow-ing me, I’m pleased. The product itself is the most important part, and it was standout. Definitely some of the best eyeshadows I’ve tried from a drugstore beauty brand.

"['Backstage with MAC Cosmetics at San Francisco Fashion Week! zArchived Aug 28, 2007 August 28, 2007 TEMPTALIA TAKES YOU BACKSTAGE WITH LOUISE AND VICTOR AT SAN FRANCISCO FASHION WEEK 2007! Louise Zizzo created this retro-glam look that puts an emphasis on a large, natural brow (which she totally fauxed on some models by using mascara or Blacktrack fluidline) paired with a plump red lip using Mahogany lip liner nearly all over the lips and then Russian Red lipstick on top. One side of the tent were all the MAC artists dealing with creating all the fabulous runway looks, while on the opposite side were hair stylists creating fabulous dos. Louise managed to catch herself in this shot, but you can see just how crowded backstage can be when everything is done in a small tent on the sidewalk of San Francisco! A veritable feast for any true MAC-aholic, as four or five long tables were covered with a decadent display of every MAC product you could possibly wish for. Here is a model sporting one of the looks for Pink Elf. Victor Cembellin was responsible for the creation of this look, and he accomplished this by doing a strong smokey eye using Graphito paint, Blacktrack fluidline, and Smolder eye kohl. He paired it with a great neutral lip using Illicit lipglass and cheeks with golden bronzer. This next set of photos are taking you through the process of a demonstration of a look by Louise Zizzo so that her team of 4-5 MAC makeup artists could recreate it on their own models for the show. The model shown here is Alexa, who had enviable natural brows. Louise mentioned that it was very, very important for the skin to look absolutely flawless, and as a result, she spent a good amount of time showing the ways to blend and perfect the model’s complexion so that when she was on the runway, it would come off nearly plastic in its perfection. If only you and I had that kind of time (and skills!) to accomplish such absolutely divine skin. Louise used a mixture of studio select concealer/coverup, as well as various shades of Studio Fix Fluid. Louise did a dramatic eye for this particular designer, and she takes a generous amount of Blacktrack fluidline to cover the entire lid and just above the crease, and then a gentle wing on the side. Using an angled brush, the 266, she accomplishes such detailing as seen here. I was totally reminded of the black smokey eye that I do using Blacktrack as a base, actually! Surprisingly, despite how bold this makeup appears here in this shot, on the runway it is hardly noticeable. Check out that palette Louise is creating on her own hand. You can see the various colors of foundations and skin products that she used to give the model’s skin such clarity. Louise makes sure that her shape is flawless and that both eyes are about as even as she can get with the naked eye. What, I didn’t mention it already? Oh, Louise created this look of pure Blacktrack-ladened lid with a splash of thick, double liner in three different shades of liquidlast liner (pink, green, and purple). The whole theme of the look was icy, ice princess, ice queen. She chose green for this particular model. It’s the magical 266 again, look how precise that line is! Sigh, so jealous. To add further drama, Louise put false lashes on both the top and the bottom lash lines. She also doled out a great tip – if you have trouble putting on false lashes, try cutting them into thirds and attaching each third by third. Here’s the finished eye look! Louise used Pink cream colour base on the cheeks and the lips, with Hush cream colour base to highlight. Pink cream colour base is a PRO only color, and you can see how it matches perfectly with the ice princess theme. Here is the completely finished look! And see how dramatic it is with the eyes closed? I’m still totally marvelling at the definition of those shapes. A quick snap shot of the look Victor did for the Vian Hunter line using Silver (metal) pigment on lid and Blacktrack fluidline to create the defined crease. Christine (makeup artist), two models, and Louise Z. posing for photographers. Still posing, as you can see, right next to the runway, behind the curtain. Kind of crazy, huh? Christine on her knees moisturizing one of the model’s legs, but really, check out those HEELS? My feet hurt just looking at them! Back in the dressing room, models chit chat and get ready while Victor does last minute touch ups. I swear, the dressing room was about as big as my own closet back at my parents’ house when I lived there. It was quite tiny! So that concludes my little photo-experiment-journal from Backstage at San Francisco Fashion Week 2007. I had SUCH a blast, and it was an amazing opportunity (so glad I was able to take it, too). I meant several other beauty bloggers, like Karen, and it was awesome to see professional makeup artists working in their element. For photos of the actual fashion show, check out this post .

I suppose my feelings are much like they were with Warm & Cozy from last week — I’d loved to have seen new and different neutrals. I also wish Showstopper would go into retirement for at least a few years! Of the four, my favorite was All Races, and I do think that one is the most worth picking up, because it’s not a shade I’ve seen by MAC at all (no immediate dupes came to mind). Eyeshadows ($14.50 U.S. / $16.50 CDN) All Races is a cool-toned lilac with a little gray edge. It has a matte finish, and it is a creamy, silky matte–no chalky texture here. I can’t remember seeing a shade like this by MAC. Maybe once or twice, but nothing I can remember at the moment! Banshee is a dirty pink with a little brown to it — it has a silver glitter that makes it a little chunky. It has a lustre finish, which definitely accounts for the glittery feel. I imagine you may have some issues with fall out with this shade. Cross-Cultural is a medium-dark chocolate brown with a matte finish. This is definitely a shade you could use to contour your eye space with; it has a nearly neutral finish, not being too cool nor warm. I’d say this is similar to maybe Era/Texture or a lighter version of Espresso. Showstopper is an ultra dark charcoal brown with a cool feel to it. This is a shade that’s not permanent yet it comes out often enough that it never feels like you need to stock up. This also has a matte finish to it. This is similar to Mystery/Brun.

I liked Personal Style the most, because I could see it being just a hint of definition on cheeks when eyes/lips are bold. Beauty Powder Blushes ($18.50 U.S. / $22.00 CDN) All’s Good is a dirty brown with just a smidgen of pink in it. It has very, very little shimmer — like barely there shimmer. I think this might be nicer on deeper skin tones, but I keep thinking it’s just going to look dirty on me. The texture is very smooth, and the color itself is pigmented. Personal Style is a neutral-to-cool fleshy beige with no real shimmer (the powder looks like it has some, but I couldn’t detect any in the swatch).

It’s been used in over 70 posts ! The one I hav been using is actually a smaller size included in one of Laura Mercier’s gift sets or travel kits (can’t remember), but it was 0.33 oz., whereas the full-size version (which is pictured in this post) is a full 1 oz. It took me six months of regular usage to go through it, so I imagine a full-size should last at least a year with daily use or a year and a half with 3-4 uses a week. I just picked up the full-size during Sephora’s F&F sale last month. I love it because it sets my makeup, keeps it in place throughout the day, and helps minimize oiliness. It never looks powdery, and it never looks obvious–it has a silky smooth texture as it is a finely milled loose powder that disappears on the skin. The soft, featherweight texture means it never feels heavy over foundation. I like using this with MAC’s 134 brush and dusting all over after finishing foundation and blush. The only area this product could improve on is working longer than six hours – I do find a hint of oiliness starts to peek through by hour seven or eight, and I’m normal-to-dry, so I imagine that very oily skin types may find they need a touch-up after three or so hours. P.S. — I recommend only peeling back (or cutting) half of the label, because you don’t need that many holes exposed to get a good amount of product.

Three of the four are lustres, but Empowered is a satin finish lipstick and has a spectacular amount of pigmentation, creaminess, and overall feel. It’s not my kind of color, though, which makes me wish it was! Equality is definitely not going to be an easy shade for us to pull off; probably gotta layer it with another lipstick and/or gloss. Myself is really weird, because it is myself on me. Which isn’t bad, but hey, I wear lipstick so I can’t *change* the lip color. Lipstick ($14.00 U.S. / $16.50 CDN) Equality is a semi-opaque fleshy-beige. It reminded me a bit of maybe Fleshpot lipstick (PRO) or concealer. This is really “concealer lips” on me, because it is so, so pale. This is not a shade that I’d consider suitable–at least alone–on my medium skin tone. It’s just going to wash me out. It is, however, an interesting way to neutralize the natural pigmentation in one’s lips. It has a lustre finish,which accounts for its slightly uneven application and glossy sheen. Myself is MLB… not quite better. No, but seriously, I put this on my lips, and I was like, “Where’d it go?” I slathered this sucker on, but it just looked like my lips… but again, not really *better*. I think this might be particularly lovely on those with more naturally reddened lips, because it might cool ’em down to a lighter pink. This was the sheerest lipstick of the four. It’s kind of a soft, cool-toned dirty pink. It is also a lustre finish lipstick. Empowered is a creamy, ultra pigmented brown with kind of a lightened peach feel — it’s just not dark brown or even chocolate brown, but it’s definitely brown. On me? Don’t love it. I’m not a brown lipstick kind of gal, but I do think deeper skin tones will appreciate this one. It has a full coverage look, a lovely satin finish, and feels lovely on. Best formula/texture out of the four — just wish I liked the color on me! 5N is a semi-sheer, plummy brown. It’s beautiful on lips, but it can go darker or lighter depending on your lips’ pigmentation — on me, it’s not ultra dark, but it darkens my lips enough that I’m satisfied with the color. It has a glossy finish, as it is also a lustre finish lipstick. This is a repromote from the N Collection from 2008 (correct me if I’m wrong on the year…). See photos, swatches, and lip swatches!

First, I definitely recommend this as a great multi-purpose kind of brush. It can be used to apply eyeshadow, blend shades together, deposit color into the crease, or highlight the brow. If you’ve ever found the 239 to be too large, you’d probably adore the size of the 213! Soft when used against the skin, so it doesn’t feel scratchy or rough when swished across the lid. The denseness of the bristles allows for good application of color shadows without the brush eating up product. I do like this for highlighting the brow bone, because it gives a soft-focused kind of application with more natural colors like highlighters. I also like it for highlighting the cupid’s bow (above your lips)! How do you like to use this brush?

"['NARS Melusine Eyeshadow Duo Review, Photos, Swatches (Holiday 2010) Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Nov 19, 2010 November 19, 2010 NARS Melusine Eyeshadow Duo NARS Holiday 2010: Melusine Eyeshadow Duo NARS Melusine Eyeshadow Duo ($32.00 for 0.14 oz.) is one of two new and permanent products from NARS’ Holiday Collection (the other is Sex Appeal ). NARS describes these shades as “pale silver lilac” and “bright deep purple.” From NARS: In folklore tales, a melusine was described as a feminine, free spirited woman. Similarly, this duo eyeshadow is an ultra-modern union of two colors working in harmony. Sweep the bright deep purple across the lid and highlight under brow with the pale silver lilac. First things first–this is by no means a dupe for NARS Daphne . The swatch tells the whole story! Daphne is a brightened violet with blue undertones, while Melusine (the purple side, of course!) is an eggplant purple with red undertones. Bottom line: they are quite distinct. The light shade of the duo is a silvery gray, and if I look close enough, I can make out the finest misting of lilac–so light that it’s almost pink. On cooler skin tones, I imagine the lilac will be more pronounced, but the effect is still quite subtle. The finish is a frosted shimmer, smooth overall, but does have shimmer kick up. The darker shade is a rich eggplant purple with red undertones and has a matte finish. It swatches better than Daphne did, but they’re both lovely in use–very rich, smooth, and true-to-color. I threw this duo on before running some errands, and I had three sweet ladies compliment me on my eyeshadow. There is a lot of contrast in the duo, with the silvered shade being so much lighter than the deeper purple, so it works well on its own. When I wore it, I wore the silvery shade all over the lid with the purple hue in the crease (to highlight, I used Burberry Trench Eyeshadow, which is just my-skintone-but-better!).

"[""NARS Daphne Eyeshadow Review, Photos, Swatches (Fall 2010) Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jul 23, 2010 July 23, 2010 NARS Daphne Eyeshadow Don’t Judge an Eyeshadow by a Swatch?! NARS Daphne Eyeshadow ($23.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a rich shade of night violet purple. It’s dark and deep and bright. But I have to warn you: don’t judge by a mere swatching on your arm. I’ve often found that matte eyeshadows don’t swatch well on the arm but perform phenomenally when used on the eyes. A truly outstanding matte shade will do both well, but I’ve simply learned that you cannot judge a poor swatched matte without trying it, too. When swatched with a sponge-tip applicator, I get a patchy mess of violet — it’s more of a red-based purple than blue-based, but it seems to flicker between the two depending on the lighting situation. ( Sidenote, photographing this eyeshadow was a pain in the behind–it constantly wanted to photograph BLUE! ) My arm wasn’t exactly the most moisturized environment to be sure, but wow ! Daphne made it look like a desert. Even when I tried to use my finger to smooth out the color, it didn’t work out well (as reflected in the swatch). Now, I say all this to show you that I did not get good results when I simply swatched for color. In fact, I had a sneaking suspicious this was going to be an issue. Nevertheless, I trudged on, and I tested it out by wearing it in a look. AND WE HAD LIFT OFF! Daphne looked as vibrant as pictured in the pan, but it applied smoothly, evenly, and it didn’t need much product at all–so it went on quite pigmented. It’s similar to Make Up For Ever’s #92 Eyeshadow , but #92 is brighter and a little lighter–it’s not quite the darkened violet that Daphne is. #92 is also more pigmented and thicker/smoother, though they perform similarly on the eye–with Daphne having less fall out. You can see a couple of looks I did using #92 , and you’ll notice it’s definitely not quite as dark. Initially, they seem very comparable, but in use, they’re really not. Daphne is a several shades darker and not the bold, vibrant shade of violet that #92 is. They’re both nice shades to own that don’t dupe each other. I do, of course, wish Daphne was a little smoother, so it would swatch well even on skin.

These are some of my favorite eyeliners, and I have NO idea why MAC doesn’t make them permanent. They glide on so smoothly, and they don’t fade away. They stay on my lower lash line just fine throughout the day. They are not waterline safe, as they all have micro-glitter in them, though. I can’t get over how smooth they feel when used on the lash line or lid; and the intensity of the color is so rich. I love that the majority of the colors seem to have a lot of depth, too. The five limited edition shades are: Black Swan (black with pearl), Lord It Up (bronze with pearl), Petrol Blue (deep navy with pearl), Undercurrent (teal with pearl), and Blackline (black with gold pearl). Three of these shades are repromotes, though, from Art Supplies . The new shades are Black Swan and Lord It Up . Black Swan is a deep black with charcoal gray shimmer. Very sultry of a shade! It is darker than Urban Decay’s Oil Slick, but they are similar. Lord It Up is a medium-dark brown with subtle warmth–not quite chocolate, but maybe a molten chocolate. It’s a little warmer than Urban Decay’s Bourbon. Petrol Blue is a rich, deep ocean blue with soft sky blue and medium blue shimmer-sheen. This shade is similar to Urban Decay’s Deviant. Undercurrent is a medium-dark teal base with teal-green shimmer and gold sheen. This shade is similar to Urban Decay’s Covet but that shade lacks the green-gold sheen. Blackline is a blackened base with antique green-gold sheen and shimmer. It’s similar to Shiseido’s Black Sand .

"['Chanel Rouge Allure Extrait de Gloss (Part 2) Affiliate Links Reviews Nov 20, 2010 November 20, 2010 More Chanel, More Gloss Chanel Rouge Allure Extrait de Gloss ($32.00 for 0.28 fl. oz.) is the brand’s latest gloss with nine shades (all are permanent except Confidence). I reviewed Fatale, Impertinence, Insolence, and Insouciance earlier. It has a new wedge-shaped applicator–almost like someone took a nibble out of a doe-foot gloss on both sides. I found the applicator rather springy, and though application was easy for me, I do prefer the Rouge Allure Laque applicator, which has one side that’s rather curved, almost designed to fit your lip into that curve. The opening of the gloss itself seems to make it so not much product gets on each swipe, so you may find yourself going back for a second helping to get a more opaque look. It’s not a sticky or tacky gloss, but I wouldn’t describe it as non-sticky; there’s a little tack to it. The texture of the gloss is on the thicker side, very jelly-like, which is fitting, since it is a gel-based formula. It is smooth, and it applies evenly without settling into lip lines. They do have a lovely glossy finish, though, and they feel like a gloss–they are not a liquid lipstick like the Rouge Allure Laques. There’s an incredibly faint floral scent, but I can barely detect it long enough to accurately describe it, so it’s certainly nothing heavy. I found myself getting about three to four hours of wear with these, even the lighter shades, and it made it so-so through a full venti cup of coffee. I wouldn’t call it a long-wearing gloss, though. It wears well, but it doesn’t go on for hours. The Extrait de Glosses last a little longer than the average gloss (three to four hours for me) but not much longer. Genie is a semi-sheer peach with an underlying pinky tone. Very slight and subtle white micro-shimmer sprinkled through. Oh, and don’t let the initial orangeness of the color scare you, because it translates into something sheerer. Confidence is a semi-opaque, pretty-in-pink rose with lots of white and pink micro-shimmer–it has a rather frosty finish in comparison to the other shades. MAC Wonderstruck Lustreglass is the closest dupe, though it’s sheerer and the shimmer is larger. Imaginaire is a semi-sheer, pale milky pink with soft white-pink micro-shimmer. It’s a more pigmented, more sophisticated version of MAC’s Baby Sparks. Emoi is a semi-sheer, pink-red with soft pink and gold micro-shimmer. It’s almost red, but the sheerest makes it look pinker when worn. It does read rather neutral, though. I’d compare this to MAC’s Venetian Lustreglass. Exces is a semi-opaque cherry red. It does have a tendency to settle into lip lines, though. This is a shade that doesn’t seem to have any micro-shimmer, it’s just a glossy cream kind of finish. Like Emoi, it is rather neutral, but if pressed, I would say it leans orange-red rather than blue. It’s a sheerer, glossier, non-sticky version of Russian Red–oh and not as blue-based. All in all, they’re a nice gloss. Not exactly groundbreaking, but for those looking for a little more color than the Glossimers and Aqualumieres have to offer, Extrait de Gloss fills that void. These also remind me of Guerlain’s Kiss Kiss Gloss Serum–which also debuted this fall. My favorite part about the gloss is actually the packaging, which is sleek, long, and hefty. Not heavy as in you’ll break your back, but it’s weighty; and there’s something about a little bit of heft that makes it feel like you’re holding onto something of quality.

"['Clarins Rosewood Rouge Prodige Lipstick Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Nov 27, 2010 November 27, 2010 Clarins Rosewood Rouge Prodige Lipstick Going Beyond Nude with Rosewood Clarins Rosewood Rouge Prodige Lipstick ($24.00 for 0.10 oz.) is a rosy nude with a glistening shine. This is my kind of nude–it doesn’t wash you out or make you look like a corpse. It’s soft and muted, the way a good nude should be, but it still brightens up the face. This is the kind of shade that works well for everyday or paired with a heavier eye/cheek look. I find it more neutral-cool, which makes it a very wearable shade. It does have that shiny, glossy finish the description boasts, and it doesn’t feel like the traditional long-wearing lipstick does. There is nothing drying about it when you apply it, because it applies like a thin gloss or a gloss/lipstick hybrid. The color pay off is excellent, though, and really delivers opaque color with a lightweight feel. It doesn’t transfer much when drinking from a glass, but for whatever reason, it just doesn’t extend past four hours. The Rouge Prodige is a comfortable lipstick to wear, because it doesn’t cling or dry lips out (but while it has a glossy feel when applied, I do not find it moisturizing). There is a faint sweetened berry scent that is detectable but not overpowering (and doesn’t read synthetic or syrupy sweet), and there was no noticeable taste. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ?

"['Look for Less: Gold Shimmered Red Lips Looks Nov 18, 2010 November 18, 2010 Rimmel Berry Queen Lipstick + NYX Blonde Pearl EYeshadow Look for Less: Gold Shimmered Red Lips Many of you really liked my MAC Marcel Wanders Lip Combo that featured MAC Gesina Lipstick and MAC Mary Lip Gloss. It’s a lovely combo, but it’s DEFINITELY! dupeable. Gold shimmer always looks really stunning layered over a red lipstick. I used… Rimmel Berry Queen (940) Moisture Renew Lipstick ($5.99) NYX Blonde Pearl Eyeshadow ($7.00) (But any yellow gold eyeshadow will do!) Wet ‘n’ Wild Clear Lipgloss ($1.99) For $15, I think we get pretty close. I specifically wanted to find the cheapest dupe I could, so I only went through my drugstore products to pull colors. Berry Queen is insanely close to MAC’s Gesina, but it’s a little more pigmented, so it doesn’t end up as pink as Gesina when applied. I mixed the gold eyeshadow with the gloss and then applied, so it would blend better (if you pat it on, it can be lovely, but it tends to stay where you patted it!). I’d also recommend trying maybe a dark pink and then patting a sheer layer of blue-based red lipstick on top to get that pinky-red if you don’t have one already in your stash! If you have naturally red lips, you might opt for a fuchsia lipstick rather than a pink-red. What do you think? Close enough? Better? Worse?

Using the 239, apply Mangrove eyeshadow on the inner third of the lid and pull upwards along the inner crease. Lightly blend Rajasthan (taupe) eyeshadow on the middle of the lid blended to the outer lid with the 239.

Bring everything together by applying #11L eyeliner on the lower lash line. Finish by sweeping lashes with Precious Cells mascara . For cheeks, apply Douceur blush on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116.

This is my kind of nude–it doesn’t wash you out or make you look like a corpse. It’s soft and muted, the way a good nude should be, but it still brightens up the face. This is the kind of shade that works well for everyday or paired with a heavier eye/cheek look. I find it more neutral-cool, which makes it a very wearable shade. It does have that shiny, glossy finish the description boasts, and it doesn’t feel like the traditional long-wearing lipstick does. There is nothing drying about it when you apply it, because it applies like a thin gloss or a gloss/lipstick hybrid. The color pay off is excellent, though, and really delivers opaque color with a lightweight feel. It doesn’t transfer much when drinking from a glass, but for whatever reason, it just doesn’t extend past four hours. The Rouge Prodige is a comfortable lipstick to wear, because it doesn’t cling or dry lips out (but while it has a glossy feel when applied, I do not find it moisturizing). There is a faint sweetened berry scent that is detectable but not overpowering (and doesn’t read synthetic or syrupy sweet), and there was no noticeable taste.

It’s nearly opaque, and it has a more emollient finish, so it glides onto lips, but it may bleed on those who find darker lip colors to feather on them.

In the past, I have experienced less than average wear (two to three hours) with Rimmel’s Moisture Renew lipsticks, but this shade lasts around four on my lips.

It’s nicely pigmented, and it has a very smooth, silky finish. Blonde Pearl is part of a new eyeeshadow formula packed with more shimmer for “a soft, shimmery, iridescent look.” The last NYX eyeshadows I tried were among their Trios, and the Pearl formula definitely has a smoother, more finely milled feel to it. It doesn’t have any powdery-ness. I did find that when used with a brush, it will diffuse a little, but it stays true-to-color for the most part. It’s a good eyeshadow, and for the price–as compared to high end alternatives–it’s a bargain. Compared to other NYX eyeshadows, I’m not sure they’re significantly better than their singles ($5.50). The $7 price tag for a single eyeshadow seems a little steep for a brand known for their affordability.

The palette includes these shades: Opal (cool pale grey), Lavender (light lavender), Cool Ivory (grey-ish tan), Cobra (medium cool grey), Plum Orchid (deep black plum), and Eclipse (blackest black). Opal is a soft, silvered gray with beige and a frosted finish. It was nicely pigmented. Lavender is a pink-tinged lavender with a frosted metallic finish. This is a metallic eyeshadow. The pigmentation was spot-on. Cool Ivory is a cool-toned grayish beige with a matte finish. It had a very smooth, silky texture and went on nicely. Cobra is a slightly sheer bluish gray with sparkle. This is a shimmer wash eyeshadow, which is supposed to be sheer. Plum Orchid is a blackened, deep purple with a matte finish. Unlike many of Bobbi Brown’s mattes, I felt this one was chalky and not nearly as pigmented as I would expect. It reminded me of my issues with NARS Daphne , but I did not feel like this worked beautifully when applied–it was still a bit chalky. Eclipse is a dark black with a matte finish. It, too, was not nearly as buttery as Bobbi Brown’s mattes usually are. Eclipse was not nearly as frustrating as Plum Orchid, though, as it was more pigmented and applied better. The palette contains 0.24 oz. worth of eyeshadow, which is an equivalent value of $40.00 of eyeshadow, $10.00 of shimmer wash eyeshadow, and $8.00 of metallic eyeshadow–plus two miniature sized brushes. The value of the palette is no less than $58.00, but I would say it’s a bit higher, with the brushes. When I tried using the palette in an eye look, I found the colors seemed rather stubborn–they really did not want to play together. I felt like the resulting look was rather muddy and trying to go back and deepen certain shades only made it look worse.

"[""Urban Decay Rollergirl Nail Kit Swatches, Photos, Review Sample Reviews Mar 30, 2011 March 30, 2011 Urban Decay Rollergirl Nail Kit Urban Decay Rollergirl Nail Kit Urban Decay Rollergirl Nail Kit ($28.00 for 6 x 0.17 fl. oz.) features six miniature-sized nail polishes. It includes these shades: Fame (champagne shimmer), Love Train (opalescent shimmer), Miss T (bright orchid fuchsia), Superfreak (gold shimmer base with gold micro-glitter), Woodstock (hot pink), and Xanadu (sheer purple base with purple glitter). Each polish is 0.17 fl. oz, so the total amount of polish in the kit is the equivalent of 1.02 fl. oz, or about two full-sized nail polishes. I used Zoya’s Anchor & Armor as my base/top coats unless otherwise specified. Fame is a soft champagne with subtle pink undertones and white shimmer. I used three coats and still had a hint of visible nail line. China Glaze Hybrid is a bit darker and more opaque but similar. Superfreak is a tarnished gold with micro-glitter and a metallic finish. It dries to a matte metallic finish (I didn’t use a top coat in the photos, to show you the natural finish). It is very similar to Dior Timeless Gold–maybe a smidgen lighter but they’re quite close. This shade was nicely pigmented so I only needed two coats. Xanadu is a fuchsia-tinted jelly base with violet and fuchsia glitter. I used three coats, and it still had a sheerness in the base color, but it was expected based on the description (it is not meant to be opaque). It’s like a red-toned version of Illamasqua Boo. Miss T is a vibrant fuchsia magenta with subtle fuchsia micro-shimmer strewn through the base. Essie’s Bermuda Shorts was the closest I could think of, but it is pinker (not as magenta). Woodstock is a neon hot pink, and it dries to a matte finish–almost like patent leather. I used two coats–the flash photo is taken without a top coat to show the finish. Zoya’s Gilda is similar in color but not in finish. China Glaze Rich & Famous also seems similar but perhaps a bit darker. Love Train is a sheer, muted white with subtle opal iridescence and micro-shimmer. Think Chanel Pearl Drop but cool-toned. my thoughts on the formula: The formula on these was really easy to work with–it applied smoothly, evenly, and nothing took too long to dry. Both Xanadu and Love Train are sheerer shades but the descriptions say exactly that–can’t fault them there–while Superfreak, Miss T, and Woodstock have excellent color pay off. I love the concept of miniature-sized nail polishes, because you get to try a variety of shades without committing to the price tag of full bottles. However, as someone with longer fingers and bigger hands, it can take some getting used to holding the small-sized caps, even though the brush applicator is full-sized (thankfully!).

It seems to have more neutral undertones, and on me, it looks like my natural lip color pulls a touch of pink out of it. It has a creamier, slicker feel than other NARS lipsticks have, and it is very comfortable to wear. NARS Lipstick typically wears four to six hours, with a shade like this lasting just under four. It has a creamier texture that’s moisturizing, and this particular shade is more opaque (some shades can be quite sheer). I didn’t notice any waxy scent, as NARS lipsticks are typically unscented but the scent of the waxy base sometimes come through.

"['MAC In the Groove Collection – Lipsticks Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Jul 07, 2010 July 07, 2010 MAC Lipsticks: Call My Bluff, Creme d’Nude, Go For It, I Like It Like That, All Styled Up, Jazzed MAC In the Groove Collection: Cremesheen Lipsticks In the Groove also includes five new and limited lipsticks (plus one repromote– Creme d’Nude ). All six of the lipsticks have a cremesheen finish, so they’re on the more pigmented side with creamier-looking color (less shimmer/frost), but they have less moisture in them (though I don’t find them drying). Creme d’Nude is a creamy, nearly opaque pink-toned fleshy nude. It’s part of the permanent launch, and I know that many Temptalia readers love it as a go-to nude. Call My Bluff is a lightly warmed up mushroom-y brown. It reminds me of Shitaki , except warmer. Like a cooler Touch , maybe. It’s semi-sheer on lips and has a soft silver shimmer. Go For It is a semi-sheer red-toned purple with violet shimmer. It’s a lighter, less intense version of Violetta –not nearly as shimmery, opaque, or vibrant. More distinctly purple than Up the Amp , but it has that same subtle muted color. I Like It Like That is a cool-toned, blue-based opaque pink. It’s a little darker and cooler than All Styled Up , but they’re pretty close. This shade is very close to Viva Glam Gaga , but a little brighter; it’s darker than Snob . All Styled Up is a blue-based bubblegum pink with a slight glossy sheen and semi-opaque color. It actually doesn’t feel like a true cremesheen finish to me – almost like a little lustre-ness snuck in (though more a cremesheen than a lustre finish!). It does look a little streaky when applied, so make sure to smoosh lips to even it out. This shade is pinker and darker than Viva Glam Gaga , pinker than Snob . They’re all in the same family, though. Jazzed is a nearly opaque, glossy coral-peach. It’s like a cross between Ravishing and Vegas Volt–not as peach/orange as Ravishing, but not as bright as Vegas Volt. It’s not too warm, so I think cooler skin tones can wear this well. This is not like Ever Hip–this is peach, orange, but not pink, which Ever Hip most definitely is. This is not like either lipstick from Pret-a-Papier, particularly since the finish is completely different, Jazzed is incredibly pigmented, and much brighter. I really don’t why I Like It Like That and All Styled Up are so similar and in the same launch–they’re completely redundant. Yes, there is a difference between the two, but it’s incredibly small, and given they’re in the same launch? Boring! (Not to mention, this collection is obese–why six lipsticks at all?)

"['Urban Decay Summer of Love Nail Kit Sample Reviews Mar 29, 2010 March 29, 2010 Summer of Nails with Urban Decay Urban Decay Summer of Love Nail Kit ($28.00) includes seven miniature-sized bottles of nail polish in summery shades. Each bottle contains 5ml/0.17 fl. oz. of product in it. Shine On is a brightened bronze with gilded bronze shimmer. You can see a few brush strokes in this one, but they’re not too bad. I found the formula on this one to be a little goop-y but watery. You can’t rush this one — you have to let it dry quite a bit between coats. I found three were necessary for overall smoothness and color. Woodstock is a bright neon pink. Like most neons, it’ll dry on the matte side, but a shiny top coat like Seche Vite will give it a glossy look. This went opaque in two coats, and it was a fuss-free formula. Love Light is a sheer champagne shimmer. Even with three coats, you’ll still see the nail beneath it, but there’s plenty of shimmer here. The formula is sheer but easy to work with. Hashbury is a magenta-fuchsia purple. It has a lot of red in it, and in the light, it looks much lighter than it does in the dark (where it looks more like an eggplant-y purple). Compared to the other two shimmery/metallic shades like Shine On and Aquarius, this one was easy to use and was just a bit on the runny side but not difficult to work with. Magic Bus is a darkened neon orange. It’s like construction cone orange to me. Like Woodstock, it has a very smooth, easy to use formula that applies opaque in two coats. Aquarius is a metallic-y aqua blue with teal sheen/shimmer. This one is both a pain to photograph and apply. It applies sheerly, so you need at least three coats for an opaque look. The problem with the formula is that it’s both goop-y and watery — it’s difficult to get enough for a thin coat, because if you do a medium-thick or thick coat, you’ll end up with goop-y looking nails (see my index finger in the swatch) that looks terrible. This was the problem child of the bunch for sure. Like Shine On, make sure you give each coat time to dry. Psychedelic Sister is a neon coral-red. Again, like the other two neons (Woodstock and Magic Bus) in this kit, Psychedelic Sister applies smoothly and evenly without any work. Three of the seven shades have an excellent formula–Woodstock, Magic Bus, and Psychedelic Sister–while three aren’t so hot–Shine On, Hashbury, and Aquarius. Love Light was neither excellent nor problematic; it just was, you know? Shine On and Hashbury weren’t too bad, but the formulas had a bit of a goop-y yet watery feel to them. Aquarius had this issue, but it also showed brush strokes the most and required nearly four coats to look right. With my larger hands, I found the tiny bottles harder to work with (I felt like I had meathooks!), but I was able to get used to that pretty quickly so it wasn’t a huge issue. I like that it comes in a cute little bag that you can reuse later on for whatever makeup essentials you might want to put in it. It’ll fit your 24/7 Eyeliners, a few eyeshadows, glosses, and a blush. It’s not huge, but it has enough space for an overnight adventure. If it was just the neons, these would be an A! Unfortunately, the metallic shades are harder to work with, and between Shine On and Aquarius, they have more of a low-B/mid-C formula, respectively, to me. The kit, in total, is thus somewhere in between–just to clarify how everything came together. I didn’t feel that comfortable rating it as a whole, just because some were great, some weren’t so great! If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ?

"[""Benefit Brows A-Go-Go Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 17, 2011 March 17, 2011 Benefit Brows A-Go-Go For the Brow Enthusiast Benefit Brows A-Go-Go ($38.00) is an all-i-one brow kit, which includes both Light and Dark Brow Zings Powders (0.04 oz. each), Brow Zings Wax (0.03 oz.), Smokin’ Liner (0.01 oz.), Eye Bright (0.03 oz.), Brow Highlighter Powder (0.04 oz.), mini tweezers, and dual-ended brush. Benefit and brows take me back almost ten years (which makes me a little nauseous to think about, because sometimes I think I’m still 18 and when I’m clearly not). One of my first beauty experiences was begging my makeup-enthused best friend to tweeze my brows, and she always carried Benefit’s Brow Zings and their mini tweezers. I can’t tell you how I longed for a pair of my own mini tweezers–they just seemed so cool at the time. (With my hands, I can appreciate full-size tweezers for regular maintenance but minis are nice in a pinch.) The lighter shade is a medium-dark taupe brown, while the darker brow shade is a dark brown with subtle red undertones. The wax is a cross between the two–not too dark, not too light. I found the eyeliner to be fairly black but a bit stubby so it may be difficult to hold for some. I actually liked the shimmering icy pink of the highlight powder; not quite as cool-toned as Eye Bright, which is a creamy, pale white-pink. The dark shade works well for me, having nearly black natural brows. I like mixing the two, though, for a softer look as well. I would be careful using the highlighting products on deeper skin tones, because I think it may turn a little ashy, but they work well on light and medium skin tones.

Is it really only Tuesday? I feel like it should be Friday already! No, seriously… ? You will need the following… Eyes : MAC Soft Ochre Paint Pot (neutral beige base), MAC Indianwood Paint Pot (dark gold), MAC Nylon Eyeshadow (white-gold), MAC Patina Eyeshadow (antique gold), MAC Bottle Green Eyeshadow (matte blue-green), MAC Satin Taupe Eyeshadow (dark brown), MAC Ricepaper Eyeshadow (neutral highlighter), Make Up For Ever #20L Aqua Eye Liner (forest green), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Korres Tinted Moisturizer (#2) Cheeks : Benefit Sugarbomb (soft beige-pink) Lips : Guerlain Gardenia Rouge G Lipstick (pink nude), MAC Gold Dust Lipglass (sheer orange-gold) Brushes : 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : N/A For eyes, start by applying Soft Ochre paint pot as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Next, apply a secondary base of Indianwood paint pot on the lid only. Using the 239, apply Nylon eyeshadow on the inner third of the eyelid. Next, apply Patina eyeshadow on the middle third of the eyelid and lightly blend with the inner corner. Darken the outer third of the lid with Humid eyeshadow with the 239, gently brushing it into the lower crease. Apply Bottle Green eyeshadow into the outer crease with the 226. Lightly tap and brush Nylon eyeshadow directly above the crease to soften. To finish the eyeshadow look, sweep Ricepaper eyeshadow as a highlighter on the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying #20L eyeliner on the lower lash line and sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Sugarbomb blush to the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Gardenia lipstick first, and then layer Gold Dust lipglass for a complementing lip.

SPF30 Sunscreen Swipes ($10.00 for 8 wipes, $34.00 for 40 wipes) are ultra convenient wipes loaded with sunscreen to ensure that you are never without sun protection. I like these for their convenience, and if you carry around a big bag, they are great to stash in (the travel-size pouch, in particular) for any impromptu day-trips. The formula is lightweight, non-sticky, and absorbs so, so quickly. If you’re familiar with makeup removing wipes, these are very similar–just moistened with sunscreen.

SPF30 Sunscreen Swipes ($10.00 for 8 wipes, $34.00 for 40 wipes) are ultra convenient wipes loaded with sunscreen to ensure that you are never without sun protection. I like these for their convenience, and if you carry around a big bag, they are great to stash in (the travel-size pouch, in particular) for any impromptu day-trips. The formula is lightweight, non-sticky, and absorbs so, so quickly. If you’re familiar with makeup removing wipes, these are very similar–just moistened with sunscreen.

"['Bobbi Brown Powerful Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jan 10, 2011 January 10, 2011 Bobbi Brown Powerful Palette Bobbi Brown Powerful Palette Bobbi Brown Powerful Palette ($60.00 for 0.36 oz.) is an all-in-one palette with four eyeshadows, one blush, two lipglosses, and one lipstick. It includes: Navajo (creamy pinkish white), Rose Gold (golden pink), Burnished Rose (warm rose), Chocolate Caviar (deep chocolate brown), Plum (deep pinky plum), Pink Pudding (bright medium pink), Pink Bouquet (baby pink with silver flecks), and Powerful (bright deep pink). Navajo is a pale beige white with a matte finish. This is part of the permanent range. Rose Gold is a rose-tinged bronze gold with a frosted finish. Burnished Rose is a warmed-up, soft light-medium brown beige with a matte finish. Chocolate Caviar is a deep, dark cool-toned chocolate brown with a matte finish. Plum is a very pinked plum with lots of color pay off; it can be built up with ease or blended out for a softer look. It has a near matte finish. This is a powder blush. Pink Pudding is a sheer, medium pink with soft pink shimmer. This is a Shimmer Lip Gloss. Pink Bouquet is a semi-sheer rosy pink with petal pink shimmer. This is a Glitter Lip Gloss. Powerful is an opaque, rich, deep burgundy wine with a creamy, slightly shiny finish. This is a lipstick. The palette contains 0.09 oz. of Eyeshadow ($22.50 value), 0.04 oz. Shimmer Wash Eyeshadow ($7.50 value), 0.14 oz. of blush ($23.69 value), 0.028 oz. of Shimmer Lip Gloss ($4.00 value), 0.028 of Glitter Lip Gloss ($4.00 value), and 0.035 oz. of Lip Color ($6.42 value). It total value of the products inside the palette sums to $68.11, while the palette itself costs $60. It’s not a value-packed palette, but you’re getting your money’s worth. All four eyeshadows were pigmented, and Chocolate Caviar was the only one that didn’t have a really beautifully creamy, silky texture (just slightly drier), and the Plum blush was also nicely pigmented. The two lip glosses are both on the sheer side as Bobbi Brown glosses often are, while the lipstick was gorgeous and rich in color. I love the sleek packaging, and I think the typography on the outside cover of the palette is beautiful. Bobbi Brown’s campaign of Pretty. Powerful. is really a fantastic slogan, so I’m all for it being emblazoned across the palette itself. Though I’m not personally that fond of palettes that mix powders with gloss or creams, I do like that Bobbi Brown’s palettes always seem to have deeper wells and a very tightly clasping palette to minimize powder migration.

Product : 26/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 FINAL THOUGHTS: For those who like palettes that make their mornings easier, Bobbi Brown’s Powerful palette may just be one of those. With eyeshadows, blush, and lip color all in one go all housed in a slim palette, it is easy to travel with. However, I am not sure just how keen I am with the way the eyeshadows coordinate with the blush and lip colors–they are almost too orange compared to the plum and pink of the other shades.

"['Clarins Barocco Gold Shimmering Powder Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Jan 10, 2011 January 10, 2011 Clarins Barocco Gold Shimmering Powder Clarins Barocco Gold Shimmering Powder Clarins Barocco Gold Shimmering Powder ($35.00 for 1.2 oz.) looks so beautiful on the inside, it’s hard to believe that the insides did not make such a splash. Inside, there are gold “nuggets,” which are incredibly soft and delicate. Every time I opened this, there was a cloud of sparkly dust that hovered and spilled over the edges and on my desk. I had presumed these would be more like Guerlain’s Meteorites, which are shimmering spheres that impart a soft, subtle shimmer-sheen glow–these produce a bronzy, glittery bonanza. It does impart an orange-toned bronze brown with chunky bronze and gold glitter. Even when buffed, the chunky glitter is hard to disguise. This looked absolutely disastrous on face, and I did not find it worked well for decolletage either. The only place that seemed to work so-so was on legs, but it still had to be really blended and buffed so it looked natural and used considerably more product per use than I’d like. Given that it is supposed to be face and decolletage, going as far as using it on legs was more to see if it worked anywhere than something I’d use this as a go-to for. I can do shimmer, sheen, and even glitter; I’m not at all scared of glitter, and while I don’t need to wear it every day, I have no problem wearing even heavier glitter on face or cheeks or lips. But this powder goes beyond what I see even glitter fanatics wanting in a face/decolletage glitter. I would also not recommend using the provided pouf unless you want to be a bronze sculpture — one pat packs far too much product! The concept is nice but there needs to be serious improvement on execution in order to make it work. I would have loved to see this impart a much subtler, softer micro-glitter or shimmer.

Product : 10/30 Value : 9/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 FINAL THOUGHTS: This is a product that was beautiful in concept and dressed to impress in the beautiful filigreed canister, but the product itself just doesn’t work well in real life. It’s a mess to open but doesn’t work anywhere but legs–everywhere else is just too much. From Clarins, I would have expected something subtler and sophisticated.

"[""Cult Nails Warehouse Sale Mega Post of Photos, Swatches & (Quick) Review-a-thon Sample Reviews Dec 11, 2013 December 11, 2013 Cult Nails Alter Ego Nail Lacquer Cult Nails is having a “warehouse clearance” sale of colors that have been discontinued. This post features photos and swatches of shades that are available for $5, 6, or 7 a pop that I haven’t reviewed previously (just got these this week!). I’ve also included links to all previous shades that are discontinued that I’ve reviewed before. There are three– Blaze, Mazo, and Party Time –that I don’t have, but I did order them and if I get them before they’re sold for good, I’ll be happy to post. Baker is described as a “rich butterscotch/tan creme with gold shimmer.” It’s a light-medium, yellow peach with soft gold sparkle. It was semi-opaque after two coats, and application was very slightly streaky at times. See comparison swatches . Blackout is described as a “deepened slate grey creme.” It’s a deep, dark, soft black–a gray black, if you will–with a cream finish and a glossy shine. It was fully opaque after applying two coats. See comparison swatches . Swanbourne is described as a “deep, alluring brown creme laced with flashes of golden shimmer.” It’s a rich, chocolate brown with subtle warm, reddish undertones and copper-bronze flecks of shimmer. It was fully opaque in two coats and was a dream to apply and work with. See comparison swatches . Tulum is described as a “luxurious milk chocolate creme … with gold shimmer.” It’s a medium-dark, muted beige-brown with golden micro-sparkle. It was opaque after two coats of polish, and it applied fairly evenly and smoothly. See comparison swatches . Doppelganger is described as a “sheer top coat that transforms your existing polish by giving it a ‘dusty’ feel while adding a familiar multi-colored shimmer.” It adds a layer of bluish-white cloudiness plus multi-colored shimmer–almost looks like a nebula applied over black with a very thin coat. The consistency was on the thicker side, so it can apply too heavily for a layered look. It’s quite pretty on its own, too–reminded me of bridal nails with more oomph. Alter Ego is described as a “sheer top coat that will cast a gold and green tinge over your polish.” It transforms into a fine shimmer of oiled bronze when layered over another color. I applied one coat over Nevermore, Cult Nails’ black cream. Deception is described as a “sheer top coat that lays a pink/purple sheen over your existing polish.” Layered over another polish, it adds a fine violet shimmer. I applied one coat over Nevermore, Cult Nails’ black cream. Two Timer is described as a “sheer top coat that enhances your existing color by casting a beautiful emerald shimmer over it.” It transforms into a fine shimmer of emerald green when layered over another color. I applied one coat over Nevermore, Cult Nails’ black cream.

"[""Too Faced Spring 2014 La Creme Lipsticks Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Dec 11, 2013 December 11, 2013 Too Faced Spring 2014 La Creme Lipsticks Too Faced La Creme Lipstick ($22.00 for 0.11 oz.) sees the introduction of five new shades for spring from pale peach to rich red. They’re true to the La Creme formula–creamy, balm-like consistency with good color payoff, glossy finishes, and moderate wear times. I didn’t notice any taste, but they had a sweet, lemony scent. Jelly Bean was the best, while Taffy was disappointing. Bon Bon is described as a “pink papaya.” It’s a pop of brightened, medium pink-coral with a glossy, luminous sheen. It had mostly opaque color coverage–just a hint of translucency, and it wore well for four and a half hours and was nicely hydrating when worn. Charlotte Tilbury Coachella Coral (P) is less glossy, slightly warmer. MAC Hoop (DC, $15.00) is much pinker. Givenchy Rose Dressing (202) (P, $36.00) is slightly darker. MAC Elegant Accent (P, $22.00) is very similar. MAC Watch Me Simmer (LE, $15.00) is more matte. MAC Heart to Heart (LE, $15.00) is pinker, more matte. Guerlain Giulette (P, $49.50) has shimmer, slightly pinker. Chanel Genial (LE, $34.00) is a touch pinker. See comparison swatches . Jelly Bean is described as a “raspberry red.” It’s a deepened, brightened raspberry red with cool, blue undertones and a lightly glossy shine. It had rich, opaque color coverage, and it applied very smoothly and evenly. This shade lasted six hours and left a residual stain behind. It was moisturizing both during and after wear. Guerlain Provocative (863) (LE, $49.50) is redder. Urban Decay Catfight (P, $22.00) is very similar, slightly redder. Guerlain Girly (P, $49.50) is pinker. MAC Scan-delicious (LE, $19.00) is similar. Guerlain Champs-Elysees (P, $35.00) is pinker. See comparison swatches . Lollipop is described as a “violet with orchid shimmer.” It’s a cool-toned, fuchsia-shimmered magenta with cool undertones. It had semi-opaque color coverage–it was a lot sheerer than other La Cremes. When I wore this shade, it was lightly hydrating and wore well for four hours. MAC Midnight Mambo (LE, $22.00) is similar, less shimmered. Revlon Lollipop (P, $7.49) is glossier, less shimmery. Milani Violet Volt (P, $5.49) is more matte, more shimmery. MAC Show Orchid (P, $15.00) is very similar in color but is not as glossy. See comparison swatches . Pink Chocolate is described as a “berry brown.” It’s a warm, rosy plum with a glossy, luminous shine. It had mostly opaque color coverage, lasted four hours, and was nicely hydrating during that time. Laura Mercier Cozy (P, $24.00) is warmer, more matte. MAC Candy Apple (LE, $16.00) is redder. Chanel Ce Soir (P, $34.00) is slightly more muted, more matte. MAC Glamourdaze (LE, $15.00) is darker. MAC Brick-o-la (P, $15.00) is more matte. Buxom Hooligan (P, $21.00) is lighter. See comparison swatches . Taffy is described as a “pink marshmallow nude.” It’s a light, pinky-peach with a luminous shine. This shade was really, really creamy, but it applied unevenly and seemed to emphasize every imperfection on the lip. It was extremely unforgiving, even on freshly exfoliated lips. This shade wore well for three hours and was moisturizing during that time. Chanel Melba (75) (LE, $34.00) is lighter. Urban Decay Native (P, $22.00) is slightly pinker. Revlon Pink Lemonade (P, $7.49) is very similar.

In my experience, they had semi-opaque to opaque coverage, while the wear time was between four and six hours (about the same as similarly hued-lipsticks) but was comfortable to wear and definitely non-drying. What I liked most about the product was actually the applicator, which was very smooth and easy to work with on the lips, as it had enough flex to maneuver naturally across the lips and made it easy to get crisp lines on the edges with it. These are not for someone who likes a truly matte, flat finish that wears all day long, doesn’t budge or transfer, because these never quite dry down. They take anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes to “set” to a velvety finish–a light sheen but not glossy–and aren’t transfer-proof; I get closer to transfer-proof wear after several sips of coffee or blotting it down (which is true with the majority of lip products) but will not make it through a meal fully intact. They do reapply well, and they wear down evenly, so for someone who likes a semi-matte finish, longer wearing lip products, and finds traditional matte, liquid lipstick formulas too drying, these might be worth checking out. They are housed in a frosted glass tube with a glossy black cap and are lightly scented with rose (I’ll say it is subtler than usual for Chanel). All swatches were taken 30 minutes after initial application. Chanel Luxuriant (150) Rouge Allure Ink Matte Liquid Lip Colour ($37.00 for 0.20 fl. oz.) is a muted, pinky-red with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied smoothly and evenly. It was one of the better-applying shades I tried. The texture was lightweight, water-like initially but dried down to a comfortable, thin, and smooth consistency that didn’t slide around but didn’t feel tacky or clingy either. The color wore just over six and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating. Urban Decay Psycho (P, $18.00) is brighter (95% similar).

Chanel Experimente (154) Rouge Allure Ink Matte Liquid Lip Colour ($37.00 for 0.20 fl. oz.) is a dark red with warm, brick undertones and a satin finish.

Estee Lauder Defiant Coral (P, $30.00) is a smidgen lighter. Too Faced Bon Bon (P, $21.00) is lighter, pinker. Givenchy Rose Dentelle (203) (P, $36.00) is darker, less shimmery. Chanel Pygmalion (LE, $34.00) is sheerer. MAC Lady at Play (P, $22.00) is warmer, less glossy. MAC Hibiscus (LE, $16.00) is a touch darker. Guerlain Rouge Sensuel (LE, $49.50) is darker, redder. See comparison swatches / view dupes . The look and feel of this shade is really where the luxury is; the consistency is incredibly lightweight, as it is creamy and glides on easily. It applies smoothly, evenly, and better yet, lips look soft, juicy, and lustrous. When a lipstick makes your lips look like they’re in better health–smoother, plumper, softer–you know the formula is a winner. Sunset had mostly opaque color coverage with a hint of translucency that kept it from reading too heavy. It wore well for four and a half hours, and it did leave behind a stain. The formula was nicely hydrating both during and after the color wore away, and I didn’t detect any scent or taste.

The duochrome is incredibly present and noticeable. I don’t have it, but Zoya Adina seems like it would be similar, perhaps a bit lighter. Initially, my mind went to Rescue Beauty Lounge Scrangie , but it’s definitely a pinker purple with more of a blue shimmer. It’s fully opaque after two coats, and the formula was a breeze to work with; not too thick or too thin, so it applied evenly and fluidly without overflowing along the edges. I tested this shade specifically for wear, and it wore for a fully seven days with minor tip wear but no chips. There are some visible brush strokes in the finish, which is as anticipated, but may be a deal-breaker for you. I think the strength of the duochrome might sway you, though ? 15 0 Portfolio 15 0 Portfolio A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Amazon Folica 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 96% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Milani Cyberspace was the closest shade I could think of, as it does have holographic shimmer and is blue, but it’s a darker, almost grayish blue in comparison–and has a larger sparkle/shimmer finish overall. This is a fun polish to play with and do some hand dancing with, because it lightens and darkens as the light hits the nail, along with the holographic shimmer that gets more and less pronounced, depending on the angle and lighting. It has a strong holographic finish, though, that’s noticeable even in low light, so you don’t have to hold your nails at just the right angle under bright sunlight to appreciate it. The coverage was totally opaque in two coats, and the consistency wasn’t too thick or too thin. It was a breeze to apply–no pooling or bubbling, and the polish didn’t accentuate the natural texture of the nails like some holographic polishes can.

It’s almost so warm-toned that it gets into a pink-coral range, but I think it leans just pink enough to still be a pink hue overall. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a creamy consistency that easily glided onto lips. It had a fair amount of slip, which was great for application, but it did seem like it wore off a bit faster as a result–though it was lightly hydrating while it lasted (three and a half hours). Givenchy Rose d’Exception (206) (LE, $36.00) is more muted, darker. MAC Hoop (DC, $15.00) is brighter. Urban Decay Naked (P, $22.00) is similar. Urban Decay Native (P, $22.00) is lighter. Urban Decay Rush (P, $22.00) is darker. Chanel Liaison (P, $34.00) is similar. MAC Flamingo (LE, $15.00) is warmer, a touch lighter. MAC Betty Bright (LE, $15.00) is brighter. See comparison swatches . NYX Castle Round Lipstick ($3.99 for 0.14 oz.) is a cool-toned, lavender-shimmered, medium purple with a frosted finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, and the consistency was very creamy and emollient. It applied evenly for the most part, though it wasn’t perfectly even. This shade wore well for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating. I couldn’t think of any previously reviewed shades quite like this. MAC RiRi Boy (LE, $15.00) is matte, no frost, so it appears darker and brighter. MAC Seasoned Plum (LE, $18.00) is darker, less frosted. MAC Nocturnal Instincts (LE, $16.00) is grayer. MAC Lavender Whip (LE, $15.00) is lighter, pinker. Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics Digitalis (P, $18.00) is cooler-toned, lighter. See comparison swatches . NYX’s Round Lipstick formula is a nice, budget-friendly formula that offers a bajillion colors (real number), so it’s always been a go-to recommendation from me when there’s a color someone wants to try but may not want to splash out a lot for. 132 19 Blush 132 19 Blush A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Ulta Selfridges Amazon DermStore NYX Priceline Boots ASOS 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total 86 64 Castle 86 64 Castle B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Ulta Selfridges Amazon DermStore NYX Priceline Boots ASOS 8.5 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 87% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

I have ten shades that I picked up awhile ago when they first launched, but Maybelline’s website shows the range with twenty shades now (I couldn’t seem to find them online to buy, though), and I haven’t seen anything new at my local drugstores for ages (I’ve gone twice a week for the last month to find summery goodness with no luck!). In general, the formula has good color payoff with a velvety, creamy consistency that covers evenly and most shades seem to make lips appear smoother but some shades were prone to pulling into lip lines as the color wore away. The big thing about these is that they have a mostly matte finish and are more comfortable to wear than many matte formulas due to the velvety feel (almost like a silicone primer, but not quite as heavy and not clingy). The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me. It had a sweet, plastic-like scent but no taste. Maybelline Nude Embrace Color Sensational Creamy Matte Lip Color ($7.99 for 0.15 oz.) is a light-medium beige with strong, warm brown tones and a satin finish. It had good color payoff with a creamy consistency, so there was no drag when applied, but the color migrated into lip lines during initial application. Despite trying to smooth the color out of the lines, as it wore on, the color kept gravitating towards the lip lines. It wore for four and a half hours in all and was neither drying nor hydrating. Colour Pop Precocious (LE, $5.00) is lighter. MAC Naturally Transformed (P, $16.00) is darker. MAC Sensual Sparks (LE, $16.00) is darker. Too Faced Melted Nude (P, $21.00) is brighter, warmer.

Maybelline Daringly Nude Color Sensational Creamy Matte Lip Color ($7.99 for 0.15 oz.) is a peachy-pink with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had fairly opaque pigmentation that covered evenly, but again, the color had a tendency to emphasize lip lines. It wasn’t as noticeable as it was with Nude Embrace, at least. On me, the color lasted for four and a half hours with more color settling into lip lines over time, though it wasn’t drying. MAC Reel Sexy (LE, $16.00) is darker, warmer. MAC Kinda Sexy (P, $16.00) is darker. Burberry Pink Apricot (301) (P, $30.00) is darker. Givenchy Beige Plume (102) (P, $36.00) is darker, cooler. MAC Antonio’s Girls (LE, $16.00) is cooler.

See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . Maybelline Touch of Spice Color Sensational Creamy Matte Lip Color ($7.99 for 0.15 oz.) is a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with subtle, warmer undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered evenly and smoothly. The texture was creamy, and it was much more forgiving on the lips. It wore well for five and a half hours, and I didn’t have any issues with the color pulling into lip lines. It wasn’t drying when worn. Maybelline Yummy Plummy (P, $7.49) is cooler. Make Up For Ever #4 (P, $19.00) is lighter. Tom Ford Beauty Casablanca (P, $50.00) is cooler, glossier. Marc Jacobs Beauty Infamous (228) (P, $30.00) is lighter, cooler.

"[""Burberry Gold Glow No. 01 Luminizing Powder Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Nov 15, 2014 November 15, 2014 Burberry Gold Glow No. 01 Luminizing Powder Burberry Gold Glow No. 01 Luminizing Powder ($68.00 for 0.35 oz.) is a dirty, light-medium antique gold with a frosted sheen. Chanel Camelia de Plumes (LE, $76.00) is much lighter. Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Glow (P) is warmer. Chanel Dentelle Precieuse (LE, $80.00) is warmer. Becca Opal (P, $38.00) is warmer, cream. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Despite the very true, yellowed gold packaging, Burberry’s take on “Gold” in terms of actual color is much lighter, and honestly, unexpected. It is fragranced with the My Burberry scent, which is a stronger floral (a mix of bergamot, freesia, and rose), and it’s not a subtle or faint scent, so if you don’t like scented powders or are adverse to floral scents in general, you may want to skip this. You might be able to minimize the scent by leaving the compact open for a few days. I did notice the scent when applied to the skin, but it didn’t seem to be apparent after about forty minutes of wear. The powder is lovely with its soft, silky consistency that blended beautifully and highlighted the skin without emphasizing pores. It gives the skin a luminous glow that is easy to achieve. On me, the highlighter wears well for nine hours before starting to fade. It includes a very slim, narrow yet wide, straight-across brush, which will work and isn’t the worst brush I’ve tried, though not something I would use if one already had full-sized brushes.

"[""L’Oreal Colour Riche Eyeshadows Reviews, Photos, Swatches (Part 2) Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Apr 27, 2016 April 27, 2016 L’Oreal Petite Perle Colour Riche Eyeshadow L’Oreal Colour Riche Eyeshadow ($5.99 for 0.12 oz.) is supposed to be “soft, velvety” in texture with “intense pigments for exquisite color richness” and “lasts all day.” The texture is incredibly soft; to the point where I’m not sure these would travel as well as your average powder eyeshadow. The lighter, more matte shades are very white-based and can look chalky on my skin tone but should work better on fairer skin tones or coupled with a smoothing primer. Most of the shades were fairly pigmented and blendable on the lid with good adhesion without a primer with a few exceptions. Unsurprisingly, neutrals were more consistently higher-performing than the bolder/more colorful shades. I did run into wear issues, as all the shades I tried either faded and/or creased within six hours of wear, so I would recommend a primer with these. Initially, they reminded me of formulas like Make Up For Ever Artist Shadow, Kat Von D Metal Crush, etc., but while these have a similar velvety, smooth feel, they are looser once you touch your brush to them. L’Oreal Petite Perle Colour Riche Eyeshadow ($5.99 for 0.12 oz.) is a light white with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a fairly smooth texture, but it was harder to apply on the lid without it applying unevenly (almost like the color bunched up/thickened in places). The color started to crease after six hours of wear. Tom Ford Beauty Cobalt Rush #1 (P, ) is more shimmery (95% similar). NARS Rue Allent (Left) (LE, ) is darker (95% similar).

L’Oreal Teal Couture Colour Riche Eyeshadow ($5.99 for 0.12 oz.) is a muted, medium-dark green-teal with cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had a drier, firmer texture that made it harder to get decent color payoff out of it. I also had issues with applying it to my lid, as it didn’t seem to blend out without becoming patchy/uneven.

It had fairly good color coverage, but it was a shade that required two layers for full opacity. It layered and blended easily, and it wore well for ten hours. Colour Pop Mermaid Kiss (P, $5.00) is darker. MAC Lisa’s Spikes (LE, $15.00) is darker. Make Up For Ever S336 Lime (P, $21.00) is less shimmery, less yellow.

ColourPop Chipper Super Shock Shadow ($5.00 for 0.07 oz.) is described as a “mid-tone minty green … with multi-coloured glitter.” It’s a light-medium, sea foam green with lighter, aqua glitter. It had mostly opaque color coverage that applied smoothly and evenly with very little fall out during application. I had minor fall out during wear, but the color itself hadn’t faded or creased after ten hours. Urban Decay Dragon (LE, $18.00) is darker, warmer. Charlotte Tilbury The Rebel #2 (P) is darker, warmer. MAC Apple Squishee (LE, $15.00) is warmer. Make Up For Ever S312 Mint Green (P, $21.00) is less glittery, darker.

ColourPop Pop Rocks Super Shock Shadow ($5.00 for 0.07 oz.) is described as a “cool-toned cornflower blue … with multi-coloured glitter.” It’s a medium-dark blue with lighter silver and blue glitter. It swatched as semi-opaque, but it seemed to go on fully opaque when I applied it to the lid (I used a flat, synthetic brush) to the point where a little went further than anticipated. I didn’t notice any glitter fall out when I was blending this shade, but there were a few stray glittery bits after a few hours of wear. I didn’t have any creasing or fading at the ten-hour mark. Gucci Beauty Iconic Ottanio (P, $37.00) is much darker. Urban Decay Freeze (LE, $18.00) is more muted. Make Up For Ever ME232 Turquoise Blue (P, $21.00) is brighter.

MAC Parrot (LE, $15.00) is slightly darker. See comparison swatches / view dupes . ColourPop Lace Super Shock Shadow ($5.00 for 0.07 oz.) is described as a “deep rich blue violet with a pearlized finish.” It’s a brightened, medium-dark violet purple with a blackened purple base and lighter purple shimmer and amethyst glitter. I thought this one was a bit trickier to get opaque color coverage with using a brush, as it tended to look darker and less vibrant when applied with a brush (the same brush I could use with the previous three without issue). The first time I swatched it, the color payoff was very intense, but every subsequent time, it was weaker. The texture was blendable, and it stayed on well without any fading or creasing over a ten-hour period. MAC Victorian Plum (LE, $19.50) is darker. Ardency Inn Royal (P, $21.00) is lighter. Sleek MakeUP Simbad’s Seas (LE, $9.99) is bluer. Sleek MakeUP Bliss in Barcelona (LE, $9.99) is more muted. Disney by Sephora Sea Witch (LE) is less shimmery.

I spotted it on QVC last week and had to have it, and bonus, right now it’s slightly discounted (basically takes care of shipping fees). I ended up liking it quite a bit, and it’s both wearable and smokier–more colorful and more unique than a lot of bareMinerals palettes have been. No duds, but those with extensive Ready collections may find it has too many repromotes. Celebrate is described as a “yellow-cream.” It’s a light beige with warm undertones and a satiny finish. It had rich pigmentation with a very soft, blendable texture that was silky and finely-milled without becoming powdery. This shade wore well for ten hours before creasing.

It’s almost a duochrome, but it seemed like a subdued variation on the green-brown duochrome we’ve seen from many brands in the past and didn’t have a lot of shift. The texture was soft, just a smidgen powdery, and it was easy to work with for application and blending. It wore well for ten hours.

It had good pigmentation that was buildable to opaque coverage with a moderately dense, smooth consistency that didn’t kick up any excess product in the pan but still was easy to pickup with my brushes. It was darker and warmer compared to the shade in the previous formula ( see side-by-side comparison ), while the consistency yielded better in the new formula and wasn’t as thick, but I found they blended equally well and applied similarly to the lid–I didn’t notice much of a difference in practice. On me, it lasted for 10 and a half hours before creasing faintly.

Formula Overview $17.00/0.08 oz. - $212.50 Per Ounce The original Artist Shadow formula had a creamier, slightly softer, and thicker feel for finishes like Metallic, Iridescent, and Satin, while I felt the original Diamond finish was denser/thicker (heavier almost) and the Matte finish was more powdery but similar in softness and pigmentation (I did not find the original Mattes to be ultra pigmented across the board--semi-opaque to opaque, buildable, which you can see in my original swatches here ). By and large, I found the formula to be easy to work with and did not have to spend a lot of time blending or fussing with the shades on the lid. The new Matte formula has a smoother consistency that has more slip to the touch with less powderiness in the pan, but the pigmentation did seem slightly weaker on average compared to the original formula. The pigmentation of the new Matte formula was still semi-opaque to opaque and buildable but I felt like there were just more shades that were closer to semi-opaque than to opaque. However, shades like M402 Mimosa showed improvement, as it used to be a Satin ( see here ) and not as easy to work with due to the denser texture. A lot of the shades were similar in color between the formulas, but there were a few that were not ( M546 Dark Purple Taupe was a shade with more significant changes; the new version is warmer and lighter). Overall, I did not have any issues applying most of the matte shades to the lid, blending them out, or building up coverage. They lasted between nine and ten hours on me, which was actually a bit longer (on average) compared to the original formula, where the mattes tended to wear between seven and eight hours on me (without primer). The new Satin formula was the most different; it had weaker pigmentation, felt denser and drier with less give and creaminess. In practice, I did not feel like application was harder or noticeably different other than feeling like more of the shades required two layers for more opaque coverage, though some of the more neutral shades were fairly pigmented in a single layer. I also noticed that this particular finish seemed to be the most culled; there weren\'t that many shades in it, and I wonder if they did not sell well or something about the finish is harder to produce. There were significant differences in color (and/or undertone) between shades in the new formula and old formula (with the same names) within this finish, too, where most were different rather than only a handful being different. The pigmentation of the new Satin formula was typically semi-opaque and buildable, while they applied evenly, blended out without much effort, and lasted between eight and ten hours (without primer). The new Iridescent formula was the second most different and more comparable to the Satin finish in terms of overall feel and performance, just with larger shimmer/micro-sparkle. The new formula has a denser consistency (almost ""drier"" and with less slip) and didn\'t feel as cream-like, but the powder seemed to pickup better with most brushes and was more consistent in the actual finish--pearly with sparkle--whereas the original formula varied more heavily between pearly and metallic, sparkle and finer shimmer. There were, however, more substantial color and undertone differences between old and new within this formula, like I saw with the Satin formula. Overall, I did not experience any significant issues applying most of the shades to the lid--they were semi-opaque to opaque, fairly buildable, blendable, and long-wearing (eight to ten hours). The new Metallic formula was the most consistent between old and new for overall feel, performance, and color. There were, of course, a few shades that seemed lighter/darker, cooler/warmer compared to the previous versions, and all those notes will be made within the respective shade\'s review. I think the new Metallic finish has a more flattering look on the lid, as the consistency wasn\'t quite as thick, which should make it apply and appear smoother on the lid for more people. There were several shades that seemed slightly deeper or less reflective, while others were as reflective as past versions. The majority of the shades of this finish were very pigmented with a moderately dense, lightly creamy texture that blended out well on the lid and wore between nine and ten hours on me. The new Diamond finish was noticeably less dense/thick, particularly on the lid, which did make it easier to spread across a larger area and easier to pickup with more types of brushes. I was worried that there would be more fallout, but I haven\'t noticeable much fallout with the new Diamond shades over the eight to ten hours they last for. Most of them had good pigmentation, though there were a few that were weaker (medium to semi-opaque coverage); a shade like D410 Gold Nugget was a weaker shade before and still is while D326 Lagoon Blue is significantly less pigmented in the new formula . As I typically do with new eyeshadow formulas, I tested a few shades from each finish over various primers, as I like to see how new formulas interact with different types of primers and if there are any unexpected consequences of using primers (I felt that some of the more silicone-heavy Artist Shadows from before actually applied better without primer). I didn\'t notice any ill effects of using primers like Smashbox 24-Hour, Marc Jacobs Coconut Eye Primer, Too Faced Shadow Insurance, or Urban Decay Primer Potion. They all seemed to just help with wear, and with some of the shades that felt drier or had weaker pigmentation, the use of primer seemed to improve initial coverage levels, too.

It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer with a smooth, moderately dense and slightly firm texture. There was no excess product that kicked up in the pan, but I felt like it needed a slightly heavier hand to pickup product well onto my brush (but I didn’t feel I needed to change my brush or overall technique for application). The color is significantly different in the new formula than the old one, as the new formula is much, much lighter and yellower ( see side-by-side comparison ). The eyeshadow applied nicely to bare skin and blended out with ease. It wore well for 10 hours on me before fading slightly.

It was intensely pigmented and had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was dense but not too thick or heavy on the lid, so it did not emphasize my lid’s texture. The new version is slightly darker but find I can only tell the difference through photos (based on how the light bounced off the shimmer) and not at all in person, while the texture wasn’t as dense or as thick as the previous formulation ( see side-by-side comparison ). The eyeshadow applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin, blended out nicely, and stayed on well for almost 11 hours on me.

Formula Overview $17.00/0.08 oz. - $212.50 Per Ounce The original Artist Shadow formula had a creamier, slightly softer, and thicker feel for finishes like Metallic, Iridescent, and Satin, while I felt the original Diamond finish was denser/thicker (heavier almost) and the Matte finish was more powdery but similar in softness and pigmentation (I did not find the original Mattes to be ultra pigmented across the board--semi-opaque to opaque, buildable, which you can see in my original swatches here ). By and large, I found the formula to be easy to work with and did not have to spend a lot of time blending or fussing with the shades on the lid. The new Matte formula has a smoother consistency that has more slip to the touch with less powderiness in the pan, but the pigmentation did seem slightly weaker on average compared to the original formula. The pigmentation of the new Matte formula was still semi-opaque to opaque and buildable but I felt like there were just more shades that were closer to semi-opaque than to opaque. However, shades like M402 Mimosa showed improvement, as it used to be a Satin ( see here ) and not as easy to work with due to the denser texture. A lot of the shades were similar in color between the formulas, but there were a few that were not ( M546 Dark Purple Taupe was a shade with more significant changes; the new version is warmer and lighter). Overall, I did not have any issues applying most of the matte shades to the lid, blending them out, or building up coverage. They lasted between nine and ten hours on me, which was actually a bit longer (on average) compared to the original formula, where the mattes tended to wear between seven and eight hours on me (without primer). The new Satin formula was the most different; it had weaker pigmentation, felt denser and drier with less give and creaminess. In practice, I did not feel like application was harder or noticeably different other than feeling like more of the shades required two layers for more opaque coverage, though some of the more neutral shades were fairly pigmented in a single layer. I also noticed that this particular finish seemed to be the most culled; there weren\'t that many shades in it, and I wonder if they did not sell well or something about the finish is harder to produce. There were significant differences in color (and/or undertone) between shades in the new formula and old formula (with the same names) within this finish, too, where most were different rather than only a handful being different. The pigmentation of the new Satin formula was typically semi-opaque and buildable, while they applied evenly, blended out without much effort, and lasted between eight and ten hours (without primer). The new Iridescent formula was the second most different and more comparable to the Satin finish in terms of overall feel and performance, just with larger shimmer/micro-sparkle. The new formula has a denser consistency (almost ""drier"" and with less slip) and didn\'t feel as cream-like, but the powder seemed to pickup better with most brushes and was more consistent in the actual finish--pearly with sparkle--whereas the original formula varied more heavily between pearly and metallic, sparkle and finer shimmer. There were, however, more substantial color and undertone differences between old and new within this formula, like I saw with the Satin formula. Overall, I did not experience any significant issues applying most of the shades to the lid--they were semi-opaque to opaque, fairly buildable, blendable, and long-wearing (eight to ten hours). The new Metallic formula was the most consistent between old and new for overall feel, performance, and color. There were, of course, a few shades that seemed lighter/darker, cooler/warmer compared to the previous versions, and all those notes will be made within the respective shade\'s review. I think the new Metallic finish has a more flattering look on the lid, as the consistency wasn\'t quite as thick, which should make it apply and appear smoother on the lid for more people. There were several shades that seemed slightly deeper or less reflective, while others were as reflective as past versions. The majority of the shades of this finish were very pigmented with a moderately dense, lightly creamy texture that blended out well on the lid and wore between nine and ten hours on me. The new Diamond finish was noticeably less dense/thick, particularly on the lid, which did make it easier to spread across a larger area and easier to pickup with more types of brushes. I was worried that there would be more fallout, but I haven\'t noticeable much fallout with the new Diamond shades over the eight to ten hours they last for. Most of them had good pigmentation, though there were a few that were weaker (medium to semi-opaque coverage); a shade like D410 Gold Nugget was a weaker shade before and still is while D326 Lagoon Blue is significantly less pigmented in the new formula . As I typically do with new eyeshadow formulas, I tested a few shades from each finish over various primers, as I like to see how new formulas interact with different types of primers and if there are any unexpected consequences of using primers (I felt that some of the more silicone-heavy Artist Shadows from before actually applied better without primer). I didn\'t notice any ill effects of using primers like Smashbox 24-Hour, Marc Jacobs Coconut Eye Primer, Too Faced Shadow Insurance, or Urban Decay Primer Potion. They all seemed to just help with wear, and with some of the shades that felt drier or had weaker pigmentation, the use of primer seemed to improve initial coverage levels, too.

The pigmentation was very nearly opaque in a single layer and easily built up to opaque coverage using a heavier hand or applying a pat of additional product on top. The consistency was smooth and velvety to the touch and felt like it had a little more slip than the previous formula, which had run a little drier and slightly powdery at times. In terms of color, the new formula is deeper and slightly warmer in tone ( see side-by-side comparison ). The new formula was easy to apply and blend out on the lid.

A lot of the shades were similar in color between the formulas, but there were a few that were not ( M546 Dark Purple Taupe was a shade with more significant changes; the new version is warmer and lighter). Overall, I did not have any issues applying most of the matte shades to the lid, blending them out, or building up coverage. They lasted between nine and ten hours on me, which was actually a bit longer (on average) compared to the original formula, where the mattes tended to wear between seven and eight hours on me (without primer). The new Satin formula was the most different; it had weaker pigmentation, felt denser and drier with less give and creaminess. In practice, I did not feel like application was harder or noticeably different other than feeling like more of the shades required two layers for more opaque coverage, though some of the more neutral shades were fairly pigmented in a single layer. I also noticed that this particular finish seemed to be the most culled; there weren\'t that many shades in it, and I wonder if they did not sell well or something about the finish is harder to produce. There were significant differences in color (and/or undertone) between shades in the new formula and old formula (with the same names) within this finish, too, where most were different rather than only a handful being different. The pigmentation of the new Satin formula was typically semi-opaque and buildable, while they applied evenly, blended out without much effort, and lasted between eight and ten hours (without primer). The new Iridescent formula was the second most different and more comparable to the Satin finish in terms of overall feel and performance, just with larger shimmer/micro-sparkle. The new formula has a denser consistency (almost ""drier"" and with less slip) and didn\'t feel as cream-like, but the powder seemed to pickup better with most brushes and was more consistent in the actual finish--pearly with sparkle--whereas the original formula varied more heavily between pearly and metallic, sparkle and finer shimmer. There were, however, more substantial color and undertone differences between old and new within this formula, like I saw with the Satin formula. Overall, I did not experience any significant issues applying most of the shades to the lid--they were semi-opaque to opaque, fairly buildable, blendable, and long-wearing (eight to ten hours). The new Metallic formula was the most consistent between old and new for overall feel, performance, and color. There were, of course, a few shades that seemed lighter/darker, cooler/warmer compared to the previous versions, and all those notes will be made within the respective shade\'s review. I think the new Metallic finish has a more flattering look on the lid, as the consistency wasn\'t quite as thick, which should make it apply and appear smoother on the lid for more people. There were several shades that seemed slightly deeper or less reflective, while others were as reflective as past versions. The majority of the shades of this finish were very pigmented with a moderately dense, lightly creamy texture that blended out well on the lid and wore between nine and ten hours on me. The new Diamond finish was noticeably less dense/thick, particularly on the lid, which did make it easier to spread across a larger area and easier to pickup with more types of brushes. I was worried that there would be more fallout, but I haven\'t noticeable much fallout with the new Diamond shades over the eight to ten hours they last for. Most of them had good pigmentation, though there were a few that were weaker (medium to semi-opaque coverage); a shade like D410 Gold Nugget was a weaker shade before and still is while D326 Lagoon Blue is significantly less pigmented in the new formula . As I typically do with new eyeshadow formulas, I tested a few shades from each finish over various primers, as I like to see how new formulas interact with different types of primers and if there are any unexpected consequences of using primers (I felt that some of the more silicone-heavy Artist Shadows from before actually applied better without primer). I didn\'t notice any ill effects of using primers like Smashbox 24-Hour, Marc Jacobs Coconut Eye Primer, Too Faced Shadow Insurance, or Urban Decay Primer Potion. They all seemed to just help with wear, and with some of the shades that felt drier or had weaker pigmentation, the use of primer seemed to improve initial coverage levels, too.

I found it felt and looked quite different than the shade in the previous formula, as the new version is deeper, yellower, and more metallic than pearly with a firmer, thinner consistency ( see side-by-side comparison ).

Formula Overview $17.00/0.08 oz. - $212.50 Per Ounce The original Artist Shadow formula had a creamier, slightly softer, and thicker feel for finishes like Metallic, Iridescent, and Satin, while I felt the original Diamond finish was denser/thicker (heavier almost) and the Matte finish was more powdery but similar in softness and pigmentation (I did not find the original Mattes to be ultra pigmented across the board--semi-opaque to opaque, buildable, which you can see in my original swatches here ). By and large, I found the formula to be easy to work with and did not have to spend a lot of time blending or fussing with the shades on the lid. The new Matte formula has a smoother consistency that has more slip to the touch with less powderiness in the pan, but the pigmentation did seem slightly weaker on average compared to the original formula.

"[""Kevyn Aucoin Sunlight Celestial Powder Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jun 30, 2016 June 30, 2016 Kevyn Aucoin Sunlight The Celestial Powder Kevyn Aucoin Sunlight The Celestial Powder ($44.00 for 0.14 oz.) is a shimmering, golden brown with warm, yellow undertones and a frosted sheen.

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . The Celestial Powder is supposed to give “an agenlic glow” that doesn’t look “glittery.” There are now three shades in the range (the other two are Candlelight and Starlight), and Sunlight is more comparable to Starlight , as it has more color oomph and stronger shimmer compared to Candlelight (which is particularly nice for those who like subtle to moderate highlighters). This is more of a highlighting bronzer, as it adds a lot of glow and luminosity to the skin, but it does add warmth. It is very pigmented, but the texture is soft, blendable, and forgiving, so it can easily be applied with a lighter hand for barely-there golden sheen or more intensely for true-to-pan bronzing. The consistency of the powder was smooth and finely-milled, and this didn’t emphasize my pores or skin texture. It wore well for almost nine hours on me before fading.

"[""BUXOM Fall 2016 Eyeshadows Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Jun 30, 2016 June 30, 2016 BUXOM Eyeshadow BUXOM Silver Screen Eyeshadow ($12.00 for 0.05 oz.) is a brilliant lavender with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. This shade had more noticeable sparkle, though I didn’t notice any fall out during the day, which I think is owed to the denser, thicker consistency of the eyeshadow overall. It had great color payoff, and the powder had a smooth, cream-like feel to it that was blendable and adhered well on the skin. This shade wore well for eight hours. Kat Von D Heaven (LE, ) is less shimmery (90% similar). Viseart Bijoux Royal #4 (LE, ) is less shimmery (90% similar). bareMinerals Flash (P, $12.00) is less shimmery (90% similar).

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . BUXOM Made of Jade Eyeshadow ($12.00 for 0.05 oz.) is a bright, light-medium green with subtly warmer gold shimmer on top with a slightly cooler, silvery base paired with a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation with a soft, smooth, and blendable texture, which was a little looser in the pan compared to the shades. It applied well, though, but it is one that I liked better with a firmer/flatter brush. This shade wore nicely for eight hours before fading slightly. Colour Pop Up and Up (P, $5.00) is less shimmery, warmer (90% similar). Chanel Jade Shore (LE, $34.00) is less shimmery, darker (90% similar).

BUXOM Rose Gold Eyeshadow ($12.00 for 0.05 oz.) is a rich, medium-dark gold with a warm, reddish-copper base paired with a frosted finish. It didn’t seem to shift color, but it had a very strong base color and a more contrasting shimmer color, which gave it a lot of dimension and depth on the lid. In some ways, I think it had more nuance than a duochrome, since it is apparent regardless of the angle. Makeup Geek Ritzy (P, $6.00) is more shimmery (95% similar).

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . BUXOM Dusk ‘Til Dawn Eyeshadow ($12.00 for 0.05 oz.) is a medium-dark, forest green with warm, olive undertones and a soft, frosted sheen. The color payoff was amazing with fully opaque coverage immediately as a little went a long way. The texture was soft, smooth, dense, and creamy, which made it easy to use on the lid as it blended out nicely and sat well on the skin. This shade stayed on for eight and a half hours before creasing faintly. Makeup Geek Venom (P, $6.00) is lighter, cooler (90% similar). Too Faced Money Bags (LE, $16.00) is lighter (90% similar).

BUXOM Twilight Tryst Eyeshadow ($12.00 for 0.05 oz.) is a deep, almost blackened, blue-teal with cooler undertones and a strong, purple-red base. It had a near-metallic finish. The texture was very dense, though it was still smooth and blendable on the skin. It had fantastic pigmentation that applied and adhered well to bare skin.

FORMULA OVERVIEW | BUXOM Eyeshadow ($12.00 each or $40 for six) is a powder eyeshadow that is available as a customizable palette system, where you can purchase a single shade and an individual compact for $12 or purchase a six-pan palette, plus six eyeshadows to go inside of it, for $40. Each eyeshadow is held inside a metal pan that is (presumably) glued into a plastic pan that snaps into the compact/palette. The eyeshadows are easily lifted in and out of the palette, so you can rearrange them or create a new combination if you have more than one set of six. They will fit into a Z-palette, but you’ll need to add a magnet to keep it in place. The eyeshadow formula is one that works better in action than swatched, as several of the mattes seemed on the thinner, more powdery side, but then they would blend exceptionally well while adhering to bare skin–and they wouldn’t fade any faster than the more shimmery eyeshadows. The more shimmery shades tended to outperform the matte shades with better color payoff. These eyeshadows seem to have a slightly firmer press to them (more in the style of your average MAC eyeshadow), and they feel quite different compared to bareMinerals’ Ready line, as those have a thicker, denser consistency. 31 2 Silver Screen 31 2 Silver Screen A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Buxom 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 92% Total 23 3 Made of Jade 23 3 Made of Jade A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Buxom 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total Recommended 34 2 Rose Gold 34 2 Rose Gold A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Buxom 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total Recommended Recommended 21 0 Dusk 'Til Dawn 21 0 Dusk 'Til Dawn A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Buxom 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 98% Total Recommended Recommended 35 3 Twilight Tryst 35 3 Twilight Tryst A+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Buxom 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9.5 Longevity 5 Application 99% Total Recommended Recommended 19 2 Bronzed Bod 19 2 Bronzed Bod A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Buxom 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total Recommended We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Urban Decay Plague, UV-B, Frostbite XX Vintage Vice Lipsticks Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Sep 04, 2016 September 04, 2016 Urban Decay Vice Lipstick Urban Decay Plague Vice Lipstick ($17.00 for 0.11 oz.) is described as a “bright purple with pink undertone [with a Cream finish].” It’s a medium-dark reddish-purple with warm undertones and fine pink and light blue pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on evenly, but the slippery texture of the formula made it prone to emphasizing and settling into lip lines, unfortunately. It wasn’t as noticeable as the other two shades, though. I imagine this would be easier to find a coordinating lip liner for, which would alleviate the issue of settling. The color wore well for four and a half hours, left a subtle stain behind, and was hydrating. MAC Royal Hour (LE, $17.50) is more shimmery, cooler (90% similar). MAC Model Behavior (P, $17.50) is less shimmery (90% similar). Milani Raving Matte (08) (LE, $8.99) is darker, better quality, less glossy (85% similar).

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Urban Decay UV-B Vice Lipstick ($17.00 for 0.11 oz.) is described as a “vibrant blue with purple shift [with a Cream finish].” It’s a medium-dark, bluish-purple with strong, cool undertones and fine pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation paired with a creamy, moderately emollient texture, which did cause some color to pull into lip lines right away. It applied fairly evenly, though it wasn’t perfect in application. The color wore well for four hours, left a pinkish stain behind, and was hydrating. Urban Decay Monarchy (P, $18.00) is darker, less pigmented (85% similar). NYX Immortal (P, $6.00) is less shimmery, darker (80% similar). NYX Ego (P, $7.50) is less shimmery, darker, less glossy (80% similar). Urban Decay Reverb (P, $18.00) is darker, less pigmented, warmer (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Urban Decay Frostbite Vice Lipstick ($17.00 for 0.11 oz.) is described as a “frosted deep blue with multicolored micro-glitter [with a Cream finish].” It’s a subdued, medium-dark navy blue with cooler undertones and a metallic shimmer-sheen finish. It’s a cool shade, to be sure, but it applied terribly–it was semi-opaque, streaky, and went on unevenly. I imagine part of that is due to the more emollient consistency. The color lasted for four and a half hours, left a stain behind, but it settled into lip lines over time. The formula was hydrating at least!

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Formula Overview Urban Decay Vice Lipstick ($17.00 for 0.11 oz.) is available in six finishes, which are primarily distinguished by level of sheen, shimmer content, and coverage. Mega Mattes are the thinnest and have the most “cling” as they are drier and more matte (but most are semi-matte and not a totally flat matte) and can be drying, though they are longer-wearing. Comfort Mattes are creamier, a little denser, with richer color payoff on average (they are the most pigmented out of the finishes), and have a satin finish that is fairly comfortable to wear, usually lightly hydrating, and longer-wearing. Creams are usually softer and creamier, though not too soft (they don’t mush or break from the base easily), with some being tackier and stiffer in the tube until they warm up against the lips; they have good color payoff, are hydrating, and are comfortable to wear but have more typical wear (four to six hours–six hours for deeper/richer shades like a red). Sheers and Sheer Shimmers have a more balm-like consistency that feels a little thinner but is wetter/more emollient than Mega Mattes , so ultimately, they feel quite different applied; they have sheerer coverage, though more semi-sheer to semi-opaque than very sheer, and have the shortest wear time at two to fours with light hydration. Metallized is the most shimmery of the finishes, though some of the other finishes have shades that are actually as shimmery (to me), but the Metallized formula has a thinner, more emollient base that isn’t as dense or as cream-like as the Creams ; they feel more like the Sheers but a bit heavier and more pigmented (but seem to run semi-opaque to opaque, not always fully opaque) with average wear (four to five hours), light hydration. The Revolution formula–generally–felt a little more hydrating and pigmented on the lips, but these seem to wear a little longer; some of the shades that were in Revolution and are now in Vice (particularly the Creams, Sheers, and Sheer Shimmers) feel virtually the same on to me. The Comfort Mattes are the only ones that felt largely different–more satiny than matte, less dense compared to Matte Revolution. 32 7 Plague 32 7 Plague B- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 8 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 8 Texture 8 Longevity 4.5 Application 82% Total 29 9 UV-B 29 9 UV-B C+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 7.5 Product 8 Pigmentation 7.5 Texture 8 Longevity 4.5 Application 79% Total 11 13 Frostbite 11 13 Frostbite C- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 6.5 Product 7 Pigmentation 7 Texture 8.5 Longevity 3 Application 71% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It had nearly opaque pigmentation, so a little went a long way. If you tend to have a heavy-hand and prefer sheerer coverage, I’d look elsewhere, but if you love very pigmented, deep blushes, this one might appeal to you. The texture was fairly soft and blendable, but it could have been easier to diffuse and blend out on the cheeks; I found the best way to apply this was with a light hand to try and build it up as gradually as possible. This shade wore well for eight and a half hours before fading on me. As a note, this shade is much deeper and brighter (and not quite as blue-based) as it was in the original formulation. 5 1 Rendezvous 5 1 Rendezvous B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beauty Bay (UK) Makeup Geek 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It had medium, buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque) that applied fairly evenly, but it did not look as smooth nor as flattering on my lips as most of the Ecstasy Lacquers have. I think it may have had to do with the fact that this shade was thinner and did not develop to the more gel-like texture after initial application that the others have in my experience.

"[""MAC With Gusto, Sway to the Sound, Saucy Miss, Acting on Impulse Vamplify Lipglosses Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jul 02, 2016 July 02, 2016 MAC With Gusto Vamplify Lipgloss MAC With Gusto Vamplify Lipgloss ($20.00 for 0.14 fl. oz.) is a deep, muted burgundy with subtle, warm undertones and and a lightly pearlized finish. The texture was lightweight, comfortable to wear, and spread easily across the lips, but the semi-opaque coverage made it more apparent just how much color settled into lip lines. It wore well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing. Anastasia Venom (-, $16.00) is more shimmery, warmer (90% similar). Anastasia Potion (-, $16.00) is less shimmery, darker (90% similar). NARS Toy (P, $26.00) is darker (95% similar). MAC Dark as Night (P, $19.50) is darker, warmer (90% similar). Makeup Geek Mixtape (P, $15.00) is more shimmery, warmer (85% similar). Makeup Geek Acoustic (P, $15.00) is warmer (85% similar). MAC Lasting Achievement (P, $19.50) is warmer (85% similar). Maybelline Slay It (P, $7.99) is darker (85% similar). Urban Decay Apocalypse (DC, $26.00) is lighter, warmer (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . MAC Sway to the Sound Vamplify Lipgloss ($20.00 for 0.16 fl. oz.) is a muted, medium-dark lavender purple with cool undertones and a cream finish. It applied fairly evenly, though it highlighted lip lines as some of the gloss gathered there. This shade had mostly opaque coverage and lasted nicely for five hours. The formula was moderately hydrating. MAC Night and Daze (P, $17.00) is darker (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . MAC Saucy Miss Vamplify Lipgloss ($20.00 for 0.16 fl. oz.) is a medium-dark blue-violet with a cream finish. I find it appears bluer when swatched, but due to it being only semi-opaque, the pink tones of my natural lips seems to make it appear almost purplish on. It applied unevenly and tended to look streaky on. The color lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating. Maybelline Major (P, $7.99) is darker, more muted (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . MAC Acting on Impulse Vamplify Lipgloss ($20.00 for 0.16 fl. oz.) is a deep bluish-teal with cool undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-sheer color coverage, and it did not apply particularly well, as the color gathered in lip lines and could have been more even. It lasted for four hours and was lightly hydrating (that was the highlight of this one). Lancome Crystallized Cobalt (10) (P, $22.00) is more shimmery, lighter, cooler (85% similar). Colour Pop Getty (P, $7.00) is lighter, brighter, warmer (80% similar). Maybelline Major (P, $7.99) is darker, cooler (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . FORMULA OVERVIEW | MAC Vamplify Lipgloss ($20.00 for 0.16 fl. oz.) is supposed to have intense, vivid color paired with a moisturizing, glossy, long-wearing formula. Some shades are very pigmented while others are semi-opaque, and some shades apply evenly while others are more streaky. They have a light-medium thick consistency that’s not heavy or goopy, but it’s not really thin; however, they’re really smooth and creamy, so they feel nice on. There’s no tackiness initially, and it feels a lot like lip balm to me–soft, smooth, and my lips felt supple. I find they develop light to moderate tackiness as they wear on. They wear anywhere from three to five hours and are lightly to moderately hydrating over time. The formula has strong, vanilla scent (stronger than their lipsticks; I can smell it for a bit even when it is applied, not just in the tube) but no discernible taste. Editor’s Note : At the time of the original review, there were no similar shades of lipgloss close enough to be considered dupes for Sway to the Sound, Saucy Miss, or Acting on Impulse; if there are any dupes in the future, the post will automatically update with them (but it’s not an error!). 5 7 With Gusto 5 7 With Gusto B Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8 Product 8 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9.5 Longevity 4 Application 83% Total 8 4 Sway to the Sound 8 4 Sway to the Sound B Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8 Product 9 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9.5 Longevity 4 Application 86% Total 6 6 Saucy Miss 6 6 Saucy Miss B- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 7 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9.5 Longevity 3.5 Application 81% Total 5 4 Acting on Impulse 5 4 Acting on Impulse C Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 6.5 Product 7 Pigmentation 8 Texture 8.5 Longevity 3 Application 73% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The Color Source Buildable Blush formula is supposed to offer–you guessed it–buildable color coverage with a “silky-smooth” consistency available in matte and satin finishes. The softer, more finely-milled consistency of the powder made this a lot easier to use, as it blended out well, and it could be sheered out slightly as well. With such a deep shade, having a lot of blendability is key. It was semi-opaque to opaque in pigmentation, which is a bit higher coverage than most of the shades in the range that I have tried myself, but it should work exceptionally well on deeper skin tones as a result. Those who like sheerer or softer blush, I would recommend a fan brush and a light hand. The finish has a nice, luminous sheen to it that looked natural and not overtly shimmery on. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me. 15 1 Infrared 15 1 Infrared A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Ulta Amazon DermStore Kohl's LORAC 9 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The KissKiss formula is supposed to have “covetable color” with a “satiny, vibrant finish” and an “ultra-comfortable texture” that is also hydrating. For fall, the brand released two new shades, this one and Lady Pink (which I don’t have). The consistency was lightweight with moderate creaminess so it glided onto lips without dragging but still covered evenly, as it didn’t slide around easily. It yielded mostly opaque color payoff that lasted for five hours on me. The formula was comfortable to wear with a moderate hydration over time.

I’m not sure about this shade being universally applicable (it’s rare for a product like this to work across all skin tones), as I could see the base color possibly becoming chalky on darker skin tones, so you might want to check it out on-counter if you can. On very fair skin tones, it may add slight warmth and color, while fair to medium-dark will likely see more of a golden sheen without much color. On my medium skin tone, I get a golden glow that makes my cheekbones pop without any noticeable color. It’s a very fine shimmer, so it doesn’t emphasize pores, and the powder’s texture was soft without being powdery. It was one of the better Dior face powders I’ve tested in the last couple of years, so it was a pleasant surprise to try. The highlighter wore well for eight hours on me before fading. 14 14 Cosmopolite 14 14 Cosmopolite B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Dior Macy's Harrods Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil Boots Bloomingdale's Escentual Sephora (PL) Dillard's 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . According to the brand, Air Blush is supposed to offer buildable coverage with a “luminous finish” that wears for “24-hours.” Each shade consists of a lighter and deeper shade, designed to be used together (each section of product is quite narrow, so it’s not feasible to use a blush or highlighting brush to get a single color). In general, I found the lighter color to have more shimmer/luminosity and acted as the “highlighting” shade within the palette, even though some variations are such that both shades are more blush-like in color and depth. Please note: It’s pretty hard to test a cheek product for 24-hours, since inevitably, most of it will end up on my sheets if I go to sleep, and I can’t tell you if or when I’ve ever pulled an all-nighter on purpose. To that end, I am rating by considering how it looked and what (if any) break down of product occurred between 14 and 18 hours of wear and then extrapolating to determine a “final” wear-time. Flesh & Fantasy is the lightest/most muted shade in the range. It had medium coverage, which could be built-up to opaque coverage in two to three layers. The texture was soft, smooth, and a little dusty when I worked with it, but luckily, this did not translate on the skin. It still applied well, blended out easily, and produced a natural sheen that added luminosity but did not emphasize pores or look metallic on my skin. On me, it was still looking very much intact even after 18 hours of wear. Worth noting, during July, 25% of sales of Air Blush will be donated to amfAR when purchased through Marc Jacobs Beauty . (I wouldn’t use it as an excuse to purchase something you’re not interested in but would consider purchasing directly vs. through another retailer if you were planning to buy. I have ordered direct from MJB a few times, and they have always packed well and shipped efficiently–no complaints!) 46 14 Flesh & Fantasy (506) 46 14 Flesh & Fantasy (506) A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Neiman Marcus Bergdorf Goodman Harrods Sephora Brazil Sephora (Australia) Escentual Sephora (PL) Marc Jacobs Beauty 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 92% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The formula is described as having shine, color, and long-wear (‘up to six hours”). It uses a “gel base” for a “feather-light finish giving immediate moisture.” The collection of ten will launch on May 7th online and May 14th in-stores. The formula clings without feeling dry or uncomfortable, but it doesn’t have as much slip as a lot of glossy, balm-like formulas do, so it does wear a bit longer, though rarely the full six hours. It is lightly to moderating hydrating over time. The color coverage varies but tends to be semi-opaque. You’ll want to let the bullet melt against the warmth of your lips for a few seconds before applying, as this will help it glided across the lips. MAC Glamorized Huggable Lipcolour ($20.00 for 0.11 oz.) is described as a “creamy vibrant pink.” It’s a brightened, fuchsia magenta with strong, blue undertones and a soft shine. While it had semi-opaque pigmentation, it seemed to apply somewhat streakily, so it looked splotchy on. It lasted for five hours on me and was hydrating over time. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . MAC I’m In Huggable Lipcolour ($20.00 for 0.11 oz.) is described as a “warm rose.” It’s a muted, medium pink with warm undertones and fine, gold pearl. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentation (slightly less compared to most shades in the set of ten) that applied evenly. The formula was comfortable to wear and moisturizing over time, and it lasted for four hours on me. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . MAC Bare Hug Huggable Lipcolour ($20.00 for 0.11 oz.) is described as a “creamy soft peach/orange.” It’s a muted, light-medium pink-coral with subtle gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff that yielded a fair amount of color but had a slight translucency to it where the natural lip color still came through. It was comfortable to wear and lasted for four and a half hours on me. I was surprised at how similar this was to I’m In .

It has a light-medium-weight feel with a little slip but it definitely clings (or hugs, if you like) to the lips in a way that isn’t uncomfortable but enables the color to last longer than more emollient formulas would. There’s a soft shine that starts to wear away after two to three hours, while the color itself wears from three to five hours, depending on the shade. If you’re familiar with MAC’s finishes, it’s like a cross between their Cremesheen finish and the Mineralize Rich lipsticks. I find the formula lightly hydrating over time, though they really need time to melt against the heat of the lips to feel good and glossy. When applying, I recommend letting the bullet rest against the lips for a few seconds prior to gliding it across, or else it will drag somewhat. MAC Flaming Lips Huggable Lipcolour ($20.00 for 0.11 oz.) is described as a “deep creamy red.” It’s a muted, medium-dark red with warm, orange undertones and a soft shine with very, very fine shimmer. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied fairly evenly. This shade wore well for five hours on me and was nicely hydrating over time. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . MAC I’m Game Huggable Lipcolour ($20.00 for 0.11 oz.) is described as a “creamy raspberry.” It’s a softened, medium-dark pink with subtle cool undertones and a soft shine. On me, it looks almost warm-toned, but it is slightly cool-toned. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and was comfortable to wear. It wore well for four and a half hours on me. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . MAC Play It Soft Huggable Lipcolour ($20.00 for 0.11 oz.) is described as a “bright coral red.” It’s a medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a light shine. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and didn’t look streaky. The formula really shined here, because that gel consistency kept it from bunching up like it might in a more emollient formula. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was hydrating over time.

Kat Von D Mother Everlasting Liquid Lipstick ($20.00 for 0.22 fl. oz.) is described as a “dusty mauve pink.” It’s a lightly brightened, medium-dark pink with cooler undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage (almost opaque) that went on smoothly and evenly, but the dry down seemed to emphasize the the natural texture of the lips a little more than other shades, like Double Dare . The color lasted for nearly eight hours on me and was slightly drying after six and a half hours of wear. Colour Pop Thirsty (LE, $5.00) is glossier. Kat Von D Bauhau5 (P, $20.00) is darker, brighter. MAC Nouvelle Vogue (LE, $16.00) is lighter, glossier. MAC Flat Out Fabulous (P, $16.00) is darker, brighter, cooler. Milani Hot Pink Rage (P, $5.49) is lighter, brighter, glossier. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . FORMULA SUMMARY | Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipstick ($20.00 for 0.22 fl. oz.) is supposed to be a “long-wear, full coverage liquid lipstick with a smooth, matte finish.” Of the liquid lipsticks on the market that go and have a full dry-down, Kat Von D’s formula remains my favorite, as it is the easiest to apply with the kindest learning curve and lasts awhile. Some shades are more drying than others, but typically they don’t get drying until after five to six hours of wear. They often wear anywhere from six to ten hours, depending on what you’ve had to eat or drink during the day. This formula is thin but not watery, has a longer dry down than most liquid lipsticks (but I noticed some of the newer shades dried to a mostly dry finish faster), and layers better than most (you can touch-up or add a second layer for more coverage). It takes about a minute for it to mostly set, but it will remain a little tacky in places for up to three minutes so you’ll want to avoid pressing your lips together if it doesn’t seem totally dry initially. There isn’t a noticeable scent or taste. If you don’t mind the trade-off between very long, near-pristine wear and being drying, it’s worth checking out. As a bonus, these also come with one of the most generous amounts of products within the realm of liquid lipsticks! 205 29 Double Dare 205 29 Double Dare A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Kat Von D Beauty Sephora Brazil QVC Sephora (Australia) 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total 127 31 Mother 127 31 Mother A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Kat Von D Beauty Sephora Brazil QVC Sephora (Australia) 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 92% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""MAC Extra Dimension Eyeshadows Reviews, Photos, & Swatches (Part 3) (2015) Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 25, 2015 April 25, 2015 MAC Extra Dimension Eyeshadow Here are the next five, now-permanent shades of MAC Extra Dimension Eyeshadow ($20.00 for 0.04 oz.). According to MAC, it’s a formula that ranges from “sheer crystallized light” to a “highly polished metallic effect” that “lasts up to [six] hours.” Make sure to read part one for an overview of the formula. Smoky Mauve is also being added to the permanent range, but I do not have that one at this time. MAC Silver Dawn Extra Dimension Eyeshadow ($20.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as a “dirty grey mauve.” It’s a warm-toned, taupe brown with reddish-brown undertones and a frosted finish. It had semi-sheer, lighter color payoff when applied dry that wore well for six hours, while it was slightly darker (and cooler-toned) with full coverage applied damp and stayed on well for eight hours. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . MAC Silver Sun Extra Dimension Eyeshadow ($20.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as a “mid-tone dirty sea foam green.” It’s a muted, medium-dark green with warm undertones and a frosted, slightly metallic, finish. It had semi-sheer coverage that wore well for six hours dry. It had mostly opaque pigmentation when applied damp and wore well for eight hours. It seems exactly the same as the originally released version, but the swatch seemed to catch light as it appears less metallic–I double checked, though, and they are really the same. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . MAC Stolen Moment Extra Dimension Eyeshadow ($20.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as a “dark taupe.” It’s a dark taupe brown with warm undertones and a frosted, metallic sheen. It had good color payoff dry, though it appeared warmer, while damp application was fully opaque and richer-looking. It wore well for six hours dry, eight hours damp. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . MAC Stylishly Merry Extra Dimension Eyeshadow ($20.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as a “mid-tone dusty violet.” It’s a medium-dark pink with lighter violet shimmer and an overall frosted finish. It had semi-sheer pigmentation applied dry, and the color lasted for five and a half hours on me. Applied damp, it was mostly opaque and wore well for seven and a half hours. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . MAC Sweet Heat Extra Dimension Eyeshadow ($20.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as a “bright peach champagne.” It’s a light-medium, peachy beige with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff that stayed on well for six and a half hours when applied dry, while damp application yielded full coverage that wore well for eight hours.

There is a ninth blush, Damselfly that has been out forever, but it is out of stock and I’m not certain when or if it will be coming back into stock… which I’ve apparently reviewed before (in 2012), so I’ll try to see if I still have it and redo swatches. From what I can tell, the range has gone through a slight packaging and labeling update, but the ingredients don’t seem to have changed from existing shades when compared against the list I have from 2012. Nightingale, Hyacinth, and Lantana are brand new, though!

"[""Anastasia Pure Hollywood Liquid Lipstick Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Feb 01, 2015 February 01, 2015 Anastasia Pure Hollywood Liquid Lipstick Anastasia Pure Hollywood Liquid Lipstick ($20.00 for 0.11 fl. oz.) is a light-medium peach with a hint of pink and an ultra matte finish. Colour Pop Button (P, $5.00) is darker, pinker. Bite Beauty Leche (P, $24.00) is less matte, pinker. Bite Beauty Amaretto (P, $24.00) is darker, less matte. Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics Lament (P, $18.00) is lighter, less matte. MAC Riot House (LE, $16.00) is much lighter. Too Faced Melted Nude (P, $21.00) is slightly darker, less pink. Givenchy Beige Mousseline (101) (P, $36.00) is darker, less matte. See comparison swatches / view dupes . The Liquid Lipstick formula is supposed to have “full coverage” with a “matte finish” that will last “all day.” It’s very pigmented, yet it’s a shade that goes on unevenly with visible streaks initially and seems almost watery when applied. Luckily, it seems to self-level so that as it dries down, the unevenness disappears (so I would recommend not fussing with making it appears perfectly even while it is wet). As it is drying down, it gets very tacky, and you’ll want to ensure you don’t press your lips together while it is drying down, or else color will lift. The consistency is more unforgiving in this lighter shade than American Doll , and it immediately started to pull into lip lines. This only worsened as the color wore on, even though it had minimal transfer on my coffee cup, but it looked settled and made my lips look cracked after a mere two hours. It was very drying, and it was extremely difficult to wear it past five hours–my lips felt so parched that they hurt. 89 86 Pure Hollywood 89 86 Pure Hollywood C- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Beautylish Ulta Cult Beauty DermStore Macy's Net-A-Porter Skinstore.com b-glowing Sephora (Australia) Beauty Bay (UK) Beauty Brands Dillard's Anastasia 6 Product 9 Pigmentation 7 Texture 6 Longevity 4.5 Application 72% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Kat Von D Adora Studded Kiss Lipstick Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Jul 18, 2014 July 18, 2014 Kat Von D Adora Studded Kiss Lipstick Kat Von D Adora Studded Kiss Lipstick ($21.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as a “metallic candy apple red.” It’s a brightened, medium red with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish with a metallic shimmer. NARS Mondore (LE, $25.00) is more muted, darker, no shimmer. Estee Lauder Emotional (140) (P, $30.00) is browner, glossier, no shimmer. Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics Role Play (P, $18.00) is darker. NARS Majella (P, $25.00) has no metallic shimmer. Milani Cherry Crave (P, $5.49) is brighter. Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics Super NSFW (P, $18.00) is warmer. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Kat Von D’s redone their lipstick formula, and it’s been repackaged with a glossy, black studded cap and base. It’s decreased slightly in size (0.11 oz. to 0.10 oz.), but the packaging is a lot sturdier than before. The packaging is quite light, though, and the plastic felt a bit thin though not to the point where it seemed fragile. I purchased a few shades when they launched earlier this week, and I was intending to review two or three at a time, but Adora lasted so long that it will probably take a day to test each shade! Adora topped in at ten hours of wear and lasted through two meals and two cups of coffee; even at nine hours, it was only a little bit faded. It’s worth noting right away that the metallic finishes have a different texture/consistency (from what I can tell) compared to the (shimmer-free) matte finishes. The consistency has a light creaminess that keeps it from tugging on the lips, and it applied with even, opaque color coverage. The formula is vanilla-scented to me (though Sephora describes it as creme brulee) but has no discernible taste. I worried that this was going to be drying, but it seemed to maintain the state of my lips from start to finish, so it never really felt hydrating, but it wasn’t drying and my lips felt fine after wearing nothing but this for ten hours. It’s not transfer-proof, though if you blot once or twice, it is almost transfer-proof from thereon. I didn’t experience any bleeding or feathering with the richer red shade of Adora. The reformulated Adora seems slightly drier and less metallic compared to the original, though the reformulation wears a lot longer on me. 86 40 Adora 86 40 Adora A Discontinued N/A Affiliate Links Sephora Kat Von D Beauty Sephora Brazil QVC Sephora (Australia) 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 93% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Hourglass Mood Exposure Ambient Lighting Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Reviews Jan 30, 2014 January 30, 2014 Hourglass Mood Exposure Ambient Lighting Blush Hourglass Mood Exposure Ambient Lighting Blush ($35.00 for 0.15 oz.) is described as a “soft plum.” It’s a rosy plum with subtle warm undertones and a satiny finish. In the pan, it looks more neutral-toned, but when everything is blended and applied, I don’t get any of that neutral (let alone cool) undertone coming through. MAC Lavish Living (LE, $25.00) is darker, more plum-hued, more shimmery. Giorgio Armani Light Rose (LE) is browner, less rose/plum. NARS Lovejoy (P, $29.00) is much darker overall, but applied with a softer application, it is similar–just a little more shimmery. bareMinerals The Indecent Proposal (P, $22.00) is darker, less shimmery. See comparison swatches . The texture is incredibly soft, finely-milled, and silky, so it blends beautifully on the skin. Though it seems a little powdery in the pan (excess builds up in the corners), it doesn’t look powdery or cakey on the skin. In fact, the powder almost melts against the skin, because it looks natural and smooth; very much that “seamless, soft-focus” look Hourglass was after. This particular shade has a soft sheen that gives skin a glowing, healthy finish but doesn’t emphasize pores or imperfections. It had good color payoff that was both buildable and blendable. Mood Exposure wore as well as the other shades–eight full hours before there were signs of fading along the edges. The quality seems comparable across the board from the five (of six) I’ve tried and tested now. P.S. — As soon as my order of Ethereal Glow arrives and I’ve written up a review for it, I will do a round-up with some overall thoughts and commentary! 146 42 Mood Exposure 146 42 Mood Exposure A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Hourglass Space NK Bergdorf Goodman Net-A-Porter Barneys Sephora Brazil Space NK (UK) 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 93% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

FORMULA OVERVIEW | Makeup Geek Eyeshadow ($6.00 for 0.064 oz.) is supposed to be a “highly-pigmented” powder eyeshadows. They come in a variety of finishes and shades, and the range has some winners but more than a few misses, too, so your mileage may vary from shade to shade. The formula tends to be softer and a little more powdery/dusty as they are not as firmly pressed into their pans, but they aren’t typically crumbly or so loose that they are prone to breakage. I find the more shimmery shades to be the most consistent in pigmentation, blendability, and wear, while the more neutral-hued matte shades are often finely-milled, blendable, and easy to use. The brighter pops of color, both shimmer and more matte, can run the gamut on quality. Some shades are better built-up than immediately opaque, which can suit some application styles better. The wear tends to fall between seven and eight hours as some shades are more prone to fading as a result of the dustier texture. (Note: this applies to their standard powder formula, not their Foiled line, which is a different formulation.) 26 5 Anarchy 26 5 Anarchy B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beauty Bay (UK) Makeup Geek 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 88% Total 38 30 Casino 38 30 Casino A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beauty Bay (UK) Makeup Geek 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 92% Total 34 21 Sin City 34 21 Sin City A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beauty Bay (UK) Makeup Geek 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total 36 4 Venom 36 4 Venom A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beauty Bay (UK) Makeup Geek 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It is lighter, less pink, and cooler-toned compared to Berry Pop , though applied they look more similar than dissimilar! Guerlain Cherry (02) (LE, $42.00) is a cream blush and has less of a sheen. Too Faced Jingle All the Way Blush (LE) is more shimmery. Tarte Dollface (P, $26.00) is lighter, more matte. Urban Decay Quickie (LE) is brighter, matte. NARS Angelika (P, $29.00) is more matte. MAC I’m the One (LE, $21.00) is cooler-toned. MAC Florida (LE, $21.00) is brighter, darker, and a cream product. See comparison swatches . Plum Pop has an incredibly soft but smooth, even color application, and it delivers color as intense or as sheer as your heart desires. Deeper skin tones won’t feel like they’re spending ten minutes to layer on the product while fairer complexions can easily use a lighter touch/brush and blend and sheer away the product with ease. The finish is luminous, glowy, but very natural; it looks like a cream blush when applied–never powdery–and applies like one, as the way it blends and smooths over the skin is incredible. Plum Pop lasted well for eight hours on my skin before starting to fade away along the edges. I’ve spotted them online at Nordstrom as well as Sephora .

Tarte Darling (LE, $26.00) is darker, less shimmery. bareMinerals The Adrenaline Rush (LE, $29.00) is lighter. MAC Cream Soda (LE, $21.00) is more orange, lighter. Estee Lauder Sensuous Rose (LE, $28.00) is darker, less warm-toned. Bobbi Brown Nude Peach (P, $26.00) See comparison swatches . The texture was interesting; it was soft, yet there was a slight difference between the light beige (“Dim”) and the more coral-hued shade, as the latter felt a little stiffer, but together, I didn’t really notice a difference in texture. It had true-to-pan color payoff, which could be applied at true intensity or more softly, and then blended out to whatever desired sheerness one wanted. The color is on the lighter end of the spectrum, so it is a shade better suited for lighter complexions. It just barely shows up on my medium complexion, and I’m about NC25/NC30 for reference. I get just a little warmth and color, which can work, but it’ll depend on what you’re after in terms of blush colors. The texture didn’t emphasize pores and had a fair amount of sheen. It wore well for eight hours before starting to show signs of fading. 130 37 Dim Infusion 130 37 Dim Infusion A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Hourglass Space NK Bergdorf Goodman Net-A-Porter Barneys Sephora Brazil Space NK (UK) 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 93% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . The formula is described as a “luxurious powder blush” with “silky smooth application” that yields a “radiant glow” and a “delicate flush of color.” The latter seems to suggest a sheerer formulation. The texture was rather stiff in the pan; the kind of texture where little powder comes off the surface, so I had to use a denser brush and really jab at the surface to get enough color to show up on my skin tone. Once on, the color and finish are gorgeous–a really glowing, luminous sheen that doesn’t emphasize pores or even come off as shimmery. This shade wore for six and a half hours on me before noticeably fading. 3 11 Hibiscus 3 11 Hibiscus C- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Black Opal 7 Product 8 Pigmentation 6 Texture 7 Longevity 4 Application 71% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Hourglass Luminous Flush Ambient Lighting Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Jan 29, 2014 January 29, 2014 Hourglass Luminous Flush Ambient Lighting Blush Hourglass Luminous Flush Ambient Lighting Blush ($35.00 for 0.15 oz.) is described as a “champagne rose.” It’s a pink-tinged coral with warm undertones and a golden shimmer-sheen finish. Depending on the lighting, it looked pinker and less pink/more true coral. I could walk into one room and see the pink tones, and then walk into another room and lose them almost entirely. I think if you have stronger pink undertones (compared to my yellow), it may stay pinker-toned on you, but the undertone is definitely warm. Clinique Peach Pop (02) (P, $21.00) is darker. Tarina Tarantino Feather (P, $25.00) is lighter. Tarte Crave (LE, $26.00) is darker, pinker. NARS Day Dream (LE, $29.00) is slightly darker. Too Faced Melt Into Spring (LE) is darker, less shimmery. Physicians Formula Warm (P, $11.99) is similar. MAC Supercontinental (LE, $21.00) is warmer. See comparison swatches . This shade seems to fall in-between Diffused Heat and Radiant Magenta ; they’re not dupes when swatched, but on, they look more similar than dissimilar. The powder had a soft, smooth texture that wasn’t too powdery (and less powdery than others in the range). It blended effortlessly on the skin, so it was easy to apply and nearly impossible to overdo! The color coverage seemed true-to-pan, and the color could be built up in thin layers or applied more intensely from the get-go. I didn’t see any visible sparkle, just a satiny sheen that gave a glow and sheen to the skin without emphasizing pores. The color wore well for eight and a half hours before beginning to decline in intensity. 167 38 Luminous Flush 167 38 Luminous Flush A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Hourglass Space NK Bergdorf Goodman Net-A-Porter Barneys Sephora Brazil Space NK (UK) 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 96% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""YSL Fuchsia Desinvolte (01) Baby Doll Kiss and Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Mar 06, 2014 March 06, 2014 YSL Fuchsia Desinvolte (01) Baby Doll Kiss and Blush Earlier this month, YSL offered an early debut of two shades of the YSL Baby Doll Kiss and Blush ($40.00 for 0.33 fl. oz.) range, and I bought both shades that were available. They’ve since released twelve shades, though they say online exclusive at the moment. The official release date is later on in April. I’ll be reviewing both shades I bought, and this is the first one up! YSL Fuchsia Desinvolte (01) Baby Doll Kiss and Blush ($40.00 for 0.33 fl. oz.) is a bright, medium fuchsia with cool, blue undertones. Milani Love Potion (07) (LE, $7.99) is a powder, lighter. Clinique Berry Pop (03) (P, $21.00) is a powder, slightly warmer. NARS Coeur Battant (LE, $29.00) is a powder, brighter. Tom Ford Beauty Narcissist (LE, $55.00) is a powder, more shimmery. See comparison swatches . ( Here are some possible dupes for this shade as a lip color. The new formula is supposed to work on cheeks and lips, and the texture is described as an “air whipped mousse” and has a “soft matte finish.” The color is supposed to be buildable. Now, I’m often unimpressed by two-in-one products, because it usually doesn’t excel in both areas, just one (or worst case scenario, neither), but YSL has something special here. It’s packaged in a square, glass bottle with a long, cylindrical cap, so it looks nail polish-esque, but when you twist and open, it is a little reminiscent of the Glossy Stains . The applicator is tapered and spongy with a fair amount of give without being floppy. The texture was very, very different from Glossy Stains as it never turns thick. Instead, the consistency is thin and felt like a cross between velvet and gel, and it turns into a creamy powder as it blends with the skin and dries to a satin-matte finish. On lips, it stayed rather glossy before eventually wearing down, but I waited before shooting the lip swatch photos, expecting it to dry fairly matte, yet it didn’t. I felt like I had a workable amount of time to apply and blend the color as a blush, and once it’s on, it stayed on for nine hours. It was easy to pat and blend on the skin, whether bare or over foundation, and though it’s quite pigmented and a little goes a long way, it was very forgiving. This shade seemed to stain my cheeks slightly, as there was some pinkness even after I removed the color, and it did the same on lips (but a little more staining). When I wore it as a lip color, it lasted well for six and a half hours. More surprising was that my lips weren’t dried out–I wouldn’t describe this as hydrating really, but it kept my lips feeling about the same over time. It does have a sweet, mango and grape scent (reminds me of Glossy Stains ), though it seemed subtler than some of their other lipstick formulas (like Rouge Volupte ).

"['Makeup Look: Warm Neutral Eyes with Bold Red Lips Looks May 31, 2014 May 31, 2014 bareMinerals The Nude Beach Makeup Look The inspiration behind this look was to pair warmer neutrals with a bold, rich red lip. I also wanted to try using a sheer black gloss over red, and the neutrals in bareMinerals The Nude Beach Eyeshadow Palette seemed like a good way to start. Eyes For the eyeshadows, I used shades from the bareMinerals The Nude Beach Eyeshadow Palette . I started by applying bareMinerals Nude Beach Eyeshadow to the inner third of the lid and lightly diffused towards the middle of the lid. Next, I applied bareMinerals Tan Lines Eyeshadow to the outer third of the lid and lightly blended it towards the middle of the lid. I patted on bareMinerals In the Buff Eyeshadow on the middle of the lid between the inner and outer thirds of the lid. In the crease, I applied bareMinerals Santorini Eyeshadow and blended upwards about halfway between the crease and the brow bone. I lightly dusted bareMinerals Pure Eyeshadow on the brow bone to highlight. For the lower lash line, I applied Marc Jacobs Blacquer Highliner Gel Crayon on the waterline and slightly on the lower lash line, but I primarily used bareMinerals Skinny Dip Eyeshadow to accent the lower lash line. Face I mixed two shades of Guerlain Parure de Lumiere Foundation with half of a pump of Kevyn Aucoin Celestial Skin Liquid Illuminating Emulsion as my base. For blush, I applied Becca Guava Beach Tint on the apples of cheeks. I set with Urban Decay Naked Loose Finishing Powder . Lips I applied Dolce & Gabbana Scarlett (602) Classic Cream Lipstick on the lips, and then I applied Smashbox black Tied Be Legendary Lipgloss on top with a separate lip brush.

Dupes by Palette You can know get all dupes for shades within a single palette, like Viseart Boheme Dream , all at once instead of searching shade-by-shade; you can also refine the results to specific price points or by brand to compare to your stash more “at a glance” for a palette. Palette vs. Palette You can now compare any two palettes that we have in the database to see if any shades from Palette A are known dupes from Palette B (or vice versa), so you can see how much overlap, if any, there might be. (Note: if the exact same shade, like MAC Carbon, actually repeats in both palettes, that will not come up as a dupe.) You can compare duos, quads, palettes, and even sets (like an eyeliner set). If you just want to compare any two specific shades, you can already do that through our compare any two swatches tool here .']",f4987b334a3d4dc380d7cee04876648d8cd4bda0,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/the-dupe-list-dupes-by-palette-palette-vs-palette-comparison-tool/,['2016-05-10 00:00:00']

The texture is soft, finely-milled but not powdery. It blends well if you use a light touch, but I noticed that it has a tendency to stick where it’s placed once it is buffed into the skin to a degree. Argyle lasted well without fading or becoming patchy for a solid ten hours, so it is indeed long-wearing. It removed easily, though, with makeup remover, whereas a traditional stain would still leave something behind, so I wouldn’t describe this as a cheek stain, but it was an exceptionally long-wearing powder blush. 225 40 Argyle 225 40 Argyle A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Amazon DermStore Kohl's LookFantastic Sephora (Australia) FeelUnique ASOS theBalm 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 97% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Formula Overview $54.00/0.10 oz. - $540.00 Per Ounce The formula is supposed have an ""ultra-creamy texture"" with ""smooth application"" that will deliver ""pure color."" The lipstick tends to have semi-opaque to opaque coverage with a natural to luminous finish with some shades with very fine pearl and others with more metallic shimmer. The consistency is typically creamy, lightweight, and has moderate slip, which makes it comfortable to wear and to apply but is not the most long-lasting lipstick formula. The wear tends to range between four and six hours with some shades performing above and below that range. There\'s a vanilla scent but no discernible taste.

"[""Givenchy Blanc Satin, Bleu Soie, Gris Organza Ombre Couture Cream Eyeshadows Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews May 27, 2014 May 27, 2014 Givenchy Blanc Satin (1) Ombre Couture Cream Eyeshadow Givenchy Ombre Couture Cream Eyeshadow ($23.00 for 0.14 oz.) is a more recently released cream eyeshadow that’s supposed to be “creamy, waterproof, [and] long-lasting.” It’s a cream-to-powder formula, so it feels like a cream initially but dries down to a powder finish. Givenchy actually states that this lasts for 16 hours, which is quite a tall order. I reviewed three shades here , and I have a few more to share with you now. Givenchy Blanc Satin (1) Ombre Couture Cream Eyeshadow ($23.00 for 0.14 oz.) is described as a “top coat.” It’s very much as described: a sheer, sparkling top coat that can be layered over whatever your heart desires. The consistency is thin, lightly creamy, and spreads easily, so you can apply an even layer of sparkle over another cream or powder eyeshadow. The sparkle is finer, though larger than shimmer. Worn alone, the sparkles don’t gather in my creases, but I do have noticeable fall out within eight hours. Dior Atlantique #1 (LE) is similar. Divergent Transform (LE) is warmer. Marc Jacobs Beauty Stagelight (302) (LE, $32.00) is similar. Dior Golden Snow #3 (LE) is more pigmented. MAC Bleuluxe #1 (P) is more pigmented. Chanel Fantasme (P, $36.00) is more pigmented. Bobbi Brown Tinsel (LE) is similar. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Givenchy Bleu Soie (4) Ombre Couture Cream Eyeshadow ($23.00 for 0.14 oz.) is described as a “marine blue.” It’s a dark, navy blue that leans slightly purple with a satiny finish. This wasn’t too shimmery, and it had fairly good color payoff, though it needed two layers for fully opaque color. It wore well for ten and a half hours before creasing on me. NARS UbangiU (P, $25.00) is less purple. MAC Bleuluxe #4 (P) is powder. Bobbi Brown Blue Onyx (LE) is darker. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Givenchy Gris Organza (7) Ombre Couture Cream Eyeshadow ($23.00 for 0.14 oz.) is described as a “grey.” It’s a medium-dark, cool-toned gray with silver sparkle. It had really good pigmentation, which was opaque in a single stroke, but it was creamy enough that it could be sheered out easily, if desired. This shade lasted for ten hours before it showed signs of creasing. theBalm #26 (P, $6.50) is darker, powder. Tom Ford Beauty Ice Queen #4 (P) is a powder. NARS Transvaal (P, $25.00) is less cool-toned. MAC Typographic (P, $15.00) is darker, warmer, powder. MAC Nehru (P, $15.00) is a powder. Chanel Gris Exquis (LE, $28.50) is a powder.

"[""Givenchy Beige Caraco, Beige Deshabille, Rose Ruban Le Rouge Lipsticks Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Jun 01, 2014 June 01, 2014 Givenchy Beige Caraco (107) Le Rouge Givenchy Le Rouge ($36.00 for 0.12 oz. each) recently released twelve new shades in the range, and I purchased all twelve through Sephora. I’m working my way through testing each one, so you should reviews sooner rather than later! The formula is described as having a semi-matte finish and intense, “one stroke” color. Each lipstick is housed in a tube that is encased in a thin layer of leather. They are rose-scented with no discernible taste. You can see all the shades I’ve reviewed previously here . Here are reviews for the first three I’ve tested: Givenchy Beige Caraco (107) Le Rouge ($36.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as “medium peach beige.” It’s a slightly-lighter-than-medium peach with beige and warm undertones. The finish is luminous with a soft sheen. The consistency was lightweight, very creamy and smooth, but it had a little more slip than darker and more mid-tone shades in the range. It was mostly opaque, and for as much creaminess/slip this had, it only very, very lightly showed “lines” if you pressed your lips together. This shade lasted four hours on me. Too Faced Melted Nude (P, $21.00) is lighter, more matte. NARS Torres del Paine (LE, $25.00) is rosier. Givenchy Beige Mousseline (101) (P, $36.00) is lighter, more beige. Urban Decay Naked 2 (P, $22.00) is more beige. Edward Bess Forbidden Flower (P, $32.00) is brighter. NARS Isola Bella (P, $25.00) is more orange. NARS Biscayne Park (P, $25.00) is similar. MAC Yash (P, $16.00) is more beige, more matte. MAC Wholesome (LE, $16.00) is lighter, yellower in tone. MAC Freckletone (P, $16.00) is darker but sheerer. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Givenchy Beige Deshabille (108) Le Rouge ($36.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as “muted light peach beige.” It’s a light-medium, peachy beige with subtle, warm undertones. It had mostly opaque pigmentation, but it is one of the sheerer shades I’ve come across within the formula. It is a lot less forgiving applied as well; one of the qualities I really like about the Le Rouge formula is how much smoother lips usually look with it on, but my lips look almost crumbly at times with this shade. A lot of lighter shades, such as this one, have similar issues, but it is always disappointing when a brand doesn’t improve upon it. It has a bit more slip than average, and it does show “lines” if you press your lips together. This shade only lasted three hours on me. MAC Close Contact (LE, $16.00) is slightly rosier. MAC Pure Decoration (LE, $16.00) is lighter, yellower. MAC Peachstock (P, $16.00) is a bit lighter. MAC Nearly Nude (LE, $16.00) is similar. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Givenchy Rose Ruban (211) Le Rouge ($36.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as a “pale pink.” It’s a light-medium pink with neutral-to-warm undertones–it almost has a gray-ish cast. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but it suffered from the same problems as Beige Deshabille did–uneven, not smooth, appearance once on, and it, too, will show some “lines” where the color will gather on itself if you press your lips together. This color wore well for three hours when I tested it. MAC Sublime Pleasure (LE, $16.00) is sheerer. MAC Flair for Finery (LE, $16.00) is sheerer, lighter. theBalm Milly (P) is darker, more matte. MAC Fun Finds (LE, $16.00) is lighter, more matte. MAC Myth (P, $16.00) is lighter, more matte. MAC Innocence Beware (LE, $16.00) is similar.

"['Round-up: NARS Dual Intensity Eyeshadows Overview & Thoughts Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jun 10, 2014 June 10, 2014 NARS Dual Intensity Eyeshadows There are twelve shades of NARS Dual Intensity Eyeshadow ($29.00 for 0.05 oz.), and I’ve now finished reviewing all of them. In general, I like them; I think the textures are soft and smooth for nearly all of the shades. If you apply them with a dampened brush, color payoff is quite good and wear is about average. They’re blendable and easy to apply with no fall out. They’re supposed to be sheer when applied dry, opaque when applied with a dampened brush, and this is sometimes true, sometimes not. A couple were very sheer, and a few were quite pigmented dry. If you aren’t someone who likes to use their eyeshadows wet, then I would say to look elsewhere, but if you like the idea of two types of finishes and color coverage, you may like these. >> See all the shades swatched here! << BEST PERFORMING: Himalia (A-), Phoebe (A-), Subra (A-) WORST PERFORMING: Desdemona (B+), Europa (C-) WARM-TONED: Andromeda (B+), Dione (B+), Europa (C-), Himalia (A-), Lysithea (B), Phoebe (A-), Subra (A-), Sycorax (B-) COOL-TONED: Callisto (B+), Cassiopeia (B), Giove (B+) LEAST SHIMMERY: Europa (C-), Sycorax (B-) PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Callisto (B+), Subra (A-) Reviews, Photos, Swatches Andromeda (B+) Callisto (B+) Cassiopeia (B) Desdemona (B+) Dione (B+) Europa (C-) Giove (B+) Himalia (A-) Lysithea (B) Phoebe (A-) Subra (A-) Sycorax (B-)']",d63c8237c61d30ba4842f93e5bfce752b81c552a,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/round-nars-dual-intensity-eyeshadows-overview-thoughts/,['2014-06-10 00:00:00']

It is lightly cool-toned but may look more obviously cool-toned if you have cool, pink undertones. It had fully opaque pigmentation, and the color went on evenly and smoothly. This shade was not quite as creamy as others in the launch, but it didn’t drag during application. It lasted for almost eight hours and left behind a stain, and it was a little drying for the last two or three hours. Kat Von D Hellbent (P, $21.00) is darker, less pink. Too Faced Melted Ruby (P, $21.00) is brighter, glossier. Chanel La Precieuse (317) (LE, $34.00) is similar. MAC Glam (DC, $16.00) is a smidgen brighter. MAC RiRi Woo (LE, $16.00) is darker, more matte. NARS Luxembourg (P, $25.00) is lighter. MAC Ronnie Red (LE, $16.00) is similar. MAC MAC Red (P, $16.00) is similar. See comparison swatches / view dupes . MAC Fashion Revival Lipstick ($16.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as a “deep raspberry.” It’s a dark, muted raspberry with a semi-matte finish. The color coverage was very nearly opaque (hint of my lip freckle coming through) with even color application. The consistency was lightly creamy, easy to apply, and lasted for almost seven hours. It was neither drying nor hydrating. Gucci Beauty Bitter Grape (P, $39.00) is more shimmery, sheerer. NARS Vera (P, $32.00) is brighter, redder. Marc Jacobs Beauty Cabaret (146) (LE, $30.00) is a touch lighter. Inglot #293 Lipstick Cream (P, $12.00) is much glossier. Illamasqua Shard (P, $24.00) is more matte. See comparison swatches / view dupes . MAC Heroine Lipstick ($16.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as a “vibrant violet.” It’s a bold, magenta purple with cool, pink undertones and a semi-matte finish. It has mostly full color coverage, is lightly creamy and applies evenly, while the wear is about six hours on me, plus a stain. This is part of the permanent range, so I’ve reviewed it previously, and I didn’t retest it this launch. See comparison swatches / view dupes . MAC La Vie En Rouge Lipstick ($16.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as a “bright orange coral.” It’s a brightened, medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It’s the kind of shade that’s so bright that it plays tricks on your eyes (stare at this for awhile, then stare at something neutral!). It had a lightly creamy consistency that wasn’t heavy, slightly clingy (but not in an uncomfortable way), and lasted for six and a half hours (probably wearable until about eight before you really needed to reapply). It was a little drying towards the end. Gucci Beauty Hibiscus Thrill (P, $39.00) is sheerer, lighter. NARS Kelly (P, $32.00) is lighter. NARS Grace (P, $32.00) is glossier.

It takes two to three hours for the finish to wear down to something more matte, which is really the only “downside” to the formula–it’s supposed to be matte, but there’s a definite shine to it. To get more of a matte finish from the beginning, I would recommend lightly blotting. The consistency is creamy and stays that way for a few hours, so while it’s not transfer-proof, there’s so much pigmentation that it still wears long and well. There is a slight scent to it that I can’t quite place–a little herbal-y? perhaps that’s subtle and I can only somewhat catch a whiff of it when I smell the applicator.

It had mostly opaque color coverage, and it applied fairly well (though not perfectly, I didn’t notice the imperfections at a normal viewing distance, only close-up). The consistency was lightly creamy and didn’t tug at the lips, but the finish isn’t truly matte as a result. It wore well for six and a half hours and left a fuchsia-like stain behind. It was a little drying over time. MAC Punk Couture (LE, $16.00) is lighter, warmer. Illamasqua Kontrol (P, $24.00) is more muted. See comparison swatches / view dupes . MAC Runner Lipstick ($16.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as a “burgundy [with a Matte finish].” It’s a medium-dark, burgundy red with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation, but it didn’t look even when applied. There was something about it that looked almost grainy. The color itself wore really long (over six hours), but it was somewhat drying towards the last half of wear. I found it particularly troublesome to apply it from the tube, as it seemed prone to skipping. Tom Ford Beauty Black Dahlia (10) (LE, $50.00) is cooler-toned. MAC Fixed on Drama (LE, $16.00) is similar. MAC Endless Drama (P, $18.00) is darker. MAC Sin (P, $16.00) is similar. See comparison swatches / view dupes . MAC Stunner Lipstick ($16.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as a “clean red [with a Matte finish].” It’s a brightened, medium red with cool, pink undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had nearly full color coverage with a lightly creamy texture that was easy to apply. This shade wore well for six hours and left a stain behind. It was a little drying but the least drying of the three. MAC Kinky (LE, $16.00) is slightly warmer. Bite Beauty Fraise (P, $24.00) is lighter. NARS Deadly Catch (LE, $26.00) is slightly darker. MAC Damn Glamorous (LE, $16.00) is pinker. Kat Von D Hexagram (P, $21.00) is more matte. MAC Ruby (LE, $16.00) is glossier. Too Faced Melted Ruby (P, $21.00) is glossier, brighter. MAC RiRi Woo (LE, $16.00) is cooler-toned. MAC Ruby Woo (P, $16.00) is cooler-toned. MAC Ronnie Red (LE, $16.00) is similar. MAC MAC Red (P, $16.00) is cooler-toned.

"[""Bite Beauty Lush Lip Wipes Review & Photos Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Aug 28, 2014 August 28, 2014 Bite Beauty Lush Lip Wipes Bite Beauty Lush Lip Wipes ($12.00 for 10; $22.00 for 30) are supposed to “remove color, replenish, and mattify.” The moistened wipe says it will “soothe and hydrate while removing your old lip color.” Even if this was an amazing lip color remover, it’s a product that really only makes sense in a more in-case-of-emergencies situation where you just have to remove your lip color on the go, but you’re paying for the convenience. I didn’t like the feel of the product, its efficacy, the size of the wipe, or the way it left my lips feeling after removing the color. Each wipe is about 4.15? x 1.65? — it really is a lip wipe! — but the size is awkward to hold/use, because there’s not a lot of free edge for you to hold while removing the lip color. To remove lip color, I needed a few swipes — I find removal easier and gentler with Neutrogena’s and MAC’s Wipes (both the ones I have at home). I use MAC Wipes for removing lip color when I’m swatching, and it’s the best for removing stubborn lip color with little effort (or wear/tear on the lips), whereas this felt like it required more work and wiping. My lips felt dry (almost puckered–very textured when I looked at them in the mirror), sticky, and a little raw, after using, so it absolutely didn’t soothe or hydrate for me. The wipe itself was well-moistened, but it seems like it has more slip and a smoother surface, so it doesn’t grip the lip color and lift it off as effectively as other remover wipes I’ve tried. I used five of the ten wipes on various lip products ranging from sheer gloss to more opaque, tacky gloss to beige lipstick to deep red lipstick, and I used one on bare lips. I think there’s room for the convenience of makeup removing wipes, but I’m not sure why these are so much more expensive than even mid-end full-sized, makeup remover wipes (MAC at $0.44/wipe, though if you buy the 100-bulk pack they are $0.29/wipe, Estee Lauder at $0.44/wipe). Bite Beauty’s product pricing is mid to high-end, so it should be priced similarly. Instead, they’re $1.20/wipe or $0.73/wipe if you purchase the larger pack (the larger pack would be more comparable to the $0.44/wipe packs from MAC and Estee Lauder). I think that even considering the individual packaging costs, these still seem overpriced (relative to Bite Beauty’s price point on other products) given that Bite’s wipes are much, much smaller and yet they’re 66% more expensive. Even MAC has a 30-pack demi-sized option for $10 ($0.30/wipe) for travel. The pricing on these reflects a higher-end, luxury price point, e.g. Koh Gen Do’s wipes, which work out to be $1.30/wipe (full-sized, though), which makes the pricing inconsistent with Bite Beauty’s product range. Note, I’m not saying these should be priced like a mass market brand’s wipes, but they should be more in line with brand’s pricing range, and it seems these fall outside of it. I really enjoy a lot of Bite Beauty’s products, but this was a flop for me as far as the actual product went. It just didn’t remove lip color that easily, and it didn’t make my lips feel better, hydrated, or soothed after using. There was also a weird, sweet but chemical-y taste. 9 82 Lush Lip Wipes 9 82 Lush Lip Wipes - Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 0 Product 0 Pigmentation 0 Texture 0 Longevity 0 Application 0% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"['Lipstick Queen Silver Screen Launches Affiliate Links Year: 2014 Launches Sep 07, 2014 September 07, 2014 Lipstick Queen Silver Screen Hot on the heels (and we mean high heels!) of Velvet Rope comes Silver Screen, the sexiest, sassiest lipstick to date from Lipstick Queen. Founder Poppy King explains “While Velvet Rope paid homage to Hollywood glamour with its rich velvet finish, Silver Screen pays homage to its sassiness. Its rich yet wet feel is inspired by the slinky ladies of the silver screen. If this lipstick could walk it would sashay. My most vixen lipstick to date!” The term ‘silver screen’ comes from the actual silver content embedded into the material that was used in the early days of the motion picture industry. The screens had a highly reflective surface that was extremely flattering to the women up there on the screen. The texture of the new Silver Screen lipsticks has been designed to have this exact same effect on each and every woman wearing it; enshrine her look with a flirty and sultry finish. This glossy, wet-look effect is achieved with a high percentage of an innovative new active ingredient Pomegranate Sterols. This 100% natural active, derived from the pomegranate fruit, improves the barrier-function of the lips, keeping them soft and hydrated for longer, whilst also ensuring the intensely glossy look and feel of the lipstick. The formulation is further enhanced with anti-oxidant vitamin E, moisturizing plant oils, beeswax and skin-perfecting vitamin A, which ensure lips stay nourished and comfortable all day long. And just as with Velvet Rope, Silver Screen contains a high quality peppermint oil which releases its invigorating natural scent upon application. The palate is a kaleidoscope of slinky siren shades ranging from a magnetic deep purple to sexy watermelon, to flirty nudes and a seductive wine. Each shade derives its name from an iconic line in a classic movie. Encased in the same stunning packaging as Velvet Rope but this time in silver, Silver Screen is an extraordinary object to own and it feels equally extraordinary to wear. Poppy says “Pulling this out of your handbag feels like pulling out a piece of the Manhattan skyline and the endless possibilities that come with it.” Silver Screen ($50.00) Come Up Chic, vibrant baby rose Made It Mouth-watering deep wine Play It Exotically glamorous hot pink See Me Head-turning, playful peach Stella!

CoverGirl Turquoise Glow (325) (LE, $4.99) is warmer. L’Oreal Endless Sea (P, $7.99) is darker. Make Up For Ever #150 (DC, $20.00) is a lot lighter, less shimmery. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Make Up For Ever S234 Azure Blue Artist Shadow ($21.00 for 0.08 oz.) is a bold, brightened, medium-dark blue-teal with a satin-matte finish. It was intensely pigmented with a soft, smooth texture that felt more like a cream than a powder. The color lasted for nine hours before fading slightly. It did lightly stain the skin but went away after a few hours. Make Up For Ever I-20 (P, $21.00) is more shimmery, cream. Maybelline Never Fade Jade (P, $6.99) is darker. Fyrinnae Gender Bent (P, $6.80) is more shimmery. MAC Cool Heat (LE, $15.00) is more shimmery. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Make Up For Ever I220 Sapphire Artist Shadow ($21.00 for 0.08 oz.) is a navy blue with a subtle, pearly sheen. It had nice color payoff that went on evenly and smoothly. The creamier, more buttery consistency made blending really easy, despite how rich and pigmented the shade was. It wore well for eight and a half hours before fading slightly. Urban Decay Moonshadow (P, $18.00) is lighter, more shimmery. Kat Von D Entombed (P) is brighter. Clinique Massively Midnight (P, $17.00) is similar.

Guerlain Les Ombres de Nuit #3 (LE) is a touch lighter. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Make Up For Ever D104 Black Diamond Artist Shadow ($21.00 for 0.08 oz.) is a rich, deep dark black with silver sparkle. It was incredibly rich in pigment–a little goes a very long way!–and the sparkle actually binds with the underlying color, so the majority of it applies to the lid and stays in place while worn. There is minor fall out but not really noticeable unless I went looking for it. The color lasted for eight and a half hours before showing signs of wear. Too Faced Starry Night (LE, $16.00) is less sparkly. Too Faced Pure Glam (LE, $16.00) is less sparkly. CoverGirl Molten Black (300) (P, $4.99) is cooler-toned.

It’s part of the collaboration with Prabal Gurung, which will launch online on November 20th (in select stores on the 26th). One shade was really nice to work with, while the other needed improvement. At this price point, both shades should hit it out of the park. I also wish these were the equivalent of two full-sized eyeshadows. Satin Ochre (Left) is described as a “soft pale white gold [with a Frost finish].” It’s a warm, golden beige with a frosted sheen. The texture was soft, smooth, and buttery, while the color payoff was mostly opaque. The eyeshadow wore well for eight hours before fading slightly. Chanel Poesie #2 (LE) is more muted. MAC Just Gleaming (LE, $19.50) is more sparkly. theBalm High Tide (LE, $16.00) is similar. Charlotte Tilbury The Rebel #1 (P) is a touch darker. Tom Ford Beauty Nude Dip #1 (LE) is slightly darker.

Satin Ochre (Right) is described as a “coral orange [with a Matte finish].” It’s a light-medium, muted orange with a matte finish. It had a thinner, slightly stiff, consistency that made application more challenging. It tended to stick to skin without wanting to blend easily. This shade started to fade after seven hours of wear.

It was fully opaque after two coats of polish, and it applied smoothly and evenly. I didn’t notice any brush strokes, but the consistency did run a little thick. It didn’t seem to impede application.

"[""Bite Beauty Hazelnut & Rosewood Butter Cream Lipsticks Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Feb 12, 2015 February 12, 2015 Bite Beauty Hazelnut Butter Cream Lipstick Bite Beauty Butter Cream Lipstick ($28.00 for 0.15 oz.) is a creamy, thicker, and hydrating formula with good color payoff, light shine, and moderate wear time. The formula has eight shades, and I’ve tested two so far (I bought four initially, liked them enough to buy the remaining four for review, too). According to the brand, the selling point of the lipstick is that they “hand cut each bullet, removing the outer waxy layer,” which gives the lipstick an “impossibly creamy core.” They’re nice overall, and the only downside was that the thicker consistency may catch on flakes if you have them. It feels thicker than their Luminous Creme range, but they are less glossy. It is creamy, to a degree, but the slightly heavier and thicker texture make it firmer overall. It’s not as creamy as formulas like NARS Audacious or YSL Rouge Volupte (probably one of the creamiest formulas, all-time), but the thicker quality makes it adhere and stay on longer, as it doesn’t slide or slip all over the place. As a bonus, thicker lipsticks often cover more pigmented lips better. As far as the “hand cut” bit, take it or leave it; I don’t really think it adds anything (Luminous Creme formula has a traditional bullet, and it’s very creamy and emollient!). My lips are large enough/shaped to the point where I didn’t have issues using the more bluntly cut edge to apply to my lips, but I still prefer the traditional shape for better precision. “Hand cut” is also not emblazoned on the actual bullet, it is just a translucent paper tab that is placed over it. The packaging is heavier and more substantial than the Luminous Creme formula–it feels weightier to me. The scent is similar to the rest of Bite’s products, which is a subtle fruit-y scent that seems more like what their base smells like than added fragrance. Bite Beauty Hazelnut Butter Cream Lipstick ($28.00 for 0.15 oz.) is described as a “brown pink.” It’s a muted, medium-dark rosy brown with subtle, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had mostly opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly. On me, it lasted for five hours and was hydrating over time. Marc Jacobs Beauty Roleplay (110) (P, $30.00) is lighter, more matte. Tom Ford Beauty Richard (LE, $32.00) is brighter, darker. Bite Beauty Glace (P, $24.00) is more matte, lighter.

Givenchy Rose d’Exception (206) (LE, $36.00) is cooler-toned, lighter. Revlon Pink Truffle (P, $7.49) is glossier, sheerer. NARS Tolede (P, $26.00) is pinker. MAC Grande Dame (P, $22.00) is warmer, brighter. MAC Gem of Roses (LE, $16.00) is more shimmery, cooler-toned. Giorgio Armani Blush (500) (P, $32.00) is lighter. Benefit La La Land (DC, $18.00) is lighter. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Bite Beauty Rosewood Butter Cream Lipstick ($28.00 for 0.15 oz.) is described as a “plum rosewood.” It’s a dusky, medium-dark rosy plum with very subtle, warm undertones and a soft shine. It had good, mostly opaque color coverage with a lightly creamy, thickened consistency that went on evenly and smoothly. The color wore well for five hours and was moisturizing while worn. Tom Ford Beauty Cary (LE, $32.00) is slightly more matte. Tom Ford Beauty Richard (LE, $32.00) is warmer. Tom Ford Beauty Negligee (LE, $50.00) is warmer.

Vanilla Extract and Honey Lust were the worst performers, but there were a lot of nicely pigmented, easy to use and blend shades overall. The palette could have used one or two additional medium-dark to dark shades for more contrast, as a lot of them were in the light-medium and medium range. All of the shades wore just around eight hours on me before fading, with a couple of shades that had some fall out (noted below). If you’re curious about pricing and value, consider checking out my lengthy discussion/thoughts after the review. Hey is described as a “metallic coral [with a Veluxe Pearl finish].” It’s a light, peachy beige with a frosted, metallic sheen. It had good color payoff and applied smoothly and evenly. bareMinerals Ball Gown (LE) is similar. Laura Mercier Primrose (P, $23.00) is pinker. Too Faced Cheers! (LE) is similar. Kat Von D Precious (LE) is also similar. Marc Jacobs Beauty The Starlet #2 (P) is lighter, more beige. Disney by Sephora Splendid (LE) is slightly more beige. MAC Summer Haze (LE, $21.00) is browner. bareMinerals Peace (P) is less frosted. Inglot #397 (P, $6.00) is darker, less beige. See comparison swatches . Warm Breeze is described as a “pastel coral [with a Satin finish].” It’s a light-medium, peachy beige with a satin-matte finish. The texture was soft, and it had fairly good color payoff. Chanel Charming #1 (LE) is more shimmery. Too Faced Bubbly (LE) is similar. Too Faced Whiskers on Kittens (LE) and Too Faced Spike the Punch (LE) are pinker. Wet ‘n’ Wild Newport Nights #2 (LE) is also pinker. bareMinerals Peace (P) is darker. See comparison swatches . Gingersnap is described as a “deep rosy pink [with a Frost finish].” It’s a muted, rusty brown with a frosted finish. It had excellent pigmentation, and the texture was soft and smooth.

MAC Mythical (LE, $15.00) is slightly browner. See comparison swatches . Dark Brew is described as a “deep chocolate with pink pearl [with a Velvet finish].” It is a medium-dark, chocolaty brown with warm, yellow-red undertones and a satin finish–almost matte. The texture was soft and silky, while the color payoff was really nice. Laura Mercier Truffle (P, $23.00) is lighter, yellower-toned. LORAC Sable (P) is darker. MAC Brown Script (P, $15.00) is redder. Make Up For Ever #17 (P, $20.00) is similar. See comparison swatches . Dance in the Dark is described as a “dark brown [with a Matte finish].” It’s a dark, cool-toned brown with a matte finish. It had a softer, slightly dry, texture that was a smidgen powdery, so it doesn’t adhere as nicely to the skin as other shades in the palette, but it is actually on the pigmented side. Laura Mercier Espresso (LE, $23.00) is warmer. theBalm Matt Ramirez (LE, $16.00) is similar. MAC Najm el Lail (LE, $15.00) is slightly warmer. MAC Midnight Flurry (LE, $15.00) is darker. MAC Showstopper (LE, $15.00) is a touch lighter. Guerlain Calligraphy #4 (LE) is darker. Estee Lauder Bronze Dunes #3 (LE, $21.00) is similar. Inglot #326 (P, $6.00) is redder in undertone. See comparison swatches . Brule is described as a “soft creamy beige [with a Satin finish].” It’s a light beige with neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin finish that borders almost matte. It was nicely pigmented and very soft and silky–easy to blend out on the skin. There are a lot of comparable shades to this one–it is a basic/staple: See comparison swatches . Vanilla Extract is described as a “soft warm yellow beige [with a Frost finish].” It’s a light-medium, yellow gold with a frosted sheen. It almost seemed like a Lustre finish, as it had a sort of sheer, slightly wet, texture. It was semi-opaque. Sleek MakeUP Meet in Madrid (LE, $9.99) is darker, less yellow. Giorgio Armani #10 #2 (P) is similar. Urban Decay Blunt (P, $18.00) is also similar. L’Oreal Eternal Sunshine (P, $7.99) is slightly yellower. Dior Night Golds #4 (LE) is similar. See comparison swatches . Honey Lust is described as a “bronze-dipped peach [with a Lustre finish].” It’s a warm-toned, coppery orange with copper and gold micro-glitter. It had semi-opaque color coverage, and the texture was gritty and glittery, which is typical of the Lustre finish. I had fall out with this shade during wear. Makeup Geek Glamorous (P, $5.99) is less glittery, less frosted. Too Faced Jingle All the Way Eyeshadow #7 (LE) is more golden. Anastasia Rum Cake (LE) is browner. Makeup Geek Vegas Lights (P, $6.99) is more orange. Sleek MakeUP Sunset #10 (P, $9.99) is yellower. LORAC Gold (P) is less glittery. Marc Jacobs Beauty The Starlet #4 (P) is less glittery. Disney by Sephora Cosmic (LE) is browner. bareMinerals Bragging Rights (LE) is less glittery. See comparison swatches . Amber Lights is described as a “peachy-brown with shimmer [with a Frost finish].” It’s a vibrant, warm-toned, coppery brown with a metallic sheen. It had excellent color payoff and a soft, buttery texture–one of my favorite MAC eyeshadows for color payoff and texture. Makeup Geek Glamorous (P, $5.99) is less metallic. LORAC Gold (P) is similar. Marc Jacobs Beauty The Starlet #4 (P) is also similar. NARS Isolde #1 (P, $24.00) is slightly less orange. MAC Campfire (LE, $32.50) is browner, darker. bareMinerals Bragging Rights (LE) is similar. bareMinerals Louder (LE) is slightly less orange. bareMinerals Hoopla (LE) is more muted, less orange. See comparison swatches . Saddle is described as a “golden orange brown [with a Matte finish].” It’s a medium-dark, warm-toned brown with a matte finish. It had a really soft, silky texture that can be a little powdery, though it’s really pigmented. Makeup Geek Cocoa Bear (P, $5.99) is darker. Anastasia Sienna (LE) is redder in tone. Kat Von D Cleopatra (P) is also redder. MAC Soft Brown (P, $15.00) is more muted, less yellow-toned. MAC Exposed (LE, $15.00) is browner, shimmery. See comparison swatches . Lemon Tart is described as a “metallic gold [with a Veluxe Pearl finish].” It’s a muted, yellow gold with a frosted sheen. It had good color payoff, and the texture was soft and smooth. MAC Captivating #1 (LE, $21.00) is very similar. Kat Von D Sunset Blvd. (LE) is yellower. theBalm D1 (LE, $16.00) is similar. MAC Dreammaker (LE, $15.00) is also similar. bareMinerals Standing O (P) is slightly yellower. See comparison swatches . Creative Copper is described as a “frosted gold [with a Lustre finish].” It’s a rich, coppery brown with warm undertones and a frosted, almost metallic, finish. Though it says it is a Lustre finish, it’s a lot smoother and infinitely more pigmented than most Lustres, though there is a little glitteriness to it (and some fall out). But this is a lot like Amber Lights (and its many dupes!), just a little browner. MAC A Glimmer of Gold #3 (P, $21.00) is lighter. Too Faced Jingle All the Way Eyeshadow #7 (LE) is similar. MAC Exquisite Ego #2 (LE, $21.00) is more orange. LORAC Gold (P) is more orange. theBalm Manic Maribel (LE, $16.00) is similar. NARS Isolde #1 (P, $24.00) is less frosted. MAC Amber Lights (P, $15.00) is warmer, more orange. bareMinerals Louder (LE) is similar. Inglot #405 (P, $6.00) is browner. See comparison swatches Butterfudge is described as a “dirty mocha with gold pearl [with a Satin finish].” It’s a medium, golden brown with warm undertones and a soft, golden shimmer. It had fairly good pigmentation and was soft to the touch. Too Faced Milk Chocolate (P) is less golden. Too Faced Chocolate Milk (LE) is less brown. Burberry Pale Nude #1 (P) is darker. See comparison swatches . Divine Decadence is described as a “soft bronze [with a Velvet finish].” It’s a dark, bronze-shimmered brown with red-orange undertones and a frosted sheen. The texture was a little dry and, in a way, gritty. It had good color payoff, though, but it was a little messy to use and didn’t blend as easily. It didn’t apply as intensely as the single I have does. Clarins The Essentials #7 (LE) is darker. Clinique Fuller Fudge (P, $17.00) is a cream product, darker. Milani Intermix (P, $6.99) is similar. MAC Sable (P, $15.00) is less warm-toned. See comparison swatches . Unwind is described as a “dirty olive [with a Veluxe Pearl finish].” It’s a muted, yellowed khaki–it’s not gold, yet it’s not really an olive or a green. It had excellent pigmentation, and the texture was incredibly soft and buttery. bareMinerals Stay Golden (LE, $14.00) is less yellow. Too Faced Crème Brulee (P) is less yellow. Too Faced Twinkle (LE) is not quite as yellow. NARS Iskandar (P, $25.00) is a cream product. Sephora Collection Girls Night Out (03) (P, $13.00) is yellower. MAC Gaelic Gold (LE, $15.00) is warmer.

Thanks! Sephora Amazon Ulta Nordstrom If you’ve kept up with the initial launch post and subsequent sneak peeks on MAC’s new pre-filled 15-pan palettes, you’ll see a variety of responses regarding the price point. Like any beauty product, whether something is “worth it” is really subjective–if you use every single color every single day, it would absolutely be “worth it.” If you would never use the palette, it would never be “worth it,” even if it was $5! Here are some of my personal thoughts, and these had no impact on the actual rating (which doesn’t consider value, just quality/performance metrics): I think it would have been a much more compelling palette if MAC hadn’t glued the pans in. If they feared people purchasing a palette and then splitting, I don’t really know why it matters–they’re still getting $100, and possibly, even more for the cost of an additional empty palette, and then two people have half-empty palettes that will compel (to a degree, at least!) them to fill them up with other colors that are more suitable to them. With some heat and elbow grease, these can be depotted, too, so anyone who really wants that feature can do so. It would have been really cool to swap out certain shades with other ones I already own to create new combinations–perhaps a mix of neutrals and pops of color–or maybe take four of my favorites from this palette and put them into a quad, which is more travel-friendly. There have been a lot of comparisons to Urban Decay’s Naked palette, and though Urban Decay has no doubt made the concept of an all-neutral eyeshadow palette a trend, there have been beige and brown palettes before Naked and will continue to be beige and brown palettes after Naked. I don’t think every palette with neutrals is a Naked copy or always designed to be a direct competitor. How many neutral palettes did Bobbi Brown release before Naked was in our vocabulary? It’s hard to imagine MAC thinking, “You know how we can take out Urban Decay’s Naked palette? Release our own for $100 that’s only available at select stores and online!” It doesn’t, however, mean we can’t compare the two or that we can’t criticize or question why MAC chose this price point. Urban Decay’s Naked palettes contain 12 full-sized eyeshadows (0.05 oz. each or 0.60 oz.) and retail for $52 (to be fair, they also include a full-sized brush), which brings the cost to $86.67/oz. of eyeshadow. The cost is $147.06/oz. with this MAC palette, which also contains full-sized MAC eyeshadows (I know Veluxe Pearls, which there are three of in this palette, contain 0.04 oz. and other finishes contain 0.05 oz., and the packaging says 0.68 oz.). The argument in favor of MAC’s pricing is that filling your own 15-pan palette would cost $160 ($10 per shadow, $10 for the palette). That’s very true; and the cost to fill-up your very own Urban Decay palette is $18 per shadow, plus $10 for a 4-pan palette (they don’t even have a 15-pan palette available). It is more expensive to create your own Urban Decay palette than it is to purchase the pre-made one, which is often a selling point of pre-made palettes–a lot more for less than if you bought them individually. (And Urban Decay’s BYOP system, as a result, is rather un-compelling, because there is no real savings for buying into their system.) To think in terms more relative to MAC, consider the cost of a pre-made quad compared to creating your own. Pre-made quads currently retail for $40.00/0.19 oz., which is $210/oz. If you created your own, it would be $8 for the palette and $40 for the eyeshadoows, which is $252.63/oz. So, the new pre-made 15-pan palettes bring that cost down to $147.06/oz., which is over 25% less than a pre-made quad. MAC has never been a brand that’s created major value-driven palettes, sets, or kits; their palettes have typically been marginally less than what you would have paid if you did it on your own. It is also worth mentioning that the majority of the shades in the palette are, at this time, exclusive to the palette, so you cannot feasibly create it yourself. On a price basis, the majority of palettes on the market will beat MAC out. The average 10-pan (or larger) palette is around $50, sometimes less, sometimes more. When it comes to palettes and dollars, it’s a highly competitive landscape, because $50 (or $100) is a lot to invest all at once. If you are looking specifically for MAC eyeshadows in the neutral range, this is more cost-effective than building your own 15-pan palette. If you’re not attached to these particular shades or the brand, there are numerous other options that will stretch your dollar further. This is true for most products, not just this one. It is, perhaps, more glaring with this offering than others.

"['Sneak Peek: Hourglass Ambient Lighting Edit Palette Photos & Swatches (Holiday 2015) Features Sep 15, 2015 September 15, 2015 Hourglass Ambient Lighting Edit Palette Here’s a preview of the recently released, limited edition Hourglass Ambient Lighting Edit Palette ($80.00 for 0.29 oz.). One of the main concerns I saw from readers when the palette was announced was with respect to the size of the palette, both actual size as well as quantity. The pans are smaller than prior palettes, and the majority of blush brushes are too small (even my SUQQU/Chikuhodo Z brushes barely fit, and those are smaller cheek brushes). Here is how it breaks down for value: Ambient Lighting Edit: 0.294 oz. for $80.00 = $272.11/oz. Contains: $18.90 worth of Ambient Lighting Powder ; $22.87 worth of Ambient Lighting Blush ; and $6.28 worth of Ambient Lighting Bronzer Value: $48.05 Ambient Lighting Blush Palette : 0.33 oz. for $58.00 = $175.76/oz. Value: $77.00 worth of Ambient Lighting Blush Ambient Lighting Powder Palette : 0.35 oz. for $58.00 =$165.71/oz. Value: $45.00 worth of Ambient Lighting Powder Ambient Lighting Powder : 0.35 oz. for $45.00 = $128.57/oz. Ambient Lighting Blush : 0.15 oz. for $35.00 = $233.33/oz. Ambient Lighting Bronzer : 0.39 oz. for $50.00 = $128.21/oz. It’s a real shame that Hourglass priced this year’s palette so high; the value is really out of sync compared to the past palette releases. On one hand, you can justify spending more even if the quantity isn’t a great value to get six shades for the price of 2-3 products, but the difference in value of products to what you pay is so much more than most kits and palettes where a pesky thing like principles can come into play. I also think that having the actual size of each pan being so small makes it very hard to use; you really can’t use a powder brush for all-over dusting with the Ambient Lighting Powders (which is how they’re often used) or a blush brush (and forget about a bronzer brush!).

"[""Hello Kitty Pop-Up Party Eyeshadow Palette Review, Photos, Swatches (Quick) Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Oct 03, 2014 October 03, 2014 Hello Kitty Pop-Up Party Eyeshadow Palette Hello Kitty Pop-Up Party Eyeshadow Palette ($52.00 for 0.70 oz.) includes twenty eyeshadows in an array of colors and neutrals with a variety of finishes. I love the concept–colors, neutrals, mattes, satins, shimmers–but I think the quality is missing. Often, you’ll see collaborations or non-beauty brands put out makeup, and the first thought is, “This is going to suck, it’s just a gimmick.” Sometimes you’re surprised, and sometimes, you’re not at all. The eyeshadow formula used here feels cheap, because they’re loaded with fillers that make these powdery, chalky, prone to fading, and under-pigmented. There’s no reason this shouldn’t perform at least decently–the price tag certainly leaves plenty of room to use quality ingredients and formulas. It is packaged similarly to Urban Decay’s Book of Shadows with a bulky, cardboard container with a pull-out drawer. The drawer doesn’t extend fully, so the top row of eyeshadows sits a little underneath the lip of the exterior cover. This is a quick review. In this instance, I have only tested twelve of the twenty shades for wear, and I have used an average wear time for the remaining shades. In an effort to cover more products during the holiday season, some palettes and sets will be given quick reviews. I’m still doing full reviews of products throughout the holiday season, but instead of having 20 palettes/sets photographed, swatched, and half-tested but never written up come January, my goal is to share photos and swatches and shorter reviews where it makes sense to. I use your reactions as a community to prioritize what gets fully tested and what may get a shorter review. Happy is a medium, pink lavender with cool undertones and a subtle sparkle. It was powdery, prone to fading, excessive fall out, wears six hours. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Playdate is a muted, medium-dark gray with subtle neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. Powdery, semi-sheer, faded after five and a half hours of wear. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Dear Daniel is a brightened, medium-dark periwinkle blue with an aqua micro-shimmer over a matte finish. It was powdery, sheer, dry, chalky, prone to fading after five and a half hours of wear. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Milk is a cool-toned white with a satin finish. It had semi-sheer pigmentation, lightly powdery, seven hours of wear. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Celebrate is a medium-dark, burgundy-brown with warm, reddish undertones and a pearly finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff, lasted for seven and a half hours, and was a touch powdery. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Supercute is a medium-dark, cool-toned purple with a soft, pearly sheen. It had a very dusty, dry consistency that was prone to fading along with semi-sheer color coverage. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Friendship is an iridescent, peachy-pink with a frosted sheen. It had so-color payoff, some powderiness to the texture. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Kitty-Chan is a dark, navy blue with a metallic sheen and copper sparkle. The copper sparkle made it more unique, but it didn’t bind and just fell underneath the lid during application. The consistency wasn’t powdery. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Apple Pie is a light, peach with a hint of beige, warm undertones, and a frosted finish. It had good color payoff and was easy to blend, but it was somewhat powdery. One of the better shades in the palette, though. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Bow is a medium-dark, coral-red with warm, orange undertones and a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation but was very powdery, so it adhered poorly to the skin and immediately looked faded applied to bare skin. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . 1974 is a medium-dark gray with subtle, neutral undertones (almost looks warm on my skin tone) and a satin finish. It was dry, powdery, and semi-sheer. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Kawaii is a cool-toned, light-medium aqua-teal with a metallic sheen. It had decent pigmentation and was only a little dry. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . The Original is a deep brown with olive undertones and a soft, bronze shimmer. It had great color payoff, though the texture was still on the powdery side. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Hot Cocoa is a muted, medium-dark brown with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. It was drier, powdery, and somewhat chalky with semi-sheer color payoff. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Bright is a brightened, metallic white gold with warm, yellow undertones. It had good pigmentation but was still a little powdery and dusty to work with. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Three Apples is a muted, cool-toned emerald green with a subtle golden overlay. It had good color payoff with only a slight powderiness, but it wore better than a lot of the other shades. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Anniversary is a blackened navy blue with lighter blue sparkle over a matte finish. It had great color payoff, and it was only a little powdery. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Cookie is an ultra frosted, pewter gold with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It was very crumbly and powdery, though the pigmentation was good (it just didn’t stick). See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Mimmy is a muted, light-medium butter yellow with a soft, frosted finish. It was crumbly and powdery, a little chalky, and difficult to get to stick to the skin. See swatches of dupes / view dupes side-by-side . Chocolate Chip is a rich, golden bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was a soft, smooth shade that wasn’t powdery and was nicely pigmented.

"[""Make Up For Ever I922 Electric Purple Artist Shadow (Blush) Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Sep 06, 2014 September 06, 2014 Make Up For Ever I922 Electric Purple Artist Shadow (Blush) Make Up For Ever I922 Electric Purple Artist Shadow (Blush) ($21.00 for 0.08 oz.) is a vibrant, violet purple with cool, pink undertones and a satiny sheen. Ardency Inn Royal (P, $21.00) is more shimmery, cooler-toned. Urban Decay Urban (P) is slightly more shimmery, a touch darker. Tarina Tarantino Violet Storm #5 (LE) is more muted. Fyrinnae Parental Advisory (DC, $8.25) is cooler-toned. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Of all the shades in Make Up For Ever’s massive (original) eyeshadow range, #92 was iconic. It was that bold, bright, deep purple with a matte finish that so many people had to have (myself included), so it was a real surprise to see how much they changed it in the new formula. I had asked specifically what shade replaced #92 in the new range, and the answer was consistently I922. The finish is obviously different, as the new one has a satiny, pearly sheen and the original had a matte finish. The original was also darker overall, so they’re not too similar in color or finish. I don’t remember if #92 was actually eye safe or not, but I922 is listed as a “Blush” rather than an eyeshadow, even though it is lumped with all of the eyeshadows. It was intensely pigmented with a soft, lightly creamy (but it is more powder than cream) consistency that blends fairly easily on the skin. Applied with a lighter hand, it takes on a pinky-lavender coloring rather than the richer violet you see in the heavy swatch. As a blush, the color lasted for eight and a half hours before fading slightly. 63 23 I922 Electric Purple 63 23 I922 Electric Purple A- Discontinued N/A Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora Brazil Sephora (Australia) Escentual Sephora (PL) Make Up For Ever 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 92% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Giorgio Armani Onyx, Green Iron, Emeraude Eye Tints Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jan 26, 2015 January 26, 2015 Giorgio Armani Onyx (05) Eye Tint Giorgio Armani Eye Tint ($38.00 for 0.22 fl. oz.) is a “fluid eyeshadow” that is supposed to be a long-wearing (“16-hour staying power)’ with “deep and intense color.” When they work, they work well, but there is a definite learning curve with the formula. I noticed that sometimes when I pulled the doe-foot applicator out of the tube for a few shades, the consistency was thinner and more watery, and other times, it was almost clumpy with product, though it never felt genuinely thick. If it is more watery than not, it can apply somewhat sheer, but if it is normal (because a more watery pull was more infrequent), it applied beautifully with rich, opaque color coverage (which was what happened most of the time with most shades). It is imperative to spread out the product with a smooth, even layer, or else it can add a textured (read: wrinkled, scaly, etc.) look to the lid. They dry down in fifteen to twenty seconds, and it doesn’t stay really wet for long, but it remains blendable for almost a minute. I didn’t feel too rushed, but I’d probably do one eye at a time. If you press and rub your finger gently against the lid, there will be transfer, which is why the formula is still blendable even after it dries down. The formula doesn’t feel heavy on, and it feels and looks more like a powder after it dries down. It is also a buildable formula, if you prefer to apply in layers, but it can be trickier to get a really thin, even layer. I used a flat, synthetic brush to apply and then a synthetic crease brush to blend the edges for this formula. They wear an impressive length of time (though not quite 16 hours) and tend to fade more than crease on my normal-to-dry lids (no primer). Once you get the hang of using them, they’re really lovely to use. If you prefer a sheerer look, it’s very easy to use less and blend out more. They seem overpriced (I would have expected $32-34), but at least they come with a fair amount of product (other high-end cream eyeshadows tend to contain an average of 0.14 oz.), which is slightly mitigated by the tube packaging (harder to get every last bit out of it). Giorgio Armani Onyx (05) Eye Tint ($38.00 for 0.22 fl. oz.) is a dirty, tarnished gold with a hint of pewter. I want to call it a mix of gold, olive, and pewter. It had a more metallic finish with a hint of gold sparkle. The pigmentation on this often varied; one time it would be very opaque (see it applied to the eye–that was a single layer), the next a little watery and thus semi-sheer to semi-opaque. The color wore well for fourteen hours before fading, but there was some minor fall out after eight and a half hours of wear. Chanel Tisse Fantaisie #3 (LE) is powder, warmer. Kat Von D Division (LE) is powder. Cle de Peau Stardust #4 (P) is warmer, powder. Hello Kitty Cookie (LE) is lighter, powder. Chanel Tisse Venitien #3 (P) is less shimmery, lighter, powder. L’Oreal Gilded Envy (755) (P, $7.99) is warmer, powder. NARS Taiga #2 (P, $24.00) is less shimmery, powder. MAC Cakeshop (LE) is lighter. MAC Modern Pewter (LE, $19.50) is lighter, powder. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Giorgio Armani Green Iron (06) Eye Tint ($38.00 for 0.22 fl. oz.) is a warm, olive bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a very smooth consistency that never seemed watery. The color blended out easily, whether you wanted an opaque all-over lid color with diffused edges or a wash of color. This shade wore well for fourteen and a half hours on me before fading. Cle de Peau Stardust #2 (P) is lighter, powder. MAC Psyche (LE, $15.00) is warmer, powder. theBalm Kawabunga (LE, $16.00) is greener, powder. Make Up For Ever D320 Golden Khaki (P, $21.00) is more shimmery, powder (kind of). MAC Olive Blend #3 (LE) is lighter, less shimmery, powder. Urban Decay Stash (LE, $18.00) is greener, powder. Clinique Whopping Willow (P, $17.00) is greener. MAC Fiction (DC, $15.00) is powder. Giorgio Armani #6 (P, $33.00) is browner, powder. Giorgio Armani #14 (LE, $33.00) is powder. bareMinerals Eureka (P) is powder. bareMinerals Speaker Box (LE) is less shimmery, darker, powder. Inglot #419 (P, $6.00) is greener, powder. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Giorgio Armani Emeraude (04) Eye Tint ($38.00 for 0.22 fl. oz.) is a bold, deepened emerald green with cool undertones and a satin sheen. It was intensely pigmented and applied smoothly with even color coverage. On me, it wore well for fourteen hours before fading. It’s hard to find a shade like this, as cooler-toned emerald greens are surprisingly rare! Charlotte Tilbury The Rebel #4 (P) is more shimmery, powder. Make Up For Ever I300 Pine Green (P, $21.00) is bluer, powder. MAC Green Room (LE, $15.00) is lighter, less shimmery, powder. Urban Decay Damaged (LE, $18.00) is warmer, powder. Sephora Collection Walk on the Wild Side (08) (P, $13.00) is warmer, powder. bareMinerals Max Volume (LE) is darker, powder. Bobbi Brown Forest (P, $28.00) is darker.

"[""Sephora Colorful Duo Reflects Colorful Eyeshadows Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Jan 28, 2015 January 28, 2015 Sephora Colorful Duo Reflects Colorful Eyeshadows Sephora Colorful Duo Reflects Colorful Eyeshadow ($13.00 for 0.07 oz.) popped up online a week or so ago, and three shades are already out of stock (count me surprised!). I’m not sure if they’ll be restocking these, but hopefully they will for those of you who had this on your radar! They’re interesting in concept, but I wouldn’t consider the majority of them duochromes at all (only one had a subtle duochrome). They’re more frosted to metallic in finish with some shades having noticeable sparkle (both in the finish as well as some fall out). I swatched them both dry (left) and damp (right), but they don’t need to be used damp at all, and I didn’t think it really transformed the color much more than intensifying and smoothing out the finish slightly. Sephora Hidden Treasures (114) Colorful Eyeshadow ($13.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a medium-dark, olive green with warm, golden shimmer and sparkle and a frosted finish. It had good color payoff both wet and dry, and the texture was denser but a little dry in feel. I felt like the formula with these wasn’t as smooth as the regular Colorful range. The eyeshadow wore well for nine hours but had some sparkle fall out over time. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Sephora Mermaid Tail (112) Colorful Eyeshadow ($13.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a purpled brown with a blue metallic sheen. This had the strongest duochrome out of the six, where it shifted from bluish-brown to brown. The texture was soft but a little dry, though blendable and applied without a lot of work. It stayed on well for eight and a half hours with very minor fall out over time. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Sephora Seahorse (115) Colorful Eyeshadow ($13.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a brightened, eggplant purple with warm undertones and a frosted, sparkling finish. The consistency was dry and less easily blended on the skin as a result, as the edges tended to reflect the drier texture. It had decent pigmentation dry, but it was easier to work with when I used a damp brush, as it was more pigmented and the dryness had less of an impact. On me, the color started to fade after seven and a half hours of wear, and there was some fall out over time. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Sephora Siren’s Charm (111) Colorful Eyeshadow ($13.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a muted, burgundy brown with gold and mauve sparkle. The texture was soft but dry, and it tended to kick up an excessive amount of powder when used it. The pigmentation was good whether applied dry or damp, but it was prone to sheering out when used dry on the lid. There was significant fall out throughout the time I wore it, and it only lasted for six and a half hours before fading noticeably. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Sephora Iridescent Shell (110) Colorful Eyeshadow ($13.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a brightened silver with a metallic finish. Again, there was a dryness present in the texture that made it harder to use as it was a little powdery and not as readily blended along the edges. It had good color payoff, but damp application helped to minimize some of the issues I had with the texture. The color showed signs of fading after seven and a half hours of wear. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Sephora Stormy Seas (113) Colorful Eyeshadow ($13.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a medium-dark blue with a frosted finish. It had a soft, lightly powdery texture that felt somewhat dry but was still blendable on the skin. It had good pigmentation both dry and damp, but it was smoother and adhered better to the skin when applied damp. It lasted for eight hours on me, and as it wasn’t as sparkly, it had minor fall out towards the end of the day.

You can wear them together or alone, and they coordinate well together. Flamenco (Lipstick) is described as a “sheer candy apple red.” It’s a slightly muted, medium pinky-red with warm undertones and a natural finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a lightly creamy consistency that had a little slip but didn’t slide around on the lips. The color wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.

Mysterious Red (Velvet Matte Lip Pencil) is described as a “crimson red.” It’s a medium-dark red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a creamy, velvety consistency that glided across the lips easily and sat well. This shade wore for over six hours and was very lightly drying after four hours of wear. Makeup Geek Beauty Queen (P, $12.00) is lighter, brighter (90% similar).

Misdmeneaor (Velvet Lip Liner) is described as a “crimson red.” It’s a medium, pinky-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture is slightly stiff/dry, so it does tug on the lips when used. It will wear for five to six hours, but I did find it somewhat drying on its own.

"[""NARS An Abnormal Female Lip Pencil Coffret Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Oct 12, 2015 October 12, 2015 NARS An Abnormal Female Lip Pencil Coffret NARS An Abnormal Female Lip Pencil Coffret ($65.00 for 0.24 oz.) includes three full-sized Velvet Matte Lip Pencils, and all three are shades that are part of the permanent range, so if you like one, you may find it better to just pick up the one you want. Of all the packaging in the collection, this is the most unique, and it is more unique relative to other special edition packaging I’ve seen from brands in general. The Velvet Matte Lip Pencil formula can be drying, and it doesn’t always have the pigmentation expected, which are its major downsides. 413 BLKR is a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with lighter iridescent fuchsia shimmer over a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered evenly, but the texture of the pencil was a smidgen dry compared to the other two shades. It didn’t tug much, but it seemed to take longer to apply. The color wore well for five and a half hours, and it left behind a stain, but it was somewhat drying after two hours of wear. Urban Decay Menace (P, $18.00) is less shimmery, darker (95% similar).

"[""MAC Nutcracker Sweet Red Lip Bag Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Oct 23, 2016 October 23, 2016 MAC Nutcracker Sweet Red Lip Bag MAC Nutcracker Sweet Red Lip Bag ($39.50 for 0.30 oz.) includes a full-size lipstick, Vamplify Lipgloss, and Lip Pencil. The Vamplify and Lip Pencil are repromotes, while the lipstick is new (but it is a matte red, so it is definitely dupable). I verified the color consistency between the two repromotes but did not retest them for wear or re-swatch them, so the lip swatches and review are from the last time I wore them. Value Vamplify Lipgloss : $20.00 for 0.16 oz. or $125.00/oz. Lipstick: $17.00 for 0.10 oz. or $170.00/oz. Pro Longwear Lip Pencil : $21.00 for 0.04 oz. or $525.00/oz. Total Value : $58.00 Suggestive is a bold, bright, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had good pigmentation, but there’s some translucency so the natural lip color will come through still. It applied really well with even coverage and never looked streaky and somehow managed not to slip into lip lines until after four to five hours of wear. The color lasted for five hours in all and was hydrating over time. MAC Tease Don't Touch (LE, $20.00) is lighter (95% similar). MAC Utterly Tart (LE, $17.00) is darker, more muted (95% similar).

Candy Cane is a bright, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had very nearly opaque color that went on evenly, though the texture was a bit firmer in the tube, so it tugged slightly as I applied it and definitely needed more pressure to go on. The consistency was thinner and clung more to the lips, but it was still going strong after six hours of wear. The formula was somewhat drying over time.

Trust in Red is a slightly muted, medium pinky-red with cooler undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was drier and harder to apply to the lips evenly, so it was most comfortable used to line the lips rather than to fill them in. The color was similar to the last version I had, but the texture was drier. I did retest this one for wear, and it lasted for over eight hours but was drying. MAC Ruby Woo (P, $17.50)(100% similar).

"[""NARS Humoresque Audacious Lipstick Coffret Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Oct 07, 2015 October 07, 2015 NARS Humoresque Audacious Lipstick Coffret NARS Humoresque Audacious Lipstick Coffret ($160.00 for 0.70 oz.) includes five full-sized Audacious Lipsticks held in a hefty, mirrored case with a velvet-lined interior (that has indentations where the lipsticks fit) that can be removed to just use the case in its full capacity. All five lipstick shades are part of the permanent range. Audacious Lipsticks retail for $32 each (or $160.00 for five), so this set is only “worth it” if you’re looking for the packaging, but otherwise, you might as well pick your personal five favorite shades. The quality of all five seemed exactly the same as the full-sized versions, which is quite high–soft, smooth, creamy consistencies with good pigmentation, comfortable wear and moderate wear-time. I don’t personally find it to be a very hydrating formula, but it isn’t drying either. You can see my round-up on the Audacious Lipstick formula here . I’ve swatched and re-tested the five shades as they were included in this set. Raquel is described as a “pink beige.” It’s a light-medium, pinky-peach with warm undertones and a creamy, natural finish. It had very nearly opaque color coverage, but it is one of the creamier, more slippery shades in the range, so it doesn’t apply as well as the majority of the range does as a result. It doesn’t apply badly, it just shows lines more readily and is harder to keep looking even. It lasted for almost four hours on me and was lightly moisturizing. Bobbi Brown Pink Sand (P, $37.00) is lighter, glossier (95% similar). bareMinerals Dream Big (LE, $20.00) is darker (95% similar). Bite Beauty Amaretto (P, $24.00) is darker, less glossy (90% similar). Chanel Adrienne (402) (P, $37.00) is darker (90% similar). MAC Enchanted One (LE, $17.50) is less glossy (90% similar). KKW Beauty Classic K (LE, $20.00) is darker, more muted (90% similar). Estee Lauder Insatiable Ivory (P, $32.00) is warmer (90% similar).

Urban Decay Unicorn (P, $18.00) is lighter, cooler (85% similar). Top 20 dupes listed, see the rest. See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Juliette is described as a “pink coral.” It’s a bright, pink-coral with a satin finish. The consistency was light-medium in weight, creamy, and glided on easily. The color lasted for four and a half hours and was comfortable to wear. MAC Tropic Tonic (P, $17.50) is darker (90% similar). Make Up For Ever C303 (P, $22.00) is lighter (95% similar).

Anna is described as a “smokey rose.” It’s a subdued, medium-dark pinky-plum with subtle, cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had mostly opaque color payoff that went on smoothly without tugging. The consistency seemed a little better in this particular version than my full-sized, as it was creamier and less dry. It was neither drying nor hydrating over the four hours it wore for. Pat McGrath Soft Core (P, $38.00) is warmer (95% similar). NYX Whipped Caviar (P, $6.00) is darker, less glossy (90% similar). Kat Von D Magick (DC, $21.00) is warmer (85% similar).

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Charlotte is described as an “oxblood burgundy.” It’s a dark, reddish-brown with warm undertones and a light shine. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered well without looking streaky. The texture had some slip but was less heavy compared to other shades (but it was also not as pigmented). This version was more pigmented and appeared a bit darker as a result on. It wore well for five and a half hours and was slightly hydrating. NARS Josephine (LE, $34.00) is glossier (95% similar).

"[""MAC x Guo Pei Night Sky Eyeshadow Quad Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Sep 16, 2015 September 16, 2015 MAC Night Sky Eyeshadow Quad MAC Night Sky Eyeshadow Quad ($70.00 for 0.19 oz.) includes three cooler-toned shades paired with a warm white. It is a good set of shades overall, though you may find the black and white shades within your stash as they are more basic shades. This is a limited edition piece in the MAC x Guo Pei collaboration, which has limited edition packaging (and pricing!) to match. The exterior of the lid is covered in a printed fabric, which may this less durable/travel-friendly (not sure about cleaning it/whether it’ll catch and fray over time). The MAC x Guo Pei collaboration launches online on September 24th at maccosmetics.com, and it will only be available at MAC 5th Avenue in NYC and MAC at South Coast Plaza (in southern California) for U.S. locations. Nehru (Guo Pei) is described as a “black grey [with a Matte finish].” It’s a deep black with cooler undertones and a matte finish. This isn’t like the Nehru I know from the permanent range, which translates as gray, and it might have something to do with the texture of this being incredibly dense, smooth, and almost cream-like. This was very, very pigmented and just an intense shade to work with, but it was still blendable — it’s just not really like the permanent version, so I have distinguished it as the Guo Pei version. It wore well for eight and a half hours before fading. Giorgio Armani #1 Fall Collection 2012 #4 (LE, )(100% similar). Marc Jacobs Beauty The Enigma #1 (P, ) is warmer (95% similar). Kat Von D Black Metal (LE, ) is cooler (95% similar). Makeup Geek Corrupt (P, $6.00) is warmer (95% similar). Pat McGrath Xtreme Black (P, ) is darker (95% similar).

Celestial Peak is described as a “dark frosted blue [with a Veluxe Pearl finish].” It’s a muted, dark navy blue with a soft, frosted sheen. It’s a “warmer” navy blue, but it isn’t truly warm-toned. The texture was soft with a slight dustiness but was fairly easy to work with, though it sheers out a bit when applied to the skin so two layers may be necessary to achieve true-to-pan color. It wore well for eight hours on me. Colour Pop Rhinestone (LE, $5.00) is warmer (95% similar). Sephora Stormy Seas (113) (LE, $13.00) is warmer (95% similar).

Bright Moon is described as a “warm white [with a Veluxe Pearl finish].” It’s a creamy white with warm, yellow undertones and a frosted sheen. It had nice pigmentation with a soft, buttery texture that was easy to use and apply. I felt like it turned almost silvery when combined with the cooler blue tones from the other shades, but it may appear truer in undertone on someone with naturally cool undertones. This shade wore for eight hours before fading. Too Faced La Croisette (P, $16.00) is more shimmery (95% similar). Tarte Pearl (LE, ) is less shimmery (95% similar).

"[""MAC x Guo Pei Moonlight Beauty Powder Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Sep 16, 2015 September 16, 2015 MAC Moonlight Beauty Powder MAC Moonlight Beauty Powder ($70.00 for TBA oz.) is described as a “translucent powder with small sized fine pearls.” It’s a light beige with subtle, warm yellow undertones and a nearly-matte finish. This seemed more like a sheer pressed powder for someone fairer than I, as it proceeded to give me a chalky, ghostly cast that was as unflattering as it sounds. I couldn’t use it on my medium skin-tone, and when applied, it mattified but didn’t smooth or diffuse the look of pores or the skin’s natural texture and made my skin appear dull as it went very matte. Beauty Powders are an interesting MAC beast, because they really come in all forms, and it seems to be more of a catch-all for “powders we want to put out for face.” A lot of them are light or pale, sheer to semi-sheer, while others have had a little more oomph and sheen to them (more like highlighters or a stronger finishing powder). I can’t detect the shimmer or pearl in it on the skin at all. The texture is firmer with a dry, dustiness that collects together but doesn’t diffuse as readily as a finer, silkier powder would. It comes in a large compact (but I don’t know how much is in it) with fabric on the exterior lid (which is pretty but may not withstand much abuse or dirt). It is a sheer, light beige powder that seems suitable only for fair complexions who are looking for a powder that will totally mattify skin. I wore it, and it seemed to keep my face looking flat and matte for eight hours (I have normal-to-dry skin, mostly normal at this time). 9 26 Moonlight 9 26 Moonlight B- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 7.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 82% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The texture was smooth but on the drier side with a firmer press, though it was just fine for blending on the skin, and it didn’t look powdery on. It had medium coverage that was buildable to full coverage in two layers. On me, the color lasted for seven hours before fading. I also noticed that it darkened on my skin, so it appeared warmer on my complexion and may look pinker on others. Dior Floral Pink (844) (LE, $44.00) is more shimmery (95% similar).

MAC Red Water Lily Blush ($40.00 for TBA oz.) is described as a “light coral pink.” It’s a brighgt, medium pink with subtle, warmer undertones and a satiny sheen. It was intensely pigmented, and a little went a long way, so this will be a great option for a wide spectrum of skin tones. It may look cooler or warmer depending on your undertones as well. The texture was finely-milled, smooth enough that it blended out without a struggle, but it was a little dusty/dry to the touch. The color started to fade after eight hours of wear.

"[""Bite Beauty Pastille, Red Velvet, Rosehip Matte Creme Lip Crayon Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Jan 17, 2016 January 17, 2016 Bite Beauty Matte Creme Lip Crayon Bite Beauty Pastille Matte Creme Lip Crayon ($24.00 for 0.05 oz.) is a muted, medium-dark rosy mauve with neutral undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was one of the more matte shades in the six for spring shades. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a lightly velvety consistency that applied evenly and didn’t tug on the lips during application. The color wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating. Maybelline Almond Rose (P, $7.99) is warmer (95% similar). Kat Von D Lovecraft (P, $19.00) is darker (95% similar).

Bite Beauty Red Velvet Matte Creme Lip Crayon ($24.00 for 0.05 oz.) is a deepened red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was nearly opaque applied, but you can see a hint of lip freckle peaking through. The texture was creamy and smooth, and it applied with ease. This shade lasted for over six hours and left a stain behind. The formula was slightly hydrating overall. Hourglass At Night (P, $34.00) is lighter (95% similar).

Bite Beauty Rosehip Matte Creme Lip Crayon ($24.00 for 0.05 oz.) is a bright, medium red with warm undertones and a satin finish.

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Bite Beauty Matte Creme Lip Crayon ($24.00 for 0.05 oz.) is supposed to be “long-wearing,” hydrating, and pigmented. It’s one of my favorite formulas for really pigmented, long-wearing, comfortable color that is more matte, though I wouldn’t describe them as a true or flat matte. There is a slight shine to them that wears down within an hour or so of wear (as you’d expect for most semi-matte to satin finish lipsticks). They come in a twist-up, large pencil format that makes it fairly easy to get precise edges and even coverage. For spring, they’ve brought back one previously limited edition shade (Blood Orange) and created five new shades to join the permanent range. The formula has a slightly herbal, lemony scent but no discernible taste to me. 64 12 Pastille 64 12 Pastille A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total 41 5 Red Velvet 41 5 Red Velvet A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total 24 5 Rosehip 24 5 Rosehip A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 98% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""NARS Cheek Studio Blush Palette (Spring 2016) Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Feb 03, 2016 February 03, 2016 NARS Cheek Studio Blush Palette NARS Cheek Studio Blush Palette ($65.00 for 1.01 oz.) includes a highlighting/contour duo, bronzer, and four blushes. Three of the blushes are exclusive to the palette with one blush being part of an exclusive offering for Sephora VIB Rouge members (as a single). Strangely, the Paloma duo, which is available in the permanent range (see my original review here ), was very chalky and clumpy in the palette–it felt smooth and soft to the touch, but it looked dry and chalky on the skin. I wish NARS (and other brands guilty of it) wouldn’t include one-size-fits-all contouring products; matte highlighters are also difficult to make inclusive (without the shimmer, it is hard to salvage one that really doesn’t work for one’s skin tone). Paloma Highlight is a pale beige with subtle, neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It was sheer, chalky, powdery, and looked all those things on the skin. It’s harder to tell the wear on a shade like this on my skin tone, but based on how powdery the skin looked in the area I applied it, it seemed to wear about six hours. Chanel Jardin de Camelias (LE, $70.00) is more shimmery (95% similar). Guerlain Mythic (P, $59.00) is more shimmery (95% similar). MAC Blush Pink (LE, $35.50) is darker (90% similar).

NARS Highlight (P, ) is lighter (85% similar). NARS Nico (P, $30.00) is more shimmery, darker (85% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Paloma Contour is a muted, medium-dark brown with subtle, warm rosy tones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer coverage with a firmer consistency that was hard to blend out or build-up in coverage. It wore for six and a half hours on me. NARS Gienah Highlight (P, ) is darker (95% similar). Viseart Sculpting #2 (P, ) is cooler (95% similar). MAC Sculpt (P, $16.50) is cooler (95% similar).

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Laguna is a medium, yellowed brown with warm undertones and a soft, frosted finish. This version was firmer, sheerer, and harder to blend on the skin than many others that I have tried. It is similar in color, but the performance is sub-par. It lasted for seven hours on me. MAC Nude on Board (LE, $30.00) is more muted (90% similar). Colour Pop Paradise Cove (P, $8.00) is less shimmery, darker (90% similar). Too Faced Spice (LE, ) is warmer (90% similar).

Top 20 dupes listed, see the rest. See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Cheek Studio I is a light-medium, cool-toned pink with a dusting of gold shimmer over a mostly matte finish. It looks primarily like a matte blush on the skin as the shimmer is fine, and as it is buffed into the skin, the finish is less flat-looking. The texture was lightly powdery but blendable, and the color lasted for seven hours. Makeup Geek First Love (DC, $9.99) is less shimmery (95% similar). Hourglass Ethereal Glow (P, $35.00) is less shimmery, warmer (90% similar). Makeup Geek Promise Ring (P, $10.00) is darker (95% similar).

Cheek Studio III is a medium-dark, copper-brown with warm undertones and a frosted finish.

"[""Too Faced Maneater, Pitch Perfect, Rebel Heart La Matte Lipsticks Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Mar 19, 2016 March 19, 2016 Too Faced Maneater La Matte Color Drenched Matte Lipstick Too Faced Maneater La Matte Color Drenched Matte Lipstick ($22.00 for 0.11 oz.) is a deep, burgundy purple with cooler undertones and a satin finish. It had more slip than the other shades, and it wasn’t as thick, but it applied more noticeably uneven–though it felt better going on and when worn–as it was splotchy, clumpy, and gathered in lip lines within an hour of wear. It lasted for five hours and left a stain behind, and it feathered slightly on me. MAC Prince Noir (LE, $17.50) is warmer, glossier (90% similar).

FORMULA OVERVIEW | Too Faced La Matte Color Drenched Matte Lipstick ($22.00 for 0.11 oz.) is supposed to be the “most comfortable matte lipstick” with a “high-pigment formula” that is “creamy” and “softens” against the skin,” while the formula is “non-drying.” There have been a lot of modern takes on the matte lipstick that have forsaken the days of dry, firm, tugging mattes in lieu of creamier, more velvety-feeling mattes that have a smidgen of sheen but are infinitely easier to apply and wear–these are somewhere in-between. They’re not the worst mattes I’ve tried, but half or more of the formula tugs, drags, and clumps up. They had a really dry, chalky consistency to me; thick and somewhat heavy. Some shades emphasized every flaw (and some I honestly didn’t know I had at all) on my lips. They were non-drying to moderately drying. The wear time was four to six hours, which is more in line with average across a typical shade range, but I had issues with color separating into lip lines and fading unevenly. The thicker texture gets harder to smooth back out and is extremely unforgiving to reapply over. 3 18 Maneater 3 18 Maneater C- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Amazon DermStore Skinstore.com HSN Sephora (PL) Beauty Brands Too Faced 6 Product 8 Pigmentation 7 Texture 7 Longevity 3.5 Application 70% Total 8 7 Pitch Perfect 8 7 Pitch Perfect B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Amazon DermStore Skinstore.com HSN Sephora (PL) Beauty Brands Too Faced 8 Product 9 Pigmentation 8 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 84% Total 12 5 Rebel Heart 12 5 Rebel Heart B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Amazon DermStore Skinstore.com HSN Sephora (PL) Beauty Brands Too Faced 8 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It was richly pigmented with a creamy, smooth consistency that was lightweight and comfortable to wear. There was a slight tackiness if I pressed my lips together, but it didn’t create uneven color.

ColourPop TooLips Ultra Satin Liquid Lipstick ($6.00 for 0.11 fl. oz.) is described as a “deepened plum brown.” It’s a deep, muted plummy-brown with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was totally opaque, while the product applied with smooth, even coverage and was a cinch to apply. The color wore on and on–it was still going strong after eight hours of wear–and was comfortable and non-drying to wear. Coloured Raine Soul (P, $17.00) is lighter, cooler (85% similar).

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . FORMULA OVERVIEW | ColourPop Ultra Satin Liquid Lipstick ($6.00 for 0.11 fl. oz.) is supposed to be a “lightweight, bold lipstick with a satin finish” that is “extra intense colour saturation” and “long-wearing,” but the brand is quick to note that it is “not completely kiss proof.” The consistency is very light to lightweight with a thin to mousse-like consistency–they feel a little heavier going on than the Ultra Matte formula, but they don’t feel heavy on. They dry down somewhat, but it isn’t a full, flat dry down like matte liquid lipsticks, and when you press your lips together, there is moderate tackiness there, but I didn’t notice any lifting or separating of color by doing so. Thus far, they have been extremely long-wearing and comfortable to wear for the most part–it’s after ten hours or so that I notice my lips feeling a little dry–but six hours into wear and the colors have looked good post-meals/post-drinking. I think if you like the idea of longer-wearing, mostly matte lip color but find most liquid lipsticks too drying or too flat while not needing an ultra-hydrating formula, you might like these. 45 12 Mess Around 45 12 Mess Around A+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 99% Total Recommended 68 14 TooLips 68 14 TooLips A+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 100% Total Recommended We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The new formula is designed to give you opaque coverage, long-wear, but it doesn’t dry down completely and isn’t transfer-proof like the Ultra Matte formula. This is a permanent addition, so while some shades are out of stock, they will be restocked. I’ll be reviewing these as I test them, but my lip product queue is hefty, so you’ll see a rotation through what I have — it may be a few weeks before I get through all of these!

It had nearly opaque color payoff with a very smooth, creamy, and slippery consistency that felt like butter melting on the lips when applied. The formula is comfortable to wear and hydrating over time, but it only wore for three and a half hours on me. Tarte Escape (P, $21.00) is more muted, cooler (90% similar). MAC Candy Apple (LE, $17.00) is lighter (90% similar). Tom Ford Beauty Night Mauve (P, $54.00) is lighter (95% similar). Bite Beauty Brandy (P, $24.00) is lighter, warmer (90% similar).

Chanel Script (218) Rouge Coco Stylo ($37.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a slightly muted, medium-dark brown with hints of mauve and fine pink micro-shimmer. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a very creamy consistency that had a lot of slip and melted against the lips as it applied. The color seemed to emphasize lip lines a bit, as the color gathered there, but it didn’t worsen over time, so it wasn’t too noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade lasted for three and a half hours on me, but it was moisturizing. Urban Decay Broken (P, $18.00) is more shimmery, darker, less pigmented (95% similar). MAC Sunset Pearl (LE, $25.00) is lighter (90% similar). Tom Ford Beauty Monica (LE, $36.00) is darker, warmer (90% similar). MAC Glamour Era (P, $25.00) is less shimmery, warmer (90% similar).

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Formula Overview Chanel Rouge Coco Stylo ($37.00 for 0.07 oz.) is supposed to offer the “intensity of a lipstick” with the “shine of a lipgloss” and “comfort of a lip balm.” The consistency of this formula is incredibly soft and melts against the lips, so it is easy to over-apply (and subsequently, easy to run through the product!) with a butteriness that you typically find in more emollient lip balms. In general, color coverage is semi-opaque to opaque, with wear coming in at three to five hours, depending on the shade. The formula is comfortable to wear and very hydrating both during and after wear. The downside is that these types of twist-up lipsticks (in the slim casing) tend to contain noticeably less than a standard bullet lipstick (0.10 to 0.12 oz. usually!) and the more pliant formula makes it easy to reapply and run it back and forth more than necessary (for the coverage). There’s a light rose scent to the formula, subtler than the Rouge Allure lipsticks, though. 29 6 Message (214) 29 6 Message (214) A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Chanel Dillard's 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total 13 15 Script (218) 13 15 Script (218) B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Chanel Dillard's 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Guerlain Happy Glow Pearls (LE, $65.00) is cooler (85% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . This year’s holiday Meteorites Perles are supposed to have three shades: “pink to refresh, gold to illuminate, and a touch of blue to softly correct the complexion.” It is dominated by a lot of smaller gold pearls with a few larger pink and minty green pearls, and when I swatched and used it, it was mostly a translucent, yellowish powder with gold micro-sparkle. This year’s Meteorites’ shimmer/sparkle is more noticeable on the skin as a result, but the overall effect is one of the subtlest I’ve seen out of all the Meteorites I’ve tried. I think those who enjoy using this product and aren’t as concerned about a noticeable effect will be happy with their purchase, but as a fan of the product, I still found the difference to be incredibly subtle. What I noticed, for the most part, was that it gave my skin a warmer, slightly brighter look overall with fine sparkle all over the skin.

It was very pigmented with a lightly glossy, smooth consistency. I did have some issues with the color adhering to the center of my lip, so there’s a bit of translucency there. The texture was lightweight and comfortable to wear without the color sliding around over time. On me, the color wore well for seven hours and was non-drying. Marc Jacobs Beauty Blacquer (000) (LE, $30.00) is less glossy (95% similar). Make Up For Ever C604 (P, $22.00) is less glossy (95% similar). NYX Chambord (P, $6.00) is less glossy (95% similar). Tarte Naughty (P, $20.00) is less glossy (95% similar). Colour Pop Aeronaut (P, $7.00) is lighter (95% similar). Sephora Woof (44) (P, $8.00) is lighter (90% similar). Urban Decay Perversion (P, $18.00) is lighter, less glossy (95% similar). MAC In the Spirit (LE, $17.50) is cooler (95% similar). NYX Go Rogue (P, $7.50) is more shimmery, lighter, cooler (85% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . MAC Blue Beat Liptensity Lipstick ($21.00 for 0.12 oz.) is a deep navy blue with strong, cool undertones paired with a lightly glossy finish that had some visible pearl. It was almost so cool-toned that it looked almost purplish. The consistency of this shade had a bit more slip than other shades, which led to slightly uneven application. For this type of shade, it still went on rather well, but there was still room for improvement. It had good pigmentation, though not quite opaque, in one stroke and was fairly comfortable to wear over time. It wore well for seven and a half hours and left a strong, purplish stain behind (more pink than blue). It was neither drying nor hydrating while worn. Sephora Ice Breaker (46) (P, $8.00) is more shimmery (90% similar). Maybelline Midnight Blue (P, $7.49) is darker (90% similar). Smashbox Deep (P, $21.00) is more muted, warmer (85% similar). Maybelline Sapphire Siren (P, $7.49) is lighter, brighter (85% similar). Urban Decay Heroine (P, $18.00) is lighter, warmer (85% similar). Bite Beauty #054 (P, $18.00) is darker, more muted (85% similar). Sephora City Beat (45) (P, $8.00) is more muted, warmer (85% similar). Fenty Beauty Clapback (P, $18.00) is darker, more muted, warmer (80% similar). Kat Von D Bruno (LE, $20.00) is more shimmery, lighter, less glossy (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . MAC Galaxy Grey Liptensity Lipstick ($21.00 for 0.12 oz.) is a muted, medium grayish lavender with a cream finish. It was richly pigmented with a lightweight, lightly gel-like texture that applied evenly and smoothly on the lips. The consistency melted on the lips after 45 seconds and seemed to make my lips appear smoother and more voluminous. This shade wore well for six and a half hours on me and was slightly hydrating. Make Up For Ever C502 (P, $22.00) is lighter (90% similar). Kat Von D Zero (P, $19.00) is lighter (85% similar). Kat Von D Zero (LE, $21.00) is lighter, less glossy (85% similar). MAC Evening Buzz (LE, $17.50) is lighter, cooler, less glossy (85% similar). Bite Beauty Taro (LE, $26.00) is darker (80% similar). Dior Cloudy Matte (380) (LE, $35.00) is lighter, brighter (80% similar). Colour Pop Marshmallow (P, $6.50) is lighter, warmer (80% similar). MAC Plum Princess (LE, $17.50) is warmer (80% similar). MAC Fresh Amour (LE, $19.00) is lighter, warmer (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Formula Overview MAC Liptensity Lipstick ($21.00 for 0.12 oz.) is supposed to have “intense amounts of pigment” with a gel-like texture that melts on lips that leaves behind a satin finish and wears for “eight hours.” It’s supposed to be “comfortable” to wear, but there are no claims about hydration–and overall, they were non-drying. The majority of the range varied from semi-opaque to fully opaque in one stroke, while the texture had some body and thickness to it but was not heavy. The consistency feels firmer in the tube, but it became softer and more pliable as it warmed up against the lips. This was also true about how the color settled and looked on the lips–it tended to fill up lip lines without emphasizing them as much after thirty seconds of wear. The formula didn”t have a lot of slip, and it was actually lightly tacky, which helped it stay in place better. The wear ranged from four to eight hours with lighter shades typically wearing shorter than deeper and more intense shades. The finish was anywhere from satin to natural with noticeable sheen, sometimes glossiness, but it often wore to a satin to semi-matte finish after a few hours. The formula has MAC’s typical vanilla scent but had no discernible taste. 13 11 Stallion 13 11 Stallion A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 91% Total 11 12 Blue Beat 11 12 Blue Beat B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8 Product 9 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 84% Total 37 9 Galaxy Grey 37 9 Galaxy Grey A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

ColourPop Lights Out Ultra Metallic Liquid Lipstick ($6.00 for 0.11 fl. oz.) is a medium, bronzy gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on somewhat evenly, but it could have applied better. This shade had a tendency to emphasize lip lines as the color would dry down in them and then separate afterward. The texture was smooth and thin, comfortable to wear after it dried down to a matte, metallic finish. The color wore well for five hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.

Formula Overview ColourPop Ultra Metallic Liquid Lipstick ($6.00 for 0.11 fl. oz.) is supposed to be “super intense” with “high impact metallic pearls” and a “non-drying formula” that “is extremely long-wearing” (but it is “not completely transfer resistant”). Of ColourPop’s liquid lipstick formulas, this had the most slip and least pigmentation (across all four shades)–more semi-opaque, though they were buildable. The consistency spreads well across the lips, but it could look more even; I think the darker coloring of the shades made some of the translucency less apparent. They dry down to a mostly transfer-proof finish, and they are flexible and comfortable to wear. I got between four and six hours of wear with these, and they seemed to break down easily with food compared to the Ultra Satins/Mattes. Two of the four shades were a little drying, while the other two were non-drying. 7 5 Jic 7 5 Jic B- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 8 Product 6.5 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 80% Total 12 6 Lights Out 12 6 Lights Out B- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 7 Product 8 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 9.5 Longevity 4 Application 82% Total 4 5 PYT 4 5 PYT C+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 7 Product 8 Pigmentation 7 Texture 9.5 Longevity 3.5 Application 78% Total 16 5 Salt 16 5 Salt A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 9.5 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"['Sneak Peek: Hourglass Surreal Light Palette Photos & Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Features Sep 11, 2016 September 11, 2016 Hourglass Surreal Light Palette Hourglass Surreal Light Palette ($80.00 for 0.30 oz.) contains five cheek/face powders revolving around the shade of Surreal Light, which makes them all new (and limited edition), but it wouldn’t surprise me if we saw it added to the regular line someday later on (equally possible it never returns!). There are two blushes, one bronzer, one highlighter, and one finishing powder (which is the largest of the five shades). Like last year’s palette, the only value is in whether you like the idea of getting five shades for less than the cost of two or three full-sized Hourglass Ambient Lighting products (which range from $38 to $50 in price). There’s only $53.30 worth of product in the palette, so it’s obviously not a value-packed palette. This is something that will be best for someone who wants everything in a single palette and will wear at least three of the five shades often. This year’s palette is marginally better in value than last year’s (which was $48.05 in product value at the same $80.00 price point), but their palettes prior to that were significantly better in value.

MAC Swiss Chocolate (P, $23.00) is lighter (90% similar). MAC Exotic Ember (LE, $29.00) is more shimmery (90% similar). Makeup Geek Chivalry (P, $10.00) is less glossy (90% similar).

For an in-depth look at what the formula is supposed to do and how it performs generally, please check the overview below the rating! Anise had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation when applied with a brush or fingertips and opaque coverage if applied directly from tubes (in swipes/passes, if you just dotted or dabbed it, then it was sheerer). The consistency was creamy, light-to-light-medium in weight without feeling or looking heavy, and very blendable on eyes, lips, and cheeks. As you might expect by this point, the performance on the eyes was the weakest while the performance on the cheeks was strongest, though it wore well and comfortably on the lips. As a cheek product, the product was very forgiving on the cheeks and blended out with ease. I had no trouble using synthetic brushes of all kinds as well as my fingertips; the latter is my go-to for most cream cheek color for blending but I like initially laying down color with a synthetic stippling brush. On my normal-to-dry skin, the color lasted for nine hours before fading slightly. It did not dry down fully, so it would transfer if I touched it, I didn’t notice migration or movement over time either (which was a surprise). This shade looks a lot lighter when used at lower coverage levels, instead of the deep brown it appears in the tube; the difference is a bit more dramatic than in other shades to me (I think it’s the warmth that comes through when it appears lighter in hue). As a lip product, it’s versatile in its pigmentation depending on how you apply it. For ease, I applied it directly from the tube, which yielded opaque pigmentation in a single pass, but you could easily apply with fingertips for sheerer coverage or a lip brush for more precision (it is a rounded tube!). The texture was smooth, creamy, and a little powdery without feeling dry–there’s something to the texture that reminds that there is powder in the formula–and applied even color. It wore well for six hours and left behind a slight stain afterward, and while it was not hydrating, it was also not drying. As an eye product, I applied with fingertips, which yielded a semi-sheer application, and it was easily built-up to greater coverage, if desired, though fully opaque was a little more challenging without applying it directly from the tube. It blended out easily and while it did not fully set, this particular shade managed to hold on for–wait for it!–two hours before creasing set in. Please note, the rating is an average across performance on eyes, cheeks, and lips. 4 4 Anise 4 4 Anise B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 8 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 7.5 Longevity 5 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below. Thanks! Sephora Amazon Ulta Nordstrom See more photos & swatches! Formula Overview Bite Beauty Multistick ($24.00 for 0.17 oz.) is a cream formula that can be worn on eyes, lips, and face, and it is supposed to be “blendable, breathable, and buildable” with a “soft focus finish.” In general, it has a more cream-like feel than powder-like, even after it “dries.” The consistency is medium in thickness–more noticeably thick when used on the lips, as it is quite dense–and is quite blendable across the majority of shades. They don’t have a true cream-to-powder dry down, as the Bite formula does not dry down completely. I did notice that the exposed portion of the bullet itself (like the flat top) gets drier and firmer after each use, as if it dries out a bit on the exterior, but a light swipe on the skin reveals a much creamier interior. When I’ve used it directly from the tube on the lips, I can sense that “35% powder” part of the formula as well. I really liked the formula as a cream blush, as it was blendable, buildable, and long-wearing. As a lip product, it was decent to good (performance depended a lot on the shade), and as an eye product, it was a total miss for me due to poor wear. As an eyeshadow : The texture was blendable around the edges, while the thicker consistency and buildable coverage enabled me to get better coverage that didn’t just sheer out immediately. The issue I had with wearing the formula on my eyes was that I could not get the formula to wear well on eyes, as they continuously settled into creases within minutes of applying; I would smooth the color back out after the initial creasing, but it would just happen again after another five to ten minutes. I tried using the formula over different primers (Urban Decay Primer Potion, Too Faced Shadow Insurance, MAC 24-Hour Prep + Prime Eye) as well as dusting with translucent powder, but the wear was only improved to a couple of hours of wear before creasing occurred (instead of minutes). As a cheek color : The formula has performed the best as a cream blush (or bronzer/contour). The were very much as described–blendable and buildable–and could be worn as true-to-tube color if desired, but it was easy to diffuse and blend out the blush on the cheeks. I liked to use a synthetic blush brush to swirl on the color and then used my fingertips to blend out the edges. While the formula didn’t dry down completely, it yielded a natural sheen that was glowy in a subdued way (and without shimmer), and it didn’t seem to result in wear issues, as the shades I have tested have all lasted between nine and ten hours as a cheek color. If I patted lightly at the blush on my skin, there would be immediate transfer onto my fingertip and a missing splotch of color on my skin. It set well with translucent powder but does lose its sheen (no transfer if I set it). As a lip color : I was surprised to find that the formula wore about as well as an average lipstick on the lips, and the formula wasn’t drying at all. If you apply it directly from the tube like a regular lipstick, it’s very, very pigmented and totally opaque, but if you apply with fingertips or use a lip brush, it is more buildable. You can also apply directly from the tube to the center of lips and then use a fingertip/brush to blend and diffuse to the rest of the lips for sheerer coverage. It is most comfortable and flattering worn at a higher opacity, as the denser texture seems to help lips look smoother without emphasizing lip lines. Some of the lighter shades settled into lip lines while worn (after an hour or two), while others didn’t have such issues. Some shades were also more prone to fading more noticeably from the center of lips. What I was most impressed by was the fact that they did not feel dry or clingy on the lips, and the formula itself wasn’t drying at all, even after six hours of wear. Bite’s Amuse Bouche formula is a far superior lipstick formula, but these were absolutely wearable as a lipstick. It took as long as four hours before the color would start to look more matte, but it never felt truly powdery or dry.

Formula Overview Bite Beauty Amuse Bouche Lipstick ($26.00 for 0.15 oz.) is supposed to have “bold, creamy color” with “extreme moisture, soft texture, and creamy wear.” The majority of the range is very pigmented–typically opaque with one pass–with a few shades being semi-opaque but usually buildable. All 34 shades are shimmer-free and vary being a soft satin finish to a natural finish (light shine but not glossy). The consistency is very lightly creamy to lightly creamy with some shades requiring light-medium pressure and can pull the lip a bit when gliding it across the lips, though the color doesn’t appear ragged and the bullet itself doesn’t feel stiff (while other shades applied without tugging, so check individual shade reviews!) The majority of the shades I’ve tested have been lightly hydrating to non-drying and fairly comfortable to wear for the long-haul. They wear longer than average, from four to eight hours, depending on the intensity and propensity of the shade to stain. In comparison to the Luminous Creme formula : The level of color payoff and lemony scent are the two things that are similar, but they feel quite different on. If you have drier lips and need the intense hydration that the Luminous Creme formula offered, I don’t know if you’re going to like these. The Luminous Creme formula had a thicker consistency with a very creamy texture that glided on and never tugged at all, and the thicker consistency paired with the glossier finish was more forgiving on lips as it didn’t emphasize lines, natural texture, dryness, or flaking. Some had issues with the Luminous Creme formula bleeding/feathering and shorter-wear due to the amount of slip (high), and the Amuse Bouche formula has much, much less slip, so the wear is longer. I didn’t typically experience bleeding/feathering with the Luminous Creme formula, and that is also true with Amuse Bouche, but I would expect less with this more satin-finish formula for most (but not all). The scent seemed slightly stronger in the Amuse Bouche range, but it wasn’t noticeable after I was done applying the color. 31 14 Spritzer 31 14 Spritzer A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9.5 Longevity 5 Application 93% Total 17 15 Gin Fizz 17 15 Gin Fizz B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 87% Total 26 14 Dragonfruit 26 14 Dragonfruit A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total 46 3 Eggplant 46 3 Eggplant A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

You may find the following links useful… 1,000 point rewards 2,000 point rewards 5,000 point rewards 10,000 point rewards I tried to do some rough calculations of value, and I made assumptions that what they are giving you is full-sized, but it’s hard to know for sure. I noticed several designer bags included in rewards were discontinued or from a prior season, so sometimes tracking it down was a challenge (I don’t follow a lot of fashion, but if you’re able to identify a bag by name, do let me know!). Let me know if this was helpful/worth putting together (it was more time-consuming than anticipated, but if the value info isn’t useful, I’ll skip that part next time).

It was moderately creamy with some slip (but it didn’t slide around) that applied with mostly opaque color. The lipstick wore well for four and a half hours with a little color that gathered into lip lines after three hours of wear, but it was nicely hydrating while worn.

Bobbi Brown Almost Bare Luxe Lip Color ($35.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as a “soft beige.” It’s a muted, medium peachy-brown with warm, orange undertones and a natural sheen. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a soft, creamy, glide-on consistency. The color wore well for four hours, but I had some color pull into lip lines after three hours of wear.

Bobbi Brown Mod Luxe Lip Color ($35.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as a “pale yellow beige.” It’s a light, yellowed peach with warm undertones and a cream finish with light shine. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a creamy consistency, but it was very unforgiving. It seemed to exacerbate the natural texture of my lips and made them look uneven, almost dry. This was one of the worst-performing shades in the range for me. The color lasted for three hours and was lightly hydrating. MAC Nearly Nude (LE, $17.50) is darker (95% similar).

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . FORMULA SUMMARY | Bobbi Brown Luxe Lip Color ($35.00 for 0.12 oz.) is supposed to have one-stroke color coverage with a hydrating, smoothing formula, and “nourishing shine.” I was impressed with the formula as a whole, as the majority of the shades were very pigmented in one pass with a creamy consistency that glided on easily. There’s a richness to the texture that does feel more “luxe” in a way. The natural-to-luminous shine level gives lips a smoother, plumper look, while the formula itself is hydrating and many shades are longer-wearing. I noticed that the lighter shades tended to perform more poorly relative to more light-medium to medium-dark-hued shades. There was a faint floral scent (that was a surprise, I wish they had gone the unscented!), but I didn’t have issues with taste and found it very subtle on (it’s no Dior/Chanel-level scent!). In general, I like Bobbi Brown’s lipstick formulas, and this one feels creamier and more hydrating than others, but for pigmentation, you can’t go wrong with this or the Rich Lip Color formula. 24 7 Pink Nude 24 7 Pink Nude A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total 18 15 Almost Bare 18 15 Almost Bare B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 7.5 Longevity 5 Application 87% Total 5 19 Mod 5 19 Mod C Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 7 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 7 Texture 7.5 Longevity 4 Application 76% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Tarte Deluxe Amazonian Butter Lipstick Set Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Sep 25, 2015 September 25, 2015 Tarte Deluxe Amazonian Butter Lipstick Set Tarte Holiday 2015 Deluxe Amazonian Butter Lipstick Set ($21.00 for 0.14 oz.) is a travel-sized set of four of the brand’s Amazonian Butter Lipsticks, which are okay if you like a more balm-like, semi-sheer, lightly shiny formula, but not so much if you were banking on Tarte delivering on their promise of “hydrating creamy, full-coverage.” I reviewed the formula here when it first launched, and they’re very lightly hydrating with short wear time; unfortunately, these were consistent with that prior experience. They have a lightweight, balm-like consistency that goes on without tugging but wear away with two hours (except one shade, Sangria, lasted closer to three hours) and aren’t nearly as hydrating as they claim. They are mint-scented and packaged in cardboard tubes (same as the full-sized versions). If you’re unfamiliar with minis, they tend to be quite narrow, but I didn’t have any issues with the bullets breaking. The formula has a stronger mint scent and a very light mint taste (at times). A full-sized Amazonian Butter Lipstick retails for $17.00 and contains 0.10 oz. (or $170.00/oz.), so this set contains $23.80 worth of lipstick (I’m not sure how they got to a $32 value, which is what is listed on Sephora). Punch is described as a “mauve pink.” It’s a subdued, medium pink with soft, warm undertones and a creamy, lightly shiny finish. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color payoff that applied without dragging and deposited color evenly. The color lasted for two and a half hours, and it was slightly hydrating. Dior Diorkiss (578) (P, $35.00) is more muted, less pigmented, cooler (90% similar). Revlon Pink Truffle (P, $7.49) is darker, warmer (90% similar).

"[""Urban Decay Naked3 Eyeshadow Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Nov 21, 2013 November 21, 2013 Urban Decay Naked3 Eyeshadow Palette Urban Decay Naked3 Eyeshadow Palette ($52.00 for 0.60 oz.) includes twelve eyeshadows, each 0.05 oz. (equivalent of a full-sized eyeshadow), in hues of pink and brown. It also includes a dual-ended eye brush, and a week’s worth of samples of each of their primers. The case is a rose gold metal with “waves” indented across the exterior. Overall, it’s a really lovely palette filled with eyeshadows that are highly pigmented, soft, blendable, and easy to use. With ten of the twelve, they wore well for just over eight hours without fading or creasing. Darkside was my favorite shade, as it was somewhat unusual, and it wasn’t too frosted. Dust was the worst performer, which isn’t unexpected, as it has a fair amount of glitter, which makes the texture less smooth and results in fall out during wear. Trick had minor fall out during wear, but it applied better and had more color payoff. It is now available at urbandecay.com ! ? Comparisons to Naked 1 and Naked 2 can be found here ! Strange is described as a “pale neutral pink matte-satin.” It’s a pale, neutral-to-warm white-pink with a satin matte finish. It had really good color payoff, and the texture was soft and finely-milled–a very, very smidgen powdery if I’m being nitpicky as a little goes a long way. Too Faced Powdered Sugar (LE) is similar.

Dust is described as a “pale metallic pink shimmer with iridescent micro-glitter.” It’s a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a white and gold micro-glitter. The texture is a little powdery and glittery, so it feels looser; it’s a shade I would apply with a dampened brush to minimize fall out and to help it apply more smoothly. I had noticeable fall out with this shade. Sleek MakeUP Sunset #12 (P, $9.99) is darker. Chanel Pink Lagoon (LE, $34.00) is warmer, cream product. Urban Decay Scratch (P, $18.00) is darker.

Trick is described as a “light metallic pinky-copper shimmer with tonal micro-sparkle.” It’s a medium copper with brownish tones and a gold sparkles over a frost finish. It had good pigmentation, and the texture though sparkly, was soft and buttery and applied smoothly overall. Dior Meteore (661) (P, $30.00) is a cream product. LORAC Garnet (P) is less frosted, darker. Guerlain Cuivre Ora (LE, $35.00) is more orange. theBalm Racy Kacy (P, $16.00) is darker. NARS California (P, $24.00) is darker, less sparkly.

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . FORMULA SUMMARY | Bobbi Brown Luxe Lip Color ($35.00 for 0.12 oz.) is supposed to have one-stroke color coverage with a hydrating, smoothing formula, and “nourishing shine.” I was impressed with the formula as a whole, as the majority of the shades were very pigmented in one pass with a creamy consistency that glided on easily. There’s a richness to the texture that does feel more “luxe” in a way. The natural-to-luminous shine level gives lips a smoother, plumper look, while the formula itself is hydrating and many shades are longer-wearing. I noticed that the lighter shades tended to perform more poorly relative to more light-medium to medium-dark-hued shades. There was a faint floral scent (that was a surprise, I wish they had gone the unscented!), but I didn’t have issues with taste and found it very subtle on (it’s no Dior/Chanel-level scent!). In general, I like Bobbi Brown’s lipstick formulas, and this one feels creamier and more hydrating than others, but for pigmentation, you can’t go wrong with this or the Rich Lip Color formula. 63 11 Neutral Rose 63 11 Neutral Rose A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total 41 16 Pink Buff 41 16 Pink Buff A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 96% Total Recommended 72 11 Soft Berry 72 11 Soft Berry A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9.5 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total Recommended We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"['5 Faves: Satin Lipsticks for Fall 2015 Sample Features Sep 27, 2015 September 27, 2015 I find that I actually prefer a satin finish to a matte one as a personal preference; satins have a little sheen and offer more comfort than your average matte, but they aren’t truly glossy either.

"[""LORAC Mega PRO 2 Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Sep 27, 2015 September 27, 2015 LORAC Mega Pro 2 Eyeshadow Palette LORAC Mega Pro 2 Eyeshadow Palette ($59.00 for 0.45 oz.) contains sixteen matte eyeshadows and sixteen more shimmery shades (varies from satin to metallic). The quality is comparable to LORAC’s eyeshadow formula in the past Pro palettes: very silky and soft but moderately powdery, so some shades are faster to fade, have a lot of fall out, or sheer out when applied to the skin. I like their shimmers more than their mattes, because I test over bare skin, and the mattes tend to need a primer to perform well. The palette gets pretty messy, as there is a ton of excess kick-up with almost all of the shades, so use the most delicate of motions to get color out of a pan. This new, limited edition holiday palette that will be available exclusively at ULTA beginning October 4th, but it is apparently available to Platinum members exclusively today here (I have heard that non-Platinum members had success purchasing as well). Worth repeating is that this year’s palette contains 0.45 oz., whereas last year’s palette contained 0.62 oz. (the price is the same on both palettes); visually, they appear to be the same size, and the pans still line-up, so I can only guess that the pans themselves are shallower or somehow they tweaked the formula to make it fill the same volume with less product. I was surprised to see such a noticeable difference in quantity, given that they otherwise appear to be the same size. Updated 10/5 at 8AM PST : LORAC PR emailed me with the following information: “Similar to all of the brand’s PRO palettes, the shadows in this new one have the same base formulations, pan size/depth and shadow volume. However, the difference in weight is due to the actual weight of the shadow pigment, which varies based on light or darkness of the specific color.” Porcelain is a light, yellowed beige with a matte finish.

Overall, it’s a pretty good batch; some of the darker, vampier shades weren’t great, but the formula is more forgiving and you can solve sheerer coverage by applying a second layer (without it causing application problems). Kat Von D’s formula remains my personal favorite when it comes to the liquid lipstick type of product, as it is the least drying, most comfortable to wear, and easiest to apply.

ColourPop Ouiji Ultra Matte Liquid Lipstick ($6.00 for 0.11 fl. oz.) is described as a “bright coral red.” It’s a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had very nearly opaque color payoff with a consistency that ran a little thin and streaked just slightly–the vibrancy of the color made the streaks less apparent, but this is one to work quickly with. The color lasted for seven hours on me with light fading beginning from the center of the mouth. The formula felt lightly drying after five hours of wear.

Formula Summary: ColourPop Ultra Matte Liquid Lipstick ($6.00 for 0.11 fl. oz.) is a long-wearing, pigmented lipstick that starts off glossy and dries down quickly to that super flat matte finish. They have minimal transfer with some of the lighter shades having almost none for the first few hours of wear, but any time you’ve had a meal, they lose that transfer-resistant quality to a noticeable degree. They tend to wear anywhere from six to ten hours with darker shades maintaining better color coverage and wear over a longer period of time. Some shades get a little drying about two-thirds to three-fourths through the wear, while a few shades have been fairly non-drying even many hours into wear. They fade away evenly with most color loss occurring from the center of the lips if eating a more oil-based meal but the majority of color survives a meal. Reapplication has been hit or miss and tends to depend on how well it wore away and how easily the shade applies normally, but reapplication tends to emphasize the lip’s natural texture significantly compared to initial application and gives lips a very wrinkled, dried-up look. I’ve layered gloss on top of some shades with moderate success, though it will obviously lose the matte finish and will transfer and I’ll get tiny flakes where the matte lip color has lifted by mixing with gloss but has been pretty minimal. The formula had no discernible taste or scent. 141 25 Creeper 141 25 Creeper A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total 124 24 Ouiji 124 24 Ouiji A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Essie First Timer Nail Lacquer Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews May 12, 2013 May 12, 2013 Essie First Timer Nail Lacquer Essie First Timer Nail Lacquer ($8.00 for 0.50 fl. oz.) is described as an “adorable newbie green.” It’s a more vibrant take on mint green–there’s a little green and aqua mixed together to create something deeper and richer than your typical pastel mint green, but it’s not neon or a medium-colored shade either. Dior Samba is a bit darker, not quite as bright. Illamasqua Nomad is similar, perhaps a bit less green. The consistency was slightly thicker than average but the thickness did not impede application. First Timer applied beautifully with full color coverage in two quotes, no streaking or bubbling, and the polish didn’t pool along the edges. The drying time was average and had a slightly shiny finish when all was said and done. I normally get a week of wear out of Essie’s formula with minor tip wear but no chipping. P.S. — And if my bottle looks tiny, it’s because I bought the mini version since you and I both know I’ll never finish a full-sized bottle so I thought the minis would suffice for review purposes! ? 165 27 First Timer 165 27 First Timer A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Ulta Selfridges Amazon DermStore Target Kohl's Priceline FeelUnique Beauty Brands 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 98% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

This pulls almost warm-toned me, due to my yellow undertones, but I expect it can look more neutral-to-cool depending on your coloring or what other makeup you’re wearing that day. It applied fairly evenly with good color coverage, but it dries quickly and tends to “crack” once dried (you can see it coming apart just slightly where you have deeper lip lines). It lasted for eight hours but the color pulled into lip lines noticeably. This shade was slightly drying after five hours of wear and worsened from there.

It had mostly opaque coverage that went on fairly well. It dries down quickly but has a little time to work, and then once it dries down, it feels soft and thin without cracking when you smile. The color lasted for eight hours and faded a little more heavily towards the center of the lips but not to the point where it left an obvious ring. It was a little drying after five and a half hours of wear. Colour Pop Solow (P, $6.00) is lighter, more muted, cooler. Make Up For Ever #4 (P, $19.00) is darker, glossier.

"[""Bite Beauty Opal Creme Lip Gloss Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Jul 13, 2015 July 13, 2015 Bite Beauty Opal Lip Gloss Bite Beauty Opal Lip Gloss ($24.00 for 0.14 oz.) is described as an “ultraviolet” with an “opalescent shine.” It’s a very light, milky lavender-white base with lighter lavender and bluish-violet pearl. Marc Jacobs Beauty Pink Steam (322) (P, $28.00) is darker, warmer. Bite Beauty Four (Watercolor) (LE, ) is less shimmery, brighter, more pigmented. MAC Reckless Desire (LE, $15.00) is less shimmery. MAC Vacant (LE, $15.00) is more shimmery. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . The gloss is supposed to be “silky and nourishing” that can be “worn alone or on top of any lip color.” It had sheer coverage, and the milky quality of the base color tended to pull into lip lines for me, though the gloss itself seemed to go on evenly. The shimmer is noticeable when worn alone, and the gloss wore for almost three hours on me with light tackiness and had a sweet, fruity scent. I didn’t find the formula to be hydrating, but it wasn’t drying either. It worked applied over lipstick, but you have to be careful as it can cause the underlying lip color to pull into lip lines as well. For me, the effect of the gloss is subtler than the lipstick, and I didn’t like that it tended to lessen the performance of any lipstick I tried with it. When I layered the gloss over the coordinating lipstick, it added glossiness but didn’t seem to change much else to my eye. 13 36 Opal 13 36 Opal B- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 7.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8 Texture 7.5 Longevity 4 Application 80% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Hare Polish The Tropics are Calling Collection Reviews, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Sep 15, 2013 September 15, 2013 Hare Polish The Tropics are Calling Collection Hare Polish The Tropics are Calling Collection features five shades inspired by, you guessed it, the tropics. I received about a week ago, and I wanted to wait until today to share them with you, because Hare will be restocking their Etsy shop at 11AM PST today. They will also be launching their fall collection, The Coin Operation (I don’t have swatches, but the brand has shared theirs). Hare Polish retails for $10.00 and each bottle contains 0.50 fl. oz. I applied each shade as recommended by Hare (one of the benefits of indie brands!), which I’ve noted by each shade. One of the reasons that I really enjoy Hare’s polishes is that they’re not top coats (or they don’t need to be used as such) and can be worn on their own. Most of them tend to have jelly bases, so two to three coats will get you where you need to be–but it depends on how opaque/translucent you want the polish to be. I typically get a week of wear out of Hare’s formula with minor tip wear but no chipping. It is, of course, polish loaded with glitter, so removal will be more time-consuming than the average polish. The consistency of these made it easy to apply both thinner and light-medium (in thickness) coats, so three coats didn’t feel or look heavy and thick on (with the exception of Washed Ashore , which was a little thicker relative to the others, and Flight of the Flamingos was the tiniest bit thicker but less thick than Washed Ashore ). Neon Palm is described as a “dusty, muted green jelly base brimming with a mix of neon pink and copper glitter in several shapes/sizes.” It has a green-tinged gray jelly base with coppery-gold and fuchsia glitters in square and hexagon shapes in both medium, small, and micro sizes. There is a very faint dusting of copper shimmer in the background. I applied two light-medium thick coats (as recommended), and the coverage was semi-opaque with some faint translucency. The glitters dispersed somewhat evenly, but if you want a slightly more uniform look, it could use some minor adjustments from pulling some into place. I couldn’t think of anything similar to this shade in my stash. Dancing Bird of Paradise is described as a “bright cherry red jelly base with a blend of various shapes/sizes of neon pink, satin white, gold glitter, flaky gold shimmer.” It’s a cool-toned, fuchsia-based red jelly base with larger fuchsia hexagon-shaped glitters, flecks of gold glitter in both smaller micro sizes as well as larger flakes. I applied two light-medium thick coats (as recommended) and had mostly opaque coverage with a faint translucency coming through. Each coat had a good amount of glitter, and I didn’t have to push or tug glitter into place, with the exception of one of the larger fuchsia hexagons. It has a lot of smaller-sized glitters, which spread easily across the nail. Hare Polish Leap Light Year has a similar base color (not quite as fuchsia), but the glitter composition is different–you have silver glitters as well as square-shaped glitters. Cult Nails Captivated has larger gold glitter and no large-sized glitter. Zoya Kimmy is more like a frost than a glitter, but it has a similar mix of red/gold, and the red is a bit warmer. See comparison swatches . Mad Chill is described as a “royal blue jelly base with a mix of various shapes/sizes of neon blue, white and ice blue glitter.” It’s an icy, navy blue jelly base with brighter, almost cyan-hued, blue glitters in various hexagon (maybe square?) shapes), as well as silvery-white square-shaped glitters. The background is dusted in a fine silver-white micro-shimmer. I applied three thin coats (as recommended), which yielded semi-opaque coverage. The glitters spread evenly across the nail without having to be tugged into place. I couldn’t think of any similar shades. Flight of the Flamingos is described as a “light grey jelly base with those striking neon pink glitters in various shapes/sizes, plus gold glitter and shimmer.” It has a cool-toned, beige jelly base with large square- and hexagon-shaped fuchsia glitters, as well as smaller fuchsia glitters, and a lot of paler gold glitter. It had mostly opaque coverage after applying two light-medium thick coats (as recommended). The larger fuchsia glitters could use some maneuvering to ensure they disperse evenly, though I did not find it necessary on all nails, but it did happen on two of the nails. I couldn’t think of any similar shades. Washed Ashore is described as a “peachy pink jelly polish with an ethereal mix of ice blue glitter, purple/blue iridescent glitter and silver shimmer.” It’s a soft, light-medium peach with hints of pink jelly base with iridescent glitter in square and hexagon shapes (on the smaller side), along with bits of blue and silver glitters. I applied two light-medium thick coats (as recommended). The consistency was just a bit thicker than the other shades. Because of the glitter composition, I also wasn’t able to think of possible dupes for this shade! 57 29 Neon Palm 57 29 Neon Palm A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 93% Total 45 27 Dancing Bird of Paradise 45 27 Dancing Bird of Paradise A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total 51 18 Mad Chill 51 18 Mad Chill A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 93% Total 57 18 Flight of the Flamingos 57 18 Flight of the Flamingos A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 92% Total 60 19 Washed Ashore 60 19 Washed Ashore A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 91% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Buxom Hold the Line Waterproof Eyeliner Reviews, Photos, Swatches (Part 2) Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Sep 15, 2013 September 15, 2013 Buxom Door’s Unlocked Hold the Line Eyeliner Buxom Door’s Unlocked Hold the Line Eyeliner ($17.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as a “metallic purple.” It’s a brightened, medium-dark violet purple with fuchsia undertones and a satiny sheen. In a single pass, it had rather weak color payoff, and it was only buildable to about semi-opaque color (about 80%). The consistency was a bit drier compared to other shades, though it wore well for ten hours before starting to thin. Urban Decay Ransom is very similar. MAC Designer Purple is darker, less fuchsia-toned. See comparison swatches . I’ll Be Waiting Hold the Line Eyeliner ($17.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as a “sparkling gunmetal gray.” It’s a medium silver-shimmered gray with a pearly sheen. It’s a bit darker than most silvers, but it is more metallic than just a gray shade. It had so-so color payoff in a single stroke, and it was slightly drier (but I wouldn’t describe it as dry, it was still quite creamy and glided across the skin easily) and only layered to semi-opaque color. It lasted nine and a half hours on my lower lash line and then started to thin. Bobbi Brown Chrome is lighter, more silver. Chanel Gris Scintillante is darker. See comparison swatches . Pick Me Up Hold the Line Eyeliner ($17.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as a “sparkling denim blue.” It’s a brightened navy blue with a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff in one layer, and it was buildable to mostly opaque color in two to three layers. This shade wore well for ten and a half hours before fading. MAC Blue Stripe is a touch darker. MAC Petrol Blue is darker. See comparison swatches . Ring My Bell Hold the Line Eyeliner ($17.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as an “emerald green.” It’s a medium-dark, blue-tinged green with a matte finish. It had so-so color payoff in a single stroke, but it was buildable to opaque color in two to three layers. It wore well for ten and a half hours and then began to fade. Revlon Emerald is a touch bluer. Sephora Good Mood is shimmery. Make Up For Ever #4K is similar. See comparison swatches . Hold the Line Waterproof Eyelinersr ($17.00 for 0.04 oz.) are supposed to “glide on like a gel” and wear for 14 hours. The formula is also supposed to be waterproof, transfer- and smudge-proof. I’ve been wearing these eyeliners on and off for the past few weeks, and while I like the formula a lot, a few of these shades could use more pigmentation, and of course, they don’t deliver on the 14 hours of wear as promised. They’re very long-wearing, relative to other eyeliners, at ten hours or so (on average), but it is significantly short of 14. The pencils had a creamy, glide-on consistency that didn’t skip or tug on the lash line. 18 34 Door's Unlocked 18 34 Door's Unlocked C+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Buxom 8 Product 7 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 7.5 Longevity 4 Application 78% Total 15 31 I'll Be Waiting 15 31 I'll Be Waiting C+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Buxom 8.5 Product 7 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 7 Longevity 4 Application 78% Total 22 26 Pick Me Up 22 26 Pick Me Up B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Buxom 9 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 7.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 86% Total 13 23 Ring My Bell 13 23 Ring My Bell B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Ulta Buxom 9 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 7.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 87% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Physicians Formula Warm Happy Booster Glow & Mood Boosting Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Jul 04, 2013 July 04, 2013 Physicians Formula Warm Happy Booster Glow & Mood Boosting Blush Physicians Formula Warm Happy Booster Glow & Mood Boosting Blush ($11.99 for 0.24 oz.) is a warm, light-medium coral-pink with a soft, sparkling sheen. MAC Simmer is more intense, darker. Edwared Bess Secret Affair is more orange. theBalm Frat Boy is pinker, less shimmery. NARS Deep Throat is a bit darker. MAC Supercontinental is warmer, less pink. MAC Legendary is lighter. MAC Flaming Chic is less shimmery. Chanel Fleur de Lotus is a bit warmer, brighter. See comparison swatches . The formula is supposed to give a “soft iridescence to highlight contour and add radiance to cheeks.” It had good color payoff that was buildable from sheer to semi-opaque but it may get lost on medium-dark to darker complexions. The texture was soft and smooth, and it was easy to blend it on the skin. It had a sparkling finish, so there were a few visible bits of sparkle, but it is rather fine so it didn’t seem to emphasize pores on my skin. It wore well for eight hours when I tested it, and it started to fade just before nine hours of wear. The powder is scented with violet, but I didn’t notice it once applied, only in the pan. It comes in four shades, and I plan to review Natural as well, but I haven’t tested that one yet. But I did take photos, and between the two, there is not a major difference. If you have cooler undertones, I expect you’ll see a more notable difference, because Natural is warmer with less pink, but on my warmer, medium skin tone, it was hard to tell the difference between the two on (so just a heads up–I will do a full review of Natural once I’ve had a chance to wear it!). 146 34 Warm 146 34 Warm A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Ulta Amazon Priceline 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Sephora Blonde Ambition & Roof Top Party Contour Eye Pencils Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Jul 04, 2013 July 04, 2013 Sephora Blonde Ambition Contour Eye Pencil Sephora Blonde Ambition Contour Eye Pencil ($9.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as “beige.” It’s a pale, gilded beige with a pearly sheen. It had good color payoff in a single pass, but it’s only semi-opaque and buildable to about semi-opaque, even though I tried to layer it. It’s sufficient for brightening the eye, and it can be evened out with a brush to blend the eyeliner together. NARS Rue Bonaparte is matte. MAC Gilded White is very similar, perhaps a touch whiter. Other champagne eyeliners are warmer, more beige. See comparison swatches . Roof Top Party Contour Eye Pencil ($9.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as “gunmetal.” It’s an olive brown; a murky, dirty brown with a hint of green and subtle shimmer. The color payoff was good in one stroke, and it was buildable to mostly opaque color with two or so passes of the eyeliner. Urban Decay Stash is richer–darker and more intense. MAC Forever Green is greener. bareMinerals 10AM is darker, more intense. See comparison swatches . I liked both of these, but they weren’t as intense on the eye as they looked in the pencil–it was almost as if the consistency was a little too waxy so the color didn’t build up to full intensity as a result. Though, the waxiness enabled both shades to glide across the skin easily–no skipping or dragging. Both shades wore well for eight hours on me with very minimal thinning but no smudging or migrating. 51 68 Blonde Ambition 51 68 Blonde Ambition B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora Brazil Sephora (Australia) Sephora (PL) 8.5 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 88% Total 32 36 Roof Top Party 32 36 Roof Top Party A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora Brazil Sephora (Australia) Sephora (PL) 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""MAC Bellgreens Eyeshadow Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Jan 20, 2015 January 20, 2015 MAC Bellgreens Eyeshadow Palette MAC Bellgreens Eyeshadow Palette ($44.00 for 0.10 oz.) is a green-hued set of shades. The palette contains six shades in total, with two shades being part of the permanent range (Gorgeous Gold and Charcoal Brown). There was only dud in the palette, while the other five were very easy to work with and performed well. Even the miss of the palette was still blendable enough on the lid that it was still usable, but it will take a little extra effort to get the right level of intensity and diffusion. I was very surprised to see that the palette only contained 0.10 oz. worth of product, which is the equivalent of two full-sized eyeshadows. Despite the size of the palette, it really doesn’t have much product. MAC’s eyeshadow quads typically contain 0.19 oz. almost double what’s inside this one. Fresh Blade is described as a “pale frosted yellow [with a Veluxe Pearl finish].” It’s a brightened, golden yellow with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had fantastic pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that was dense and buttery. It wore well for eight and a half hours before fading. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Gorgeous Gold is described as a “muted yellow gold [with a Veluxe Pearl finish].” It’s a green-tinged, light-medium gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. There is a green-gold duochrome to it, but it is subtle. The eyeshadow had good color payoff with a soft, blendable texture. This shade also lasted for eight and a half hours on me. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Vicuna is described as a “light neutral olive [with a Frost finish].” It’s a muted, medium golden brown with a pearly sheen. It had really nice pigmentation with a blendable texture that was a smidgen powdery at times, but it was just barely powdery. This shade showed signs of fading after eight and a half hours of wear. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Savant is described as a “mid-tone mustard lime [with a Satin finish].” It’s a medium-dark, dirty olive green–it really is like mustard and lime together–with a mostly matte finish. It was really velvety with a smooth, soft texture that blended well but still adhered well with good color payoff to bare skin, which was a happy surprise. It wore well for eight hours on me. I couldn’t think of any really great dupes for this shade, because it’s darker and not a brighter, more typical chartreuse-like green. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Charcoal Brown is described as a “muted taupe brown [with a Matte finish].” It’s a muted, medium-dark taupe brown with a matte finish. It had good color payoff that was fairly blendable. The texture was soft, finely-milled, and almost felt like a Matte2 with how velvety and blendable it was. On me, the color wore well for eight hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Sushi Green is described as a “charcoal olive with multi-dimensional pearl [with a Velvet finish].” It’s a dark brown with subtle, olive undertones and a slight gold sparkle. It was a firmer, stiffer shade that had semi-opaque pigmentation that was harder to work with. My best advice is to apply using a fluffier brush to minimize how work it will take to diffuse and blend out. It lasted for eight hours.

"[""Laura Geller Guava Baked Gelato Swirl Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jul 27, 2015 July 27, 2015 Laura Geller Guava Baked Gelato Swirl Blush Laura Geller Guava Baked Gelato Swirl Blush ($26.00 for 0.17 oz.) is described as a “peachy pink.” It’s a brightened, medium-dark pink-coral with a subtle, golden sheen. Charlotte Tilbury Las Salinas (P, $45.00) is more shimmery, lighter. NARS Panic (Right) (P, ) is warmer. MAC Secret Admirer (LE, $22.00) is less shimmery, brighter. Surratt Beauty Ponceau (P, $32.00) is less shimmery, lighter. IT Cosmetics Pretty in Peony (P, $24.00) is warmer. NARS Soulshine #1 (LE, $30.00) is warmer.

See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . The formula is described as having vivid and “translucent, vibrant color” with a “flirty, natural-looking flush” that goes on “like a powder but feels like a cream.” They have a very similar texture as the Baked Gelato Swirl Illuminators I reviewed earlier this year, which I totally fell in love with. The texture has a smooth, denser feel to it that has good color payoff that’s incredibly easy to blend out on the skin. The pigmentation varies from shade to shade, but they are generally quite pigmented. Guava was intensely pigmented with a soft, blendable consistency that was dense and almost cream-like but applied and blended exactly as a powder blush would. I felt like it almost melted into the skin and gave a more stained-like appearance, but it was very even (and stains can be tricky to work with for that reason, at least for me!). What’s nice about the formula is you can use less and blend out for a tint of color or apply normally and get a bold cheek look. The blush has a luminous sheen that gives it a dewy look without emphasizing pores. It wore well for almost nine hours on me before fading slightly.

FORMULA OVERVIEW | Urban Decay Vice Lipstick ($17.00 for 0.11 oz.) is available in six finishes, which are primarily distinguished by level of sheen, shimmer content, and coverage. Mega Mattes are the thinnest and have the most “cling” as they are drier and more matte (but most are semi-matte and not a totally flat matte) and can be drying, though they are longer-wearing. Comfort Mattes are creamier, a little denser, with richer color payoff on average (they are the most pigmented out of the finishes), and have a satin finish that is fairly comfortable to wear, usually lightly hydrating, and longer-wearing. Creams are usually softer and creamier, though not too soft (they don’t mush or break from the base easily), with some being tackier and stiffer in the tube until they warm up against the lips; they have good color payoff, are hydrating, and are comfortable to wear but have more typical wear (four to six hours–six hours for deeper/richer shades like a red). Sheers and Sheer Shimmers have a more balm-like consistency that feels a little thinner but is wetter/more emollient than Mega Mattes , so ultimately, they feel quite different applied; they have sheerer coverage, though more semi-sheer to semi-opaque than very sheer, and have the shortest wear time at two to fours with light hydration. Metallized is the most shimmery of the finishes, though some of the other finishes have shades that are actually as shimmery (to me), but the Metallized formula has a thinner, more emollient base that isn’t as dense or as cream-like as the Creams ; they feel more like the Sheers but a bit heavier and more pigmented (but seem to run semi-opaque to opaque, not always fully opaque) with average wear (four to five hours), light hydration. The Revolution formula–generally–felt a little more hydrating and pigmented on the lips, but these seem to wear a little longer; some of the shades that were in Revolution and are now in Vice (particularly the Creams, Sheers, and Sheer Shimmers) feel virtually the same on to me. The Comfort Mattes are the only ones that felt largely different–more satiny than matte, less dense compared to Matte Revolution. A note on packaging: an average Revolution lipstick weighed 1.0 oz. in total, while a Vice Lipstick weighed 0.7 oz. in total. The weight distribution for a Revolution lipstick was: 0.2 oz. for the cap alone, 0.8 oz. for the base. The weight distribution for a Vice lipstick was: 0.2 oz. for the cap alone, 0.5 oz. for the base. The decrease is felt primarily in the sturdiness/weighted feeling of the base, so I find the older Revolutions to stand better on their own, but thrown into a cup or jar for storage, it doesn’t really matter. The more weighted base does give a greater sense of heft when applying, since you hold the base. The caps are the same total weight, but the Revolution caps are shorter and, as a result, maybe 1mm thicker, while the Vice caps are longer and spread the same weight of material over a larger area. All but two out of 120 lipstick caps felt very secure, and then about four were extremely secure and difficult to uncap, but otherwise, there is a soft “click” and the caps seem to stay on without easily coming off. All that being said, they seem to be the same packaging used in the Gwen Stefani and Alice Through the Looking Glass collaborations, though the interior tube felt a little higher-end, even though they all weigh the same. Revolution Lipsticks were $22.00 for 0.09 oz., which works out to be $244.44/oz., and these are $17.00 for 0.11 oz., which works out to be $154.55/oz. So while the packaging does feel less substantial and cheaper, you are paying $5 less and getting more for your money, but if you really liked the heavier base of Revolution lipsticks, you might miss that feeling with the new packaging. 100 9 Rapture 100 9 Rapture A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total 75 9 Crisis 75 9 Crisis A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 96% Total 80 8 Tampered 80 8 Tampered A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 93% Total 42 12 Safe Word 42 12 Safe Word B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 7.5 Longevity 5 Application 87% Total 34 9 Peyote 34 9 Peyote B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 8.5 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 7.5 Longevity 5 Application 86% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""MAC Sweet Sakura, Dozen Carnations, Pretty Boy Cremesheen Pearl Lipsticks Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jul 27, 2015 July 27, 2015 MAC Dozen Carnations Lipstick MAC Sweet Sakura Lipstick ($16.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as a “true red with soft gold pearl.” It’s a brightened, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and fine gold pearl. It leans warm to me, but it may appear more neutral on those with cooler or more neutral undertones. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied smoothly on the lips, though it takes a few seconds for the formula to really glide on as it starts off too firm. This shade lasted for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating. Guerlain Gala (P, $51.00) is less shimmery, glossier. Too Faced Red Stiletto (P, $22.00) is lighter, brighter. MAC Must Be Red (LE, $16.00) is less shimmery, darker. MAC Night to Remember (LE, $16.00) is less shimmery. MAC Cherry Glaze (LE, $20.00) is less shimmery, warmer, glossier. Estee Lauder Envious (P, $30.00) is lighter, brighter. MAC Cherry Glaze (LE, $20.00) is less shimmery, warmer, glossier. Revlon 5th Ave. Red (LE, $7.99) is cooler. MAC True Love’s Kiss (LE, $16.00) is less shimmery, warmer. MAC Head in the Clouds (LE, $16.00) is lighter, brighter. Guerlain Red Strass (327) (P, $37.00) is brighter. Guerlain Red Hot (328) (P, $37.00) is less shimmery, more muted, cooler. MAC Oblivion (LE, $16.00) is brighter. MAC Audacious (P, $23.00) is less shimmery, brighter. MAC Dozen Carnations (P, $16.00) is darker, cooler. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . MAC Dozen Carnations Lipstick ($16.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as an “intense warm tomato red.” It’s a brightened, medium-dark red with warm, orange undertones and fine gold pearl. It was semi-opaque with a firmer, almost tacky, consistency that really was better held to the lips for a few seconds to warm it up or else it dragged. It lasted for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating. Guerlain Red Strass (327) (P, $37.00) is more shimmery, cooler. MAC Excite (LE, $16.00) is lighter, warmer.

Guerlain Gilda (P, $51.00) is less shimmery, brighter. Chanel Coromandel (P, $34.00) is darker. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . MAC Pretty Boy Lipstick ($16.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as an “intense pink coral.” It’s a muted, medium-dark coral-pink with warm undertones and pink and silver pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered evenly and lasted for four hours on me, but it was a hair drying. The consistency was firmer and needs time to soften from the heat of the lips before it really glides on easily. Dior Sunset (660) (LE, $34.00) is less shimmery, brighter.

Guerlain Pamplelune (P, $35.00) is warmer. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . Formula Summary: MAC Lipstick ($16.00 for 0.10 oz.) has a variety of finishes, which results in color coverage, finish, comfort, wear, and texture to vary from finish to finish. Lustres tend to be sheer to semi-sheer with a thin, slippery consistency and wear one to three hours; they are lightly to moderately drying on me, despite their slip. Cremesheens typically have semi-opaque to opaque coverage, wear an average of four hours, are sometimes drying and sometimes not drying, and have a light shine to their finish. Amplifieds have a light sheen, opaque coverage, slightly thicker consistency but is less “heavy” in look compared to satins; they are typically not drying but not hydrating and can wear four to six hours. Satins have less sheen compared to Amplifieds but have similar coverage and wear. Mattes, particularly newer iterations of the finish, have a velvety, silicone-like consistency that makes them easier to apply without drag, and they typically have opaque coverage and wear four to six hours, but they can be drying. Retro Mattes are ultra-matte with a very flat, nearly no-sheen finish, and they are often stiffer in the tube but thinner in consistency compared to satins or mattes; they are often drying but wear four to eight hours. All MAC Lipsticks are vanilla-scented with no discernible taste. 59 18 Sweet Sakura 59 18 Sweet Sakura B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 87% Total 52 19 Dozen Carnations 52 19 Dozen Carnations B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 87% Total 67 17 Pretty Boy 67 17 Pretty Boy B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 87% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Burberry Hydrangea Pink (P, $42.00) is less shimmery, warmer. MAC Supernova (LE, $27.00) is warmer. MAC Hot Nights (LE, $21.00) is darker, more muted.

See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . The formula is described as having vivid and “translucent, vibrant color” with a “flirty, natural-looking flush” that goes on “like a powder but feels like a cream.” They have a very similar texture as the Baked Gelato Swirl Illuminators I reviewed earlier this year, which I totally fell in love with. The texture has a smooth, denser feel to it that has good color payoff that’s incredibly easy to blend out on the skin. The pigmentation varies from shade to shade, but they are generally quite pigmented. Plumberry was incredibly pigmented with full color coverage easily achieved if desired, which means it’s a good idea to use a lighter hand and/or feathery brush if you want sheerer coverage. The texture has a smooth, dense feel to it where the color applies and blends out easily while feeling lightweight. There’s a subtle sheen to the finish that doesn’t translate into overt shimmer, and it doesn’t emphasize pores. On my skin, the blush wore well for eight and a half hours before fading.

The brand has divided their eyeshadows into two finishes: Powderluxe Pressed Eye Shadows (matte, pearl, and sparkle finishes) and “modern, hybrid pigmented formulas” (I’m not sure why one type got an official name and the other did not!) with the latter having “metallic, satin sheen, iridescence, and holographic brilliance finishes.” The key to determining which is which is to look at the shape of the eyeshadow–the “hybrid” shades are domed, and they tend to have a lot more sparkle in them, too. These shades are often recommended to be applied with a “dampened brush to achieve an eye-opening effect” or with “fingertip[s],” though some of the Powderluxe shades can be used wet or dry, too (per the brand). Pat McGrath actually breaks down how to apply each shade here . It’s all I ever wanted from a brand: to actually be more specific on a shade-by-shade level if, in fact, they intend for shades to differ in pigmentation or application! There’s something about the way the palettes in the Mothership line are designed that makes me think they’re artistic, conceptual palettes that will be most versatile when paired with other eyeshadows and palettes one might have in one’s stash. There were definitely looks to be done within the palette, but I often wanted to reach for outside shades to bring looks to their fullest potential. It will also perform the best if you already use dampened brushes with high-sparkle/high-shimmer eyeshadows. The packaging is hefty; there’s no question that some of the high price tag is due to the heavier packaging and the metal-esque plate on the exterior and the faceted mirror inside. I do, however, wish the brand had labeled the eyeshadows somewhere on the palette along with the palette’s name. 17 3 Subliminal 17 3 Subliminal B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Pat McGrath Labs 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 88% Total 01 /02 View All Pat McGrath Skinshow Nude Eyeshadow Pat McGrath Skinshow Nude Eyeshadow View On One Page Skinshow Nude Skinshow Nude is a light, golden beige with warm undertones and a metallic sheen.

"[""Chanel Rêve d’Orient Eyeshadow Quad Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Nov 27, 2014 November 27, 2014 Chanel Rêve d’Orient Eyeshadow Quad Chanel Rêve d’Orient Eyeshadow Quad ($70.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a new, limited edition Quad that will be available on chanel.com on December 1st. As a bonus, any orders with the Quad will get complimentary overnight shipping (and therein is the Cyber Monday deal for ya!). The formula of the quad seemed similar to the recent Tisse series quads that Chanel released a few months ago, but these do have a raised star pattern on each shade (otherwise, it doesn’t seem different). All four shades performed well with nice pigmentation, soft, blendable textures, and long-wear (eight to nine hours). They can be used wet or dry, though I don’t think it’s necessary to use them damp to get good performance out of them, but applying the shades with a dampened brush gives a slightly more intense look and a smoother, less frosted (more metallic) finish. You may find that you can easily dupe this with shades you already own, though, as there was no shortage of dupe options for the shades in this quad. Rêve d’Orient #1 is described as a “luminous brown.” It’s a medium-dark, golden brown with warm, yellow undertones and a pearly finish–a little more sheen than satin but not a frost. It had excellent pigmentation applied wet or dry, though the drier application was a touch richer with less product. It wore well for nine hours on me. Tarte Bastille in the Night (LE) is darker, cooler-toned. Tarte Too Haute to Handle (LE) is lighter. Guerlain Petrouchka #5 (LE) is darker. Make Up For Ever S616 Chocolate (P, $21.00) is less shimmery, yellower. Make Up For Ever I606 Pinky Earth (P, $21.00) is redder. Kat Von D Papilio (P) is similar.

Chanel Intuition #4 (P) is similar. Inglot #421 (P, $6.00) is more shimmery, warmer. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Rêve d’Orient #2 is described as a “glimmering beige.” It’s a brightened, white gold with warm, ivory undertones and a frosted, metallic finish. Applied dry, it was semi-opaque with a more frosted finish, whereas when I applied it to the skin with a dampened brush, it had a smoother, more metallic finish. It wore well for eight and a half hours before fading slightly. MAC Just Gleaming (LE, $19.50) is less warm-toned. Guerlain Petrouchka #1 (LE) is darker. LORAC Cashmere (LE) is darker. LORAC Sand (LE) is darker. LORAC Opal (LE) is similar. Hello Kitty Bright (LE) is similar. MAC Amberluxe #1 (P) is similar. Make Up For Ever I414 Yellow Ivory (P, $21.00) is brighter.

Disney by Sephora Charming (LE) is similar. Disney by Sephora Sea Shells (LE) is similar. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Rêve d’Orient #3 is described as a “rich gold.” It’s a brightened, medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color payoff both wet and dry, but the wet application made it appear slightly darker and richer. This shade started to fade after eight hours of wear. Kat Von D Brass Knuckles (LE) is lighter. Guerlain Petrouchka #2 (LE) is warmer. Gucci Beauty Antique Gold (P, $37.00) is lighter. Ardency Inn Sunday (P, $21.00) is warmer.

Chanel Topkapi #4 (LE) is similar. bareMinerals Remix (LE) is warmer. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Rêve d’Orient #4 is described as a “deep black.” It’s a rich, dark black with neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin finish. It was intensely pigmented both wet and dry, though it is a bit smoother and looks inkier in person when applied damp. Thankfully, it is incredibly blendable with a silky, finely-milled texture. This shade stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me. Make Up For Ever S102 Onyx (P, $21.00) is similar. NARS Sycorax (P, $29.00) is softer. Chanel Jardin Zen #4 (LE) is warmer.

"[""MAC Smoky Black Friday Veluxe Pearlfusion Shadow Trio Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Nov 28, 2014 November 28, 2014 MAC Smoky Black Friday Veluxe Pearlfusion Shadow Trio MAC Smoky Black Friday Veluxe Pearlfusion Shadow Trio ($25.00 for 0.07 oz.) is the brand’s online-only, limited edition offering for Black Friday. It’s a mix of warm white, medium silver, and shimmery black for a smoky, monochromatic eye. It uses MAC’s Veluxe Pearlfusion formula, which is designed to give “sheer coverage with a soft finish” when used dry and “super saturation of colour with metallic brilliance” when used wet. Some of the Veluxe Pearlfusion offerings are quite nice, but others are misses. This one was a miss for me, due to just so-so quality. Smokey Black Friday #1 is a bright white with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had a soft, lightly powdery, consistency that yielded sheer color coverage applied dry and semi-opaque coverage applied damp. It lasted for eight hours before creasing. Guerlain Cygne Blanc #2 (LE) is less metallic. Too Faced Nutcracker (LE, $16.00) is less metallic. Chanel Oiseaux de Nuit #1 (LE) is less metallic.

"[""Charlotte Tilbury Fallen Angel Eyeshadow Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Nov 26, 2014 November 26, 2014 Charlotte Tilbury Fallen Angel Eyeshadow Palette Charlotte Tilbury Fallen Angel Eyeshadow Palette ($65.00 for 0.10 oz.) is a new, limited edition palette that uses a different formula than her other palettes. It is a wet/dry formula that’s supposed to have a “rich and buildable layer of color” when applied dry with “three times the color intensity and … [a] metal reflective finish” when applied damp. The palette is really easy to work with, and the four shades performed well consistently with good color payoff, soft, blendable textures, and long-wear (eight hours). It is true that the color is more buildable (or sheer-able) if you use it dry, whereas a damp brush will yield very opaque results with (seemingly) less product, though both application methods yielded richer color payoff without fuss. Ultimately, applying the shades with a dampened brush does seem to give slightly richer color with more depth and a stronger sheen, but it is a subtle difference–not three times the intensity (I think the third shade had the “biggest” difference, while the first had the least) and not all were metallic when damp. It’s a really lovely palette if you like your warmer, smokier neutrals with a lot of shimmer, but you may want to check your stash for dupes first as these were more dupable shades. The price point on this is higher than the regular line ($65 vs. $52), while quantity also decreased (0.10 oz. vs. 0.18 oz.), and I wish it was one or the other. This type of wet/dry formula seems similar to ones like Chanel’s recent eyeshadow quads, Tom Ford’s Nude Dip quad (which is similar in color composition, too), Estee Lauder Gelees, NARS Dual Intensity, MAC Extra Dimension, and so forth, which all tended to have lower quantities compared to their traditional powder formulas, but it was more of a mixed bag with regards to whether a brand increased the price per ounce as well. For reference, the palette is the same physical size of the regular line, so visually, they don’t seem smaller. Fallen Angel #1 is a light, golden beige with warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had good color applied dry, and it was fully opaque applied damp, where it was also a bit more shimmery and brighter. The consistency was soft without being powdery and applied smoothly to the skin, while it wore well for eight hours before fading. Anastasia Blush (LE) is darker. Dior Cuir Cannage #2 (P) is similar. Charlotte Tilbury The Rebel #1 (P) is a touch cooler-toned. Stila Kitten (P) is darker. Tom Ford Beauty Nude Dip #1 (LE) is very similar. Kat Von D Galore (LE) is brighter. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Fallen Angel #2 is a golden taupe brown with a frosted, metallic finish. Applied dry, it appeared slightly warmer and a touch more muted, while applied damp gave it a smoother sheen; the differences are subtle, though. It wore well for eight hours on me. Urban Decay Resist (LE, $18.00) is darker. Laura Mercier Topaz (P) is less shimmery. MAC Quintessential (LE, $15.00) is warmer, less shimmery. Make Up For Ever D562 Taupe Platinum (P, $21.00) is more shimmery, darker. Sleek MakeUP Aladdin’s Lamp (LE, $9.99) is darker. Chanel Tisse Rivoli #1 (P) is darker, less shimmery, cooler-toned.

"['MAC x BollyDoll Brush Kit Review & Photos Sample Reviews Dec 09, 2014 December 09, 2014 MAC x BollyDoll Brush Kit MAC x BollyDoll Brush Kit ($49.50) includes five travel-sized brushes and a patterned brush rkeper. The brushes have glossy black handles with golden patterns on them and white bristles (except the 204SE Lash, which is a black mascara spoolie). The brush holder has a shiny black ribbon that ties it together, and on the interior, there are five slots so each brush has its own home. The brush holder is made out of 100% polyester with a very smooth, soft feel on the exterior and a slightly more textured fabric on the interior. The brushes are consistent with this past holiday’s brush sets in that they seem improved over the last few years of brush set releases, but the full-sized versions will still out-perform, mostly in regards to softness, though I felt like the shapes of the eye brushes were larger, more rounded, and fluffier here than their full versions. The shapes of the brushes just seem a lot less precise with less defined shape here, particularly in the case of the 217SE. The 204SE Lash and the 168SE Large Angled Contour were the most similar to their full versions. The 219SE is longer and more rounded, so it can actually be nicer for smudging out color (less tapered/sharp). The 239SE seems fluffier and less flat, so it wasn’t as good for packing on color, but it worked well for blending. See more photos!

"[""Tom Ford Preston, Justin, Cooper, Jack, Francesco Lip Colors Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Dec 12, 2014 December 12, 2014 Tom Ford Preston, Justin, Cooper, Jack, Francesco Lip Colors Tom Ford Lips & Boys Lipstick ($32.00 for 0.07 oz.) is segmented into color families, and this post features the “fuchsia to magentas.” It’s a very description of this set of shades! These all seemed to have a little more slip and creaminess compared to the average Lip Color from Tom Ford, which made a few shades harder to apply without getting streaks/lines. Most of these shades are more dupable than not, so you may find a new go-to or else feel like you’re covered with your current stash. Of these, I thought the best performers were Cooper and Francesco. Right now, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus are both accepting pre-orders for the Lips & Boys collection; they officially release on December 26th (and will also be at other retailers and Tom Ford’s website at that time). The Lips & Boys shades seem a lot smaller than the full-sized Lip Colors in their tubes, but in terms of actual product, it’s 0.07 oz. vs. 0.10 oz. These are actually cheaper by the ounce at $457.14/oz. compared to $500/oz. for full-size. I liked that the packaging felt the same as full-sized, just smaller, but it didn’t feel cheapened. The bullet of lipstick itself was also wide enough at the base that it didn’t feel really skinny or difficult to use, and it wasn’t prone at breaking at the base as some miniature-sized lipsticks are. Preston Lipstick ($32.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a brightened, cool-toned, light-medium pink with very strong blue undertones. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a more emollient consistency that slid around lips moreso than other shades in the range. It was hydrating, but it also looked somewhat streaky. This shade lasted for four hours on me. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Justin Lipstick ($32.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a brightened, fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and lighter pink and fuchsia pearl. It had a glossier, wetter finish, though this one applied more evenly than Preston. It had fairly rich color payoff, but there was a light translucency to the color that will let the natural lip color come through. This shade wore well for four and a half hours, left a light stain behind, and was moisturizing over time. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Cooper Lipstick ($32.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a lightly brightened, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a very fine fuchsia pearl. It had very nearly opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly, while the color itself wore well for six hours and left a stain behind. It was comfortable to wear and hydrating over time. It is one of the more dupable shades in the line-up, though. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Jack Lipstick ($32.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a slightly muted, medium magenta pink with cool, blue undertones and a light shine. It had more slip in its consistency, so it glided on really easily and felt hydrating instantly, but it did leave lines if you pressed your lips together as the color moved somewhat. The brighter and darker coloring made it less apparent than it might have been had the color been light, but it was still there. This shade stayed on well for four hours with slight staining, and it was nicely hydrating. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Francesco Lipstick ($32.00 for 0.07 oz.) is a brightened, medium-dark fuchsia-red with lighter fuchsia shimmer. It had mostly opaque pigmentation with a creamy, lightweight texture that went on evenly and smoothly. The color wore well for almost six hours and left a reddish stain behind. It was lightly hydrating but not quite as moisturizing as some of the other shades featured in this review.

Lip Lustre Charlotte Tilbury Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds (L.S.D.) Lip Lustre ($22.00 for 0.10 fl. oz.) is a light, peachy orange with lighter gold shimmer. MAC Water Deities (LE, $15.00) is more shimmery. NARS Bimini (P, $26.00) is lighter. MAC Ultimate Dish (LE, $15.00) is similar. MAC Satin Slip (LE, $20.00) is sheerer. MAC Double Happiness (P, $20.00) is lighter. Hourglass Imagine (P, $28.00) is lighter. See comparison swatches / view dupes . It’s semi-sheer with a milkier consistency, so it doessn’t go on evenly and has a tendency to slip into lip lines and settle. Due to the way it looks on its own, I think it is better layered over a lipstick or lip liner, so you can get the shimmery, glossy finish but manage the settling. It has a fair amount of sparkle and shine, but I think it could stay glossier for longer, as it seemed to lose a lot of shine within an hour and a half of wear. The gloss wore for a total of three hours for me and was nicely hydrating while I wore it. 8 25 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds (L.S.D.) 8 25 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds (L.S.D.)

It had medium, buildable pigmentation–both the version in the palette as well as the standalone version I have are actually less pigmented than most of Becca’s powder highlighters. The texture didn’t feel rough, but there were larger sparkles in it, so it did not seem as creamy or as finely-milled compared to most of the range. On the skin, it was easily blended across the cheeks and high points of the face and yielded a strong, metallic sheen that did not emphasize pores on me. It wore well for eight and a half hours before fading. Top Dupes Formula Overview Ingredients Top Dupes View Swatches View All Dupes Becca Rose Gold (P, $38.00) is glossier (95% similar).

Formula Overview $38.00/0.28 oz. - $135.71 Per Ounce The Shimmering Skin Perfector Pressed formula is described as having an ""ultra-reflective shine"" with a ""creamy"" texture that ""applies seamlessly."" In general, the texture of the highlighters is incredibly smooth, silky, and finely-milled with frosted to metallic finishes and the occasional more sparkly finish. They tend to have a high-shine, more metallic finish and are a stronger highlighter, so they are going to be best suited to someone who likes an obvious highlight over a very subtle one. That being said, with a fan brush and a deft hand, one could certainly achieve a subtler, all-over luminosity as well, but if one takes a typical, tapered highlighting brush, there will be quite a bit of pigment and highlight on the skin. I find that some shades can emphasize the look of pores slightly to moderately, depending on application. They tend to last between eight to nine hours on me.

It had good pigmentation with a soft, slightly looser consistency that kicked up some excess shimmer in the pan. The powder diffused well over the skin and was blendable. There was slightly emphasis of my skin’s natural texture if worn heavily, but there was just a strong, metallic sheen when worn at medium or sheerer coverage.

Formula Overview $38.00/0.28 oz. - $135.71 Per Ounce The Shimmering Skin Perfector Pressed formula is described as having an ""ultra-reflective shine"" with a ""creamy"" texture that ""applies seamlessly."" In general, the texture of the highlighters is incredibly smooth, silky, and finely-milled with frosted to metallic finishes and the occasional more sparkly finish. They tend to have a high-shine, more metallic finish and are a stronger highlighter, so they are going to be best suited to someone who likes an obvious highlight over a very subtle one. That being said, with a fan brush and a deft hand, one could certainly achieve a subtler, all-over luminosity as well, but if one takes a typical, tapered highlighting brush, there will be quite a bit of pigment and highlight on the skin. I find that some shades can emphasize the look of pores slightly to moderately, depending on application. They tend to last between eight to nine hours on me.

This is such a beautifully intense shade that is so forgiving and blendable that it is going to be a real versatile product, regardless of whether you’re very fair or much deeper in color. I think the subtle warmth of it helps it straddle the fence for warmer and cooler skin tones, too. It had very rich, true-to-pan color payoff, but it’s the smooth, velvety texture that makes it easy to work with. The color blends easily over the skin for smooth, even, and glowing rosy red cheeks. It has that same luminous sheen that gives the skin a healthy glow without emphasizing pores or having really obvious shimmer or frost. This particular shade wore longer than a lot of the other Cheek Pops at nine and a half hours. I’m so glad Clinique has added this really rich, deep hue to their line-up (which has trended towards softer shades).

"[""Too Faced Melted Strawberry Melted Liquified Long-wear Lipstick Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Lip Products Mar 16, 2015 March 16, 2015 Too Faced Melted Strawberry Melted Liquified Long-wear Lipstick Too Faced Melted Strawberry Melted Liquified Long-wear Lipstick ($21.00 for 0.40 fl. oz.) is described as a “blood orange.” It’s a bright, medium red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a glossy finish. (By the by, am I the only one amused by the double-fruit description, from strawberry to blood orange!) Tom Ford Beauty Luciano (LE, $32.00) is less glossy, darker. Guerlain Rouge Parade (820) (LE, $51.00) is darker. Estee Lauder Vengeful Red (P, $30.00) is darker. Bite Beauty Pomegranate (P, $24.00) is warmer. Anna Sui Minnie Mouse (01) (LE) is similar.

Guerlain Gala (P, $51.00) is slightly warmer. Buxom Scoundrel (P, $21.00) is darker. See comparison swatches / view dupes . It’s a show shopping red with its incredibly rich, opaque color coverage and high-shine finish. As we’ve come to expect from this formula, a little goes a long way. For really crisp lines, you’ll want to reach for a lip brush, but it is possible to apply directly from the tube with an even edge overall. The texture is lightweight without sliding around a lot, but it doesn’t dry down and feel clingy, so it’s more comfortable to wear than some other liquid lipstick formulas (this isn’t transfer-proof, though!). On me, the color wore on and on and on–I took it off after eight hours, even though the color was in good shape, and there was a stain left behind. I didn’t experience the color feathering or bleeding when I tried it, but I’m not prone to either. It was neither drying nor hydrating over time.

"[""Too Faced Semi-Sweet Chocolate Bar Eye Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Dec 12, 2014 December 12, 2014 Too Faced Semi-Sweet Chocolate Bar Eye Palette Too Faced Semi-Sweet Chocolate Bar Eye Palette ($49.00 for 0.53 oz.) contains sixteen eyeshadows, and it is described as a “deeper, warmer version” of the original Chocolate Bar palette. (Why couldn’t they have gone for a deeper, cooler-toned version instead? The first was certainly warm-toned!) The palette is decent overall with a few shades that could be better, but most had a soft, silky consistency that wasn’t too powdery but remained blendable. The formula here is thinner rather than really buttery or dense, but only a few felt dry and thin. I didn’t like the glittery shade included in this palette, as it didn’t adhere well to skin, resulted in fall out all over the place (both during application as well as during wear), and doesn’t layer well over the other eyeshadows so it seemed like a waste to me. If I take out Pink Sugar’s rating (and pretend it doesn’t exist), it boosts the palette’s grade to a higher B (not quite a B+). If you’ve purchased the original Chocolate Bar palette recently, you may have a thinner version than the ones released initially. If you bought several months back, this palette is noticeably thinner (but the rest of it is the same, so they’ll stack). The magnetic closure felt weaker on the Semi-Sweet palette, which makes me a little wary for traveling, but it seems like it should be okay. Two larger-sized eyeshadows contain less product (0.07 oz. compared to 0.10 oz.) while the standard-sized eyeshadows remained the same (0.03 oz. each). The larger-sized eyeshadows look like they’re not as tall and are just wider than the standard-sized but keep the heights the same. Here are some comparisons of shades that were reasonably similar between the two palettes: White Chocolate (Original) is slightly darker than Coconut Creme (Semi-Sweet) Gilded Ganache (Original) is a more shimmery, darker version of Cocoa Chili (Semi-Sweet) Milk Chocolate (Original) is a smidgen darker than Mousse (Semi-Sweet) Hazelnut (Original) is slightly less metallic compared to Frosting (Semi-Sweet) Licorice is a medium-dark black with subtle warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. The texture was slightly thin and stiffer, so the color payoff was decent but not intense. It lasted for eight hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Coconut Creme is a light beige with warm, creamy yellow tones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff, was slightly dusty, and wore well seven and a half hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Nougat is a muted, medium-dark peach with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation and was slightly powdery. It lasted for seven hours on me. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Truffled is a medium-dark brown with warm, yellow-ish undertones and a mostly matte finish. It has a bit more of a sheen to it compared to say, Coconut Creme, but it is still more matte than a satin to me. It had good color payoff with a soft, blendable consistency that wore well for eight hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Hot Fudge is a rich, dark brown with a hint of black/gray and a frosted finish. It had nice pigmentation with a soft, smooth texture. It wasn’t really a rich, buttery texture–thinner, firmer–but it was a firmness that made it difficult to use. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Cocoa Chili is a dark brown with warm, yellow undertones and a mostly matte finish. There’s a sprinkling of gold sparkle, but very little of it transfers to the lid, so it is primarily just a matte finish. It had good pigmentation with a soft, silky texture. It wore well for eight hours on me. It is just a fraction darker and less yellow in tone compared to Truffled, but the two are too similar applied I think to merit being in the same palette. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Pink Sugar is a pale pink with subtle yellow undertones (more apparent in the pan than swatched) with a glittery finish. It felt almost wet in the pan, but it was thin and very, very sheer. It seemed more like a glitter top coat, but it didn’t stick to the lid at all, and it wouldn’t stick or layer over the powder eyeshadows in the palette either. I tried to apply it, and all the glitter would fall beneath the eye. I tried using my fingertip, and the glitter stuck to my fingertip and none transferred to my lid. Just an absolute waste of a shade in this palette. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Puddin’ is a muted, medium-dark brown with a faint hint of gray and a matte finish. It was a little faded when swatched and used compared to how it looked in the pan. For me, the color was faded on the lid after seven hours of wear. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Blueberry Swirl is a faded, very muted, dark blue with a hint of black and purple to it and a soft, frosted finish. It looks a lot lighter and softer than in the pan. It had semi-sheer pigmentation, while the consistency was a little dry but was blendable at least. It lasted seven hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Peanut Butter is a brightened, medium orange with a hint of brown and a matte finish. It had nice pigmentation with a silky, soft texture. It wore well for eight hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Frosting is a bronzy brown with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had excellent color payoff with a really smooth consistency, though it felt a little dry. It stayed on well for eight hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Rum Raisin is a slightly muted, medium-dark taupe brown with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It had good pigmentation that went on smoothly and was easily blended on the skin. It had a slight dryness to it, but it didn’t seem to impact wear or application. This shade wore well for eight hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Mousse is a medium brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It was semi-opaque and a little dusty, and it was faded after seven hours of wear. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Caramel is a brightened, golden copper with warm undertones and a metallic finish. The consistency felt a little dry, but the color payoff was excellent when swatched. When I applied to the lid, I had a little more trouble getting the color to adhere to the lid, but it was manageable. It started to fade after seven and a half hours of wear. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Bon Bon (Semi-Sweet Palette) is a medium copper with a hint of brown and a metallic finish. It had a really soft texture that was almost crumbly, so there was some fall out during application, but it had good color payoff and was blendable. It wore well for seven and a half hours before fading. (There is a shade previously released called Bon Bon, but this isn’t the same.) See comparison swatches / view dupes . Butter Pecan is a light gold with a hint of peach to it (there’s a little orange vibe I get from it) and a frosted sheen. It had fairly good color payoff, and the texture was soft and silky.

"[""Surratt Beauty Rougeur Artistique Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Purchased Reviews Sep 04, 2014 September 04, 2014 Surratt Beauty Rougeur Artistique Blush Surratt Beauty Rougeur Artistique Blush ($32.00 for 0.20 oz.) is described as a “classic rouge.” It’s a lightly brightened, raspberry red with subtle, cool undertones and a satiny sheen. Make Up For Ever #510 HD Blush (P, $26.00) is warmer, cream. Kevyn Aucoin Neolita (P, $37.00) is lighter, more muted. Bobbi Brown Berry (LE, $26.00) is darker. MAC Keep It Casual (LE, $20.00) is warmer, cream. Chanel Rouge (LE, $45.00) is slightly darker. See comparison swatches / view dupes . It’s quite pigmented with a soft, velvety texture that feels almost like a cream but is definitely a powder. It’s a deeper, richer shade that would be excellent on all skin tones, though you may need a light hand and the right brush in your arsenal if you are light-medium or fairer. Applied with a lighter hand, it takes on more of a raspberry pink look and as it is blended out, the finish becomes more and more luminous–but never emphasizes pores–that’s natural and gives skin life. The color lasts eight and a half hours on me before fading. 60 19 Rougeur 60 19 Rougeur A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Cult Beauty Net-A-Porter Barneys b-glowing 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The brush head is 30mm in width, 29mm in height, and 30mm in thickness. It has an open, rounded ferrule. The total length is 7 inches or 18 centimeters with the majority of the handle having a “soft-touch grip.” (If you’re familiar with NARS’ packaging, it’s a bit like that but smoother, and I haven’t noticed a tendency to pick-up powder or smudges–my handle is totally pristine after having it for two months). The brush is well-balanced with a handle that’s comfortable to hold and fit well into my hand. This is an excellent brush for foundation, particularly liquid and cream foundations, as the fibers are so fine and the brush itself so dense that all the fibers move as one, which yields a smooth, even, streak-free application. It’s domed enough to move across more contoured areas of the face, like underneath the eyes, around the nose, and along the jaw, but the more buffer-brush-like shape makes it easy to stipple, spread, blend, and buff foundation into the skin. It’s become my new go-to liquid foundation brush since I started testing it. I’m particularly impressed by how silky it feels against the skin no matter the angle or motion of the brush–there is never a direction or pressure where you can feel any of the individual fibers, which also indicates how well-cut it is. The brush itself is very dense, much like a buffer brush, so it does take extra time to really clean and rinse through any brush cleanser used, and subsequently, drying time is longer, but it dries within 12 to 16 hours in my experience.

"[""MAC Sculpt Sculpting Powder Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews May 03, 2014 May 03, 2014 MAC Sculpt Sculpting Powder MAC Sculpt Sculpting Powder ($23.00 for 0.21 oz.) is described as a “soft taupe matte.” It’s a medium-dark, slightly cool-toned brown with a matte finish. NARS Paloma Contour (P) is slightly warmer. NYX Taupe (P, $5.00) is cooler-toned, grayer. NARS Madly (P, $29.00) is more shimmery, slightly warmer. NARS Douceur (P, $29.00) is rosier, lighter. MAC Harmony (P, $21.00) is warmer, redder in tone. Burberry Earthy (P, $42.00) is redder in tone, slightly shimmery. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Sculpt has long been one of my favorite contouring powders, and it’s one that I personally reach for as it is the right balance of color, tone, and depth for my skin tone (NC25/NC30). It can be purchased in pan form for $16.50, as it is part of the permanent Pro range, which is available to all online (and if you live near a Pro store or don’t mind ordering over the phone, you can also get it from Pro stores). There are also four other shades available in the Sculpting Powder range, if Sculpt doesn’t seem like the right fit. I have them all, and I’ve always loved them, just that Sculpt is “the one” for my coloring, so I haven’t used the others often. The texture is soft, smooth, finely-milled, and blendable (so key for a contouring product!). It wears eight hours on me before starting to fade. 87 25 Sculpt 87 25 Sculpt A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Too Faced Jingle All the Way Blush (LE) is a powder. Urban Decay Quickie (LE) is less shimmery, powder. NARS Gaiety (P, $29.00) is lighter, powder. MAC Peony Petal (P, $21.00) is a powder. MAC I’m the One (LE, $21.00) is a powder. See comparison swatches / view dupes . The Master Glaze blush formula is supposed to give dewy, sheer color. It applies sheer in one layer, but I found it to also be buildable to light-medium coverage. The consistency is quite emollient with a high degree of slip, and it doesn’t fully set or dry down, so the finish is more luminous–which may look oily if your skin is already naturally dewy. It didn’t emphasize pores, and the shimmer seemed almost undetectable once applied. On my normal-to-dry skin, Pink Fever wore well for six hours, but it was faded and patchy after that. 45 37 Pink Fever (20) 45 37 Pink Fever (20) B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Drugstore.com Ulta Amazon Target Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Priceline Boots FeelUnique 8.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 6 Longevity 5 Application 84% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Josie Maran Timeless Coral Argan Infinity Lip and Cheek Creamy Oil Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Apr 27, 2014 April 27, 2014 Josie Maran Timeless Coral Argan Infinity Lip and Cheek Creamy Oil Josie Maran Timeless Coral Argan Infinity Lip and Cheek Creamy Oil ($18.00 for 0.50 fl. oz.) is described as a “vibrant warm coral.” It’s a muted, medium coral with warm, reddish undertones and a glossy finish. NARS Stella (P, $26.00) is less warm-toned. NARS Salamanca (P, $26.00) is similar. NARS Paris Follies (LE, $26.00) is darker. MAC Drawn in Chic (LE, $15.00) is darker. Revlon Papaya (P, $7.49) is more shimmery. Hourglass Nectar (P, $28.00) is brighter, darker. See comparison swatches / view dupes . (For blush comparisons, look here .) I picked this up during the sale a couple of weeks ago, because it was new and sounded interested. The formula is supposed to be hydrating and works as a tint for lips and cheeks. Josie Maran describes it as “natural-looking, never-greasy color.” As far as I’m concerned, this is only a lip product, because on cheeks, it feels oily, lightly tacky, doesn’t set or dry down, and slides around after five hours of wear. I found it difficult to wear with foundation, whether applied over or under, as the emollient texture makes applying foundation over it difficult, and applying it over foundation led to the foundation breaking down after two to three hours. I had the best results over bare skin, but they weren’t great results. Though it felt greasy on the skin, it was comfortable to wear on the lips–very cushion-y, gel-like, and somewhat hydrating. The major downside is that as a lip product, it needs regularly reapplication as it doesn’t really leave a stain behind, and the color and glossiness wear off in two hours or less. I also found it gritty, and I don’t know why there was any grit element to it at all, but it was something I noticed when swatching both on skin, applied to cheeks, and on lips. It had a sweet, citrus-y scent and taste to it that I couldn’t really place but is there.

"[""NYX Apple Strudel, Cherry Cheesecake, Maple Blondie Butter Glosses Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Apr 27, 2014 April 27, 2014 NYX Apple Strudel Butter Gloss NYX Butter Gloss ($5.00 for 0.27 fl. oz.) is described as a “sheer to medium coverage” gloss that can be worn alone or over lipstick and “is never sticky.” The formula is also supposed to “provide nourishment.” They have a creamy, light-to-medium-weight consistency that glides on, feels comfortable, and is lightly tacky (they gradually get a little tackier as they wear on as well). The formula has a sweet, vanilla scent. As described, coverage varies from semi-sheer to semi-opaque. They wear two to three hours on me, on average, and they were slightly hydrating. NYX Apple Strudel Butter Gloss ($5.00 for 0.27 fl. oz.) is described as a “peach.” It’s a light-medium, warm-toned peachy-pink with a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but it didn’t apply evenly and had a tendency to settle into lip lines–especially over time. It lasted for three hours on me. NARS Chihuahua (P, $26.00) is sheerer. NARS Tasmania (P, $26.00) is darker. NARS Belize (P, $26.00) is darker. Bobbi Brown Nectar (LE, $24.00) is warmer. MAC Talk Softly to Me (LE, $15.00) is slightly cooler-toned. See comparison swatches / view dupes . NYX Cherry Cheesecake Butter Gloss ($5.00 for 0.27 fl. oz.) is described as an “orange.” It’s a softened,, medium orange with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, and it settled slightly into lip lines, but because it was a deeper color, it didn’t seem as noticeable at a normal viewing distance (only really, really up-close). It wore well for three hours on me. NARS Wonder (P, $26.00) is darker. MAC Teen Dream (LE, $20.00) is a bit darker, less glossy. MAC Cheerful (P, $22.00) is a touch darker. Guerlain Tangerine Vlam (P, $30.00) is darker. See comparison swatches / view dupes . NYX Maple Blondie Butter Gloss ($5.00 for 0.27 fl. oz.) is described as a “deep peach.” It’s a muted, medium warm-toned pink with a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff, and it wasn’t as prone to settling as Apple Strudel, but it didn’t apply flawlessly–just a little unevenness, a bit of settling. The color lasted for two and a half hours on me. NARS Tasmania (P, $26.00) is sheerer. NARS Belize (P, $26.00) is darker. MAC Go for Girlie (LE, $20.00) is darker, pinker. Urban Decay Flushed (P, $19.00) is darker, less glossy. Maybelline Caramel Infused (065) (P, $8.99) is darker. MAC Talk Softly to Me (LE, $15.00) is cooler-toned.

"['Summer Bronze: Josie Maran Bronzing Argan Oil Reviews Apr 07, 2009 April 07, 2009 Get Sunkissed Without the Risk: Josie Maran Bronzing Argan Oil ($52.00 for 1.7 oz.) Josie Maran has created Bronzing Argan Oil to keep you get that sunkissed look without the sun. It’s a lightweight moisturizer that can be used all over–your body, face, and even hair. I like it on legs over all else, but the “bronze shimmer” is subtle enough to be used on the face. It’s really a natural glow, a bit bronzing but more brightening, than anything else, too. It has an earthy orange-y citrus scent, which I do like more than the scent of Josie Maran’s original Argan Oil. It’s worked so far on my acne-prone skin without incident (yay!), and I think those of you who have great skin already, this is a nice way to enhance it without covering anything up, too. Ingredients : Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Silica, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil May Also Contain:Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Tin Oxide. Josie Maran’s products are formulated to be more organic and natural. Her Argan Oil products contain 100% Organic Argan Oil. It’s Earth Month, so for those looking to go be a little more natural in their beauty regimens might want to check out Josie Maran’s line of products. I like that the Josie Maran website offers detailed information about ingredients, packaging, and a great symbol key to put it all in perspective.']",ae2e11485f1fbbc28087634bf7c886e2d9072b7d,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/summer-bronze-josie-maran-bronzing-argan-oil/,['2009-04-07 00:00:00']

"[""Bite Beauty Matte Creme Lip Crayons Reviews, Photos, Swatches (Part 1) Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 17, 2014 April 17, 2014 Bite Beauty Blood Orange Matte Creme Lip Crayon Bite Beauty Matte Creme Lip Crayon ($24.00 for 0.05 oz.) is supposed to be a “moisture-rich, matte-finish lipstick with a delicious citrus scent.” All three shades featured in this review are richly pigmented with a texture that’s moderately creamy but lightweight. They were really comfortable to wear, even though they have more of a matte finish; they don’t feel clingy, and I experienced light to moderate hydration across these shades. The matte finish combined with the pigmentation makes it a long-wearing formula, too. I didn’t have issues with feathering or bleeding, though I’m not prone to either of these. They have a lemony-herbal-y scent to me, which may or may not be appealing to you. The only downside is that the pencil is only 0.05 oz., which is half the size of the average-sized lipstick. I’ll be reviewing the other three shades in the range soon, so stay tuned! Bite Beauty Blood Orange Matte Creme Lip Crayon is described as an “electric citrus red.” It’s a slightly muted, medium, orange-red with a matte finish. The color coverage was rich, fully opaque, and applied flawlessly–even, smooth color. This shade wore well for six hours and was lightly hydrating during that time. MAC Mangrove (LE, $22.00) is very similar. MAC Dangerous (P, $16.00) is darker. MAC Scarlet Ibis (LE, $16.00) is darker. Hourglass Muse (P, $28.00) is slightly pinker. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Bite Beauty Clementine Matte Creme Lip Crayon is described as a “citrus orange.” It’s a brightened, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a satin-matte finish. It had full color coverage, which applied evenly and smoothly. The consistency was creamy, lightweight, and didn’t feel clingy. This shade wore well for six hours and was lightly hydrating. Illamasqua Soaked (P, $26.00) is lighter. Dior Trafalgar (844) (P, $34.00) is redder. MAC Tomango (LE, $16.00) is slightly darker. MAC Neon Orange (LE, $16.00) is similar. MAC Morange (P, $16.00) is similar. Buxom Rogue (P, $21.00) is glossier, redder. Inglot #103 Lipstick Cream (P, $12.00) is similar. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Bite Beauty Kumquat Orange Matte Creme Lip Crayon is described as a “pink grapefruit.” It’s a light-medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin-matte finish. It applied with rich, opaque color, which went on smoothly and evenly. This shade wore well for five hours, and it was moderately moisturizing. MAC Happy-Go-Lucky (LE, $16.00) is darker. Illamasqua Luster (P, $26.00) is cooler-toned. Chanel La Diva (44) (P, $34.00) is darker. MAC Silly (LE, $16.00) is warmer. See comparison swatches / view dupes .

Blue Lagoon is a brightened, medium cyan blue with a light dusting of silver sparkle. Of all twenty eyeshadows, this was the worst (and it’s just so-so), as the texture was a bit dry and powdery, and the silver sparkle does seem to get everywhere. Urban Decay Peace is more shimmery. Urban Decay Clash is a cream product. NARS Mad, Mad World #1 is less shimmery, darker. MAC Electric Eel is less shimmery, darker. MAC Blue Candy is less shimmery. Inglot #371 is less shimmery, darker. See comparison swatches . Scuttle is a warm-toned, champagne-shimmered golden beige with a frosted finish. It had good color payoff, and the texture was soft and very, very slightly powdery. MAC Glamour Light is lighter. MAC Warming Heart is darker and more shimmery. MAC Grain is darker, less shimmery. Buxom Collie is a cream product. bareMinerals Stealth is less shimmery. See comparison swatches . Flounder is a pale yellow with a hint of orange in it and a matte finish. It was somewhat powdery, and the color was prone to sheering out quickly. I had better luck patting it onto the lid and only blending around the edges. theBalm Snobby is more shimmery, cooler. Bobbi Brown Banana is very similar. NARS Misfit #1 is lighter. MAC Motif is more shimmery. Estee Lauder Bronze Dunes #1 is more shimmery. Chanel Premier Regard #3 is more shimmery. Inglot #3102 is lighter, cooler. See comparison swatches . Sebastian is a pink-coral with a matte finish. It had a soft, smooth texture with just a small amount of powderiness, but it was easier to apply than Flounder . Chanel Rose de Mai is more muted. Inglot #359 is cooler. See comparison swatches . Flotsam is a darkened, cool-toned gray with a pearly sheen. It had good color payoff, though the texture was slightly stiffer than a lot of the other shades (not hard to work with, but just noticeably different). theBalm Matt McDonald is lighter. Urban Decay Ace is warmer. NARS Mandchourie #2 is slightly cooler-toned. Urban Decay Gunmetal is slightly warmer. See comparison swatches . Sea Shells is a warm, golden ivory with a frosted, slightly metallic, finish. It had mostly opaque color, and the texture was soft and buttery–but a smidgen powdery. Make Up For Ever #101 is warmer, more frosted. Urban Decay Midnight Cowgirl is a smidgen darker. MAC Carefree is cooler. MAC Short Shorts is similar. MAC Femme-fi is warmer. MAC Dazzlelight is cooler. Inglot #395 is slightly lighter. See comparison swatches . Les Poissons is a medium-dark brown with a hint of warmth and a frosted sheen. It was soft, smooth, and nicely pigmented. Tom Ford Platinum is a cream product, warmer. theBalm Matt Gallagher is cooler, less shimmery. Urban Decay Wreckage is cooler, darker. MAC Caramel Sundae is lighter. MAC Sweet Satisfaction is lighter. MAC Superwatt is a cream product, darker. Chanel Raffinement #3 is slightly darker. Chanel Harmonie du Soir #2 is darker. See comparison swatches . Caspian Sea is a blue-teal with a soft, frosted finish. It had nice color payoff and a soft, smooth texture that was easy to apply and to blend out. Tom Ford Emerald Lust #3 is bluer, darker. theBalm Open to Offers Olwen is darker, slightly bluer. MAC Parrot is very comparable. NARS South Pacific #1 is brighter. Make Up For Ever #83 is brighter. Inglot #415 is lighter, more frosted. See comparison swatches . Your Voice is a silvered-white with a frosted, slightly metallic finish. It was soft but a bit crumbly/powdery, and it did smooth down when patted and blended out on the lid. theBalm Sassy is similar. theBalm Metal-ica is also similar. MAC Flawless Figure is less frosted. MAC Crystal Avalanche is less shimmery. Giorgio Armani Ecailles Black Pearl #4 is similar. bareMinerals Cheers is less shimmery. Inglot #453 is brighter. See comparison swatches . Unfortunate Souls is a muted, cool-toned purple with a hint of blue and a matte finish. It had so-so color payoff, and it was a little stiff (but not powdery). Urban Decay Blue Bus is darker, more shimmery. NARS Self Portrait 1 #2 is darker. MAC Heroine is slightly darker. Giorgio Armani Ecailles Black Pearl #2 is much darker. Atlantica is a subtly warm-toned, pastel green with golden yellow undertones and a frosted sheen. It had nice pigmentation, and it was soft, smooth, and buttery to the touch. MAC Zestful is lighter. Guerlain Coup de Foudre #3 is darker. bareMinerals Wicked is warmer, lighter. Make Up For Ever #34 is a smidgen darker. See comparison swatches . Fins is a medium-dark, subtly yellow-toned green with gold and green sparkle. It had good color payoff, but there was some fall out when worn due to the amount of sparkle in it. Sephora Picnic in the Park is brighter, cooler. Make Up For Ever #52 is a cream product. Sugarpill Midori is darker. NARS Mad Mad World #2 is darker, less shimmery. Milani Green Safari is a cream product. MAC Feeling Fresh is warmer. Make Up For Ever #53 is cooler, less shimmery. Sick of Swimmin’ is a cool-toned white with a frosted, teal iridescent sheen. It was semi-sheer, and it’s probably a shade best used to apply over another to add dimension. MAC Vellum is similar but less frosted. See comparison swatches . Ursula is a subtly warm-toned, muted plum with a frosted finish. It had good color payoff but was slightly powdery. Inglot #446 is brighter. Le Metier de Beaute Fig is warmer. OCC Overlook is warmer. Guerlain Boulevard du Montparnasse #6 is less shimmery, darker. MAC Rich Core is darker. MAC Rare Find is slightly darker. MAC Universal Appeal is a touch lighter. Urban Decay Uncut is darker. See comparison swatches . Sha La La is a reddened berry with cool undertones and a satiny finish. It had so-so color payoff, but it did build up better (to about semi-opaque color). The texture was soft, finely-milled, and a little powdery. MAC Posthaste is redder. NARS Douce France #3 is darker, warmer. MAC Hepcat is slightly cooler-toned. Estee Lauder Violet Underground #1 is brighter. See comparison swatches . Triton is a warm-toned, medium yellow gold with a frosted, metallic finish and larger gold sparkle. It had good color payoff, but there was some fall out during application and seemed to have some minor fall out later on during wear, too. Chanel Cool Gold is a cream product. Sephora French Riviera is yellower. NARS Corcovado is yellower, cream. Maybelline Gold Rush is slightly darker, cream product. MAC Goldmine is similar. Chanel Blazing Gold is lighter. OCC Triptych is slightly darker. bareMinerals Remix is very similar. Inglot #430 is warmer, brighter. See comparison swatches . Wanderin’ Free is a muted copper with a frosted finish. It had great color payoff, and the texture was soft and buttery–but again, there was a smidgen of powderiness. theBalm Manic Maribel and Urban Decay Chopper are darker, warmer. Urban Decay Limelight is warmer. MAC Summer Haze is cooler. MAC All That Glitters is similar. Buxom Collie is lighter, cream. bareMinerals Nirvana is less shimmery. See comparison swatches . Jetsam is a teal-tinged, deep gray with a pearly sheen. It looks more teal in the pan than it does swatched or applied. Sephora Midnight Swim is lighter. Urban Decay Hijack is lighter. MAC Blue Spruce is less shimmery. Guerlain Les Aquas #1 is less shimmery. bareMinerals Editor’s Pick is lighter. Inglot #451 is lighter. See comparison swatches . Sea Witch is a dark, bold purple with cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had decent to good color payoff, but it was slightly dry. MAC Warm & Smoky is darker, cooler. MAC Pink Union #2 is brighter. MAC Drawn to Drama is darker. MAC Parfait Amour is brighter. See comparison swatches . Treasures Untold is a pink-tinged white with a golden sheen. It had good color payoff with a soft, buttery texture that was very slightly powdery. L’Oreal Strawberry Blonde is pinker. MAC Double Feature #5 #1 is less shimmery. MAC Winterscape is cooler. MAC Golden Flurry is less frosted. MAC Let’s Skate is a cream product. MAC Radial Pink is lighter. MAC Opalesse is cooler. MAC Good Fortune is a cream product. Overall, I really liked the palette, and I think it’s well worth the $55 price tag assuming they’re colors and finishes that you would use. My main issue was that most shades were on the powdery side with some just being very slightly powdery to a few feeling almost crumbly. The majority of the shades had good color payoff, though. I wore several shades from the palette (10 of the 20), and I’m almost at seven hours of wear–so far so good in terms of fading/creasing. There has been some slight fall out from Fins and Triton . Also, heads up: Sephora teased about this collection on their Facebook, and while doing so, also stated that this was the last and final installment of the collection. 158 28 Ariel 158 28 Ariel A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total 26 12 Blue Lagoon 26 12 Blue Lagoon B- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 8.5 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 7.5 Texture 8 Longevity 4 Application 81% Total 31 23 Scuttle 31 23 Scuttle A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 92% Total 9 11 Flounder 9 11 Flounder B- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 8 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 7.5 Texture 8 Longevity 4 Application 80% Total 25 8 Sebastian 25 8 Sebastian A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total 17 7 Flotsam 17 7 Flotsam A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total 27 4 Sea Shells 27 4 Sea Shells A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 92% Total 20 3 Les Poissons 20 3 Les Poissons A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 96% Total 25 3 Caspian Sea 25 3 Caspian Sea A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total 19 7 Your Voice 19 7 Your Voice B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 89% Total 19 5 Unfortunate Souls 19 5 Unfortunate Souls A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 92% Total 19 7 Atlantica 19 7 Atlantica A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total 23 10 Fins 23 10 Fins A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total 22 6 Sick of Swimmin' 22 6 Sick of Swimmin' B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 88% Total 19 1 Ursula 19 1 Ursula A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 93% Total 14 10 Sha La La 14 10 Sha La La B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 8.5 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 88% Total 17 5 Triton 17 5 Triton B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8 Longevity 4.5 Application 87% Total 16 1 Wanderin' Free 16 1 Wanderin' Free A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 96% Total 21 0 Jetsam 21 0 Jetsam A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 98% Total 31 3 Sea Witch 31 3 Sea Witch A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total 21 3 Treasures Untold 21 3 Treasures Untold A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Fyrinnae Parental Advisory Eyeshadow Review, Photos, Swatches Purchased Reviews Jul 24, 2013 July 24, 2013 Fyrinnae Parental Advisory Eyeshadow Edited : Fyrinnae discontinued Parental Advisory (Loose) in 2011 and reformulated it in 2012, and the current version is closer to the pressed version. (Additionally, from their description of the loose color: “Reformulated in 4-2012 but very close to the original.”) Mine is from 2011–will grab the reformulated version next time I order from Fyrinnae to compare. I unfortunately did not connect the dots that mine was pre-reformulation, so my deepest apologies! Fyrinnae Parental Advisory Eyeshadow ($6.25 for 0.11 oz.) is described as a “vivid shimmery royal purple.” It’s a vibrant, bluish purple with sparkling shimmer. It has strong, blue undertones but still comes out as more purple than blue. Applied damp, it is a slightly softer, less blue purple, and then applied dry over Pixie Epoxy produces a more intense, deeper purple. The texture is very soft and finely-milled, and a little goes a long way. It wasn’t difficult to blend, but it wasn’t easy as some of Fyrinnae’s other shades. Applied on bare lids, it lasted seven hours well and had some minor fading after eight as well as some noticeable fall out; applied over Pixie Epoxy , and it looked as-applied even after nine hours with no fall out. I don’t have anything quite like this color; anything with similar brightness is much, much bluer (like Sugarpill Royal Sugar ). Parental Advisory Pressed Eyeshadow ($8.25 for 0.09 oz.) is described as a “vivid shimmery royal purple.” It’s a brightened, medium-dark violet purple with subtle cool undertones and a warmer, lavender shimmer. Maybelline Painted Purple is cooler-toned, cream. MAC Pink Union #2 is slightly darker. Inglot #441 is warmer, pinker. See comparison swatches . It was actually just discontinued (as in, yesterday, due to being too fragile in pressed form), but I thought since I already photographed and tested it, I might as well add it into this post as a comparison against the loose formula. The loose eyeshadow is actually more complex and less readily duped, and it has a much cooler, bluer tone to it overall. I walked all around my house to look at the two side-by-side under different lighting, and they really were surprisingly different. The texture of this one was very soft and smooth, and it was easy to blend and apply on the lid. It lasted eight hours with minor fading but no fall out without any primer, and layered over Pixie Epoxy , it lasted the same length of time. 111 28 Parental Advisory 111 28 Parental Advisory A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Fyrinnae 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 10 Longevity 4 Application 96% Total 105 17 Parental Advisory 105 17 Parental Advisory A Discontinued N/A Affiliate Links Fyrinnae 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 98% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Clarins Splendours Shimmer Body Oil Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Aug 04, 2013 August 04, 2013 Clarins Splendours Shimmer Body Oil Clarins Splendours Shimmer Body Oil ($32.00 for 3.3 fl. oz.) is a body oil with deep gold shimmer. The purpose of this product is three-fold: illuminate while hydrating and scenting the skin. Clarins recommends applying it over “collar bone, arms, and legs.” After I tried Caudalie Divine Legs , I was angling for something that would give some of the warmth but with less tint, and since this arrived shortly after, it seemed like a good summer product to try next. This type of product is less foreign to me, as it is really just a shimmery body highlighter with no real tint, but I haven’t tried a lot of body oils previously, so there was still some newness (which is always exciting). It doesn’t tint, so even though it looks golden bronze in the bottle, it’s really just a lot of shimmer on. I think if you have very, very fair skin you might see a hint of golden warmth against the skin. The shimmer doesn’t look chunky, but I was able to see it up close, so it isn’t just a sheen but a real shimmer. It absorbs fairly quickly, and it doesn’t feel sticky or greasy afterwards. I didn’t find it all that hydrating in the short-term, and I didn’t try it continuously for weeks on end, but my skin felt the same after several hours of wearing it as it had before applying it. The consistency is very water-like, but it is just slightly oily, and it spreads easily across the skin. I wish this had different packaging, because it pours out a ton of product even if you’d just like a dab. It almost always dribbles down the side of the bottle when I’ve used it, and I always get more than I bargained for. I think a pump or smaller opening would be much, much better and easier to manage. It has a soft citrus scent that I couldn’t smell unless I stuck my nose to my skin, which is great if you prefer light scents and less so if you wanted this for its scent. On me, the shimmer only lasted three or so hours, and then it seemed to just fall away, so it’s definitely a product best suited for special occasions, evenings out, and the like. I thought it worked best on collar bones and decolletage, but on legs, it didn’t have an impact from a normal viewing distance. The light seems to hit my collar bones/decolletage more often, so the shimmer dances more there. I didn’t like this product overall, just because the effect only lasted a few hours, the scent was barely-there (for a product that lists “scenting” as a goal, it seems it’s an issue), and wasn’t hydrating enough to use alone for all-day hydration. The shimmer definitely rubs off on clothing as well. Initially, I wore this three days in a row, but my skin needed more hydration (particularly my legs; my arms were satisfied with the hydration the oil alone provided), so I had to use a another lotion beforehand to ensure smooth skin (I’ve been alternating between Kiehl’s Creme de Corps and Bath & Body Works Body Creams for the past couple of months) for the remainder of the week that I tried this. Worth noting, Clarins’ conducted their own study and they had the group use it for four weeks, and the results of the study were such that the majority did find it hydrating. 9 64 Splendours Shimmer Body Oil 9 64 Splendours Shimmer Body Oil C Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Macy's Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil Boots Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Cosbar Escentual bluemercury Clarins (UK) Clarins (Canada) Sephora (PL) Clarins Dillard's 6 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 5 Longevity 4 Application 76% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""NARS Final Cut Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Feb 08, 2014 February 08, 2014 NARS Final Cut Blush NARS Final Cut Blush ($30.00 for 0.16 oz.) is described as a “peach coral.” It’s a warm-toned, muted medium orange with a hint of pink. The color is more complex than it seems initially, but I think this is a shade that may look pinker or more orange depending on your natural undertones, as it looks more peachy-orange in some lighting, and then coral in the next room. Fyrinnae Nordic Angel (P, $6.50) is slightly pinker. MAC Passion for Colour (LE, $20.00) is also a smidgen pinker. Chanel Presage (62) (LE, $38.00) is darker, cream. Edward Bess Secret Affair (P, $43.00) is pinker, more shimmery. NARS Gilda (P, $29.00) is darker, not as flat of a matte. MAC Early Morning (LE, $25.00) is darker. Chanel Frivole (P, $43.00) is darker. See comparison swatches . (You can see it on The Dupe List here !) This shade is part of NARS’ Final Cut collection, which is a Nordstrom exclusive (in the states). I reviewed all of the other shades from the collection here . The texture was incredibly soft, velvety, and finely-milled. I had no problems getting true-to-pan color, and applied on my medium skin tone, it’s a soft, coral-y flush, though not a strong, intense shade. It blends beautifully and easily, so it feels like a foolproof blush that can be worn every day and applied in a hurry. It wore well for almost eight hours on before showing signs of fading along the edges. 122 33 Final Cut 122 33 Final Cut A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks Selfridges Macy's Net-A-Porter Barneys Harvey Nichols (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Space NK (UK) bluemercury Sephora (PL) Dillard's NARS 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""OCC Automaton, Deven Green, Pool Boy Nail Lacquers Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Feb 09, 2014 February 09, 2014 OCC Automaton Nail Lacquer OCC Automaton Nail Lacquer ($10.00 for 0.50 fl. oz.) is described as a “24K gold with red/green duochrome [with a Metallic finish].” It’s a brightened, sunshine yellow with warm, yellow-red undertones and very fine micro-shimmer that shifts from a coppery-red to a murky green. I tried so hard to capture the duochrome, but it’s really subtle, and despite dozens of photos, no luck. After two coats, there was still visible nail line, and I’d describe the coverage as semi-opaque. It applied evenly, and there weren’t any brush strokes even though it is a more metallic finish. NARS Kismet (LE, $19.00) is darker, more coppery. See comparison swatches . OCC Deven Green Nail Lacquer ($10.00 for 0.50 fl. oz.) is described as a “nearly-neon green [with a Creme finish].” It’s a brightened, light-medium green with subtle warm undertones. “Nearly-neon” is exactly right; it’s vibrant, bright, but it’s not quite neon. It was opaque in two coats, and the first coat was a little streaky going on, but the second coat smoothed and evened everything out. The consistency was slightly thick. The only neon green I could think of was China Glaze I’m With the Lifeguard , which is a true neon green, and it has shimmer, so it’s really not similar at all. OCC Pool Boy Nail Lacquer ($10.00 for 0.50 fl. oz.) is described as an “aquatic blue [with a Creme finish].” It’s a light-medium blue with a cream finish. It dries down to a satiny finish–there’s some shine, but it’s not glossy. The consistency is slightly thin, but it is opaque after two coats. It was a somewhat streaky going on the first coat, and the second coat covered most of it, but it wasn’t a flawless finish. Zoya Rocky (P, $9.00) is darker, more muted. Essie In the Cab-ana (P, $8.00) is warmer, greener. Cult Nails Nakizzle’s Shizzle (P, $12.00) is darker, more muted. SpaRitual Ebb & Flow (LE, $10.00) is much darker. See comparison swatches .

"[""Bobbi Brown Hibiscus Pot Rouge Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Feb 28, 2014 February 28, 2014 Bobbi Brown Hibiscus Pot Rouge Bobbi Brown Hibiscus Pot Rouge ($26.00 for 0.13 oz.) is described as a “bright red coral.” In the pot, it looks like a really bright, intense red-coral, but applied, it’s much more muted–it’s a softened, medium orange-coral with warm undertones and a satiny sheen. theBalm Crisp is more shimmery. Clinique Ginger Pop (01) (P, $21.00) is a powder. Chanel Intonation (69) (LE, $38.00) is pinker. Kevyn Aucoin Fira (P) is darker, brighter, powder. Illamasqua Sleek (P, $26.00) is more muted. Chanel Presage (62) (LE, $38.00) is more orange. Tom Ford Beauty Flush (P, $55.00) is brighter, powder. NARS Boys Don’t Cry (LE, $41.00) is darker, powder. MAC Out for Fun (LE, $20.00) is slightly more orange. Guerlain Peach Boy #1 (P) is a powder. See comparison swatches . The Pot Rouge formula is supposed to be a “multi-tasking cream color” for lips and cheeks. Bobbi Brown says to “blend it on the apples of your cheeks for a just-pinched look.” The color is buildable, but it never looks as intense applied as it does in the pot, even though it seems opaque when layered on the skin. The finish has just enough sheen to give the skin a natural, lightly dewy finish that doesn’t look oily or shimmery, and it didn’t emphasize pores. It wore well for seven hours applied to cheeks, and I had no trouble wearing it on bare skin or patted over (liquid) foundation. As a lip color, it was somewhat drying over time, though it lasted for four hours and left a very subtle stain behind, but it did have fully opaque color coverage–again, it did not look anywhere near the intensity or richness of the color in the pot. As tends to be the case, this product performed better as a cream blush than a lip color, so you’ll want to consider how you might use this and round-up or down the overall rating, as the rating reflects how the product performs in both ways.

"[""Bite Beauty Matte Creme Lip Crayons Reviews, Photos, Swatches (Part 2) Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Apr 19, 2014 April 19, 2014 Bite Beauty Grape Matte Creme Lip Crayon Today, I have the remaining three shades of Bite Beauty Matte Creme Lip Crayons ($24.00 for 0.05 oz.), so if you missed the first three, check out part one . The formula is supposed to be a “moisture-rich, matte-finish lipstick with a delicious citrus scent.” The colors are rich and opaque, while they’re lightly hydrating (I don’t know if I’d go as far as to say “moisture-rich”), comfortable to wear, and long-wearing. They have a lemony-herbal-y scent to me, which may or may not be appealing to you. The only true downside is that these are 0.05 oz., as compared to the average-sized lipstick, which is around 0.10 oz. Bite Beauty Grape Matte Creme Lip Crayon is described as a “muted violet.” It’s a medium-dark, magenta purple with cool undertones and a satin-matte finish. It had intense pigmentation that fully covered the lips in smooth, even color. The shade wore on for almost six hours, and it was lightly hydrating while worn. Sephora + Pantone Universe Radiant Rush (LE, $18.00) is slightly more fuchsia. Chanel La Diva (44) (P, $34.00) is more matte, pinker. MAC RiRi Boy (LE, $16.00) is more muted, purpler. MAC Up the Amp (P, $16.00) is more muted, purpler. MAC Candy Yum Yum (P, $16.00) is brighter, pinker. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Bite Beauty Satsuma Matte Creme Lip Crayon is described as a “fuchsia pink.” It’s a brightened, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It was extremely well-pigmented, and the color applied very evenly. This shade lasted for five and a half hours on me, and it was lightly hydrating. Sephora + Pantone Universe Radiant Rush (LE, $18.00) is darker. Bite Beauty Moscato (P, $28.00) is brighter. Chanel La Diva (44) (P, $34.00) is more matte. MAC Candy Yum Yum (P, $16.00) is similar. Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics Nylon (P, $18.00) is brighter. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Bite Beauty Sweety Orange Matte Creme Lip Crayon is described as a “coral pink.” It’s a light-medium, warm-toned pink with a satin-matte finish. Like the rest of the shades in the range, the pigmentation-level was full coverage, and it applied beautifully without streaking or settling into lip lines. This shade lasted five hours on me, and it was lightly moisturizing during that time. MAC Viva Glam Nicki (LE, $16.00) is lighter. Le Metier de Beaute Fiji (P, $32.00) is more muted.

This formula is supposed to have “full coverage finishes,” “lightweight” feel, and be hydrating. Cheri is permanent, but Irresistible is limited edition. Chanel Cheri (61) Rouge Coco Lipstick ($35.00 for 0.12 oz.) is a light-medium, rosy-peach with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had mostly opaque color payoff, but there was some translucency as you could see my lip freckle peeking through. It applied evenly overall, but you may get slight “lines” if you press your lips together; thankfully, they’re not noticeable from a normal viewing distance–only up-close. It managed to wear for three hours on me. Revlon Jungle Peach (LE, $7.99) is lighter. YSL Tender Peach (26) (P, $34.00) is lighter. Marc Jacobs Beauty Pout (142) (LE, $30.00) is lighter. YSL Corail Intuitive (15) (P, $34.00) is similar. Givenchy Beige Plume (102) (P, $36.00) is less glossy. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Chanel Irresistible (62) Rouge Coco Lipstick ($35.00 for 0.12 oz.) is a muted, medium-dark, pink-shimmered plum with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, and it covered the lips fairly evenly with color. It lasted for three and a half hours, and it was lightly hydrating during that time. Urban Decay Rapture (P, $22.00) is darker. Chanel Ce Soir (P, $34.00) is warmer. Maybelline Yummy Plummy (P, $7.49) is less shimmery/glossy. MAC Craving (P, $16.00) is less shimmery/glossy.

"[""MAC Crazed Imagination Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Purchased Reviews Oct 02, 2014 October 02, 2014 MAC Crazed Imagination Blush MAC Crazed Imagination Blush (24.00 for 0.21 oz.) is described as a “muted plum with a hint of pink pearl [with a Frost finish].” It’s a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly shimmer-sheen finish. MAC Animal Instincts (LE, $21.00) is less shimmery, browner. MAC Lavish Living (LE, $27.00) is more shimmery. theBalm Cabana Boy (P, $21.00) is cooler-toned. NARS Oasis (P, $29.00) is warmer, redder. MAC Plum Foolery (P, $21.00) is lighter. MAC Stratus (LE, $27.00) is warmer, browner. Chanel Rose Temptation (LE, $45.00) is lighter, less shimmery. Chanel Plum Attraction (LE, $45.00) is less shimmery. bareMinerals The Indecent Proposal (P, $22.00) is less shimmery, warmer. See comparison swatches / view dupes . I think this is the type of color that is very wearable across skin tones, and the finish is shimmery without emphasizing pores or skin imperfections, but the blush wasn’t without texture issues, so it may not be worth the trek and fight at MAC stores today (it launches at MAC stores only today). The texture was stiffer, a little dry. It seemed to get better after I rubbed away the top few layers, but it was still a little dry (but not as stiff) underneath. Applied, it sits well on the skin, blends fairly readily, and wears eight hours before fading slightly. 38 34 Crazed Imagination 38 34 Crazed Imagination B- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 7 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 82% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Maybelline Nude Illusion, Caramel Infused, Blush Essence Color Elixir Lip Colors Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Dec 06, 2013 December 06, 2013 Maybelline Nude Illusion (060) Color Elixir Lip Color Here are the last three shades of Maybelline’s Color Elixir Lip Color ($8.99 for 0.17 fl. oz.) range that I’ve finished testing. I have a few more shades, but they’re not even photographed yet, so not sure if those are upcoming any time soon but we’ll see how things work out. The Color Elixir formula is a medium-weight consistency that’s mostly non-tacky (but a slight tackiness develops as it wears). Some shades apply unevenly or bunch up if you press your lips together, while others look even and smooth. There is a sweet, creme brulee scent and sometimes perfume-like taste. The formula is moderately moisturizing and wears about four hours on average. Nude Illusion (060) Color Elixir Lip Color ($8.99 for 0.17 fl. oz.) is light-medium peachy beige with soft, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but the consistency did enable the gloss to settle into lip lines a bit. It’s not as even applied as I’d like. It wore well for three and a half hours. MAC Fashion Punch (LE, $15.00) is darker. MAC Calypso Beat (LE, $20.00) has shimmer. MAC Summer Sweetheart (LE, $15.00) is lighter. MAC Illicit (LE, $15.00) is also lighter. Chanel Genie (P, $32.00) is very similar. Chanel Insouciance (P, $32.00) is more beige, lighter. See comparison swatches . Caramel Infused (065) Color Elixir Lip Color ($8.99 for 0.17 fl. oz.) is a muted, light-medium pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, applied evenly overall (not perfect). This shade lasted for four hours on me. MAC Viva Glam Nicki (LE, $15.00) is lighter, brighter. MAC Kiss & Don’t Tell (LE, $15.00) is pinker, darker, brighter. See comparison swatches . Blush Essence (095) Color Elixir Lip Color ($8.99 for 0.17 fl. oz.) is a cool-toned, medium pink with soft white shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but it applied evenly for the most part. It wore well for just under four hours. L’Oreal Florid Pink (LE, $7.99) is less glossy. Edward Bess First Kiss (P, $30.00) is less shimmery. Chanel Insolence (P, $32.00) is lighter, less shimmery.

"[""Becca Gypsy Mineral Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Jul 11, 2015 July 11, 2015 Becca Gypsy Mineral Blush Becca Gypsy Mineral Blush ($32.00 for 0.20 oz.) is described as a “ballerina pink.” It’s a light-medium, cooler-toned pink with warmer gold shimmer that gives it a soft, frosted sheen. Illamasqua Lies (P, $26.00) is more shimmery, lighter. Edward Bess Filled with Desire (P, $43.00) is less shimmery, darker. Giorgio Armani Eccentrico (LE, $88.00) is warmer. Charlotte Tilbury Love Glow (P, $40.00) is darker, warmer. MAC Azalea in the Afternoon (LE, $27.00) is warmer. Sleek MakeUP Icing Sugar (P, $6.99) is less shimmery, darker. Colour Pop Boba (P, $8.00) is more shimmery, darker, cooler. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . It had decent to good color coverage that was buildable from semi-sheer to semi-opaque with a strong sheen. It’s the type of blush that looks as if you applied a separate highlighter over your blush, because the underlying color seems less connected to the warmer sheen. The texture was blendable but a little powdery, slightly dry, though it looked good on the skin. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me before fading along the upper cheek area. Formula Summary | Becca Mineral Blush ($32.00 for 0.20 oz.) is supposed to be a “delicate powder blush” with a “buildable formula” that gives a “natural-looking, flushed appearance.” They typically have a soft, creamy consistency that is a little denser than the average powder but not truly dense. Some of the very shimmery shades feel a little dry compared to the more pearly ones. I found the formula to be incredibly easy to apply and blend on the skin without any need for special tricks; they felt very grab-and-go, the kind of blush where there’s no fight to diffuse and soften edges or get even coverage. They are more pigmented than what I’d term as “buildable,” which some will appreciate, some will be disappointed by. The wear ranges from seven to nine hours with the brighter and more satin-to-matte shades lasting longer. My favorite part of the formula is the luminous sheen they give to the skin, so they don’t look too shimmery on the skin. I think if you find Becca’s pressed highlighters to be too shimmery, you may find their blushes more up your alley with respect to finish. 62 31 G*psy 62 31 G*psy B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Beautylish Ulta Cult Beauty DermStore b-glowing Sephora (Australia) Space NK (UK) Becca Sephora (PL) 8.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 8 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Becca Blushed with Light Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Sep 29, 2016 September 29, 2016 Becca Blushed with Light Palette Becca Blushed with Light Palette ($34.00 for 0.46 oz.) is a medium-size, plastic compact that contains three blushes–a neutral-to-warm pink, orange-brown, and pink-coral. One shade (Wisteria) is new and exclusive to the palette, while the other two shades are available in the Becca’s permanent range. If you don’t mind your blushes more pigmented, then I think you might like this palette–two shades were rated lower because they weren’t as subtle/buildable as described. I wish the texture of Snapdragon was smoother and softer, more like the full-size version, but it looked the same applied to the skin, so the difference isn’t as noticeable in practice. Value Mineral Blush : $32.00 for 0.20 oz., palette contains 0.33 oz., $52.80 worth of Mineral Blush Luminous Blush : $34.00 for 0.21 oz., palette contains 0.13 oz., $21.05 worth of Luminous Blush Value: $73.85 Wisteria is a muted, medium pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was soft, lightly dusty but not dry-looking on the skin, and it was easily blended across the cheeks for even coverage. It had medium, buildable coverage–which is what the formula is supposed to have–that can be applied at near opaque coverage. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours on me before fading. Tarte Empowering (LE, $28.00) is lighter, cooler (95% similar). bareMinerals Golden Gate Matte (LE, $22.00) is darker, more muted, warmer (90% similar). Laura Geller Boysenberry (P, $28.00) is warmer (90% similar). NARS Love (LE, $30.00) is brighter, warmer (90% similar). Tarte Impress (LE, $28.00) is lighter, cooler (90% similar). Divergent Misty Rose (LE, ) is brighter, more pigmented, warmer (90% similar). Kat Von D Piaf (Shade) (DC, ) is lighter, less pigmented, warmer (90% similar). Tarte Prim (LE, $28.00) is more shimmery, lighter (90% similar). Urban Decay Fetish (P, $26.00) is less shimmery (95% similar). Tarte Seduce (P, $28.00) is darker, more muted, warmer (85% similar). Urban Decay Overexposed (-, ) is lighter (85% similar). Makeup Geek Heart Throb (P, $10.00) is warmer (85% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Songbird is a medium, orange-brown with warm undertones and a golden sheen. It was richly pigmented (not really buildable, as it is supposed to be!) with a more powdery texture. The good news was that it still applied easily and blended well on the skin, so the powderiness didn’t translate when applied and worked into the skin. On me, the color started to fade after seven and a half hours of wear. Charlotte Tilbury The Climax (P, $40.00) is lighter (95% similar). Milani Bronze Burst (P, $13.00) is cooler (95% similar). Milani Coral Beams (P, $13.00) is lighter (95% similar). MAC Pleasure Model (LE, $27.00) is less shimmery, darker (90% similar).

MAC Make You Mine (P, $23.50) is less shimmery, darker, cooler (85% similar). Top 20 dupes listed, see the rest. See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Snapdragon is a bright, medium pink-coral with gold shimmer. The version in the palette is a lot pinker and brighter compared to my standalone, which looked warmer both in the pan as well as swatched. Though this formula is described as subtle and that it can be used as a “blush topper,” it was actually intensely pigmented and a little went a long way. You would need the barest amount to layer on top of a blush, otherwise the strength of the color in Snapdragon would overwhelm whatever blush you were wearing. The texture was firmer and stiffer in the pan, and it felt different compared to the other two shades well (and different from my standalone version of Snapdragon), though the blush looked fine applied and blended out without issue. It wore for just over eight hours on me before fading. Estee Lauder Wild Sunset (P, $34.00) is more shimmery, lighter (95% similar).

"['Sneak Peek: Make Up For Ever Artist Palettes Photos & Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Features Apr 24, 2015 April 24, 2015 Make Up For Ever #1 and #2 Artist Palettes For summer, there are two new, limited edition Make Up For Ever Artist Palettes ($42.00 for 0.54 oz.); one available in neutral hues and the other in a mix of brighter shades. All of the shades are shades available in the permanent Artist Shadow range, and they all swatched and appeared consistent with the singles I have (in fact, a few seemed even creamier!). The Artist Shadow formula remains a favorite for me, and it’s honestly a formula that has spoiled me when it comes to really easy-to-use, intensely pigmented, long-wearing eyeshadow. The palettes had a surprising heft to them, though they are slim and don’t seem overly large. Each palette has a large mirror, though it doesn’t stand up on its own. The side that holds the eyeshadows seems to have most of the weight, which led me to expect it to be magnetic and allow for the eyeshadows to be removed (like last holiday’s case), but unfortunately, they seemed glued in. I tried using tweezers to remove four shades (at random) from each palette, but nothing was budging. I hope Make Up For Ever will consider making future Artist Palettes interchangeable, because I think that makes them more versatile, and then you can rearrange to suit your needs over time or for a trip. The other aspect worth pointing out is that most shades have noticeable shimmer; there are no official mattes in the palettes, but there are three satins. Each pan is 24mm in diameter, and visually, they appear about the same size as your average eyeshadow pan (think MAC, Urban Decay, Makeup Geek), though it is very slightly smaller (MAC eyeshadows are 26mm in diameter). The pans contain 0.06 oz. a pop, whereas a full-sized Artist Shadow contains 0.08 oz. (and retails for $21!). The value of the palette is $141.75 based on $21/0.08 oz., though Make Up For Ever has a discounting system if you buy two or three (plus the coordinating case) individuals at a time. Based on that, you could get three for $44 or $44/0.24 oz., which would give the palette a value of $99. Another way to look at it is the cost of purchasing all nine individually, and presuming you buy in trios to maximize your discount, you would spend $132. As long as you’d use at least three shades in it, then you’ll pay less than purchasing the three as singles (you would get more product, but a little goes a long way with these). I’ve been slowing working my way through all the Artist Shadows, so I’m hoping to review these palettes (and their single counterparts, if any differences) soon. You can also see swatches grouped together in the Swatch Gallery for the #1 (Nudes You Need) and #2 (Electric) palettes if you prefer a gallery view. See more photos & swatches!

The new Afterglow 8-Hour Powder Highlighter formula is supposed to be “finely-milled” with “sheer,” buildable payoff that “blends in easily” and eight-hour wear. This was the most pigmented–more semi-opaque to opaque–shade in the range and most shimmery. I found that the texture could emphasize pores depending on application style/coverage, so it’s not as foolproof as the other shades. I recommend using a lighter touch and a buffing brush to get the best finish out of the product. It is also significantly different in color to Sin eyeshadow, which is more pink-based (I compared to a split-pan I have of Sin as well as one in the Naked palette). The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable, while the highlighter wore for eight hours on me before fading. 48 14 Sin 48 14 Sin A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 9 Product 8 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""MAC Dark Energy Mineralize Eyeshadow Quad Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 29, 2016 March 29, 2016 MAC Dark Energy Mineralize Eyeshadow Quad MAC Dark Energy Mineralize Eyeshadow Quad ($46.00 for 0.04 oz.) is a bluish take on a smoky eye–a mix of silvery white, pale blue, light-medium blue, and black. The first three shades were decent, while the last shade was a pain to work with for a myriad of reasons. The Mineralize Eyeshadow formula is wet/dry, and it is designed to have sheerer coverage applied dry while stronger color payoff requires working with the product using a damp brush; this isn’t always an extra step everyone wants to do, but it’s absolutely necessary with this palette if you want opaque coverage, so keep that in mind! Dark Energy #1 is a bright, silvery white with cool undertones and a frosted finish. It had semi-opaque coverage both dry and damp; the only difference seemed to be that the finish became more metallic when applied damp. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable. The color lasted for six and a half hours dry, seven hours damp. Buxom Velvet Snow (LE, $12.00) is more shimmery, lighter (95% similar). NARS Rue Allent (Left) (LE, ) is less shimmery (95% similar).

Dark Energy #2 is a muted, light cloudy blue with subtle, cool undertones and a frosted sheen. Applied dry, it had sheer coverage and looked more white than blue; it also wore for six hours before fading. Applied damp, it had mostly opaque coverage with a stronger blue tint, and it started to fade after seven hours of wear. Dior Blue Garden #3 (LE, ) is less shimmery, darker (95% similar).

Dark Energy #4 is a sooty black with cool undertones and a satin finish. Unfortunately, while the rest of the palette was decent, this one was a major let-down due to a very dusty, thin texture that was hard to apply and blend out on the skin, as it would adhere to some places but not others.

"['Wayne Goss #03, 04, 05, 17, 18, 19 Eye Brushes Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews May 06, 2015 May 06, 2015 Wayne Goss #04, #19, #03 Brushes Wayne Goss Brushes are, by and large, a good, solid range of brushes with usable shapes and sizes. I think the eye brushes are better than the face brushes, though the cheek and face brushes are still good, but the assortment of eye brushes has been more impressive. The price point across most of the brushes is comparable to mid- to high-end brands, and some of the eye brushes are more reasonable than you’d expect (cheaper than brands like MAC). What I personally enjoyed most was not just the quality of the brushes, but the shapes and sizes of the brushes, as I found myself reaching for and using them as part of a routine, not just for testing. The line is more traditional in its types of brushes offered, but a couple of brushes are more interesting. The only brush in this review that I had quality issues with was the #18, which felt poky on the lid. The #03, #04, and #19 are brushes that have found their way into my permanent stash, while #05 and #17 are nice, they aren’t shapes I personally reach for. Wayne Goss Brush 03 ($32.00) is a large, tapered crease brush with moderate density and fullness that comes to a more defined point where the hairs get less dense towards the tip. The hairs are soft enough to always feel comfortable on the lid, no matter the position or type of stroke or motion you use in your routine, but it still picks up a good amount of product and blend product easily. If there’s one type of brush you’ll find in the range, it’s a crease brush; there are five to choose from, this being the largest. I like using this for laying down a transition shade, blending out crease colors, highlighting the brow bone, and setting under eye concealer. The brush head is 21mm in length, 10mm in width, and 10mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6 inches / 15 centimeters with a open, round ferrule. For me, it’s very comparable in shape, size, and fullness to the Hakuhodo G5522 ($28), while the MAC 224 ($32) is less tapered. Wayne Goss Brush 19 ($27.00) is a medium, tapered crease brush with a tapered edge. This brush is 1.5mm wider than #04 but 2mm narrower than #03, though it is very similar in nsize and shape to the #04 to a degree where it’s very hard to tell by eye. The bigger difference, to me, between this and the #04 is density; the #19 has less give and flex, which makes it better for getting a defined crease and more precision out of the brush. Between the two, I prefer the #19 as I find it more versatile. The brush head is 18mm in length, 8mm in width, and 8mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6.2 inches / 15.50 centimeters with a open, round ferrule. Tom Ford Eyeshadow Blend (13) ($55) seems denser but very comparable in shape, size, and purpose and is 1mm wider. Wayne Goss Brush 04 ($28.00) is a medium-sized, tapered crease brush that comes to a soft, lightly rounded point. Visually, it looks to have half the fullness of the #03. The brush is soft in all directions with more give and flex compared to #03, though I think some may find it has too much give. It works nicely for applying and blending out eyeshadow in the crease, above the crease, or on the brow bone. The brush hairs are soft, silky, and move as one. The brush head is 17mm in length, 6.5mm in width, and 6.5mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6.2 inches / 15.5 centimeters with a open, round ferrule. Hakuhodo J142 ($18) is comparable in size and shape, though it is 0.55mm narrower. I find Louise Young LY38 ($28) is fairly cmparable, though a tiny bit wider, while the LY38B ($24) is narrower. Wayne Goss Brush 05 ($25.00) is a small, narrow crease brush with a lightly rounded, tapered edge. This is one of the smaller crease brushes offered by the range, and naturally, the shape follows #03 and #04, it’s just smaller in size across the board. It works well for depositing more defined color into the crease and smudging eyeshadow on the lower lash line. The texture of the brush was soft to feel comfortable to use but still picked up color well. The brush head is 13mm in length, 5mm in width, and 5mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6 inches / 15 centimeters. Hakuhodo J5529 ($16) comes to a less tapered point, but it has the exact same length and width/thickness. Wayne Goss Brush 17 ($32.00) is a large, flat, dense all-over dome eyeshadow brush. For someone who applies a wash of color or a powder base on the eye lid, it would work nicely for that. The edge also works for smudging or applying color to the lash line. It’s soft, smooth, and I couldn’t feel the individual bristles moving across the skin, even on the edge. The brush head is 15mm in length, 16mm in width, and 6mm in thickness. It has a total length of 5.75 inches / 14.5 centimeters. Tom Ford Eyeshadow (11) ($55) is fluffier, not quite as firm, and comes to a more pointed (less domed) edge, but is very similar in size and purpose. Wayne Goss Brush 18 ($26.00) is a medium, flat, dome-shaped eyeshadow brush. It is fairly dense and firm with just enough give to work around the curvature of the eye. I expected to use this brush the most, but this was the one eye brush that felt rough to me–I kept feeling individual bristles poking at the skin. If used it solely for packing on eyeshadow onto the lid, I usually didn’t feel any roughness or bristles, but I felt I had to use just right to avoid it. The brush head is 11mm in length, 10mm in width, and 5mm in thickness. It has a total length of 5.75 inches / 14.5 centimeters. MAC 239 ($25) is less firm, slightly fluffier, especially along the edge, which makes it a better multi-tasker. Hakuhodo J004G ($20) is softer and less thick. There are also the following eye brushes (that I don’t have): #06 (shorter crease), #07 (appears to be a short, stubby domed brush), #08 (short, flat eyeliner), #16 (rounded dome), #20 (pointed crease).

"[""Wayne Goss #02, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Face Brushes Review & Photos Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews May 06, 2015 May 06, 2015 Wayne Goss Brushes — 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 There are nine Wayne Goss Brushes designed for the face. It’s a good, solid range for cheek and face options, with shapes that should work for many. The most interesting brush that I tried was the #14, while the brushes I used and liked the most would be the #02, #11, and #15. I also liked #12 a lot, but I have two very similar brushes that I favor a wee bit more, so I don’t tend to reach for it on my own. The brushes feel lighter-weight than some higher-end brushes, but they don’t feel poorly balanced with what weight is there. Japanese-style natural brushes have been noticeably better to significantly better in quality over most mainstream mid- to high-end brands (think Bobbi Brown, Chanel, MAC, NARS, etc.). Wayne Goss Brush 02 ($35.00) is a small, tapered brush that starts off narrow at the base, flares upwards to about two-thirds and then tapers towards the tip to a rounded point. The brush is incredibly soft, moderately dense, with just enough flex and give for blending and maneuvering around the cheek bones, bridge of the nose, across the forehead, or underneath the eyes. It’s small enough to work on a variety of face shapes and sizes, but it’s not so small that it feels inefficient. The brush head is 33mm in length, 19mm in width, and 19mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6.6 inches / 17 centimeters. MAC 165 ($34, discontinued) is more rounded but similar in shape and purpose. Hakuhodo J5521 ($38) is similar as well, but it is also rounder overall with less of a noticeable tapering along the edges. Wayne Goss Brush 10 ($53.00) is a large, stippling brush with a wide, flat edge with a mix of synthetic and goat hairs. It’s designed to work with liquid and cream foundations, which it does a nice job of, but I have found that more rounded brushes tend to provide the most streak-free finish relative to stippling brushes. These days, I like stippling brushes of this size for powder products (bronzer, blush, finishing powders in particular), as well as for diffusing and blending out the overall look (similar to the function of a buffer brush, but this will move base products less, as it has an airier feel against the skin). It is extremely soft and feels feathery against the skin, despite being a fairly dense brush, except for the last fourth of the brush, where it has more spring and feels less dense. The brush head is 40mm in length, 31mm in width, and 35mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6.5 inches / 16.75 centimeters. This brush is comparable to MAC 187 ($42), which is slightly less dense and narrower with less fluffy flaring. Wayne Goss Brush 11 ($48.00) is a medium-sized cheek brush with moderate density, a rounded, domed shape. It is fairly soft, though noticeably less-soft compared to some of my other blush brushes (of which I have some very high-end options to choose from), but it’s with this brush that I noticed a lesser softness, whereas the majority of the ranges in the line haven’t been as distinguishable. I really like this brush for most blushes, except really pigmented ones, and it is a good option for that firmer pressed blush, as the larger surface and density seem to help it lift more product off the pan’s surface than a more feathery brush. It lays down color and blends it out nicely. The brush head is 37mm in length, 33mm in width, and 22mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6.75 inches / 17.25 centimeters. It’s like a much improved version of MAC 129 ($35), which has a good shape for an all-purpose blush brush, but it is one of the scratchiest MAC brushes made. Wayne Goss Brush 12 ($53.00) is a medium-sized, dense blush brush with a wider, rounded edge with a gentle flaring outwards. It’s soft, silky, and smooth against the skin and has never felt irritating while I’ve used it. This brush is convenient for powder cheek and face products from blush to bronzer, especially for someone who wants medium to full coverage out of their cheek color. This shape is very useful for blending out harder-to-blend powder products along the edges as the flatter edge makes shorter work of it. The brush head is 32mm in length, 41mm in width, and 24mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6.5 inches / 16.75 centimeters. This brush is similar to Hakuhodo J5543 ($60), which I find is a smidgen denser and tends to retain its shape without fluffing up as much. Tom Ford Cheek (06) ($78) is very, very similar to the J5543, as they share the same shape, though the Tom Ford is slightly denser, while it fluffs up on the edges more similarly to Brush 12. Both of these are ever-so-slightly smoother against the skin. Wayne Goss Brush 13 ($53.00) is a small-medium, round brush with a domed edge. In some ways, it’s like a small, buffing brush attached to a long handle. The shape works well with cream and liquid foundations, powder and liquid/cream blushes, as well as powder and liquid/cream highlighters. It can even be used to contour, depending on the style of contour you’re after (it’s large enough that it won’t give you ultra-precision, but the density gives you a lot of control in the initial lay down). It’s moderately soft; soft enough that it is likely to be a decent upgrade for most, but it is less soft than the best synthetics and higher-end natural fiber hairs. The brush head is 31mm in length, 25mm in width, and 25mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6.5 inches / 16.75 centimeters. It is very similar in style to MAC 109 ($35), which is denser and less soft. Hakuhodo 210 ($36), which is less smooth/soft (there is a J-series version for $44 that is likely to be softer), but shares the same size and shape. Chikuhodo GSN-04 ($64) is a little longer but is fairly similar. Wayne Goss Brush 14 ($33.00) is a medium-sized brush that starts off narrow at the base and significantly flares upwards to a rounded, dome edge with low-to-medium density and a very feathery, airy quality to the composition of the bristles. If you like to dust and gently sweep your cheek products on, you’ll probably enjoy this brush, as you’ll never have to worry about being heavy-handed again with this one. I liked it best for applying highlighters and very pigmented blushes, as it yields a very diffused, sheer to semi-sheer coverage level (which can always be built up, of course). It works well for contouring, too, if, like me, you like a more diffused, subtle contour and tend to use a fan brush to achieve that result, but this can do that job as-is (I’d just prefer a denser version personally). It is fairly soft and is comfortable to use on the skin. The brush head is 41mm in length, 22mm in width, and 22mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6.5 inches / 16.75 centimeters. I don’t have a brush that’s similar in shape, but the SUQQU Cheek has a similar airy, feathery quality to how it feels during application (but this is much, much softer and smoother) — for those looking to mimic the effect of SUQQU without the bank-breaking price tag, this is well worth a try. Wayne Goss Brush 15 ($25.00) is a medium-sized fan brush. It is the least soft face brush that I tried from the range, though certainly not genuinely scratchy or rough. I regularly reach for fan brushes like this one, as it isn’t too big or too soft, dense enough to deposit color on the skin but not so dense that it leaves harsh lines. It has flex and give, feels lightly feathery during application and diffuses edges easily. I use this type of brush for contouring, highlighting, and with heavily pigmented blushes. It’s also a good option for a more shimmery finishing or setting powder that you want to dust all-over without over-applying the product. The brush head is 38mm in length, 60mm in width, and 15mm in thickness. It has a total length of 6.6 inches / 17 centimeters. It similar in shape and size to MAC 184 ($24), which is a duo-fiber brush, so the composition of bristles is quite different. Sephora Pro Fan Brush (#65) ($27) is 10mm wider, which makes it less precise. Hakuhodo J4004 ($26) is very similar in shape and size. There is also one face brush (that I don’t have): #01 (angled, smaller foundation), which would be most likely be used with cream and liquid products (primarily foundation). 30 10 Brush 02 30 10 Brush 02 - Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beautylish 0 Product 0 Pigmentation 0 Texture 0 Longevity 0 Application 0% Total 18 11 Brush 10 18 11 Brush 10 - Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beautylish 0 Product 0 Pigmentation 0 Texture 0 Longevity 0 Application 0% Total 18 12 Brush 11 18 12 Brush 11 - Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beautylish 0 Product 0 Pigmentation 0 Texture 0 Longevity 0 Application 0% Total 11 9 Brush 12 11 9 Brush 12 - Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beautylish 0 Product 0 Pigmentation 0 Texture 0 Longevity 0 Application 0% Total 18 11 Brush 13 18 11 Brush 13 - Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beautylish 0 Product 0 Pigmentation 0 Texture 0 Longevity 0 Application 0% Total 14 5 Brush 14 14 5 Brush 14 - Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beautylish 0 Product 0 Pigmentation 0 Texture 0 Longevity 0 Application 0% Total 16 7 Brush 15 16 7 Brush 15 - Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beautylish 0 Product 0 Pigmentation 0 Texture 0 Longevity 0 Application 0% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Urban Decay Heartless 24/7 Glide-On Eyeliner Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 29, 2016 March 29, 2016 Urban Decay Heartless 24/7 Glide-On Eyeliner Urban Decay Heartless 24/7 Glide-On Eyeliner ($20.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described as a “light frosted pink.” It’s exactly that: a light pink with cool undertones and a frosted sheen. Marc Jacobs Beauty Pink of Me (P, $25.00) is less shimmery (90% similar). Tarina Tarantino Broken Doll (P, $15.00) is lighter, warmer (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . The 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil formula promises “creamy, forever-lasting, … waterproof” wear. In general, I consider them to be a more waxy eyeliner pencil, so they typically glide on easily as they’re very smooth, but some shades are creamier with better color payoff (e.g. Perversion, which is their richest shade in the line-up), while others are smooth but waxier and have more medium coverage. They usually build-up well if you go back-and-forth a couple of times on the lash line. Heartless falls somewhere in-between; it had semi-opaque coverage in one stroke with good glide and applied well to the lash line. It doesn’t, however, seem to build up to fully opaque coverage, so it’s one that I’d recommend smudging with a dry eyeshadow brush to manage coverage better. On my lower lash line, the eyeliner lasted for eight hours before fading. This shade may work well for those seeking more brightening hues, as the cooler pink keeps it from looking too red, and the lighter color is closer to white (but not as stark). 15 9 Heartless 15 9 Heartless B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 8.5 Product 8 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 84% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The 24/7 Waterline Eye Pencil formula is supposed to have “waterproof color that lasts all day” specifically for use “on the inner rim in the waterline.” The texture is described as “creamier” than their standard eyeliner. You might remember my review on the formula from before , where these marked one of the bigger misses from the brand for me (based on my experience). The texture is significantly different from those; it was extremely soft, smooth, and creamy–it glided on easily across the skin and the lower lash line. There was no tugging, no skipping, and no ragged dry edges like I experienced with the other shades. The color deposited evenly and with full coverage on the lower waterline. It had good color payoff–pretty much opaque in one stroke, which is always a spectacular achievement for an eyeliner–that went on evenly. The disappointment, though, is in the wear–four hours on the waterline, but it did last closer to seven hours on the lower lash line. 6 7 Walk of Shame 6 7 Walk of Shame B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 8 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 6.5 Longevity 5 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""Anastasia That Glow Glow Kit Review, Photos, Swatches Purchased Reviews Feb 06, 2016 February 06, 2016 Anastasia That Glow Glow Kit Anastasia That Glow Glow Kit ($40.00 for 1.04 oz.) includes four warm-toned shades that range from pale, buttery gold to copper. Each shade is 0.26 oz. and can be removed from the palette, if desired, but they are currently only sold together (not sure if they will eventually be available as pans only). Presently, it is exclusive to Macy’s and the brand’s website. According to Anastasia, these are supposed to be “metallic powder highlighters for intense luminosity” that can also be worn on the eyes. They are softer and silkier with a more finely-milled consistency compared to the Illuminators released a couple of months ago. These also have a finer shimmer and overall sheen that is less emphasizing of pores on the skin. Sunburst is a light, yellow gold with warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation with a soft, blendable texture that wasn’t too powdery or too firm. It applied easily to the skin without emphasizing pores but giving a high shine finish. The color lasted for eight hours before fading on me. Anastasia Summer (LE, ) is less shimmery (95% similar). Urban Decay Now's the Time (LE, $26.00) is warmer (95% similar).

This shade was intensely pigmented with a soft, lightly powdery consistency that blended out nicely.

Bubbly is a muted, light-medium golden beige with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It was slightly drier with a looser consistency, though it still blended well and luckily, it didn’t look dry or powdery applied.

It didn’t emphasize pores or the skin’s natural texture, though it is a very high-shine finish where a little goes a long way. The color wore well for seven and a half hours on me.

"[""MAC Easy Manner Blush Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Oct 25, 2012 October 25, 2012 MAC Easy Manner Blush It’s a Manner of Everyday Ease with This Blush MAC Easy Manner Blush ($22.00 for 0.21 oz.) is described as a “light dirty peach.” It’s a soft yellow-toned pink–a smidgen coral-pink. It has a satin finish, so there is an ever-so-slight sheen that’s really barely-there and just makes it look natural and not flat on the skin. MAC Legendary is more coral. MAC Rosy Outlook is similar–more matte. Illamasqua Naked is darker, pinker. Tom Ford Frantic Pink is warmer, less pink. Chanel Blush Horizon is less warm. Benefit Hervana is similar. MAC Stunner is similar but has more of a sheen. Easy Manner is one of those shades that seems to darken when applied. It does the same on my arm as it does on my face; on my cheeks, it looks a little less pink, but it’s definitely darker than the color in the pan. It’s a very easy-to-wear color for light to medium-dark skin tones. On darker complexions, I think it might get lost, but it is definitely buildable and still yielded a lot of color on my medium skin tone without having to pack it on, so it may be worth a look. It doesn’t have a chalky base color, so it shouldn’t turn ashy. The texture is a bit dry and stiff, but I didn’t have trouble blending out the color when I applied it (I used MAC’s 116). This shade wore for eight hours with minor fading along the tops of my cheek bones. 22 4 Easy Manner 22 4 Easy Manner A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Feline has been reviewed previously here . As of the last one I purchased (back in 2010), it was still a lovely rich, intensely pigmented black eyeliner with a smooth, creamy texture that stayed put. I purchased the recently released versions of the other three eyeliners, even though all of them are repromotes. The colors are all exactly the same, but the texture seemed a little drier with the new versions. Not a lot drier, just somewhat, and they’re not as creamy as Feline (so if you hated how creamy Feline was, you may prefer these). It is interesting to see your own evolution, because I remember loving the Kohl Power formula in general (being particularly taken with Feline), but I’m not really into these. They require a lot more building to yield good color payoff. They also have a tendency to look uneven if you don’t, because it’s like the color isn’t actually mixed–it’s black and then pearl, and it mixes as you move the pencil back and forth. Mystery is a blackened teal. I couldn’t think of a possible dupe for this one. I imagine you could try to apply a black eyeliner and then apply a brighter teal eyeliner over it to yield something similar. Orpheus is a dirty gray-brown with antique gold. MAC Uniform is a bit greener–more olive than brown/gray. MAC Black Line is blacker. Raven is a dark burgundy-brown. Urban Decay Rockstar has more purple, less red in it. Mystery was the least impressive; it was a bit drier than the other two, and it required some pressure and several passes to build up the color. It’s definitely possible, but after being exposed to a number of more impressive formulas, it could use greater intensity in a single go. The formula remains smudgeable for a few minutes after applying, but set down and on me, they wear good to great. They make it to eight hours, though with Mystery I could see some had disappeared after eight hours. Raven and Orpheus lasted a full eight hours.

"[""MAC Glamour Daze Lipsticks Reviews, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Purchased Reviews Oct 25, 2012 October 25, 2012 MAC Glamour Daze Lipsticks For Those Who Love Non-Traditional Holiday Lip Color MAC Glamour Daze Lipsticks ($16.50 for 0.10 oz.) are available in five shades: Beauty (pale cool pink), Dramatic Encounter (deep purple), Glamourdaze (mid-tone creamy plum), Innocence (soft coral), and Outrageously Fun (mid-tone magenta violet). Beauty is a light, cool-toned pink with a soft frosted finish, though it is officially a glaze finish by MAC. It’s more of a gray-ish pink than a blue-based one. The light color paired with the finish really accentuated the texture of my lips in a way I felt made them look very dry. The color coverage was mostly opaque. When I wore this shade, it lasted for three hours, and I tried wearing it back-to-back, and I found it slightly drying. MAC Lazy Sunday is a bit pinker, creamier. MAC You’re Perfect Already is warmer, pinker. MAC Annemiek is cooler-toned, sheerer. Chanel Candeur is similar, just a sheerer formula. MAC Double Spin is even cooler-toned. MAC Mlle is extremely similar. Dramatic Encounter is a dark, burgundy red with faint burgundy shimmer. It’s mostly opaque in color, and it has an amplified finish. MAC describes it as deep purple, but it’s more wine–a lot of red in this shade. This shade lasted for six hours on me, and it was neither drying nor hydrating; I did see some very faint feathering along the upper left edge of my lip after three and a half hours. The texture was very slick–almost wet in a way–creamy but thin. Chanel L’Impatiente is redder, lighter. MAC Hang Up is a bit redder, more berry–makes this shade look brown-ish. MAC Endless Drama is a smidgen redder. Glamourdaze is a subdued plummy red with a glossy sheen. It has a Cremesheen finish and opaque color coverage. It had a slightly stiff consistently–much like the Cremesheen finish tends to be, which I just don’t find to be creamy. It wore for five hours, and it was neither drying nor hydrating. MAC Offshoot is a smidgen pinker. CoverGirl Fervor is a little more intense. Cle de Peau #117 is very similar. Dior Raspberry is also similar. MAC Capricious is lighter, pinker. Innocence is a light-medium coral with warm undertones and a delicate golden peach frosted shimmer. It has opaque color, and it has a frost finish–and it’s extremely frosted. Like Beauty, the lighter color paired with the high frost finish tended to make lips appear drier. It wore for four hours and was somewhat drying. MAC Coral Bliss is darker, pinker, less frosted. MAC Cut a Caper is darker, pinker. NARS Bolero is a smidgen pinker but close in color. Outrageously Fun is a blue-based magenta pink with a natural sheen. It has opaque color coverage, and it has a Cremesheen finish. There are a lot of fuchsias on the market, but what will make this one stand out (at least, somewhat) is it is very magenta and cool-toned–less pink than it is magenta. It lasted four hours on my lips, and it was a smidgen drying. Chanel Extatique is pinker, iridescent. OCC Nylon is infinitely brighter. MAC Dear Diary is darker, brighter. MAC Candy Yum Yum is darker, brighter as well. MAC Pink Pigeon is deeper, matte. Chanel Kensington is pinker. Glamourdaze was the best performer out of the five, because it wore well and didn’t dry out lips. Beauty and Innocence were the more problematic of the shades, while I did encounter feathering with Dramatic Encounter , so you may want to be prepared to use a lip liner with that particular shade–very few products bleed/feather, so I am a bit concerned. Outrageously Fun is, well, fun; aside from the slightly drying result, it’s a nice alternative to some of the recently released neon magenta shades.

Chanel Sakura (87) (LE, $43.00) is darker, warmer, powder. Giorgio Armani Eccentrico (LE, $88.00) is more shimmery, darker, powder. Edward Bess Filled with Desire (P, $43.00) is powder. MAC Rosy Outlook (P, $23.50) is more muted, darker, powder. MAC Launch Away (LE, $21.00) is slightly darker, powder. Illamasqua Lies (P, $26.00) is more shimmery.

It’s one of three shades coming out in the Playland collection , which will be available online on April 10th April 15th (MAC corporate confirmed as of 4/10 8:26AM PST). This is the only shade I have from the collection, but once it launches, I will purchase the remaining two (just a heads up!). The Casual Colour formula is a lip-and-cheek product, but it’s one that performs better on cheeks than on lips. As a blush, it wears about seven hours and has buildable, semi-opaque color coverage, but due to the lightness of the color, it’s best suited to lighter skin tones (it doesn’t show up on my medium complexion very noticeably). As a lip color, it wears three hours but tends to “crack” and settle into lip lines as it wears, due to the drier consistency. It’s very unforgiving as a lip product if your lips are not completely smooth, as the product will catch easily on any unevenness. I also found it somewhat drying as a lip product and generally uncomfortable to wear, so again, it’s a product that seems best applied as a cream blush. On the upside, each pot contains significantly more product than the average lipstick or cream blush. 37 69 For Your Amusement 37 69 For Your Amusement B- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 7 Longevity 4.5 Application 82% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The finish was subtle on the skin and more of a natural sheen than an overt shimmer finish. Per the brand, it’s supposed to be a “velvety face powder with silky sheer colour” that is “blendable” and can be a subtle “highlight” or “even out skin” when used swirled (which is really the only way to use if one is using a blush or highlighting brush). The texture was soft, lightly powdery in the pan, but it didn’t appear chalky or dry on my skin. I had no trouble applying or blending it out, but the color itself was quite light and subtle that it may only work well for a limited number of skin tones and even then, based on preferences. I wouldn’t describe it as sheer, as it was rather pigmented, but the softness would enable one to dust and sheer out all-over if desired. On me, it would be lightening rather than brightening if I did so. I wore it as a highlighter on my cheekbones, where it was barely noticeable in person (more sheen than color), and seemed to last for eight hours on me.

The powder had a smooth, almost cream-like consistency as it was denser but not stiff or firmly pressed in the pan. It had semi-opaque color payoff that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer if desired (though the brand describes as sheer). I had no trouble blending out the powder on my cheek bones, and the highlighter illuminated without emphasizing my skin’s natural texture. The powder stayed on well for nine hours on me. Apparently, this was a one-day only product (though it appeared in one of their past palettes), but hopefully, the dupes are helpful or the brand eventually releases it into the permanent range.

When mixed together, the effect was a light-medium lavender with a subtle warmth and a luminous finish. Each shade was wide enough to be worn alone, though there’s no distinct beginning and end for the shades. The consistency of the palette was fairly smooth, soft, and blendable, while the pigmentation varied from semi-opaque to opaque. The only shade I had trouble with was the darker lavender, which was drier in feel and had buildable coverage. There was a bit of excess powder that kicked up in the pan, but it did not read powdery or dry on the skin. The effect was moderate to high in shine, so the palette would work best for someone who likes a stronger highlighter/highlighting blush. 17 6 Ibiza 17 6 Ibiza B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Beautylish Neiman Marcus Space NK Bergdorf Goodman Cult Beauty DermStore Net-A-Porter Barneys b-glowing Bloomingdale's Space NK (UK) 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 88% Total 01 /03 View All Kevyn Aucoin Ibiza (Left) The Celestial Powder Kevyn Aucoin Ibiza (Left) The Celestial Powder Kevyn Aucoin Ibiza (Left) The Celestial Powder View On One Page Ibiza (Left) Ibiza (Left) is a light, white gold with warm undertones and a luminous sheen.

The very light color made me nervous to apply to my skin tone, but it actually worked well, as it seemed to darken slightly and the shimmer prevented the lighter base color from looking chalky. I still think this is going to be easier for lighter complexions to wear, but it may work as a highlighting blush on medium complexions as well. The consistency was soft and smooth to the touch, but it was more powdery and thin compared to other shades I’ve tried in this formula, so it had a tendency to sheer out on the skin–great for blending, not so great for achieving true-to-pan color.

"[""Urban Decay Bittersweet Afterglow 8-Hour Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Apr 05, 2015 April 05, 2015 Urban Decay Bittersweet Afterglow 8-Hour Blush Urban Decay Bittersweet Afterglow 8-Hour Blush ($26.00 for 0.23 oz.) is described as a “bright purple.” It’s a softened, medium purple with subtle, pink undertones and a mostly matte finish. It seems to run slightly cool in undertone, but I think it may depend on what you pair it with whether it will read genuinely cool-toned or not. Make Up For Ever S924 Purple (P, $21.00) is more shimmery, brighter, cooler-toned. Too Faced Ooh la Orchid (LE, $16.00) is warmer (also an eyeshadow). NARS Fashion Rebel #2 (LE, $24.00) is similar (also an eyeshadow). MAC Evening Stroll (LE, $22.00) is a cream product. Get comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . According to Urban Decay, the Afterglow formula is supposed to be an “extremely blendable, finely milled formula [that] goes on sheer that provides eight long hours of wearable, buildable color.” The texture is very, very finely-milled and silky-feeling, and it goes on smoothly, though it is a thinner texture that is prone to kicking up excess powder–it reminded me of the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Blushes to a degree, but I would say Urban Decay’s formula is a bit thinner still. It never looked powdery on the skin, and as I worked the color into the skin, the finish seemed more satin-to-matte than a true, flat matte. The formula of Bittersweet is best described as buildable; the color goes on noticeably in one go on my medium skin tone, but it can be built-up to richer, truer-to-pan color if desired, or it can be blended (or applied with a lighter hand) for even softer color. I would say this is semi-sheer to semi-opaque in color payoff, and then buildable from there. This shade was fairly blendable, but it seemed to take a little extra effort compared to the average blush (as well as compared to other blushes in the range). On me, it lasted for eight hours and started to fade. 152 38 Bittersweet 152 38 Bittersweet A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Ulta Selfridges Macy's Urban Decay Canada Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Sephora (PL) 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 92% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The Colorful Blush formula is supposed to be long-wearing, buildable, and have a lightweight texture. My experience with the formula has shown that they’re soft, lightly powdery at times (some are worse than others) with semi-sheer to semi-opaque color coverage that blends fairly well and lasts seven to eight hours. There is some variance between shades, but there are some gems in the range. Over the Moon had semi-sheer to semi-opaque, buildable color coverage with a natural sheen that was noticeable without being shimmery. The texture was lightly powdery, thinner than other shades, but it didn’t look powdery on my skin, at least. It lasted for seven hours before there was noticeable fading. From what I can tell, this has since been discontinued, but I have heard you can still find it in some stores. As I had already tested it, I figured I might as well finish it up, but not to worry, it’s merely a bonus review for the day. It’s a shame it was discontinued, though, as a more budget-friendly option for a lavender-hued blush would have been quite welcome. P.S. — This was the last of the Sephora blushes I had to review!

"[""Milani Beloved & Crush Amore Matte Lip Cremes Reviews, Photos, Swatches Purchased Reviews Aug 25, 2015 August 25, 2015 Milani Beloved Amore Matte Lip Creme Milani Amore Matte Lip Creme ($8.99 for 0.21 fl. oz.) is a new, limited edition liquid lipstick that dries to a matte finish. You’ll mostly find them at your local drugstore (I got mine from Walgreens), but they are available online as well through Milani directly. These have a very thin, liquid-y consistency–they easily get outside the lines and in general, the applicator can apply far more than you need, so I highly recommend a little patience and maybe using a lip brush (if you can) to apply and get really precise, neat lines. The formula has a longer dry down–about five to ten minutes before you can press your lips together–and gets very tacky after two minutes or so (do NOT! press your lips together or else you will lift color in large patches!). They’re one of the lesser drying liquid lipsticks I’ve come across (but these did get a bit drying after four to six hours of continuous wear), and they are long-wearing and pigmented. They have a moderately strong sweet, vanilla scent. Milani Beloved Amore Matte Lip Creme ($8.99 for 0.21 fl. oz.) is described as a “brown rose.” It’s a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque color payoff with a thin, highly spreadable consistency, which gave really smooth and even coverage, but it does make it a little harder to apply if you don’t wipe the applicator a bit prior to application (think of it like mascara). It wore well for eight hours and was a touch drying after six hours of wear. MAC Bad Girl RiRi (LE, $17.50) is glossier (90% similar). Colour Pop Bumble (P, $6.50) is cooler (90% similar).

Milani Crush Amore Matte Lip Creme ($8.99 for 0.21 fl. oz.) is described as a “warm brick brown.” It’s a dark red-toned brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that looked smooth once it dried down, but it was somewhat uneven–there were places that appeared darker than others, even though I didn’t see so much actual streaking. The color lasted for eight hours before having noticeable fading, and it felt a little drying after the six-hour mark. Kat Von D Plath (LE, $20.00) is cooler (95% similar).

It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color payoff, but the texture had a moderate amount of slip such that the color applied unevenly and settled into lip lines over time.

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . ColourPop Lippie Stix ($5.00 for 0.0352 oz.) are slim, twist-up lipsticks that have a sweet, vanilla-y scent (that sometimes smells a little waxy, too) in a variety of shades and finishes. Each finish has its own formula, and all six shades in this post had matte finishes. This type of finish is supposed to have “full coverage,” long-wear, and be “ultra comfortable.” Some can be dry, others have just enough creaminess not to be difficult to use. Similarly, some have a more matte finish than others. Wear varies from shade to shade but leans towards four or longer, and some shades are drying over time. 64 7 Contempo 64 7 Contempo A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total 49 7 Dazed 49 7 Dazed A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total 88 12 Grunge 88 12 Grunge A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 92% Total 21 23 Nevermind 21 23 Nevermind D+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 6 Product 7 Pigmentation 7 Texture 7.5 Longevity 3.5 Application 69% Total 59 10 Oh Snap 59 10 Oh Snap A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total 44 6 Poison 44 6 Poison A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colourpop Colour Pop 8 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""MAC Enchanted Eyes/Mauve Eyeshadow Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Oct 14, 2015 October 14, 2015 MAC Enchanted Eyes/Mauve Eyeshadow Palette MAC Enchanted Eyes/Mauve Eyeshadow Palette ($39.50 for 0.15 oz.) includes six eyeshadows with a mauve (more purple to me) theme. Three of the shades (Lightfully, Subtly Elegant, and Magic Moor) have been released in past palettes but are not part of the permanent range. This is a dud palette to me, and it’s pretty much a good example of why MAC’s holiday palettes are no longer highly anticipated. The holidays used to mean a good deal on great eyeshadows from MAC, but now it seems like rinse and repeat with so-so shades that do more to ruin the brand’s reputation than enhance it. Their lip and pigment sets are still (usually) worth checking out, at least. Lightfully is described as a “white with pink reflects [with a Lustre finish].” It’s a pink-tinged white with larger white sparkle and a frosted finish. It was powdery and dry, which yielded semi-sheer color payoff. The color looked faded after seven hours of wear. MAC Radial Pink (LE, $16.00) is less shimmery (95% similar). Cle de Peau Purity (Right) (P, ) is more shimmery (95% similar). Makeup Geek Illusion (P, $12.00) is more shimmery, darker (90% similar). MAC 2x Dare #1 (LE, ) is more shimmery (90% similar). Wet 'n' Wild Petalette #2 (P, ) is less shimmery, warmer (90% similar). Giorgio Armani Open (LE, ) is less shimmery (90% similar). MAC She's Got Class (LE, $32.50) is more shimmery (90% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Pretty Jazzed is described as a “soft lavender mauve [with a Velvet finish].” It appeared as a pinky-lavender with a satin finish in the pan, but there was virtually no color payoff whatsoever when I tried to swatch it. Even scraping at it, I just couldn’t seem to get much of anything to stick/show up. Hopefully, you’ll understand that this was difficult to test since it barely adhered, so the best I could tell was maybe four hours of wear. I tried to pick dupes that represented what you see in the pan, not necessarily the swatch. MAC Fizzy Rose (LE, $16.00) is warmer (90% similar). MAC Digit (P, $16.00) is cooler (90% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Swing Out is described as a “pinky violet [with a Satin finish].” It’s a light-medium lavender purple with cool undertones and a satin to pearl finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a lightly soft texture (a little firm) that wore well for seven and a half hours. Lancome Rich History (LE, $19.00) is less shimmery (90% similar). Milani Bella Violet (14) (P, $4.49) is darker (90% similar). MAC Digit (P, $16.00) is lighter (85% similar). Sugarpill Frostine (P, $16.00) is less shimmery, lighter (85% similar). Urban Decay Tainted (LE, $19.00) is less shimmery, darker (80% similar). Colour Pop Eye Candy (P, $5.00) is lighter, warmer (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . A Different Vibe is described as a “light beige-grey [with a Lustre finish].” It’s a sparkling, light-medium taupe brown with warm undertones and larger flecks of glitter. It had semi-opaque color coverage, which is better than some Lustres, though it has that chunkier consistency where the glitter typically separates from the base more. The color wore well for eight hours but had fall out issues. Stila Rose Pewter (LE, $18.00) is more shimmery, darker (90% similar). Tarte C'est La Vie (LE, ) is less shimmery (90% similar).

Lancome Tenacity (P, $19.00) is darker (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Subtly Elegant is described as a “light grey lilac [with a Matte finish].” It’s a muted, dark taupe brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It was dusty, thin, and semi-sheer while also suffering from issues blending out–it turned quite patchy. It lasted for seven hours. Wet 'n' Wild Sweet as Candy #1 (P, ) is lighter (95% similar).

Magic Moor is described as a “rich blackened plum with pearlized pigment [with a Veluxe Pearl finish].” It’s a blackened purple with neutral-to-warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The texture was oddly dry and thin, particularly for a Veluxe Pearl! It came together as I pressed it against the skin, but it applied horribly with a fluffier brush (like the 239). It wore well for eight hours, so I guess that was the upside! LORAC Deep Purple (P, $19.00) is lighter (95% similar). MAC Black Slip (LE, $16.00) is warmer (95% similar).

It had good pigmentation when applied with fingertips–which is as marketed–and medium, buildable coverage that blended out easily along the edges. It highlighted the skin with a noticeable, luminous sheen but did not emphasize my pores or my skin’s natural texture. The highlighter/blush lasted for ten hours on me.

It had good color payoff that was buildable to opaque coverage. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and creamy without being thick or overly glossy. The formula definitely felt more powder-like once I started to work with it on my skin but had initially felt more like a cream formula in the pot. I noticed that this shade did not apply as evenly as others in the line-up, though it still applied well overall. It went on lighter as I diffused and blended it out and did not have as much color/tint as I expected. It lasted well for nine and a half hours on me before fading a bit.

It has a spongy, creamy texture that has slight wetness to the touch, but it has the thinner, more powder-like feel of a cream-to-powder product when worked with (whether using fingertips, brushes, or sponges) and not a thicker, true cream texture. The added slip helped the formula blend seamlessly over my cheek bones while retaining coverage and minimizing any disturbance to my foundation/base products. They worked well over bare skin or on top of liquid foundation or powdered foundation in my experience. The wear time ranged between nine and 10 hours on me.

The texture was fairly soft, but there is a lot of sparkle/glitter in the blush, so it doesn’t feel totally smooth on the skin. The sparkle is very noticeable on the skin, and it did seem to get everywhere. Beyond the sparkle, it has a frosted sheen that slightly emphasize pores. It had decent pigmentation, which was buildable to mostly true-to-pan color if desired. The color blended nicely and looked even and smooth on the cheeks.

This version seemed slightly less frosted/metallic to me than the permanent version. Chanel Camelia de Plumes (LE, $76.00) is cooler-toned. Cle de Peau Delicate Pink (14) (P, $55.00) is pinker.

I actually purchased this shade to review when it was added to the permanent earlier this year, but I never got around to it (such is the life of a permanent product–go sit in the corner until I’m done with these limited editions!). It gives a a soft sheen that’s luminous without being metallic, so it doesn’t emphasize pores or skin imperfections. The color payoff is decent, but it is a more buildable product than one that’s intense right out of the pan. The texture is soft, finely-milled, and goes on smoothly without looking powdery on the skin. On me, it actually lasted six and a half hours, which is improved from a few years ago–I have found that MAC has improved their Mineralize products over the years (especially in regards to texture). 75 35 Lightscapade 75 35 Lightscapade B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 6.5 Longevity 5 Application 84% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

"[""NARS NARSissist Eyeshadow Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jan 18, 2014 January 18, 2014 NARS NARSissist Eyeshadow Palette NARS Eyeshadow ($79.00 for 15 x 0.03 oz. or 0.45 oz.) includes fifteen eyeshadows. NARS’ eyeshadows are supposed to be “highly pigmented, longwearing, and crease resistant” while the “color glides on smoothly, evenly, and blends effortlessly.” Some of the issues I had with this palette are issues that I have found to occur with several NARS eyeshadows I’ve tried in the past. There are some NARS eyeshadows I absolutely love, but there are a lot that leave me wanting more. In general, if you always use an eyeshadow primer, then this palette is workable, but if you don’t, some of the shades have trouble adhering to dry skin–if you have slightly oily lids, then that should help the powders stick better as well. The texture of the eyeshadows in the palette are all a little harder/firmer than corresponding singles/duos (I don’t have them all, but comparing to the ones I did have in their original single/duo form, it held true). Wear varied between seven and nine hours, depending on the shade. All of the eyeshadows are from existing singles or duos (and all of them are currently available, I believe, though a couple are considered Vintage, and one is limited edition), so if you only love one or two, you might consider buying them individually. In regards to value, NARS eyeshadow singles are $24.00/0.07 oz. or $342.86/oz., while duos are $34.00/0.14 oz. or $242.86/oz. The palette is $175.56/oz., so you will get more product for less money when you purchase them together. I think if you love more than five or six shades, then the palette is probably the way to go. 0.03 oz. is plenty of eyeshadow to last you a good while, and if there are any you really use up all the time, most are available permanently. To clarify, the #1/#2 or I/II is to indicate left/right side of a duo. This palette appears to be fully sold out online at this time, though it was supposed to be exclusively available through NARS’ e-commerce website beginning January 15th with February 1st as the launch date for department/specialty stores. Nordstrom did release it early (January 13th), but it went “unavailable” shortly after–whether it sold out or if they took it down until February 1st, I don’t know. So while sold out for now, there should be other retailers/stores that you can purchase from closer to February 1st, but if it’s really something on your wish list, you might trying calling your local store/counter and asking if they have it available for sale. All About Eve #1 is described as a “flesh-toned neutral.” It’s a muted, yellowed beige with a soft, frosted finish and warm undertones. It had nice color payoff, though it’s close enough to my skin tone that it might not look that way, but I can assure you that it was opaque. It applied smoothly and evenly to the lid. Tarina Tarantino Delightful #4 (P) is similar. Chanel Quadrille #2 (LE) is lighter. Too Faced Cheers! (LE) is less beige. Maybelline Barely Brazen (P, $6.99) is warmer, darker. MAC Jest (P, $15.00) is similar. MAC Naked (P, $21.00) is slightly warmer. MAC Naked Lunch (P, $15.00) is warmer. See comparison swatches . Madrague #2 is described as a “matte caramel.” It’s a medium brown with warm, yellowed undertones and a matte finish. The texture was somewhat stiff to work with, so the color payoff wasn’t fully opaque. Scraping off the top layer helped a little bit going forward. This shade showed signs of creasing after seven and a half hours. Makeup Geek Latte (P, $5.99) is darker, less yellow. Makeup Geek Frappe (P, $5.99) is slightly shimmery and less yellow-toned. Makeup Geek Creme Brulee (P, $5.99) is warmer, less brown. Chanel Charming #2 (LE) is darker. Too Faced Chocolate Milk (LE) is slightly darker. Bobbi Brown Frappe (LE, $29.00) is lighter. LORAC Taupe (P) is darker. MAC Brownluxe #2 (P) is shimmery. theBalm Allegro (P, $16.00) is slightly darker. Inglot #342 (P, $6.00) is darker. See comparison swatches . Fez is described as a “velvety cocoa.” It’s a warm-toned, coppery-bronze with a frosted finish. This was the best eyeshadow in the palette; incredibly pigmented, very soft and buttery. It wore well for nine hours. Charlotte Tilbury Golden Quartz (P) is a cream product, darker. Clarins The Essentials #7 (LE) is slightly darker. Chanel Charming #3 (LE) is similar. MAC Her Cocoa #3 (LE, $15.00) is lighter. Urban Decay Ambush (LE, $18.00) is browner. MAC Divine Decadence (P, $15.00) is similar. Too Faced Gangsta (LE) is more golden. Milani Intermix (P, $6.99) is slightly browner. See comparison swatches . Bali is described as a “neutral.” It’s a dark brown with cool undertones and a matte finish. This eyeshadow just wouldn’t adhere to bare skin well; on my arm, I could pack it on (tried it with fingertips, brushes, and sponge-tip applicators), but it would sheer away to nothing. When I later worked with it on the lid, it adhered better (my eyelid is less dry compared to my arm), but it was a little stiff when blending. Over NARS’ primer, it did just fine, though. The texture was really soft (can be a little powdery), and it is incredibly pigmented in the sense that a lot of product gets on the brush just lightly tapping it on the surface of the powder–it just doesn’t stick to bare skin well. Compared to the permanent single of this, it is less pigmented and doesn’t bind as well. It was hard to rate this one, because technically, pigmentation was fine except it didn’t stick, which is more of a general quality (maybe a texture) issue. Tarina Tarantino Delightful #5 (P) is not quite as matte. Too Faced Dark Chocolate (LE) is darker. bareMinerals Boardroom (LE) is darker. Kat Von D Wolf (P) is warmer. Urban Decay Secret Service (P, $18.00) is is similar. Urban Decay Faint (P, $18.00) is lighter, warmer. MAC Cross-Cultural (LE, $15.00) is warmer. MAC Charcoal Brown (P, $15.00) is similar. Inglot #363 (P, $6.00) is slightly plummy. Bobbi Brown Hot Stone (LE, $29.00) is cooler-toned. See comparison swatches . Coconut Grove is described as a “deep brown infused with reflections.” It’s a deep brown with a matte finish. It might say “infused with reflections,” but I didn’t see any sparkle when applied! I had all the same issues with this as I did with Bali, though this one wasn’t as powdery and did adhere better–so same issues but not as severe. Laura Mercier Espresso (LE, $23.00) is redder in tone. Chanel Charming #4 (LE) is lighter. Too Faced Dark Chocolate (LE) is slightly lighter. Tom Ford Beauty She Wolf #1 (LE) has a redder tone. bareMinerals Boardroom (LE) is similar. theBalm Matt Ramirez (LE, $16.00) isn’t quite as dark, warmer. MAC Midnight Flurry (LE, $15.00) is cooler-toned. MAC Dance in the Dark (P, $15.00) is cooler-toned. MAC Showstopper (LE, $15.00) is similar. MAC Embark (P, $15.00) is similar. bareMinerals Foreshadow (P) is cooler-toned. Inglot #329 (P, $6.00) is slightly warmer. See comparison swatches . Madrague #1 is described as a “matte cream.” It’s a pale, yellow-toned beige with a matte finish. It’s another shade that matches my skin tone, so it may not look like it’s as pigmented as it really is–but it was nicely pigmented, soft and blendable, and easy to use. bareMinerals Velvet Nude (LE, $14.00) is similar. Wet ‘n’ Wild Hard Being the It Girl #3 (LE, $2.29) is a touch lighter. Disney by Sephora Ali Ababwa (LE) isn’t as warm-toned. Urban Decay Foxy (P, $18.00) is slightly yellower in tone. See comparison swatches . Nepal is described as a “soft sheer rose.” It’s a soft, peachy brown with a warm undertone and a frosted finish. It had fairly good color payoff, and the texture was soft and applied smoothly overall. Too Faced Marzipan (P) is similar. bareMinerals Ball Gown (LE) is lighter. LORAC Light Bronze (P) is warmer. See comparison swatches . Ashes to Ashes is described as a “shimmery violet based brown.” It’s a medium brown with a frosted sheen and subtle warm undertones. The texture was stiffer, and the color didn’t go on as strongly as it looked in the pan–it also looked a lot more golden swatched than it does in the pan. MAC Crushed Clove (P, $15.00) is warmer. Too Faced Jingle All the Way Eyeshadow #4 (LE) is more golden. Sleek MakeUP Court in Cannes (LE, $9.99) is more golden. bareMinerals Schmooze (LE) is similar. See comparison swatches . Brousse #2 is described as a “black violet.” It’s a muted, smoky purple with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was a drier, stiffer color to work with, and the pigmentation reflected that with semi-opaque color payoff. This one creased on me after eight hours of wear. Makeup Geek Drama Queen (P, $5.99) is slightly brighter. Illamasqua Queen of the Night (LE) is also similar. See comparison swatches . Mekong is described as an “espresso infused with shimmer.” It’s a deepened brown with subtle warm undertones and gold sparkle and shimmer over a matte finish. It had good color payoff, and the texture was soft and fairly blendable. Despite its more matte finish, it adhered a lot better to bare skin than Bali or Coconut Grove! MAC Midnight Hour (LE, $15.00) is more matte. MAC Beluga (LE, $15.00) is darker. Chanel Mystere #1 (LE) is darker. Disney by Sephora Cinders (LE) is also darker. Dior Night Golds #3 (LE) is similar. See comparison swatches . Bellissima #1 is described as a “shimmering beige with subtle glitter.” It’s a pale, peach-tinged beige with sparkle. It had fairly good color payoff, and the texture was soft and blendable–a smidgen powdery. There are so many similar beiges to this, though not as many that have the sparkles — see comparison swatches . Lhasa is described as a “lavender grey.” It’s a purpled taupe with a frosted finish and cool undertones. It had fairly good color payoff, but the texture was stiffer than it is with the permanent single–and the color payoff isn’t as good. It is buildable, so I think you can get comparable color to the single, but Lhasa is a really lovely eyeshadow as a single and less stellar here. Guerlain Les Tendres #4 (LE) is less shimmery. Bobbi Brown Smokey Grey (LE, $21.00) is darker. Urban Decay Darkside (P, $18.00) is brighter. MAC Graphic Style (LE, $15.00) is cooler-toned. MAC Hypnotizing (LE, $15.00) is more frosted. See comparison swatches . Bad Behaviour is described as a “deep pewter.” It’s a dark gray with a teal shimmer and frosted sheen. It had good color payoff, and the texture was mostly soft and smooth, but it was different than the single that was released over the holidays. The texture is completely different–firm versus incredibly soft and almost pliant–and the color of the palette shade leans very teal with a stronger sheen, whereas the single looks grayer. Makeup Geek Galaxy (P, $5.99) is grayer. Dior Golden Snow #5 (LE) is less frosted. MAC Nighttrain (LE, $15.00) is grayer, darker. See comparison swatches . Dogon #2 is described as a “charcoal.” It’s a blackened navy with very fine navy shimmer over a matte base. It had so-so pigmentation, and the texture was a little stiff (definitely not as soft as Bali/Coconut Grove). bareMinerals Black Leather (LE, $14.00) is blacker. Anna Sui Diamond Blue (LE) is similar. Wet ‘n’ Wild I Don’t Do Camouflage #2 (LE, $2.29) is bluer. Inglot #389 (P, $6.00) is lighter, bluer. See comparison swatches . Pandora #2 is described as a “matte black.” It’s a deep, dark matte black with neutral undertones. This had similar issues as the ones I experienced with Bali and Coconut Grove–it just doesn’t stick that well to bare skin, even though it is seemingly quite pigmented as plenty of product gets onto the brush, it just sheers away quickly. As it is a more basic color, there are a lot of similar shades — see comparison swatches . 68 66 NARSissist Eye 68 66 NARSissist Eye B Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora

The packaging is the signature white of the Soleil collections, and it comes with a large, interior mirror; it felt substantial to hold and clicked together nicely. The eyeshadow colors applied well, lasted seven to eight hours, and despite having two glittery shades, had minimal fall out over time. The cheek colors were high-quality, pigmented, blendable, and long-wearing, though the more matte shade did not feel dense or as buttery as the more shimmery shade (not really unexpected, as that’s how it usually works out between textures). While pricey, it performed well, and you’d think that would be the norm for luxury products, but it isn’t, so I’m glad it did. I think that both the eyeshadow and blush formulas were comparable to their permanent formulas (though the eyeshadows are not the kind found in Nude Dip or Honeymoon, rather the brand’s other quads). I wish the brand broke out how much eyeshadow/cheek color was in the palette (oh, and names), because then I could give you a more accurate assessment of total value. Typically, the Eye Color Quads retail for $82.00 and contain 0.35 oz., while the Cheek Colors retail for $60.00 and contain 0.28 oz. Based on that, even if you were getting a full-sized quad and two, half-sized blushes, it would only come to $142, and we know it is less than that, given the total weight is 0.45 oz. of the palette and a full-sized quad and two half-sized blushes would come to 0.63 oz. If you’re someone who likes using all-in-one palettes or would easily reach for and use it as a cohesive palette, it might still have more subjective value to you, but otherwise, you would be better off choosing a full-sized, permanent quad and one full-sized blush (or even the Skin Illuminating Powder Duo), as you’d get more for your money and have the ability to choose the coordinating shades. 9 4 Cool (01) 9 4 Cool (01) A- Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Beautylish Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Cosbar Tom Ford 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total Get a shade-by-shade breakdown of this palette, along with individual photos and swatches… 01 /03 View All Tom Ford Beauty Cool (Winter 2016) Blush Cheek Color Tom Ford Beauty Cool (Winter 2016) Blush Cheek Color Tom Ford Beauty Cool (Winter 2016) Blush Cheek Color View On One Page Cool (Winter 2016) Blush Cool (Winter Soleil) Blush is a bright pop of medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. The texture was soft, smooth, not too firm or too soft in the pan, and blendable on the skin. It had the type of satin finish that became more and more noticeable as the product was buffed and blended on the skin, which resulted in a soft sheen that added luminosity to the skin without emphasizing the skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me. Top Dupes View Swatches View All Dupes Tom Ford Beauty Soleil Afterglow (Blush) (LE, ) is lighter (95% similar).

It had semi-opaque pigmentation (and it was the same both wet and dry) with a smooth, slightly wet-like feel to the touch, though it wasn’t a cream product. This shade applied evenly to the lid, while the flecks of glitter seemed to adhere better to the skin. I did notice that when I blended out a non-glittery shade into this one, my brush inevitably pulled a noticeable amount out, too, so you might want to smaller brushes to minimize finishes mixing, if undesired. It lasted for eight hours with minor fallout. Top Dupes View Swatches View All Dupes MAC Sugared (LE, $16.00) is cooler (95% similar). Urban Decay Specter (P, $20.00) is less shimmery (95% similar).

The consistency was smooth, dense, and a little “wet” in a way, but again, it was not a cream product. I don’t think it was necessary for the brand to include two glittery shades in the palette (especially as they are not that different), but this shade performed similarly to the other one. It had good pigmentation on its own, but it did darken and intensify with a damp application. The color lasted for eight hours with minor fallout.

The pigmentation was intense, so a little went a long way if you just wanted to add some luminosity to the skin! It had a soft, lightly dusty texture that was dense, buttery, and incredibly easy to blend out on the skin. It did add some color to my skin tone, so it would be more of a highlighting blush on those with similar coloring or are lighter, while it should work as a highlighter on deeper skin tones.
