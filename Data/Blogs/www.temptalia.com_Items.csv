Per the brand, the Lip Powder formula is supposed to be “buildable, blendable” and can be used “with our without balm” and “worn alone or layered on lips” (per the press release). I recommend using the Lip Powders with the balm or some sort of creamy base, because they are, as one might expect, rather powdery and dry, so alone they tended to emphasize every single imperfection on my lips along with my lip lines and gave me a painfully tight (I could feel my lips protesting when I tried to smile in photos) lips as the formula clung and clung and clung. With the balm layered underneath or on top (I preferred on top for easier and more precise results), it was a lot more comfortable to wear and more forgiving on my lips. 3 2 Poison Rose 3 2 Poison Rose B- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks Selfridges Macy's Net-A-Porter Barneys Harvey Nichols (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Space NK (UK) bluemercury Sephora (PL) Dillard's NARS 7 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 7.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 82% Total 01 /05 View All NARS Lip Priming Balm Lip Priming Balm NARS Lip Priming Balm Lip Priming Balm NARS Lip Priming Balm Lip Priming Balm NARS Lip Priming Balm Lip Priming Balm NARS Lip Priming Balm Lip Priming Balm View On One Page Lip Priming Balm Lip Priming Balm is a soft, peachy-coral with a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with moderate slip and a thin texture that wasn’t clingy. On its own, it pulled into my lip lines quite noticeably, but when layered with the powder lipsticks, it did not seem to be an issue. It wore well for three hours on its own and was neither drying nor hydrating. Top Dupes View Swatches View All Dupes Marc Jacobs Beauty Shakedown (P, $30.00) is lighter, warmer (95% similar).

The consistency was dense and more powder-like in the pan, but upon patting it onto my lips, it felt thin and dry with a clingy consistency that made my lips look rough–textured and lined. I had trouble getting this shade to adhere evenly, though it wasn’t terribly noticeable that it was uneven from afar. It had medium coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage in two to three layers. It lasted for four and a half hours on its own and four hours with the balm, but it was somewhat drying without the balm.

It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was lightweight, thin, and felt like a denser powder by touch, but it felt more like a true, thin powder when pressed and patted onto the lips. It spread well, though, and adhered intensely to my lips to the point where they felt shrink-wrapped (in a painful way). This was uncomfortable to wear on its own (four hours) and quite drying, and it was only tolerable with the balm (which had a similar wear time of four hours).

It had semi-opaque color payoff that was buildable to opaque coverage with a second application. The product had a dense, powder-like texture in the pan and then felt like a thinner layer of powder on my lips, which “absorbed” a bit and then felt like I had something clinging desperately to my lips. Without some slip, the product on its own emphasized my lip texture and made them appeared wrinkled. Layered with the balm, it was more comfortable to wear and forgiving on my lips. It lasted for over six hours on its own, left a stain behind, but was drying with the wear being only somewhat drying over time when used with the balm and still lasting for a good five hours on me.

The shade seemed to matte and so intense that it managed to reflect an almost orange-like sheen at times, which I’ve seen happen occasionally with very intense, bright, and more neutral reds (and I can’t figure out how to prevent it on my end…). It had medium, buildable pigmentation that applied fairly evenly but was prone to emphasizing lip texture as the product clung and made my lips feel (and look) shriveled. Smiling was uncomfortable with this product on. On its own, it wore well for over six hours but was drying and uncomfortable to wear; with balm, it lasted for five hours but the balm completely transformed the color… and somehow made it appear as a cooler-toned red.

['2008-06-01 00:00:00'],"['Pure Oxygen Skincare: Karin Herzog Vita-A-Kombi 1 Review Reviews Jun 01, 2008 June 01, 2008 Karin Herzog Vita-A-Kombi 1 ($52.00) is a product that boasts 1% of pure oxygen and Vitamin A, which is a patented combination by Dr. Herzog. This cream is meant to be used both morning and night, and it does a whole slew of things. It promotes healing, increases cell regeneration, minimizes pores, detoxifies, hydrates, diminishes lines and wrinkles, and desensitizes sensitive skin. I was using increased amounts of acne medications, and predictably, they made my skin more sensitive. There were few creams that I could use without feeling like my face was on fire. Vita-A-Kombi 1 was one of them, and even better, it can be used both morning and night. It is a fairly thick cream, and it does take some time (5 to 10 minutes) to sink into your skin. It is best applied with a light layer all over the face, but without rubbing it too much into the skin; instead, just let it absorb naturally. My skin looked refreshed, and it felt so soft. My only complaint was that every time I used this, my boyfriend told me I smelled like old lady. So I ended up wearing this mostly at night, rather than day, because I didn’t want people thinking I smelled like “old lady.” Otherwise, the results were right in line with what I expected, and my skin was happy to use it for a few weeks! The Karin Herzog line was the first to stabilize and deliver pure oxygen in cream form. The brand manufacturers their products in Switzerland, doesn’t conduct animal testing, and products are hypo-allergenic.

This was one of the few shades that had larger particles in it. The brand described it as having a sheer base, which I found to be true–the coverage came primarily from the amount of shimmer/sparkle rather than an actual base color. I could feel some of the sparkles occasionally, but it wasn’t rough or gritty. The gloss spread well across the lips and lasted for four hours on me. The formula felt hydrating while worn, too. The Lip Strobe formula is supposed to be “sheer to full coverage” depending on the shade and can be worn “alone or layered.” Per the brand, the semi-sheer shades are: Posh, Enchanting, Ritzy, Snobby, Shameless (sheer base), Mystical, and the full-coverage shades are: Boujee, Saucey, Foxy, Fearless, Moody (Angelic’s coverage was not described). The formula has a lightweight feel, lightly creamy as it goes on initially but has a lightly tacky texture overall. The gloss spread well across the lips and had fairly even coverage with minimal settling. The wear ranged from four to five hours with a lightly moisturizing feel. There was a faint, sweet vanilla scent but tasted a bit soapy to me.

It had medium coverage–which by the omission of indication of sheer, semi-sheer, or full coverage seemed to imply medium coverage–that covered the lips evenly. I had a bit of color that settled into my deeper lip lines but wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance due to the high-shine finish.

['2008-03-18 00:00:00'],"['Olivella – Moisturizer Oil with All Natural Virgin Olive Oil Review Skincare Mar 18, 2008 March 18, 2008 Olivella Moisturizer Oil ($21.95) This product is categorized as a deep moisturizing treatment for both face and body, and thus, it is targeted for those with very dry skin. It is made from 100% virgin olive oil while it has a light floral scent. It is said to be rich in antioxidants and vitamins. You only need a drop or two to apply to face or body. It is best to do it shortly after a shower, because damp skin better absorbs the product without leaving much in the way of an oily residue. I do find that it takes anywhere from ten to fifteen minutes to totally absorb, which means this is not ideal for those who only have ten or fifteen minutes to get ready in the morning. I like this product when I think about it as more of a treatment for incredibly dry skin that is best used shortly before bed, so you don’t have to worry about being oily at work or what have you. It can be purchased (and you can learn about Olivella products) at www.olivellasoap.com . Would you use this product?

I consider this my current staple, and I’ve actually be ignoring a lot of my other favorite night creams in lieu of this fabulous one. I also credit my lessened acne and breakouts to using this deliciously rich and quickly hydrating cream. I didn’t change anything in my skincare routine except for using this as my PM cream, and whoa nice skin! Although, I admit, I’ve been cheating on Hydrating Moisture Cream with an equally amazing NARSskin product–Aqual-Gel Hydrator–but more on that three-way relationship later on this week. Okay, what else makes this so great ? I fully advocate having a specific PM cream. I do believe in having separate AM and PM routines, because your skin needs different ingredients and products at different times. For instance, at night, I prefer richer, thicker creams because I’m not layering makeup on top of it. I’m not worrying that it will melt off or give me an oily appearance. While in the morning, I have to have SPF somewhere in my AM skincare routine–but why bother with SPF at night? You could definitely use the Hydrating Moisture Cream in the morning, because it does absorb fairly quickly (2-3 minutes tops), but I do prefer it for the evening. It just feels really luxe to me. I love pampering myself right before I head for some pillow time, you know? This cream has antioxidants like chestnut rose fruit, fennel to re-texturize the skin, and vitamins A and C. I’ve actually received several comments in the past few weeks asking what I’m using that’s giving me such glowy skin–perhaps its the NARSskin additions I’ve made in my life.

WHAT IT IS: Rock & Republic’s debut cosmetics collection accessorized the Spring 2009 runway. This fashion week, Rock & Republic is unveiling more than its latest take on luxe fashion with a sexy edge. The iconic lifestyle brand is complementing its Spring collection with its own decadent line of rich, vibrant makeup, available in stores beginning September 15th. In trademark Rock & Republic style, the spring fashion line boldly defies fashion conventions, pairing delicate fabric like chiffon and organza with hard structures like accentuated shoulders, cinched waists, and high-volume ruffles. Rock & Republic’s signature hard edge shone through the collection’s strong silhouettes in stark black and white. Super short dresses, graphic print leggings and skinny jeans with rouched zippers at the ankles stomped down the runway atop sky-high heels. In conceptualizing the collection’s makeup look, Rock & Republic President Andrea Bernholtz parlayed this nonconformity into a striking take on the conventional spring aesthetic. “While most brands present spring fashion with light, bright, pastel makeup, that look just doesn’t reflect the audacious, rock-inspired edge of the brand,” Bernholtz explains. “Instead, we used a rock style spring smoky eye, with pale grays to lighten the eye and luminous skin to create that enviable dewiness we look for in spring.” Celebrity makeup artist Jeanine Lobell collaborated with Bernholtz to realize her vision for the show using the brand’s indulgent new cosmetics. “The focus of the dramatic yet feminine look we created is a smoky eye with gradated grays, bringing an airy lightness to a sultry look,” Lobell reveals. “I was really inspired by working with the new line. The range of colors and the textures made it easy to bring the look together.” Get the look! Lobell began with Saturate Eye Colour in Ciggy for a light dove gray shadow base, melting into Saturate Eye Colour in Asphalt (matte lead shadow) on the lid and Saturate Eye Colour in Fatalistic (smoky black shadow) at the lash line, smudging the shadow under the eye and blending with Saturate Eye Colour in Asphalt. Lobell added intrigue to the look by rimming eyes with Bound Gel Eyeliner in Black and accentuating lashes with Extremist Mascara in Black. Lobell tempered the dark, smoky eye with a luminescent complexion using Trickery Tinted Illuminizer on the face. “Trickery was my secret weapon in creating this look, providing medium coverage with a dewy, natural, radiant finish,” Lobell explains. “The sheer, luminous formula perfectly offset the bold eye while evoking the freshness of spring.” To add a natural flush of color, Lobell applied Rock & Republic’s Imitate Mousse Blush in Rumor or Scandal, depending on the model’s complexion. The rosy, lush hues lent a feminine sweetness to the edgy aesthetic as the whipped souffle texture contributed to the glowing look. Lobell finished the look with a nude, glossy lip, using Luxe Lip Gloss in Imposter or Vacant. The understated, pale lip balanced the strong eye, making the look cohesive and bringing it into spring. ABOUT ROCK & REPUBLIC COSMETICS: Designed to evoke the brand’s trademark marriage of high fashion and rock and roll edge, the new cosmetics line embodies Rock & Republic’s rebellious style. From the line’s bold, dark shades to its sleek black patent leather and silver packaging, Rock & Republic Cosmetics defines modern makeup. The 116-piece collection, developed in-house over a three-year period, includes lip glosses, brushes, mascara, high-pigmented eye shadow, caffeine-infused tinted primer, and a Swarovski Crystal-embedded bronzer. WHAT IT COSTS: $18-$225 WHERE TO FIND IT: Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale’s, Harrods and RockandRepublicCosmetics.com .']",98ea689c5274fdc947b3f4aa48c6d2361a5455a4,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/rock-republic-nyfw-ss-2009-creates-buzz-for-their-makeup-line/

Here are some tips to get Gossip Girl hair! Jennifer Johnson, Department Head of Hair for Gossip Girl for Seasons 1 and 2, explains below how she achieves the fashion-forward looks on the show. A professional hairdresser for 18 years, Johnson started her career working in salons, then doing hair for Broadway and for Bette Midler’s tours, and finally becoming a behind-the-scenes hairstylist for film and TV. “Gossip Girl allows me to exercise lots of creativity because we are dealing with fun characters,” she states. “It’s really great and I feel fortunate!” Says Johnson, “I can’t say enough about how much the FHI Heat tools help me in my job. I love the shine and smoothness on the hair from the FHI Heat Runway styling iron! I love everything about what it does and offers–the heat, the adjustable temperature–I just can’t say enough good things about it!!! It’s my new favorite tool. I love also the T-Rex clips and the Nano Salon Pro 2000 Blow Dryer!” Learn how to style your hair like the cast of Gossip Girls! Blake Lively, who plays Serena van der Woodsen, always sports an effortless look. “I usually use the Runway styling iron to achieve this look which is never perfect, but always a little messy,” states Johnson. “For summer, we aimed for a wavy undone look. While for back to school and fall, we are aiming for a more constructed look for Serena.” About Serena’s “goddess look” for the summer Hamptons party: “This is a messy updo look,” explains Johnson, who outlines the steps below. 1. Curl whole head using a FHI Heat Curling iron 2. Use Runway styling iron to relax some of the curls 3. Twist some of the hair and pull it back 4. Pink up all the hair in back 5. Accessorize front by using a necklace as a headband Leighton Meester, who plays Blair Waldorf, always displays a very perfect, constructed look, finished off almost always with headbands. “To achieve this look of true perfection, I take half-inch sections of hair and curl it with the FHI Heat Curling iron, curling it in different directions, achieving big curls,” says Johnson. “I put the headband on after.” Taylor Momsen, who plays Jenny Humphrey, always sports a different look. One of her looks is super straight hair, which is achieved by applying the FHI Heat Hot Sauce to hair and then running the Runway iron through hair. The other look is a curly look achieved by curling the whole head with the FHI Heat Curling iron and then setting the curls with velcro rollers. www.fhiheat.com']",18db436f1d705b76fe3334a10b58de96fa4996f7,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/gossip-girl-hair-tricks-tips-by-fhi-heat/

The texture, pigmentation, and feel of the two I tried is phenomenal — incredibly smooth, extremely color-rich, and moisturizing. The wear time is top notch, giving me several hours and lasting through drinking a glass of water. Encounter Lipstick is an opaque shade red that almost looks and feels like a matte, but it is more like a satiny finish with plenty of color and a soft sheen. Not every red works well on me, but this one made me want to go out and show ’em off! Obey Lipstick is a pretty coral-pink that’s rich in color so it’s opaque, and it has the same satiny finish of Encounter. I just love when a lipstick is soft, creamy, and has a natural sheen to it. (I find it difficult to wear matte lipsticks sometimes!) I also tried out Lily Rose Sheer Lipgloss (£12.50 each), which is a semi-sheer red with just a little bit of pink and silver shimmer. It has an ultra glossy look when applied to lips, and it did give my lips plenty of color (kind of looked like watermelon-red on me).

LEAD ARTIST: Ayako, NARS International Makeup Director A young teenager from the 70’s, very fresh and innocent with a rebellious side. The concept was a modern take on the 18th Century turning point when clothes were becoming more wearable. “I call this look the Innocent Revolutionary,” said Ayako, who was inspired by the bright hues of the collection. “I wanted to use a vivid color palette that would complement the collection and give the girls a fresh, innocent look with an edge.” LOOK : Concentrating on monochromatic shades, Ayako used beige, yellow, and orange to create a fresh, innocent face. Soft, dewy skin and sparkled cheeks, combined with a brilliant yellow gold eyelid, brought a youthful brightness to the look. Ayako explained, “I did not use mascara because I wanted to create a bare, innocent eye”. A nude-peach gloss finish on the lips rounded out the fresh look.

L’Oreal Something Shiny is very similar. MAC Satin Slip has more peach-colored shimmer. Bobbi Brown Canary is a darker gold (more orange, less champagne) and much higher in shimmer content. The base is virtually colorless (there is a yellowish tinge, but it’s hard to see it, especially once applied to lips) and then a moderate amount of sparkle and shimmer. This shade felt like it had more sparkle with less shimmer, so as the gloss wore away, I could feel a few of the sparkles. It has a thin, non-sticky consistency feels incredibly lightweight on, so it’s comfortable wear and doesn’t slide around. This shade lasted just over two hours on me, which is shorter on wear than I expected and as compared to other shades I’ve tried in the range. I don’t expect this one to turn heads; anyone who really loves the formula or who has longed for a sheer/clear gloss with some shimmer but not all shimmer may want to consider this, but if you’re thinking about splurging on one or two shades from the range, I’d recommend one of the more unique shades in the range. 2 1 Gold Tchlack 2 1 Gold Tchlack A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Cosbar Escentual Sephora (PL) Dillard's 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 7 Longevity 5 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Think MAC pigments, but more of a powdery texture and more finely milled. They can be used wherever you want, however you want. I only used mine with mixing medium, personally, as I found without the adhesiveness of mixing medium, they didn’t stay put as well. Pure Pigments ($19.00 for 0.12 oz.) are extremely pigment-rich loose color that are matte in finish. They’re like Star Powders, but they’re more intense and contain no shimmer. Pretty much all of the Pure Pigments will stain the skin (and your brushes — so be sure to wash those ASAP! after using). #920 is a shimmery muted golden yellow with frosty shimmer. This is a good base shade under golds, browns, pinks, and oranges. #910 is a grayish-green with golden shimmer. It looks like an olive green at first, but it’s a bit more gray. #958 is a pretty medium green–reminds me of a grassy green, actually. It has slightly more subtle shimmer than some of the other Star Powders, though it is still noticeably shimmery. #960 is a mix of blue with aqua and green shimmer. It reminded me a lot of MAC’s Parrot eyeshadow, but in a loose form. It also seemed a little bluer. #929 is a warm, chocolate brown with golden shimmer. It goes on smoothly and has good color pigmentation. #18 is a matte turquoise. If you ever lusted after MAC’s long-discontinued Turquoise pigment, check this out. It’s extremely similar, but it’s much better in finish/texture. If you’re into intense color, you’ll love Pure Pigments. I don’t like how much they stain skin/brushes, and I don’t have a need for shades quite this bright, so I don’t think I’ll pick up any additional shades going forward.

What’s nifty about the compacts is that they’re already magnetized and there’s no depotting necessary. If you need to pop one out, just take a pair of tweezers to do so (I do this to prevent any “oops!”). You can also purchase the eyeshadows in pan-form only (I believe that those are $13.00 each) and then fit them into 10-pan palettes (I believe those are $13 as well). #158 is a matte, medium red. It goes on smoothly, has good pigmentation, and it doesn’t have a chalky texture. Because of the intensity of the red pigment, this color may stain lids temporarily. Compared with 99, this is a much subtler red. I like that it doesn’t have any noticeable brown in it, so it doesn’t come out brick red. #99 is a matte, bright apple red. It feels like velvet when swatched, and it packs a lot of color without much product. This one, like 158, may also stain lids temporarily. #75 is a matte, bright hot pink. This is the shade I used in yesterday’s look , and it definitely gives you a nice pop of bright pink color. It, too, will stain your lids, though. I didn’t wear a base beyond my lid, and anywhere I had #75 above my lid, it stained. It is pretty easy to work with and feels like a buttery matte with no chalkiness to it. #85 is a shimmery, soft pink. This is a pretty color, and it reminds me of MAC Pink Freeze, just not as gritty/glittery. This is smoother, and while it doesn’t pack a lot of color, it is a nice all-over-lid shade to brighten up eyes. #303 is a shimmery, pale pastel pink. All Make Up For Ever shadows that start with a 3 (e.g. #3_ _) are Diamond Eyeshadows. According to the brand, Diamond Eyeshadows is a combinatoin of their Diamond Powders and their regular Eyeshadows. No matter what you call it, they’re shimmery and iridescent. This is almost like a pink-meets-lilac color, but it runs a bit pastel and cool-toned with subtle silvery-pink shimmer. To avoid staining : make sure to layer a base underneath wherever you’re going to put a shadow that has the potential to stain. When I used #75 on my eyes, it only stained above my crease, where I laid it down directly onto skin. The staining does fade after about a day or so, though.

Personally, I skipped on some of the more intense, straight yellows, just because I tend not to look good in those shades (Chrome Yellow, anyone?), so I need more time to swatch and play with them in person before getting any of those. #5 is a matte orange-coral. Smooth, pigmented, and easy to use, #5 is quickly becoming a favorite. It’s nice on the eyes, but I love it as a blush. Just be careful, because a little goes a long way, and it’s better to build up than buff out. #10 is a shimmery, true golden yellow. This is the equivalent of Goldmine eyeshadow with a little less orange and less frostiness. #153 is a peachy-orange shade with gold shimmer. When I saw it at IMATS, it reminded me of a deeper MAC Say Yeah eyeshadow (which was limited edition, and I also adore it!). It is definitely similar, but it is a bit more intense. I love this to highlight cheeks on top of #5. It just gives it a nice glow and softness. This also works well on the eyes, too. And if #5 is a new blush favorite, #153 is a new cheek highlighting favorite. #102 is a matte, pale beige-y color (or off-white, if you prefer). They describe it as “eggshell,” and it’s a rather apt description. It makes for a good neutral matte highlighter when you may already have frost overkill on the eyes. #101 is a soft, pale white-gold with pale gold shimmer. Of the shadows I’ve really worked with so far, this is one of the few that has been more disappointing. I find the pay off to be a bit glittery/chunky and not smooth like I’ve come to expect from the brand. It also seems to be the same when used in application, too. I thought I’d use it as a nice highlighter, but it doesn’t work well for that purpose either. Which of these are your favorites? Check out more photos !

It’s famous as a contouring brush, particularly for larger areas — like the hollow of the cheeks, forehead, and jaw line. It’s a bit oversized for smaller areas like the nose. It’s an incredibly soft brush with minimal shedding (at least, in my experience). Despite being touted as a contour brush, the 168 works well for applying thicker foundatoins like Studio Sculpt, applying blush more precisely, and blending out product.

['2009-09-01 00:00:00'],"['Illamasqua Fable Lipstick Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Sep 01, 2009 September 01, 2009 Illamasqua Fable Lipstick: Matte Bubblegum Pink Illamasqua Fable Lipstick ($20.00 for 0.14 oz.) is described as a “matte bubblegum pink” by Sephora. Fable is an opaque, warmed-up bubblegum pink. I’ve found most bubblegum pink lipsticks to run a tad cool, while I find this one has a definite warm edge to it. I also wouldn’t call it matte, and I’d say it is more of a semi-matte finish, because there is some glossiness/sheen to it that I don’t normally see in matte textures. I do like the way it looks with just the hint of glossiness, because it keeps the lipstick from being too dry (it’s a smidgen creamy) or flat. Illamasqua packs plenty of pigmentation into this tube of lipstick; there’s no building or layering required to achieve the opacity as seen in the lip swatch. Though a lipstick will cost you $20, the value is still strong, because you get 0.14 oz. for your troubles. Compared to other high-end brands, Illamasqua is just a bit more expensive than MAC ($140/oz. vs. $143/oz.), but not by much. Their lipsticks are priced right in line with other competitors like Cargo and Make Up For Ever, as well. The packaging is functional and isn’t over-sized (like their eyeshadows/blushes can feel like)–there’s just nothing special to it.

My photos are of the limited edition release of the 182 brush from MAC’s Couture Collection (I believe these retailed around $54), and I fell absolutely in love with it so much so that I purchased a second one. I actually really love the square handle on it, but the round handle works just as well. The brush is extremely dense and full, but the most amazing thing about it is how flawless it makes your face look. No matter what powders, liquids, or blushes you use, the 182 is always there to soften your look and eliminate any harsh edges or unevenness. I also LOVE it for applying liquid foundations like Studio Fix Fluid (moreso than the 109 and 187). I do find this is a high quality brush, so I personally believe it is well worth the cost. This ranks amongst my top five must-have brushes if you’re on a tight budget! However, if this is just too expensive for you, I recommend putting it on your wishlist for birthdays/holidays.

Of MAC’s various face brushes, I do find that the 129 does have a tendency to be scratchier than others, but it is definitely something that gets better with time. After a few washes, the brush is as soft as most MAC brushes, and it feels fluffier than when you first purchase it. It sheds occasionally, but not enough to make me hesitate on purchasing it again. I personally find this is better as a blush or bronzer brush than a powder brush, because it isn’t fluffy enough for my liking when it comes to applying loose or pressed powder all over. MAC does make a short handled version of the 129 (this is a brush of the same quality and caliber as the long handled 129–just to distinguish it from special edition 129 brushes), but I personally prefer longer handles.

The end of the brush tapers into a rounded tip with angled sides. The brush shapes reminds me of the 226 or 224, except several times larger. The bristles feel incredibly soft against the skin, and I have found mine to shed very rarely (which basically means I can’t remember it really shedding at all). The 138 can be used for a variety of applications: creams, liquids, highlighters, blushes, and contouring. It is touted by MAC as a contouring and highlighting tool, but like most brushes, usage depends more on you and your needs. To contour with this brush, simply slant it against your face with the tip pointing towards your mouth. To highlight, just use the tip of the brush on the areas you would like to highlight.

(The other shade is Gems .) If you’ve been following my coverage of various permanent shades of Rouge G, you’ll know the formula is smooth, luxurious, and often, shades are opaque. The lipstick contains a smoother, softer shimmer that’s not frosty or glittery. Wear time is about four or five hours, though it’s not a long-wearing lipstick, so it won’t last through dinner and drinks. Grace is a soft, beige-y pink with a soft pink-peach shimmer. On my lips, it does look a lot like a subtle enhancement of my natural color and doesn’t really pack a punch as far as color goes. Depending on your tastes/needs, you may l ike the subtly and softness of this holiday shade, while others may find the muted color too bland for their liking. Bottom Line: It’s a nice shade, and it’s something you can easily wear any time–not just the holidays–and for any occasion. The price will always be a sticking factor for some, and Rouge G isn’t for everyone (I’m pretty sure Guerlain was well aware of that fact when they priced these at $45 a pop), but they are very nice splurge items, particularly when you find just the right shade for you.

I am kind of this girl. I don’t think it’d be honest to try and downplay that I have a respectably sized beauty stash, so let’s not sugarcoat it: I don’t really need more makeup (in fact, need has long as since been replaced with want ). So I thought to myself, “What could others give me that would still excite me?” I am also notorious for my lack of patience, so when there’s something I want (beauty or otherwise), I tend to buy it myself if I really want it. What are your picks for the girl who has everything? My picks: Holiday Cookbook ($35.00) is a six-piece shower gel set (each with 2 oz.) housed in a cardboard “cookbook.” It contains the following scents: Red Velvet Cake, Cinnamon Buns, Spicy Pear Cobbler, Pumpkin Spice Muffin, Gingerbread, and Double Rich Hot Cocoa. Delicious! You can find this gift at: Nordstrom , Philosophy.com , Sephora . Urban Decay Show Pony Shadow Box ($30.00) contains six shades of eyeshadow – a good mix of funky, brighter shades with more neutral toned shadows, plus a miniature-sized 24/7 Eye Pencil in Zero and Eyeshadow Primer Potion. The shades included in this palette are Snatch, Mildew, Flash, Painkiller, Smog, and Toasted. I do have this already, but it’s a palette that some beauty buffs may overlook in lieu of the BoS II. Urban Decay Book of Shadows Vol. II ($48.00) is a palette that’s big on value and big on color. For the person who’s been extra good this year, you may find yourself wanting to give this collection of sixteen eyeshadows to them. It includes new/exclusive shades: AC/DC, Nylon, Mushroom, Sphynx, Jinx, Homegrown, Misdemeanor, and Perversion; as well as existing/best-selling shades: Sellout, Gunmetal, Ecstasy, Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, Twice Baked, Half Baked, Flipside, and YDK. Also included are miniature-sized Zero and Bourbon 24/7 Eyeliner Pencils and a travel-size Eyeshadow Primer Potion–all three fit nicely within the palette to boot. Like the Show Pony Shadow Box, there are some of us who felt like we just couldn’t justify the price tag on this palette or felt it was “too similar” (though I don’t think it is!) to last year’s. Urban Decay 24/7 Super Stash ($36.00) is a superb collection of miniature-size eyeliners in a variety of bold shades. If you’ve been reading the blog for a bit, you’ll know that I favor these liners quite a bit–they’re often my go-to liner. I absolutely adore their holiday sets, because practically speaking, most of us won’t finish an entire pencil of blue, but half the size and cheaper? Yes, count me in! The set contains nine different shades: Binge, Corrupt, Eldorado, Graffiti, Oil Slick, Ransom, Rockstar, Stash, and Zero. Everyone can use more eyeliner! Smashbox Wish For The Perfect Pencils ($32.00) includes five, full-sized and stunning limited edition shades of pencil eyeliner (Celebrate, Dream, Hope, Love, and Wish). Smashbox did a tremendous job formulating these eye pencils–they are definitely a top formula and wear so well. These are so fantastic in quality and only available for the holiday season that I think the seasoned beauty shopper would appreciate this surprise. See more picks. .. Bliss Softening Socks ($48.00) are these awesome socks that pretty much come with this gel lining that soothes and moisturizes your feet while you wear them. Bliss says that a pair of socks lasts for up to fifty uses (not too bad!) and you wear ’em for about twenty minutes. (You can even get them in a nifty holiday gift box at Bliss .) You can also give the same technology, but for hands (gloves, rather than socks, duh!). This kind of an indulgent gift, so it may be something that would appeal to beauty addicts, but not something you’d cave in regularly, so it’s something nice to receive! Godiva Candles ($22.50 for 7 oz.) have some very aromatic scents that burn for apporixmately sixty hours. I don’t burn candles religiously, but I really love receiving them as gifts, because they’re something I do enjoy but don’t always feel compelled to actually purchase (though that’s been changing, ha!). BURN Candles ($60.00 for ~100 hours) come in amazing, complex scents that really waft throughout the room/rooms. I’ve found that I’ll burn one in the office, and the scent will be in the living room/kitchen and even in the bedroom. The scent is just enough to enjoy without being overwhelming. For the holidays, they’ve added the following scents: Firewood Embers, Grenadine Pomegranate and Sugar Pine Balsam. If you’re finding the price tag a little gift-giving prohibitive, they also have their BURN VOYAGE line, which are smaller-sized candles for $25.00 each that burn for approximately 35 hours. (On the other side, they also have candles that burn for approximately 150 hours for $95.00 a pop.) You can also find BURN at Barneys . Tom Ford Private Blend Eau de Parfum ($180.00 for 1.7 oz.) is an ultra elegant, so luxe gift to give (and uhh, receive? Oh, yes, please!). While I haven’t yet caved on any of Tom Ford’s amazing scents yet, I do take a sniff and test them whenever I’m at Nordstrom! Everyone I know who’s purchased a bottle hasn’t been disappointed. Seriously, I can’t think of many (or any that I know) who would be distraught to receive a bottle of Tom Ford. Clarisonic PLUS Skincare Brush Set ($225.00) is the latest Clarisonic, with a detachable body brush in addition to the facial brush. Like some other more price-heavy beauty items, it’s something a lot of beauty lovers lust after but can’t commit to purchasing–the exact reasons why it makes for an excellent gift to receive! Guerlain Le Rouge G de Guerlain Lipstick ($45.00 for 0.12 oz.) is a creamy, smooth, pigmented lipstick formula that applies and clings to lips without drying them. It has the most subtle, yet noticeable, shimmer that really shines without being garish. It’s really a top formula, but the price tag definitely slots it into the luxury bag. I think I’ll go as far as to say that everyone should own at least one shade of Rouge G (I think that the line offers many, many holy grail potential shades–for the right person), but that price tag makes us all think twice… or ten times. MAKE UP FOR EVER Aqua Eyes Collector Set (Value $425) Aqua Eyes Collector Set ($249.00) includes twenty-five shades of Make Up For Ever’s famous Aqua Eyes Eyeliner. The included shares are: Aqua Eyes in Champagne 23L, Fuschia Pink 13L, Purple 11L, Black Purple 6L, Shimmering Plum 4L, Burgandy 18L, Pearly Brown 2L, Light Brown 19L, Light Taupe 24L, Bronze Green 5L, Bronze 10L, Gold 9L, Pistachio 17L, Green 16L, Forest Green 20L, Turquoise 7L, Blue With Green Highlights 12L, Majorelle Blue 15L, Iridescent Navy Blue 3L, Mat Black 0L, Star Black 1L, Dark Grey 21L, Grey 22L, Silver 8L, White 14L. It’s a value set, even if it is a heavy investment. I love Aqua Eyes, and I can definitely tell you this set tempted me on more than one occasion (I managed to resist my staring at the dozens and dozens of liners I have sitting in a drawer already). T3 Bespoke Labs Evolution Dryer ($300.00) will cut your gift recipient’s blow drying time in half, most likely! This is one of those products often overlooked in lieu of sparkly new makeup, but it is an absolute essential if you blow dry your hair regularly.']",eec567150e1995686a022df1f084e3727369c536,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/best-gifts-for-the-girl-who-has-everything/

Slink is a pale champagne beige with a frosted finish. The color payoff was good, and it applied smoothly. It’s not an uncommon shade, though, so you may find you have several similar shades in your stash. Just a few shades to consider: Tarina Tarantino Elektron , MAC Call Me Bubbles , Giorgio Armani Madreperla , Urban Decay Booty Call , MAC Baby It’s Cold , MAC Dazzlelight , and many more . Focus is a medium-dark brown with a gray-ish tinge and a soft, metallic finish. This is a Liquid Metal, so it’s like a cream eyeshadow in feel. When I used it alone, it was prone to creasing after a few hours. When I used it underneath other eyeshadows in the palette, it didn’t crease. Bare Escentuals Most Requested has more plum in it. Tom Ford Platinum has less red-orange tones. Urban Decay YDK is more golden. Urban Decay Wreckage is grayer. Forgiveness is a soft plum with red undertones and a matte finish. This shade had decent pigmentation but was a little sheer and powdery. Lancome Color du Jour is a bit darker and has gold sparkle. Make Up For Ever #131 is darker and more intense. NARS Grand Palais is browner, less plum. Queen of the Night is a dark, smoky purple with a blackened brown base and very fine shimmer (that doesn’t really translate). The texture was very, very dry and somewhat powdery, while the color payoff was good. Queen of the Night Pure Pigment is much better than the eyeshadow iteration. Bare Escentuals Romp is lighter. Urban Decay Rockstar is purpler. MAC Hypnotizing is lighter. NARS Lhasa is lighter and grayer. Bobbi Brown Black Violet is somewhat similar when sheered out. All four shades work really well together, and it’s a very smoky, purple-themed look. The quality, overall, is just okay. The dryness and powderiness of Forgiveness and Queen of the Night were disappointing, especially because those are the two more interesting shades in the palette. I really had to pack on Queen of the Night to get decent intensity, and it was prone to disappearing when you went to blend the color. I noticed that after eight hours, Queen of the Night looked rather faded when applied over Focus . I didn’t see creasing, but there was some fading. However, I also layered Slink over Focus , and I didn’t see any fading there.

This review is one of those short and sweet kind, because the product itself is really simple. Like many Aveeno products, it’s not about frills, it’s about meeting a need. If I had to compare this to another high-end brand, I’d consider this similar to Philosophy’s Purity Made Simple (Foaming). This one comes in a bottle-shaped container with a pump to distribute the foam cleanser. I find one or two pumps is all I need to feel clean. It is advertised as a makeup removing cleanser, not just a cleanser, and it’s unfortunate, because it doesn’t quite remove all makeup. Whenever I have a makeup remover, I test it against the long-lasting power of MAC Fluidline. This removed some, but it didn’t remove all. It does remove the majority of my makeup (eyeshadow, non-waterproof mascara, foundation), but it’s not necessarily the best choice for heavier or more long-wearing products. I do, personally, prefer to remove heavier makeup with an oil-based makeup remover (like Lancome’s Bi-Facil) before I do my nightly cleanser, so it’s not a big deal for me. It’s just something that does take away from this product’s score, since it doesn’t completely live up to its claims. It smells like something soft and clean and a little sweet–it reminded me of baby shampoo, to be honest. When I was trying to describe it, all I could think of was baby shampoo as my descriptor. Bottom Line: This is an affordable cleanser that works well for daily dirt and grime and light to medium makeup. If you’re looking for a cleanser to remove heavy eyeliner, you may want to look elsewhere. I actually really liked it, and I was pleasantly surprised by it overall. I’ll probably be switching over my boyfriend over to this from Philosophy’s Purity Made Simple when he runs out.

Deborah Lippmann Supermodel Nail Lacquer ($16.00 for 0.5 fl. oz.) is a sheer, jelly cherry red that leans a little orange-coral. It’s glossy, and it’s genuinely designed to be sheer–it’s not meant to be opaque, so keep that in mind. It has a very squishy, jelly look on nails. I do think this will complement warmer skin tones best, but it doesn’t pull extremely orange, so cooler skin tones may still enjoy it. Where Supermodel stands out is in the formula–streak-free, a dream to apply, and doesn’t take eons to dry. But really, the lack of streakiness makes it this sheer a pleasure to swatch.

It’s exactly what it says: plush. I always get ultra black, thick lashes with this mascara. No matter how many mascaras I try, I always end up coming back to Plushlash. I think, ultimately, I might make the switch to Chanel Exceptionnel if it weren’t so pricey (and not 2.5x better than Plushlash). MAC’s Zoomlash is another good one, though I feel it’s a little more prone to clump, though it has the super black color I love. Givenchy Phenomen’Eyes ($28.00) is one of those new-fangled mascaras, because it has a crazy mascara “wand” which looks more like a spiky ball. This works best without a primer, as when I used it with MAC’s Prep + Prime, I found it smudged. Dior DiorShow Iconic ($27.00) beats out the original DiorShow for me, because Iconic doesn’t smudge or flake like DiorShow (the original) did for me. DiorShow is a classic mascara, known for its dramatic lengthening, thickening, and ultra rich pigmentation of black. Lancome Oscillation ($34.00) is a moving mascara. Oscillation doesn’t come cheap, but it really does work well to give you long lashes without clumping them up. It does take several applications to get the hang of it, and you’ll have to figure out what technique works best for you. You can read my full review if you please. Chanel Exceptionnel ($28.00) is a deliciously luxe formula that gives you incredibly dark, lush lashes with insane length. You can read my review and see how it looks! CoverGirl Lash Exact ($8.00) is a mascara that really proved drugstore mascaras often are better than high end products. Good level of color richness in the black, plus lengthening and thickening to make your lashes that much more enviable. If you need more volume, check out Volume Exact.

What I really wanted to do was find ways to incorporate the trends we saw on the red carpet into cohesive looks. One aspect that I noticed was how much hairstyle and lip color could alter the overall look–some starlets looked glamorous with hair down and softer lips, while others went with bolder lips with their hair up. There is something so old Hollywood about a simple up-do paired with a bolder–like a red–lip, which is always a classic staple of any red carpet event. I loved how Beyonce glowed at the Grammy’s with a simple red lip, brightened eyes, and lush lashes. On the other end, many stars let their locks flow freely with soft waves, ringlets, and curls, and often, this style is paired with a softer lip; sometimes it’s a beige, but this year, there was a lot of rose-lipped stars. You can see it on such stars as Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried . (I also thought it would be fun to channel Jessica Alba’s side-swept part, since it’s something I haven’t done in ages!) Look 1 Eyes : Define the brow by filling in with a color that matches your natural brow hair–I used COVERGIRL Eye Enhancers Eye Shadow in Brown Smolder filled in with an angled brow brush. Next, sweep on a warm gold (or cool silver) all over the lid–I used COVERGIRL Eye Enhancers 3 Kit Eye Shadow in Golden Sunset –and then defined the outer corner and crease very lightly with a matte dark brown ( COVERGIRL Eye Enhancers Eye Shadow in Brown Smolder ). I lined the lower lash line with a matte brown ( COVERGIRL LiquilineBlast Eyeliner Pencil in Brown Blaze ). Apply false eyelashes or layer on mascara, preferably one with defined bristles to minimize clumping and enhance definition; I used COVERGIRL Clump Crusher Mascara by LashBlast . Face : I began by applying my moisturizer, letting it sink in, and then applying liquid foundation. To set and mattify, I used CoverGirl + Olay Pressed Powder in Medium . Then, I swept on a subtle rosy hue on cheeks ( COVERGIRL Cheekers Blush in Brick Rose ) with a slight shimmer finish to highlight as well. Lips : To keep the look soft, feminine, and elegant, I opted for a light, rosy pink lip by using COVERGIRL LipPerfection Jumbo Gloss Balm in Radiant Rose . Hair : Start by washing hair (I used Herbal Essences Shine Collection Shampoo and Conditioner ), then spray on a heat protectant and blow dry locks until fully dry. I used four pumps of Aussie Miraculously Smooth Smoothing Serum (designed to reduce frizz) between my fingertips and then ran my fingertips through my hair to smooth everything out. Check out look two!

Hair : Start by washing hair (I used Herbal Essences Shine Collection Shampoo and Conditioner ), then spray on a heat protectant and blow dry locks until fully dry. Next, apply two pumps of a frizz-reducing product (I used Aussie Miraculously Smooth Smoothing Serum ) to dry hair, and pull into a tight ponytail about half-way on the head. I then twisted the ponytail and wrapped it around the base to create a bun. I used a dozen black bobby-pins to secure the bun in place, then spritzed the whole ‘do with hair spray (I used Herbal Essences Tousle Me Softly Hair Spray ).']",8e19a9d695cdde7f4973a074666c7cf08dc0f89a,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/bringing-the-red-carpet-home-with-pg-beauty/

They have an entire beauty and body care area in their stores devoted to delivering the latest and greatest healthy, natural beauty products for their customers. Their Organic Body Care Standards help to ensure the products you’ll find on their shelves are truly as organic as they say–all personal care products with an “organic” claim must be certified by USDA Natural Organic Standards and contain at least 95% organic ingredients. So when you see a label with “organic” on it, you’ll know you’re getting a product that meets their standards and isn’t just capitalizing on a trend. To create this lip, I first lined lips with Mineral Fusion Graceful Lip Pencil (a warm rosy brown). Then I layered Dr. Hauschka Red Quartz (13) Inner Glow Lipstick , a soft warm red, on top. As a final flourish, I topped off the lip color with a layer of Mineral Fusion Dazzle Lip Gloss , a medium rose with hints of beige. Natural beauty doesn’t have to be boring beauty! One of the hardest parts for customers when shopping for more natural and organic beauty products is that it can be difficult to suss out who actually means what they say. The government doesn’t currently require any labeling of organics in skincare, and this is why it’s incredibly helpful that Whole Foods Market has taken the guesswork out of the equation as the first major brand to make accurate labeling a requirement. Whether you’re looking for products for body, hair, skin, or makeup, you’ll find them at Whole Foods Market–and the brands and products they carry aren’t just throwing out buzz words; these brands stand behind their philosophies and embody them at the core. You’ll find brands like Gabriel , Mineral Fusion , Zuzu , Dr. Hauschka , Hemp Originals , and more.

['2012-08-27 00:00:00'],"['Worst Makeup on the Internet: A Culture of Negativity Site News Aug 27, 2012 August 27, 2012 This morning, I came across an article about makeup on the internet (as posted by PinkSith ) that decided to post photos of the “worst makeup on the internet” featuring photos of real people–not celebrities–who had the audacity to share those photos on the internet. Aside from the article being poorly researched (several of the looks I recognized as done in a certain vein/for a specific purpose, some even as parodies, most notably Queen of Blending’s hilarious makeup tutorial ), their commentary and the purpose of their article seems largely intended to be mean-spirited given the focus is on how “horrible” the makeup is rather than “do this, not that.” No doubt intended to be seething and go viral–but what a shame to see a large, professional website look to drive the self-esteem down of real women. We’re not trying to be mean, we just thought these pictures were bad enough to bring to your attention. In fact, we even think these real women are brave — or a little nuts — for not caring what people think about their makeup, and freely posting their photos online for all to see. There are enough problems with boosting the self-esteem of our youth (and our adults, for that matter) in general that the last thing we need are dedicated articles that put down people for doing what? Expressing their creativity? Having fun? Parodying a look? Deliberately doing something avant garde and out-of-the-box? Isn’t the reason why we all love makeup so much is because of the way it allows us to express ourselves in colors, hues, finishes, textures, and shapes? Isn’t one of the greatest things about makeup that it’s washable ? You can wear blue blush and rock it and love it, and you can wear beige eyeshadow the very the next day. You can go as bold or as subtle as you want to. There’s a big difference in giving someone constructive criticism and being cruel. Constructive criticism is about genuinely trying to help someone improve an area, which means it points out the problem and provides some detail about how to fix it or why it is a problem. If you have to start a statement with, “I don’t mean to be rude, but,” or “I’m not trying to be mean, but” you may want to re-think what you were going to say. Apologizing in advance for being mean, rude, or what-have-you, is not a justification to be such. “I’m sorry, but you look hideous in blue eyeshadow,” is different from, “I think it could work if you just used it on the inner corner” or “Have you tried purple eyeshadow? I think that would be more flattering on you!” Just this weekend, I saw part of an old episode of What Not to Wear , and yet again, a woman who broke down at being asked if she felt or thought she was pretty. Why can’t we feel beautiful about ourselves? Why are we taught to criticize ourselves and everyone else? Why do we spend more time breaking others down than building them up? I don’t understand it, and I lived through it to a T when I was in junior high and high school. I didn’t start believing I was beautiful and worthy of praise until a few years ago. I want people to feel good about themselves and be honest with themselves; to know their flaws and to work on them but to also appreciate all of the positive attributes they possess as well–and not just how they look but how they feel, how they think, and what their abilities are.']",7e7975081d966d3c51f507508eef68070f79b1f6,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/worst-makeup-on-the-internet-culture-of-negativity/

I couldn’t think of a great dupe for this; lipsticks that may have been somewhat similar in color lacked the shimmer/sheen, which is such a noticeable characteristic of this gloss that they didn’t look alike at all. MAC Style Packed is pinker with no iridescence. LORAC Cliche has some iridescence, but it’s pinker and so much sheerer. Benefit Wild Child also had an iridescent shimmer, but it was sheerer and lighter. Illamasqua’s Intense Lipgloss formula is supposed to deliver high-shine, rich color, and be non-sticky. Boost is mostly opaque, though there’s a little translucence that lets my natural lip color peek through. It’s very pigmented for a gloss overall, but it’s not as opaque as other shades in the range are. It does have an extremely glossy sheen, though, and the sheen lasts quite awhile. I wore this, and it lasted for five hours with the glossiness being pretty high-shine for three and a half of those hours. The color didn’t apply quite as evenly as it should have, though it’s one of those colors (because there doesn’t seem to be a lot on the market that is similar to it) that may make it worth the extra energy to apply. It’s not too heavy, feels comfortable on lips, and has a non-sticky texture–it feels very slick on lips. With Generation Q, I noticed that Illamasqua has changed the packaging on their lipglosses. They used to be slanted, squeeze-tubes, but now they’re clear plastic with a black screw-top that twists and reveals a brush-type applicator. Both of the glosses I receive with this type of applicator had several splayed bristles, which made application more difficult. The bristles could be a little softer, as they seemed to be a touch scratchy against the lips as well as created some brush strokes. I’m not sure if I just happened to get two exceptionally messed-up brushes or if a lot of them are going to be that way. For now, we’ll assume that because these were samples, they were an early run, and perhaps not pristine, but I don’t think the applicator is ideal for this gloss formula–a regular doe-foot would be easier to maneuver around the lips and be less likely to cause visible brush strokes.

So it’s been a couple of weeks since the Lady Gaga inspired look which totally wreaked havoc on my eyes, but my eyes seem to be recovered now. (They were swollen for a few days, and then they proceeded to just be itchy/red and consequently dry and flaky afterward. You know, generally unpleasant.) I thought I’d try to do something holiday-esque, but maybe not the most typical holiday look (err… at least, my typical holiday look) of golds, cranberries, and red lips. P.S. – Lashes are looking a little beat-up, because I was testing out a new mascara, wasn’t loving it, tried to layer another mascara over… and yeah, not the best idea. Lesson learned = don’t test new mascara when you’re doing an actual look! You will need the following… Eyes : Soft Ochre paint pot (neutral beige base), Goldmine eyeshadow (true gold), Bio-Green eyeshadow (medium green), Humid eyeshadow (dark green), Bottle Green eyeshadow (dark green-blue), Femme-fi eyeshadow (neutral highlighter), Smashbox Wish Pencil Eyeliner (dark green-blue), Urban Decay Honey 24/7 Liner (gold), too many mascaras (so ignore the lashes, they’re terrible) Face: Kiehl’s Tinted Moisturizer in Medium Cheeks : Dior Coral Riviera blush (coral-pink), Dior Amber Diamond Skin Shimmer (bronzy highlighter) Lips : Guerlain Gems lipstick (coral), Guerlain Perle de Lune lipgloss (pearly beige) Brushes : 266 (firm, angled brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 214 (smudge brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 129 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Femme-fi = Shroom Directions: Define brows using a coordinating powder shadow applied with the 266 brush. Apply Soft Ochre paint pot all over the lid as the base with the 249. On the inner lid, pack Goldmine eyeshadow on using the 239. Apply Bio-Green eyeshadow to the middle and outer portions of the lid. Darken crease with Bottle Green eyeshadow using the 226, then deepen the outer lid with Humid eyeshadow. Sweep Femme-fi eyeshadow underneath the brow bone to highlight. Finish with Urban Decay Honey Liner on lower waterline and Smashbox Wish Pencil Liner on the lower lash line. Apply mascara on lashes. Sweep apples of cheeks with Dior Corial Riviera blush using the 129, then highlight with Dior Amber Diamond Skin Shimmer with the 188.

I was able to get a very opaque look with three coats, but I didn’t get as many hexagonal pieces as I’d like on each nail. The key is definitely to let each coat dry longer, so that you don’t drag any of the glitter elsewhere. I’d also recommend doing one or two strokes for each coat, because each time you move the brush, you can displace some of the glitter, and get a patchier look. The drying time seemed a little shorter than average, and it had a slightly glossy finish even without a top coat.

MAC Deceit is darker, browner. Estee Lauder Cyber Lilac is more silver-shimmered, not as red-toned. Urban Decay Rockstar is the closest, but it’s a little darker. Bobbi Brown’s Long-Wear Cream Shadow is supposed to be a smooth, easy-to-apply cream eyeshadow that will last all day long without creasing or smearing. The brand recommends using a short brush (like the Cream Shadow Brush) to apply or use fingertips to blend out shade for a sheerer effect. The texture of Black Violet was a little stiffer than other shades I’ve tried from this range–not that it doesn’t have some creaminess, it’s just a little thin and less creamy. I had some trouble building up the color payoff; it didn’t want to get more than semi-opaque when I tried it on the lid. I still had good wear when I tried this alone; eight hours with no creasing and some fading around the edges when used without a primer, and then very similar results over a primer, just a smidgen less fading. 9 4 Black Violet 9 4 Black Violet B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 9 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 89% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It has a soft, satiny finish with a barely-there sheen. MAC Whole Lotta Love is lighter. MAC Supernova is more shimmery, less warm-toned. MAC Mocha is slightly more subdued. NARS Amour is more coral. Worth noting: I couldn’t see much of a difference between Coral Pink and Hydrangea Pink (the other shade released in the collection) once applied and blended out. I bought both to review, but I don’t think both are necessary if you intend to wear them sheered out–I do think the nuances will be better seen on cooler skin tones, though. Again, one of Burberry’s aims for their spring/summer collection was to introduce “radiant colour” into their range. Coral Pink is incredibly pigmented–if you are a fan of NARS’ richness in their blush range, you’ll appreciate the intensity found in the newest addition to Burberry’s blush range. I highly recommend using a light hand or a feathery brush for application. The texture of the powder is soft as silk, finely-milled, and applies smoothly and evenly (Burberry’s blushes are some of the softest, most velvety powders I’ve come across). It’s blendable once applied, and Coral Pink wore eight hours well but had some signs of fading after nine hours. 24 3 Coral Pink 24 3 Coral Pink A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Net-A-Porter Burberry (US) House of Fraser (UK) Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Escentual Sephora (PL) 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 96% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

['2012-08-27 00:00:00'],"['SEPHORA COLORVISION: Crimson Velvets Site News Aug 27, 2012 August 27, 2012 SEPHORA’S COLORVISION is about transforming a face, a mood, or even an attitude. They had a vision: “Color sets the tone, ignites the moment, defines a mood as quickly as it transforms a look. Open your eyes to our bold new way to see, feel, learn, wear and love color.” Sephora has taken inspiration from this season’s color stories to create and explore a deeper connection to color. It’s less about a single trend, but rather a state of being. Sephora wants YOU opening your eyes to color, YOU connecting with color, and YOU feeling total color confidence. With their vast expertise, Sephora has created three distinct color visions inspired by the hues and shades of fall. Today’s vision is all about CRIMSON VELVETS . Don’t be afraid to embrace a crimson lip–you can wear it as sheer or as opaque as you’d like! Diffused Lip If you’re not sure about how intense you want to go, Pro artist, Sara Biria, suggests going for a diffused lip. You can achieve this look by first prepping lips with a good lip balm, which will help with the sheer effect. Next, apply a touch of red lipstick to the center of the lip and blend with the balm. You can keep adding color to build up intensity and blending toward the edges of the lip to create an even color. As a final step to really make your pout standout, dab an illuminating concealer along the edges of your cupid’s bow with your fingertip. Sephora Recommends: Sephora Collection Color Lip Last in 19 Pure Red ($12), Tarte Glamazon Lipstick in Wild ($26) Finish the Look: Sephora Collection Colorful Duo Eyeshadow in 08 natural brown ($16), Sephora Collection Retractable Waterproof Eyeliner in 01 ($12), Tarte Amazonian Clay 12-Hour Blush in Exposed ($25) Painted Lip For a more modern, stained effect, look for red that will give an intense, matte finish. Start by prepping lips with a good lip balm, massaging until absorbed, and ensuring to blot away any excess moisture (which can take away from the finish and wear). With a lip liner just slightly darker than your lipstick color, line top and bottom lips. This helps to add dimension and enhance the red. Apply your lower lip with liquid lipstick and then press lips together to transfer color to the upper lip; then shape the cupid’s bow. To make sure the shape is perfect, tilt your head back and keep lips together to check for symmetry. Now, all you need to do is let lips dry for about thirty seconds or so and then pat with translucent powder to prolong wear (and make sure to dust off any excess powder with a brush). Sephora Recommends: Hourglass Opaque Rouge Liquid Lipstick in Icon ($28), Stila Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick in Beso ($22) Finish the Look: Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner in Black ($20), Stila Eye Shadow in Kitten ($18), Hourglass Aurora Cheek Stain in Petal ($45) Lacquered Lip For dramatic, highly pigmented red lips, opt for a lacquer finish. Start with clean, bare lips and then apply the liquid lipstick by gliding the flat edge of the wand from the center to the outer corners. Press lips together to transfer the color to the upper lip and using enough pressure to ensure the color transfers within lip lines. Next, shape the cupid’s bow by tracing the rounded side of the wand over the curves for an even shape. Once again, tilt your head back and keep lips together to check for evenness in shape. Set your high-impact lip with clear gloss and you’re ready to rock! Sephora Recommends: Bite Beauty Honey Lip Lacquer in Aurora ($24), Make Up For Ever Aqua Rouge in #9 ($24) Finish the Look: Make Up For Ever Aqua Eyes in 0L ($18), Urban Decay Eyeshadow in Naked ($18), NARS Blush in Douceur ($28) You can check out full how-tos and breakdowns of the looks from Crimson Velvet here .']",f01ab9951580034ad6d65322e8e8e6e698d31d16,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/sephora-color-vision-crimson-velvets/

The collection is slated to hit stores on October 27th. Fancy Moves is an eggplant purple with silver sparkle. It’s dry, stiff, and not well-pigmented. It’s closer to Urban Decay 1999 , though it is purpler, less burgundy. It’s closest to Make Up For Ever #4L , which doesn’t have shimmer. Going for Gold is a darkened, yellow-based gold with gold sparkle. It’s dry, stiff, and isn’t opaque in a single stroke. It’s a bit darker than Urban Decay Eldorado . Practice Makes Perfect is a medium-dark blue with a hint of teal. It’s not quite as teal as NARS Kaliste , but it is reminiscent of it. This shade was one of the best performing ones, as it didn’t apply unevenly when you went to build up the color, though it was still on the drier side. Seasonally Spicy is a warm, medium-dark chocoalte brown with subtle burgundy-brown shimmer. It’s a bit warmer than MAC Brownborder . This one had the creamiest texture, though it was still drier than other Technakohls. The color payoff was better, too. Silver Skates is a light silver with a metallic finish. It is, quite possibly, the most underperforming silver eyeliner I have ever come across. The pigmentation was poor, and the texture was stiff and dry, so it tugged at the lash line. Consider one of these silvers instead. Smooth Manoeuvre is a dark black with silver sparkle. I like that it can be built up without causing the color to become uneven, but it does need a few passes to be opaque. I couldn’t think of a dupe for this one (it appears I just have a metric ton of non-shimmery black eyeliner ). I like the Technakohl formula a lot; I used to use Graphblack exclusively, because it was a nice black, smooth, creamy, and wore well. I don’t know what happened with these. The soft, glide-on creaminess of the formula is completely missing from all six of these. MAC touts these not only as “soft and creamy,” but that you should expect “intense, rich colour deposit.” I’m majorly disappointed by these, because they’re nothing like the formula I know. The good news is at least they’re still long-wearing (eight hours no smudging, budging, or migrating). The texture is just such a miss here, and the lack of color payoff on some is just the kicker of it all. You want an eyeliner that glides across the lash line in a fluid, even motion that deposits even color (and opaque, preferably!) without tugging, pulling, dragging, or skipping. It’s like a scaredy-cat eyeliner, too skittish to move, so it jerks and skids when you force it to go from one side to the other.

The shades include: Trick (blank slate), Trollop (cranberry-infused coral), Harlot (ultimate fiery, cool-toned red), Stalker (truest red), Strutter (mahogany-toned classic red), and Strumpet (deep plum-toned red). Trick is a browned peach nude. This is definitely a shade that’s better worn with a more dramatic eye than alone–by itself, it is a little light. Trollop is a bright watermelon pink coral. It practically glows, because it’s almost neon–very, very bright! Harlot is a bright, blood red. This seems like an orange-based red to me, even though it’s described as a cool-toned shade. For an orange-based red, it’s certainly one of the least warm shades I’ve tried, though–but it still pulls orange on me. Stalker is a dark, blood red. It’s darker and more blue-based than Harlot. Strutter is a deep browned red. I like that it’s not ultra dark, so it doesn’t lose its red edge. It’s been quite awhile since I initially reviewed Lip Tars (actually, just over a year!), and it’s kind of exciting to see how much the line has grown. A year ago, there were only thirteen shades to review, and today, there are thirty-two shades available. One of areas of improvement I wanted to see was for a fuller range of colors–shades that were just as intensely pigmented but wearable right out of the tube, because not everybody wants to mix shades (or buy five or six shades so they can get their mixology on). Lip Tars are incredibly pigmented and you need very little to get full-color coverage–I’m totally serious: squeeze lightly! They’re pretty easy to apply just using the slanted squeeze-tube that they come out of, but if you want true precision, a lip brush will work wonders. If you use just the barest amount, they will dry down to a satin finish, but if you add a little more, it gives a slightly glossier look. These will wear four to five hours without trouble, and even nude shades like Trick stained a little (so darker shades most definitely stain)–even after a few minutes! They smell like peppermint (from the peppermint oil), but they are fragrance-free. They don’t really taste like much to me personally.

Product : 29/30 Value : 9/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 RECOMMENDATION: If you want opaque color that doesn’t feel heavy and wears well, Lip Tars are definitely that.

Phoenix is a medium bright pink. It’s not really cool-toned, but it’s not warm, either (although, I’ve rarely met a pink I’d really classify as warm, but I digress!). I’d call it neutral-cool if pressed. Easy to apply, opaque color in one quick layer, and stunning color that lasts for hours and through eating/drinking? I’m totally on board with that! Phoenix is just as amazing as the other shades, and it doesn’t disappoint in the least bit. It’s a great shade that’s noticeable, bright without being neon, and still wearable. If the lightness of Ming wasn’t your style, maybe the brightness of Phoenix is a better fit for you. It has a light glossy sheen with subtle pinkish/white shimmer.

Using the 239, apply Hey eyeshadow all over the eyelid. Next, apply Sorcery eyeshadow on the outer third of the eyelid and lightly blend with the outer crease. Lightly blend Prepped for Glamour eyeshadow , with the 239, on the outer corner and lid. Lightly tap and brush Hey eyeshadow directly above the crease to soften. To finish the eyeshadow look, sweep Heyeyeshadow as a highlighter on the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Almost Noir pearlglide liner on the lower lash line and finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara .

It’s not an ultra cool pink, though it does have cooler undertones. It is a semi-sheer lipstick that delivers some color but doesn’t totally block out the natural lip color. It wears well–about three to four hours–and feels incredibly smooth and creamy on lips without ever drying them out. Dolce & Gabbana lipsticks do have a particularly stronger rose scent, so those who prefer unscented lipsticks should probabyl pass on this one. Is this the right pink lipstick for you?

It has no shimmer but it does have a bit of a frosty sheen–not quite glossy. It’s intensely pigmented without having to pile on the layers, and it feels lightweight. The formula itself is creamy and moisturizing, but I find the color wears off considerably after two to three hours. (In all consideration, though I rate quality independent of price, $3.50 for a lipstick doesn’t make me feel guilty or worried about reapplying throughout the day!)

One of my favorite ways (and easiest!) is to pair whatever bright lip you want to wear with very neutral eyes. You will need the following… Eyes : MAC Soft Ochre Paint Pot (neutral beige base), MAC Hey Eyeshadow (peach champagne), MAC Sorcery Eyeshadow (matte burgundy), MAC Prepped for Glamour Eyeshadow (dark taupe brown), MAC Almost Noir Pearlglide Eyeliner (burgundy-black), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140) Cheeks : Chanel Terre d’or Soleil Tan de Chanel (bronzer) Lips : Make Up For Ever #203 Lipstick (bright pink), Illamasqua Frenzy Intense Lipgloss (bright pink) Brushes : 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : N/A For eyes, start by applying Soft Ochre paint pot as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Using the 239, apply Hey eyeshadow all over the eyelid. Next, apply Sorcery eyeshadow on the outer third of the eyelid and lightly blend with the outer crease. Lightly blend Prepped for Glamour eyeshadow , with the 239, on the outer corner and lid. Lightly tap and brush Hey eyeshadow directly above the crease to soften. To finish the eyeshadow look, sweep Heyeyeshadow as a highlighter on the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Almost Noir pearlglide liner on the lower lash line and finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Terre d’or to the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply #203 lipstick first, and then layer Frenzy lipgloss for a complementing lip. Check out more photos!

There is also Brunette (02). I actually thought these were new for this year, but after going back to the summer collection details , it’s the 4 Seasons bronzing powder that launched this year. Apparently, Guerlain launched two different types of bronzers, including the one pictured above–that are limited edition and new and different from the permanent versions. Anyway, Blonde contains five different shades that come together to create a red-toned bronze. It’s designed for our fairer, blonde-haired friends, but it’ll work just as nice on our warmer, brunette-haired friends, too–because I am the latter and find this lovely on my skin. I tend to wear it more as a bronzer, but it’s subtle without being orange and the shimmer gives you a little glowiness that’s perfect for summer. I wore it in a very natural look , and I felt like it worked incredibly well to give my cheeks a little definition, glow, and that I-just-got-back-from-vacation look (even though I went nowhere!). It’s a very fine-milled powder, so it’s subtle and easy to use without going overboard–but you can layer it for a greater intensity. It also has fine shimmer that goes through the compact (no overspray here!) that gives skin a healthier, more luminous look without looking like a glitter ball. A huge bonus is that this bronzer photographs really well and natural, too! I may have to check out the Brunette version to see how it stacks up, but Blonde totally wow-ed me (and I’m not even a bronzer person!). The pricing is just about what I’d expect from Guerlain, but at least they don’t hold back on the quantity–they give you just a little more than the average bronzer, but it’s not significantly more. Nevertheless, sometimes you’ll see higher prices and lesser quantities, so I always like to see the two still in line. The packaging is also very pretty–it’s a glossy reddish-bronze with a shimmering sparkle almost! If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 28/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : If you’ve been searching for a light, natural bronzer that’s good on both fairer, cooler skin (aka one that doesn’t turn orange), Guerlain’s Blonde may be the answer! It’s soft and silky with the perfect bronzing color for those with pinker or redder undertones, but it works equally well on those with warmer, yellower undertones–you’ll see the slightly reddish tinge in it, but it works!

NARS describes it as a “soft peach,” and I’d completely agree with that assessment. Enchanted is a sheer, soft peach with soft golden shimmer and a slight sheen. I’d like to put an emphasis on sheer, though, because I could not get it to show up on my cheeks, being around medium in skin tone (I’d say I’m on the lighter side of medium, but I’m certainly not fair). I did try to build up the color on my cheeks, but it just wasn’t working for me. On my skin tone, it ended up being more like a barely-there highlighter, unfortunately! I can see this being really lovely and soft on fairer skin tones, and I think it would work well on both cool and warm skin tones. Cool skin tones will find this works as a soft peach that doesn’t turn orange, while warmer skin tones are easily complemented by peachy colors. The formula itself is soft, creamy enough to melt into skin but not so creamy that it slips around. It dries down quickly and blends easily onto skin. I find that NARS Cream Blushes last me three to four hours before fading a bit. I like using them as bases and using a setting powder or powder blush on top to set and prolong wear to about six to eight hours.

Product : 25/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : If you’re looking for a way to prolong the wear of your blushes, you may find these cream blushes work well alone or as a base for your powder blushes.

I bought these at my local Chanel counter (in Nordstrom) today, so if your Chanel counter hasn’t gotten stock in yet, I imagine it should be soon–I had done a pre-sale on these, so my favorite Chanel artist gave me a call when these were in (funny enough, her name is also Christine!). She said they only got fifteen Nouvelle Vagues in! Unfortunate for my pocketbook, along with my Chanel items, I also bought just as much in headbands… including one that matches Nouvelle Vague !! I couldn’t resist! Anyway… Mistral is a baby petal pink with champagne micro-glitter It goes opaque in three coats and looks kind of squishy on. I had no issues applying this shade–standard fair for Chanel in my experience. Riviera is a darkened bright pink cream. It’s opaque in two coats, though I swatched it with three. It was easy to apply and looked flawless on. Neither Mistral nor Riviera is as eye-catching (or unique) as Nouvelle Vague , which I fully expect to sell out and see on eBay for triple digits at some point. I don’t have previous nail shades memorized, but I’m sure you could dupe Mistral or Riviera without too much trouble–hopefully our lovely nail fanatics can chime in with their dupe recommendations! That’s not to say that these aren’t fun, feminine shades, because they are, but typically when I shell out $23 for a Chanel polish, I do so for the uniqueness of the shade! By the by, I actually asked both my parents (who are so not beauty mavens!) if they could tell the difference between the $3 and $23 polishes ( China Glaze For Audrey vs. Chanel Nouvelle Vague ), and they both immediately pointed out the Chanel-shaded fingers as the $23 one.

Just kind of looks like an all-black smoky eye to me! Review to follow shortly. This was a really quick look really just done to test out just how much color would show through when used in practice. I added all that glitter to give this look more va-voom… it was just rather one-note beforehand. I will say that Distortion over Deviant is stunning–more so in person as the glitter flashes. You will need the following… Eyes : Urban Decay Eden Primer Potion (matte beige base), Urban Decay Cobra Eyeshadow (black with antique gold), Urban Decay Libertine Eyeshadow (black with green), Urban Decay Black Dog Eyeshadow (matte black), Burberry Trench Eyeshadow (highlighter), Urban Decay Deviant 24/7 Liner (medium blue), Urban Decay Distortion Glitter Liner (iridescent), Chanel Inimitable Intense Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder (translucent) Cheeks : MAC Desert Rose Blush (muted pink) Lips : MAC Liquid Lurex Lipstick (iridescent antique gold glitter), MAC Pink Poodle Lipglass (bright pink) Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Liquid Lurex = Tanarama For eyes, start by applying Eden as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Using the 239, apply Cobra eyeshadow on the lower half of the lid and pat on horizontally. Lightly blend Libertine eyeshadow on upper half of the lid, patting lightly, all the way across with the 239. Next, apply Black Dog eyeshadow into the crease with the 226, lightly blending onto the outer lid. Blend Trench eyeshadow with the crease shade and highlight the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Deviant liner on the lower lash line, then lightly pat on Distortion glitter liner on top. Finish by sweeping lashes with Inimitable Intense mascara , and then use Distortion glitter liner brushed onto lashes. For cheeks, apply Desert Rose blush on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Liquid Lurex lipstick first, and then layer Pink Poodle lipglass for a complementing lip.

The color itself is nearly opaque (my lip freckle is almost covered but it still peeked through). I love that this is a pink that’s not too cool for warmer skin tones to wear with ease–it has just a touch of blue such that it is a cooler shade if I were to classify it. The formula itself is comfortable to wear; it’s lightweight, non-sticky, and keeps lips moisturized. It does seem to de-emphasize lip lines and the color, despite the pigmentation, did not settle into my lip lines much at all. It does have a high-shine finish, so there is no mistaking it for a lipstick, as it is most definitely a gloss! I get between three and four hours of wear with it, and it doesn’t completely disappear after having a cup of coffee either–which is nice! Essence de Gloss is housed in a “gold” rectangular case with a thin cut out where the color of the gloss shows through (it really is the gloss that shows through–it is absolutely clear until you pull the wand out once!).

I kept thinking it was a dinky little collection, but it’s a full collection. It includes two sheertone blushes and one mineralize blush duo. Blush ($18.50 U.S. / $22.00 CDN) Garb is a darkened nude with an orange undertone. It has a near matte finish, though there is a subtle shimmer in it that’s really not very noticeable. Though it’s only a bit on the warmer side, the obvious orange tone may not work well with the fairest of the fair. Instant Chic is a slightly coraled pink with a powdery look. It’s sheerer than Garb, and I found it more difficult to build up the intensity, though. I like the shade, because it’s not quite like anything in MAC’s permanent line, and I don’t know if I’ve seen something like this in recent collections either. I do wish it was a bit more pigmented–I fear it may be a wash on those with deeper skin tones (think NC/NW45 or darker). Mineralize Blush ($23.00 U.S. / $27.50 CDN) Light Over Dark is a duo of golden copper and a darkened, reddish copper-bronze. Both shades have a very frosty finish to them. The size of the compact is large enough to be able to use the shades separately or together, I’d imagine. I’m personally not a fan of this, because it does have a rather frosty finish, which turns out pretty gnarly in photographs! Instant Chic is the most unique of the three blushes, despite not having the best color pay off (it is a sheertone, though). It’s coral enough to be perfect for summer and add some brightness to cheeks, but it’s not so warm that only warmer skin tones will like it. I do think it’s a better shade for light to medium skin tones, and if you’re of a deeper skin tone, you may want to swatch it in person first. Any of these catch your eye? See photos & swatches!

['2010-09-13 00:00:00'],"['Urban Decay Black Palette Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links Reviews Sep 13, 2010 September 13, 2010 Urban Decay Black Palette Getting Heavy with Urban Decay Urban Decay The Black Palette ($36.00 for 0.24 oz.) contains six eyeshadows (0.04 oz. each), along with a miniature-sized Zero 24/7 Eye Pencil (0.03 oz.) and Eden Primer Potion (0.13 fl. oz.). As far as I know, this palette is limited edition and a Sephora exclusive (and Sephora lists it as “online only”). Black Dog is an intense, deep dark black with a matte finish. It’s about as intense and deep as Sugarpill Bulletproof , but it’s not quite as smooth or as blendable. It is not at all unworkable, though. I just point this out because it seemed like Black Dog was one of the shadows readers were most looking forward to, and Bulletproof is an alternative to buying the entire palette. Barracuda is a darkened gray with silver flecks; it is a very steely, cool-toned gray. I thought it was similar to Urban Decay’s Gunmetal , but it seems a little darker and less frosty. Jet is a cool-toned plummy purple with very subtle red undertones. It has a semi-matte color base with flecks of blue glitter. Sabbath is a darkened, smoky noir blue with flecks of blue glitter. Cobra is a muddied blackened base with flecks of antique-gold and green-gold shimmer/glitter. Libertine is a blackened green color base with flecks of gold and emerald green micro-glitter. The Black Palette is housed in a sleek, slim rectangular palette with a mirror on the inside cover; it’s made out of cardboard/paper as Urban Decay palettes often are, but it’s very compact. The miniature Zero eyeliner is stowed away inside along the eyeshadows, while the miniature Eden primer potion is loose (which does ensure that this palette is thin). It’s definitely a more travel-friendly palette than the Book of Shadows . Quality-wise, these eyeshadows feel like most of Urban Decay’s regular eyeshadow line (not to be confused with their deluxe eyeshadow line, which has a slightly differing texture); they’re pretty smooth and pigmented. These do feel a touch more powdery and kick up some eyeshadow if you’re not careful, so I do recommend tapping your brush against your wrist to get any excess shadow out–that way it doesn’t just poof and land on your under eye instead! I don’t think they’re the best of the brand’s eyeshadows, but they’re solid overall. I find this palette too redundant to be a must-have for most makeup mavens. When applied to eyes as part of look, they really don’t standout; they all look black with a touch of varying glitter (but it is so subtle, it’s hard to notice until you look for it specifically). I did a quick look using Cobra , Libertine , and Black Dog , and if I saw that, I’d say I used two eyeshadows (a shimmery black, nude highlighter); the difference is nearly imperceptible. You can really get the same effect by using a black eyeshadow/base and layering a shimmery color shade on top– in fact, a ton of people do this with MAC Blacktrack as a base and you can get some really cool effects (try using a duochrome shade on top!). You might even find that the color pops even more. These are just too black, too flat. The inclusion of Eden with this palette is interesting, because it makes these eyeshadows look flatter and even more similar to each other than other bases. I did some experimenting using Eden , a shimmery white gold base, and colored bases; these eyeshadows look best over colored bases–you can get that blackened look without losing the color entirely. I feel like I do get the concept of blackened, smoldering colors that don’t scream color but at the same time, I want some differentiation between one shade from the next. I don’t want to squint my eyes to detect slight differences in the flecks of glitter. I also think the inclusion of Gunmetal or Dime 24/7 Liner (instead of Zero ) would have helped these shades pop. I recommend experimenting with cream eyeshadow in black and layering shimmery colors on top to see what look you prefer!

The color itself is nearly opaque (my lip freckle is almost covered but it still peeked through). I love that this is a pink that’s not too cool for warmer skin tones to wear with ease–it has just a touch of blue such that it is a cooler shade if I were to classify it. The formula itself is comfortable to wear; it’s lightweight, non-sticky, and keeps lips moisturized. It does seem to de-emphasize lip lines and the color, despite the pigmentation, did not settle into my lip lines much at all. It does have a high-shine finish, so there is no mistaking it for a lipstick, as it is most definitely a gloss! I get between three and four hours of wear with it, and it doesn’t completely disappear after having a cup of coffee either–which is nice! Essence de Gloss is housed in a “gold” rectangular case with a thin cut out where the color of the gloss shows through (it really is the gloss that shows through–it is absolutely clear until you pull the wand out once!).

I kept thinking it was a dinky little collection, but it’s a full collection. It includes two sheertone blushes and one mineralize blush duo. Blush ($18.50 U.S. / $22.00 CDN) Garb is a darkened nude with an orange undertone. It has a near matte finish, though there is a subtle shimmer in it that’s really not very noticeable. Though it’s only a bit on the warmer side, the obvious orange tone may not work well with the fairest of the fair. Instant Chic is a slightly coraled pink with a powdery look. It’s sheerer than Garb, and I found it more difficult to build up the intensity, though. I like the shade, because it’s not quite like anything in MAC’s permanent line, and I don’t know if I’ve seen something like this in recent collections either. I do wish it was a bit more pigmented–I fear it may be a wash on those with deeper skin tones (think NC/NW45 or darker). Mineralize Blush ($23.00 U.S. / $27.50 CDN) Light Over Dark is a duo of golden copper and a darkened, reddish copper-bronze. Both shades have a very frosty finish to them. The size of the compact is large enough to be able to use the shades separately or together, I’d imagine. I’m personally not a fan of this, because it does have a rather frosty finish, which turns out pretty gnarly in photographs! Instant Chic is the most unique of the three blushes, despite not having the best color pay off (it is a sheertone, though). It’s coral enough to be perfect for summer and add some brightness to cheeks, but it’s not so warm that only warmer skin tones will like it. I do think it’s a better shade for light to medium skin tones, and if you’re of a deeper skin tone, you may want to swatch it in person first. Any of these catch your eye? See photos & swatches!

Vivid colors, from mandarin yellow to cotton candy pink, punctuated the collection, and exposed zippers, gentle draping and tucked and pleated details on parachute silk, jersey and lamé lent the collection that signature Victoria Beckham style. Makeup The makeup, by Charlotte Tilbury, was equally vivid. She and Victoria drew inspiration from Andy Warhol’s colorful portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor. For eyes, this meant a block of purple shadow up to the brows. Charlotte layered two purple Color Design Eye Shadows—Trendy and Drama—to get the desired finish. She lined the entire upper lashline with Artliner in Noir, complete with a “flick” at each end, and lined the lower lashline with black pencil. Hypnôse Custom Volume Mascara on the top and bottom lashes finished the eyes. Brows were left natural. For lips, Charlotte used L’Absolu Rouge Lipstick in Rich Cashmere for the gingery pink color she wanted, and topped that with a thick layer of Juicy Tubes in Pure, a clear gloss, for a dramatically lacquered look. The skin was super dewy, achieved with just foundation and highlighter. Charlotte swept the new Teint Miracle foundation over the entire face. Éclat Miracle Serum (a new liquid highlighter) was dabbed along the cheekbone and up the temple in a backwards C-shape. She didn’t use any blush or powder. The opaque bubble gum pink nails were done by Nonie Creme for Butter London. The hair, by Didier Malige for Fekkai, was long and stick straight, with an unexpected crimp across the back. Hair Didier Malige, lead stylist for Frédéric Fekkai, was inspired by hairstyles of the 60’s—without the tease—for the Spring 2011 Victoria Beckham show. To create the look, Malige first prepped dry hair with Fekkai Advanced Full Volume Styling Whip to give hair slick volume. Then, Malige created a middle part and tucked the hair straight behind the ears and spritzed with Fekkai Sheer Hold Spray to make the hair more straight and heavy. He finished the look by using a waiving tool to make an unexpected single crimp across the back of the hair. The result was a modern take on a mod era. See more photos!

When you open the compact, there’s a mirror with the phrase, “where there is grace, there is beauty,” which is a nice touch.

It’s a fine-milled, very smooth powder that can easily be used to highlight specific areas or dusted lightly for an all-over glow.

There’s a definite sheen rather than obvious shimmer or glitter that does the highlighting as well, which is always nice in a highlighter. Amazing Grace isn’t a new, innovative highlighter, but it’s a solid one if you’re looking for something soft, subtle, and with no real color.

I used bright, bold shades on eyes and cheeks and lots of flirty lashes to complement the femininity, humor, and sex appeal of Zac’s designs,” said Maybelline New York Global Makeup Artist Charlotte Willier. The Look Charlotte used Volum’Express the Flasies Mascara to create high drama, flirty lashes. Charlotte applied Eye Studio Color Plush Silk Eyeshadow in Give Me Gold, Copper Chic, and Sapphire Siren Palettes to achieve maximum eye impact. Sapphire Siren was applied all over the lid and extended to brow bone for one look; Give Me Gold and Copper Chic created a more muted color statement but extended outward in a dramatic cat eye effect. Bold bright color adorned lips with fully saturated coverage in shades of Verry Cherry, Park Avenue Pink, and Backstage #4 (created specifically for Fasion Week). Dream Liquid Mousse Foundationw as applied all over the face for a luminous base. Hair Whether you want to rock the Deconstructed Bun, Playful Pony, or French Twist, start with these curling instructions, then follow the specific steps for the hairstyle you want to achieve. Curling Instructions Using a ¼ inch curling iron, stylists curled the model’s entire head, being sure to curl the sections in opposite directions. Sims says that this curling technique “allows ringlets to look and feel more organic.” Stylists sprayed the curled strands with got2b 2sexy hairspray for hold and shine. Deconstructed Bun Sims explains that this look is meant to look a bit messy. After curling the hair, he recommends brushing the hair out “almost until it’s frizzy,” then pulling in into a bun on the very top of the head, leaving a few loose tundrils along the hairline. Be sure to set the style with got2b 2sexy hairspray. Playful Pony These bouncy up-dos complemented the flirty mini dresses in the Spring 2011 collection. After the whole head is curled, Sims says to brush the hair back into a pony, smoothing strands with got2b’s cashmere-infused smooth operator hairspray. Just like the deconstructed bun, a few loose tundrils should be left around the hairline. If you want to give your pony a little extra bounce, Sims recommends spraying the curled pony with got2b’s collagen-infused fat-tastic root-boosting spray. French Twist (with a twist!) We’ve never seen French Twists like this before! This hot rocker-chic look featured a French roll in the back, accented with a curly quaff on the forehead. Sims suggests you “curl the front of your hair into small sections and then pull the rest back, twist and secure with a few pins so it still looks undone.” The front curls should be held in place with got2b 2sexy hairspray, while the twist should be held with got2b smooth operator hairspray to achieve the soft, polished look.

Be sure to set the style with got2b 2sexy hairspray . Playful Pony These bouncy up-dos complemented the flirty mini dresses in the Spring 2011 collection. After the whole head is curled, Sims says to brush the hair back into a pony, smoothing strands with got2b’s cashmere-infused smooth operator hairspray . Just like the deconstructed bun, a few loose tundrils should be left around the hairline. If you want to give your pony a little extra bounce , Sims recommends spraying the curled pony with got2b’s collagen-infused fat-tastic root-boosting spray . French Twist (with a twist!) We’ve never seen French Twists like this before! This hot rocker-chic look featured a French roll in the back, accented with a curly quaff on the forehead. Sims suggests you “curl the front of your hair into small sections and then pull the rest back, twist and secure with a few pins so it still looks undone.” The front curls should be held in place with got2b 2sexy hairspray , while the twist should be held with got2b smooth operator hairspray to achieve the soft, polished look.']",73fe214a2b0dcbaa3b2882e7fe8a8e4c4a44cbba,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/maybelline-z-spoke-by-zac-posen-ss-2011/

Even though it seems reminiscent of such cult favorites as NARS Orgasm and MAC Springsheen, the way the gold sheen reflects light makes it stand out. It’s so wearable you could wear it as an everyday blush, but it can be worn subtly or intensely, depending on the look you’re going for. It blends beautifully with skin because of the soft, smooth texture of the powder. I always forget how gorgeous this shade is until I pull it out.

Its packaged in a mirror-finish compact and inside is a light pink powder with the word “grace” embedded in the center. When you open the compact, there’s a mirror with the phrase, “where there is grace, there is beauty,” which is a nice touch. I just like the uplifting spirit of the Philosophy brand, and I think this is a nice reminder to have in a compact, too. It’s a fine-milled, very smooth powder that can easily be used to highlight specific areas or dusted lightly for an all-over glow. It does not impart much color, if any–it’s almost the faintest pink-tinged white. There’s a definite sheen rather than obvious shimmer or glitter that does the highlighting as well, which is always nice in a highlighter. Amazing Grace isn’t a new, innovative highlighter, but it’s a solid one if you’re looking for something soft, subtle, and with no real color. I’d say the slight pinkness of the product does give a healthy glow to the face without actually making it a light blusher, so it works for a highlighter.

It can be used on eyes, lips, and cheeks. It’s a warm bronze-brown with golden shimmer-sheen. The color is buildable, so the level of opacity you want depends on how much product you apply or how much you blend it out. It’s less warm-toned compared to theBalm Betty Lou-Manizer . It’s less red-toned compared to MAC Gilty . As with most Multiples, Laguna works best as cheeks/face, because it’s very drying on the lips. It just has this uncomfortably dry feeling when applied to lips that continues and leaves lips parched after an hour or two of wear (it doesn’t even wear well or long!). On the brow bone, it’s more practical, but on the lid itself, I wasn’t able to get it to stay longer than a few hours before there was noticeable creasing. Applied to cheeks, Laguna wore for four and a half hours. By five hours, it looked a bit faded and patchy. The texture of Laguna is creamy but there’s a dryness to it, which I found difficult to blend over foundation. It’s easier to apply and blend over bare skin, but I’m not blessed with beautiful skin so it’s not a product I could use without foundation. You can layer foundation over it, but it makes the routine slightly more complicated and precision will count, so you don’t layer so much that you cover up the bronzer! I wish I liked Multiples better, but I don’t find they’re nearly as multi-talented as they claim to be! I’m always a bit disappointed in the wear (four to five hours isn’t good!). I get better wear out of NARS’ powder blushes! Laguna may not work for all skin tones; I found it looked a little dirty on me–you might need to have some natural redness or pinkness in your undertones so it brings out the golden hues of the color.

It contanis five shades: a yellowed medium brown, coppered bronze, glittering platinum, dark brown, and deeper brown. The first color (upper left corner) is a medium brown with yellowy tan and a soft gold sheen. The color payoff was excellent, and it had such a nice softness to it, which resulted in a really smooth application of color. NARS Paramaribo is darker. theBalm Schitoz is similar, a smidgen lighter. Wet ‘n’ Wild Comfort Zone is close, slightly less yellow-toned. MAC Wedge is darker, no yellow. MAC Soba is close–a smidgen less yellow in the base color. MAC Double Feature 4 is pretty close but slightly darker–it shares the yellowness, though. Next, we have a warm-toned, coppery bronze with a soft frosted finish. It has nice pigmentation with opaque results and a smooth, soft feel and application. This kind of color, though, is incredibly common, even if this particular shade is more subdued than a lot of other coppery hues. Urban Decay Snakebite is a little darker. Bare Escentuals Cognac is less copper. Urban Decay Baked is very comparable. MAC Bronze is a bit darker. Inglot #405 is more metallic. The center shade is a metallic platinum with a silvery-gold shimmer and glitter. It’s very reflective, and it’s sheer. Truth be told, it feels and acts like a layering shade. It has a sheerness that seems like it was deliberate so you could use it over the other shades in the palette, but I can’t confirm this, as it’s not part of the description of this palette or of Dior’s 5-Couleur palettes in general. When I wore it, I tested it over another shade in the palette, and surprisingly, there was very little fallout after application. MAC Manila Paper is similar but has no silver. Make Up For Ever #101 is very similar but more opaque. Dior Couture Gold has a shade nearly like it in the center as well. In the bottom right corner, there is a medium-dark olive-tonted brown with an almost cool undertone (but there is definite warmth). The color payoff is fairly good, and the texture was soft and applied smoothly. Giorgio Armani #24 is darker. Urban Decay Cobra is darker and more matte. Urban Decay Deeper is comparable. The fnial shade is a dark brown with a subtle gray tinge that makes it look like a neutral-toned brown. It has a soft sheen. This shade was slightly drier than the others, but the color payoff was still good, and it did apply evenly. Inglot #409 is more metallic. Urban Decay MIA is a bit darker. Tarina Tarantino Dreamy is very similar. What I didn’t love about this palette was the same thing as Guerlain Les Fauves : the colors are too alike. If you have a good-sized stash and are applying makeup at home, it’s not a big deal, but if you only want to take this palette and maybe one other for traveling, then it’s a little less ideal. This palette has a lot of brown, but they’re on the darker end of the spectrum–a beige or light-medium olive green could have worked exceptionally well in this palette. Aside from the sheerness of the center shade, the palette was high quality from the pigmentation to the texture to the wear. I had no fading or creasing (and very, very little glitter fall out from the center shade) over a twelve-hour period.

According to Urban Decay, these have a silky texture that has “40% more glitter than our most sparkly shadows,” and that this formula “delivers a sheer wash of color, topped with … sparkle that glistens like wet now.” The glitter ingredient is called “reflex” and these boast no fall out or chunky glitter. They can be used wet or dry, depending on what kind of color you want to achieve. Each Stardust eyeshadow retails for $20.00 for 0.12 oz. For reference, Deluxe Eyeshadows retail for $18.00 for 0.09 oz. and Deluxe Eyeshadows retail for $16.00 for 0.05 oz. Stardust Eyeshadows Space Cowboy is a champagne beige with golden sheen and sparkle. It goes on barely there when used dry, but it has a more opaque look when used wet. Bobby Dazzle is a shimmery white (just slightly tinged by gold) with white and silver sparkle. This shade is best used dry unless layering over a more intense color, because it is incredibly sheer dry, though more obvious when used wet. Griffith is a soft, yellow-toned green with paler green sheen and sparkle. You can get some green to show when you use this dry, but it’s better when used wet or over a base. Diamond Dog is a dirty brown with a little gray and silverish sparkle. This brown kind of felt like one of those “ugly” browns to me for some reason. Somewhat pigmented when used wet but still nicer when used wet. 54 is an icy purple with silver-white sparkle. It’s pretty pale and cool-toned and like the other shades, best used wet. Retrograde is a darkened purple with red undertones and silver sparkle. I expected richer color, but I couldn’t achieve the deepness I wanted even when used wet. It just looks so dark in the pot, but it’s not nearly so dark in real life. Atmosphere is a bright teal-blue with silver sparkle. Atmosphere is easily the best shade of the nine — if you only wanted one, this is the one I’d recommend. It’s richly pigmented, even when used dry, and moreso when used wet. Moon Spoon is a gray taupe with cool silver sparkle. So so when used dry, smoother when used wet. Void is a gray-black with silver sparkle. It reminded me of Oil Slick, just with more glitter. I found this one didn’t seem to look much different when used wet–about the same as when swatched dry. The packaging is a matte, slightly squish plastic (think NARS) shaped into a square. You squeeze the sides and it releases the plastic flip-top back. I’m not drooling over the packaging, but it’s functional. It’s particularly streamlined and “clean” for Urban Decay, actually. The glitter in the Stardust eyeshadows is definitely not the typical chunky glitter a la Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, but I did encounter a decent amount of fall out when I used Atmosphere in this look earlier this week . It wasn’t the worst fall out I’ve encountered, but I did get enough to be able to say that these definitely are prone to fall out for me. I used it over Urban Decay’s Primer Potion and wet, for reference, and still had the fall out. I’d say the fall out is a little less than their typical glitter eyeshadows, certainly much less so than Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, as well. If you don’t mind a little clena-up, then these might be fun to play around with. These are probably better over dark bases or else layered on top of more pigmented or vibrant shades of eyeshadow. I could definitely see these working well over a black base for a very smoky, glittering eye. Even though layering seems to the best way to use these, they weren’t quite as blendable as Urban Decay’s powder eyeshadows. When used wet, they have a bit of a tendency to “stick” in places, so you may find yourself using a similar-colored powder eyeshadow to help blend out the Stardust eyeshadow. Bottom Line: I have never been a fan of eyeshadows that produce a lot of fall out. I don’t want to have to spend extra time cleaning up after application; I don’t mind a little bit–the kind that can be covered up with foundation, just not a lot. These have enough fall out that I don’t love them, and I think the colors themselves aren’t as vibrant as I’d like to see from Urban Decay, so they’re not to my taste. Atmosphere was the only one that really popped to me. It’s like they’re okay – Urban Decay states they’re sheer, but they also say “no fall out” which I found not to be the case in my experience. I found myself preferring Stila’s Jewel Eyeshadow Palette for my dose of glitter, because I found the color went on a bit more pigmented when used dry, but I also didn’t encounter very much fall out when I used them either. Of course, the shades aren’t similar, so you may go one way or the other based on what kind of color you want. I will say that if you use a sponge-tip applicator or your finger to press on the glitter, there is a lot less fall out, though. Additionally, for a glittery-based eyeshadow, the fall out was much less than I’ve experienced in the past, on the whole. Have you tried these yet? What has your experience been like?

When I saw the promotional images for the palette, I was definitely curious — who doesn’t love some glitter? (OK, I know a few of you don’t, but shh!) I find myself at a loss as to how exactly to describe the texture and feel of these eyeshadows. They feel almost wet, but not really creamy and certainly not powdery. They apply fairly sheerly when used, though they can be layered for a slightly more intense look. Since it has a bit of a creamy feel (but it’s sooo not a cream shadow!), I patted the Golden Topaz shade all over my lid, just to see what kind of fall out we were looking for. I wasn’t even concerned about staying power, because it wasn’t over a base, so I expected it to crease. Well, it didn’t. It didn’t crease after just having patted it on my lid for over an hour. There was also very, very minimal fall out (like I saw three or four sparkles). Typically, I find myself having to strategically apply foundation over glittery bits and doing all sorts of tricks to make sure my undereye area isn’t more sparkly than my eyelid. Golden Topaz is a soft peachy-brown with champagne shimmer/glitter. Amethyst is a medium dark purple with red undertones and soft golden glitter. Black Diamond is black with silver glitter. Rose Quartz is a light-medium rosy pink with silver glitter. I was pleasantly surprised at Stila’s newest palette for the spring season. I just wasn’t expecting it to knock my socks off, and I admit I was totally expecting the glitter to fall everywhere. But you know what’s REALLY awesome about this? It looked like my lids were wet. The color really does look like shimmering water. Gorgeous!

There are three shades: Billionaire Bronze (warm golden tan), Gilty Bronze (coppery bronze with gold shimmer), and Tan Tint (soft suntan bronze). Billionaire Bronze is a medium-dark tan with warm, golden undertones. It has a soft natural sheen but no shimmer. It doesn’t have the shimmer that Beach Bronze cream bronzer from To the Beach (’10) has, but it is similar in the color. I’m not sure if NARS has something comparable; possibly Malaysia. Gilty Bronze is a darkened, coppery bronze with a strong frosted finish. It seems most comparable to NARS Palm Beach. Tan Tint is a soft, slightly warmed over tan with a near matte finish. It is less golden than Billionaire Bronze. It’s less red-based and doesn’t have shimmer, but it resembles Weekend cream bronzer from To the Beach (’10). This seems similar to NARS Cap Vert. These are really pigmented–don’t just swipe the whole stick across your face. I did so to swatch, and it was like, “WHOA! there!” You’ll want to pat the stick against the skin to deposit color, and then blend it out. These are easy to blend, but they dry down quick enough that I recommend doing one area at a time. It’s been about eight hours since I’ve applied Billionaire Bronze, and it’s still going strong. Despite being really pigmented, they feel very lightweight and look natural overall (though Gilty Bronze doesn’t look natural, with the heavier frosted finish). NARS’ The Multiples feel very much like these, and MAC’s variation is about the same size (0.49 oz. compared to NARS at 0.50 oz.). There was something off about the way MAC did the packaging, though–something about it feels a little cheap. They just didn’t feel as sturdy or as robust as other packaging types in MAC’s line-up, though realistically, I don’t see these breaking or coming apart either.

Betty Lou-Manizer is a dirty bronze with a warm, golden shimmer-sheen. The shimmer is incredibly fine, while the sheen is glowy and reflective. If you’ve tried out theBalm’s other powder products, you’ll find the texture is consistent–silky smooth with rich color payoff. It has such a fine texture that it applies well to skin, because it practically melts onto the skin and looks natural and never powdery. It’s packaged well, too. The compact is a nice size with a mirror on the inside, and the compact itself is sturdy and fits well in the hand. The ingredients are also listed on the back of the compact, which is a nice touch, because I know that I don’t keep the boxes around for long (straight to the recycling bin!). I actually found the effect to be quite comparable to Guerlain’s Terracotta Mosaic Powder . theBalm’s has a more noticeable shimmer/brighter sheen, while Guerlain’s is a little softer, more orange with less brown, but on the cheeks, the differences are minimized. 45 4 Betty-Lou Manizer 45 4 Betty-Lou Manizer A+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Amazon DermStore Kohl's LookFantastic Sephora (Australia) FeelUnique ASOS theBalm 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 99% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Bobbi Brown Naked Plum is pinker, plummier. NARS Oasis is darker, more plum. MAC Spice is like a browner, creamy, opaque variation. MAC Over Indulgence is less pink. As a new and limited edition shade for fall, it’s a very easy shade to wear. There’s just enough color to change-up your natural lip color (unless you have really pigmented lips, then I think this might lighten a wee bit but will most likely get lost) with noticeable yet not overwhelming shimmer. It’s wearable and everyday in its overall hue. This might translate as boring to some and dupeable to others, but it’s a shade I could see someone using and finishing, especially if they’re looking for work-friendly lip color. Rouge Allure Extrait de Gloss is designed as a non-sticky, long-wearing, comfortable to wear, and shiny formula with “bold color. The gloss has a faint floral scent but no taste, and it come in a black lacquered square-tube with a tapered doe-foot applicator. It has a gel-like texture that’s neither thin nor thick, which easily slides around the lips but doesn’t bunch up on itself. Though relatively non-sticky, it gets a little tacky after the first half hour or so (but not enough that I’d describe it as sticky). Troublant manages to wear for four hours, which is about average for me, though certainly short of what I’d describe as long-wearing. The color coverage is only semi-opaque, so it’s not exactly bold color. I like the formula as it stands, and the only area it needs improvement is wear: it’s just not long-wearing, but it does wear well, evenly, and comes in at four-hour wear, which is more typical of most glosses (that aren’t designated as long-wearing). If the wear isn’t a deal-breaker, then the texture might sway you. 6 3 Troublant 6 3 Troublant B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Chanel Dillard's 9 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 10 Texture 7.5 Longevity 5 Application 89% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Full of Grace is a sheer watermelon pink. Lilt of Lily is a sheer, milky pink-lilac shimmered with iridescent pink. Pink Tinge is a sheer, yellow-based pink with gold shimmer. These are lip balms, and they’re designed to be sheer–this is exactly what they are: tinted lip balm. If you have naturally pigmented lips, these will add mostly gloss for you. Those with paler natural lips may find that Full of Grace deposits some color. Lilt of Lily has the least amount of color, while Pink Tinge has the most shimmer. Earlier today, I was actually lamenting doing lip swatches for these, because they’re so similar when worn, and ironically, I didn’t do lip swatches when these first launched (back in 2009 with Baby Blooms) for the same reason! We’re on that border again; it’s expected to be sheer, but at what point is sheer too close to clear and therefore unpigmented? Full of Grace enhances my natural lip color by making it pinker and rosier, so it seems near our target. Lilt of Lily does a little but to a lesser extent. Pink Tinge adds shimmer and makes my lips look a little lighter than normal, and the sheerness is closer to Lilt of Lily but there is a little more here. It seems like pigmentation is where it should be for Full of Grace (like 9/10), while Lilt of Lily is lacking (5/10), and Pink Tinge falls somewhere between there (7/10), which averages out to around 7. Suntints have a thicker, jelly-ish consistency and feel a little like gel lips. They’re sticky (less so than Lipglass), and they have a light vanilla scent to them. I get only two to three hours of wear with these as a lip balm, but they are somewhat moisturizing. They seem to do a good job of locking in moisture, but I don’t feel like they add much to lips, because once it’s gone, so are most of the moisturizing benefits. The Suntints come in squeeze-tube packaging, and each tube holds a surprising amount of product (0.33 oz.).

Full of Grace is a sheer watermelon pink. Lilt of Lily is a sheer, milky pink-lilac shimmered with iridescent pink. Pink Tinge is a sheer, yellow-based pink with gold shimmer. These are lip balms, and they’re designed to be sheer–this is exactly what they are: tinted lip balm. If you have naturally pigmented lips, these will add mostly gloss for you. Those with paler natural lips may find that Full of Grace deposits some color. Lilt of Lily has the least amount of color, while Pink Tinge has the most shimmer. Earlier today, I was actually lamenting doing lip swatches for these, because they’re so similar when worn, and ironically, I didn’t do lip swatches when these first launched (back in 2009 with Baby Blooms) for the same reason! We’re on that border again; it’s expected to be sheer, but at what point is sheer too close to clear and therefore unpigmented? Full of Grace enhances my natural lip color by making it pinker and rosier, so it seems near our target. Lilt of Lily does a little but to a lesser extent. Pink Tinge adds shimmer and makes my lips look a little lighter than normal, and the sheerness is closer to Lilt of Lily but there is a little more here.

Remember, the palette is completely customizable from the shades you fill it with to the size itself. Inglot’s Pearl Eyeshadows have a very fine shimmer with a brighter, pearly sheen. #428 exemplifies what makes an excellent eyeshadow, and it’s one of the best of Inglot’s line from what I’ve tried so far–super rich in color and the way the base color and shimmer play together makes it glow. All five shades featured in this post had a soft and smooth texture, rich color pay off, and were incredibly blendable. 413 is a muted blue with a silvery-white sheen and pearl finish. 428 is an intense, jewel-tone of violet-blue with a pearl finish. The intensity of this shade makes it glow! 426 is a medium blue with a pearl finish. 415 is an aqua-tinted blue with a flashy yellowed sea foam green duochrome and pearl finish. I didn’t expect to see anything akin to a duochrome in Inglot’s line, but I felt like this one is. The duochrome is subtle, but it’s definitely there–more noticeable in person. 429 is a purple-leaning periwinkle with a high white metallic sheen, though it has a pearl finish.

You can go as heavy or as light as you want, but it often looks subtler because most of the time your eyes are open–so it just peeks out. I’m so anxious for final samples of Jealousy Wakes, because I want to swatch it against Black Emerald (which is definitely darker), but I think they could make a nice gradient of color. You will need the following… Eyes : NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base (primer), Le Metier de Beaute Blonde Amber Eyeshadow (wheat gold), Le Metier de Beaute Bronze Topaz Eyeshadow (bronze), Le Metier de Beaute Black Emerald Eyeshadow (blackened emerald green), Make Up For Ever #20L Aqua Eyes Liner (forest green), Hourglass Film Noir Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Guerlain Les Violettes Mineral Powder (03) Cheeks : theBalm Betty Lou-Manizer (golden bronze) Lips : Bobbi Brown Pink Tulle High Shimmer Lipgloss (multi-color shimmered coral) Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 222 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pencil brush), 188 (small, circular stippling brush) For eyes, start by applying Smudgeproof all over the lid and above the crease with the 242 to lay down your eyeshadow base. Layer Blonde Amber eyeshadow all over the lower lid with the 239. Then, apply Black Emerald eyeshadow into the outer crease, bringing it just over halfway into the crease with the 222. Next, apply Bronze Topaz eyeshadow lightly on the outer third of the lid with the 239. Apply Blonde Amber eyeshadow very lightly on the brow bone to highlight with the 239. Next, apply #20 liner on the lower lash line, and then smudge with Blonde Amber eyeshadow . Coat lashes with Film Noir mascara to finish the look. For cheeks, apply Betty Lou-Manizer on the apples of the cheeks and sweep towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Pink Tulle lipgloss for a complementing lip. Check out more photos!

It’s been used in over 70 posts ! The one I hav been using is actually a smaller size included in one of Laura Mercier’s gift sets or travel kits (can’t remember), but it was 0.33 oz., whereas the full-size version (which is pictured in this post) is a full 1 oz. It took me six months of regular usage to go through it, so I imagine a full-size should last at least a year with daily use or a year and a half with 3-4 uses a week. I just picked up the full-size during Sephora’s F&F sale last month. I love it because it sets my makeup, keeps it in place throughout the day, and helps minimize oiliness. It never looks powdery, and it never looks obvious–it has a silky smooth texture as it is a finely milled loose powder that disappears on the skin. The soft, featherweight texture means it never feels heavy over foundation. I like using this with MAC’s 134 brush and dusting all over after finishing foundation and blush. The only area this product could improve on is working longer than six hours – I do find a hint of oiliness starts to peek through by hour seven or eight, and I’m normal-to-dry, so I imagine that very oily skin types may find they need a touch-up after three or so hours. P.S. — I recommend only peeling back (or cutting) half of the label, because you don’t need that many holes exposed to get a good amount of product.

The top is textured with tousled volume, and the sides are smooth, and slicked back, with a straight-yet-messy knot at the nape of the neck. Get the Look Step 1: Dampen hair with water and brush through. Step 2: Divide hair into four sections: the bottom hangs loose, side sections along the parietal ridge (from ear to ear) are each pulled back with clips, and the top/front of hair is clipped into a loose bun. Step 3: Spritz the bottom section of hair with water, keeping ends dry. Massage a generous amount of Aveda Light Elements™ Texturizing Creme into wet half of hair to add texture, light hold, and minimize flyaways. Layer Aveda Brilliant™ Humectant Pomade over the Light Elements™ Texturizing Creme for shine and moisture. Comb hair through, leaving ends dry, and tie into a clean, tight ponytail with a bungee elastic. Step 4: Divide the ponytail into small sections and straighten each piece using a flat-iron, from elastic to ends. Once each piece is straightened, run the flat-iron through the entire ponytail to create a perfectly straight, sleek edge. Step 5: Repeat the above steps with side sections of hair. Layer Aveda Light Elements™ Texturing Creme and Aveda Brilliant™ Humectant Pomade on the top half of hair, leaving ends dry. Slick sides back tightly, criss-crossing the right section of hair over the existing ponytail and wrapping it under the elastic string. Wrap the left section of hair over the elastic, so that the string is no longer visible. Step 6: Secure a clear elastic band over the entire section to form a larger ponytail. Iron new pieces for a straight, sleek pony. Step 7: Remove top section of hair from clip. Spritz with water, leaving ends dry, and rake hair back with Aveda Light Elements™ Texturizing Creme and Aveda Brilliant™ Humectant Pomade. Hair is damp, rough and textured. Step 8: Pull all hair back, including top section, into one ponytail. Secure together with a clear elastic through. Straighten new pieces of ponytail with a flat-iron so that the entire pony is stick-straight. Step 9: Wrap a final clear elastic around the ponytail and pull hair halfway through into a loose chignon. Leave pieces of hair astray to add rough texture, creating a punk-rock, edgy look. Step 10: Finish by smoothing flyways above the elastic with Aveda Light Elements™ Texturizing Creme and misting slicked back sides with water. See more pictures AND video … Get the Look Video Backstage @ Yigal Azrouel Q&A with Antoinette Beenders Q: What was your inspiration for this look? How did you collaborate with the designer to create the look? “Yigal was inspired by the idea that spring/summer hair should be wet—as if a girl has quickly pulled her hair back with her fingers after swimming. The damp, textured top is a beautiful contrast to the raked-back sides and undone knot at the bottom of the hair. Together, we worked to create a look that was both messy and neat—sleek and funky. The combination of hair textures throughout the look also reflects Yigal’s passion for mixing fabrics in his collection.” Q: How could a woman achieve this look on her own? “This is a very summery style that can easily adapted for an edgy day or evening look. Divide hair into two sections, top and bottom. Spray top section of hair with water and massage with Aveda Light Elements™ Texturizing Creme and Aveda Brilliant™ Humectant Pomade. Slick the sides of hair tightly back with a comb, and create a low ponytail at the nape of the neck with a clear elastic. Straighten the ponytail with a flat-iron and rake back top section of hair back with fingers. Draw hair back into a second elastic and pull halfway through—bringing out loose pieces with fingers to create a messy knot.” Q&A with Yigal Azrouel Q: What is the inspiration for your collection? What is the look you are capturing? “The Spring/Summer 2010 collection is inspired by geometry. Fabrics are slashed with scalpel precision to create bold, graphic shapes in a palette of muted shades–with touches of flame and pistachio. The collection and silhouettes are more defined and structured than ever. This season I’ve restrained layering to create a clean, body-conscious look in diaphanous fabrics such as single-layer viscose jersey, open weave linens, and exaggerated neck lines. Day looks are tailored-yet-easy, while evening and cocktail wear involves lacerated techniques that are innovative and sharp. As always, the focus is on the fabric.” Q: You have made a real effort to “green” your show this season. How do you feel about this accomplishment? “I feel great about greening my show with Aveda this season. This is something I wholeheartedly support. We all benefit from being “green”—everybody should be making an effort and taking responsibility for the environment.”']",65998c08c87b16393e84ae666ea7fa9a695b4751,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/nyfw-ss-10-aveda-yigal-azrouel/

The marriage of luxury and the modern woman evokes a strong confidence that enhances the overall graphic hair look. Friedman and a team of elite Wella Professionals colorists from across North America custom colored natural hair extensions to achieve shades in a spectrum of shiny metallics and cool, silvery, icy tones for a fresh perspective on blonde.

Benefit describes it as, “Our “just peachy” face powder leaves your complexion warm and vibrant. Georgia is a dream…it’s peaches and cream!” Georgia is best used as a sheer, all-over powder on light to medium skin-tones. I think darker skin tones will find this can go on ashy or so sheer they’re not sure they’ve put anything on. It’s really good for brightening and warming up lighter skin tones, so it’s actually a very product for barely-there makeup days. When I’m in a rush, this is something I can easily dust on to make my face look a little more alive and less likely I only slept four hours the night before. I think only the lightest of skin tones will find this useful as a blusher, just because the color is both sheer and pale. In my swatch, there’s only a hint of product that shows up, so you can see that my NC25/30 skin tone starts to get close to the end of the spectrum for this product’s usefulness. I also think that some people go into purchasing this product expecting to use it as a blusher, and then find themselves disappointed by its sheerness. I do like it as an all-over face powder, but it does have shimmer in it, so if you don’t want shimmer all over your face, this isn’t the best choice in all-over powders for you. Additionally, this can be used as a highlighter on cheeks alone, too. It’s a more versatile product than you’d think, but I think a lot of us just get trapped into expecting a blush and not getting it. Georgia also feels a bit powdery/chalky, which is yet another reason I think it’s not a workable product on darker skin tones. I find this best applies with a stippling brush (like MAC’s 187) all over the face for a light, warmed up look without too much shimmer or product. By the ounce, Benefit Face Powders/Blush colors are actually cheaper than MAC! Benefit comes in at $70.00/oz. while MAC is $88.10/oz. Benefit Face Powders/Blushes are actually some of the most bang-for-your-buck in the high-end department. The packaging is cute and exactly what I’d expect out of Benefit. Georgia actually does have a light peach scent to it, though it’s not something I notice while wearing the product–only when I sniff the product itself. Bottom line: It’s not replacing any products I’m already using, and I’d probably be more apt to use it if it provided more of a peachy blush color than an all-over color. I prefer other highlighters and all-over powders with setting qualities, as well. It’s a quality product, but it doesn’t work for everyone, and it’s best used as an easy all-over powder. I think if that’s what you’re looking for, you’d enjoy this product. For others, this is nice, but it isn’t a must-have. Product : 25/30 Value : 9/10 Ease of Use : 3/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : If you’re looking for a sheer, warm-toned all-over powder and you’re light to medium in skintone, this might work for you.

I reviewed Fatale, Impertinence, Insolence, and Insouciance earlier. It has a new wedge-shaped applicator–almost like someone took a nibble out of a doe-foot gloss on both sides. I found the applicator rather springy, and though application was easy for me, I do prefer the Rouge Allure Laque applicator, which has one side that’s rather curved, almost designed to fit your lip into that curve. The opening of the gloss itself seems to make it so not much product gets on each swipe, so you may find yourself going back for a second helping to get a more opaque look. It’s not a sticky or tacky gloss, but I wouldn’t describe it as non-sticky; there’s a little tack to it. The texture of the gloss is on the thicker side, very jelly-like, which is fitting, since it is a gel-based formula. It is smooth, and it applies evenly without settling into lip lines. They do have a lovely glossy finish, though, and they feel like a gloss–they are not a liquid lipstick like the Rouge Allure Laques. There’s an incredibly faint floral scent, but I can barely detect it long enough to accurately describe it, so it’s certainly nothing heavy. I found myself getting about three to four hours of wear with these, even the lighter shades, and it made it so-so through a full venti cup of coffee. I wouldn’t call it a long-wearing gloss, though. It wears well, but it doesn’t go on for hours. The Extrait de Glosses last a little longer than the average gloss (three to four hours for me) but not much longer. Genie is a semi-sheer peach with an underlying pinky tone. Very slight and subtle white micro-shimmer sprinkled through. Oh, and don’t let the initial orangeness of the color scare you, because it translates into something sheerer. Confidence is a semi-opaque, pretty-in-pink rose with lots of white and pink micro-shimmer–it has a rather frosty finish in comparison to the other shades. MAC Wonderstruck Lustreglass is the closest dupe, though it’s sheerer and the shimmer is larger. Imaginaire is a semi-sheer, pale milky pink with soft white-pink micro-shimmer. It’s a more pigmented, more sophisticated version of MAC’s Baby Sparks. Emoi is a semi-sheer, pink-red with soft pink and gold micro-shimmer. It’s almost red, but the sheerest makes it look pinker when worn. It does read rather neutral, though. I’d compare this to MAC’s Venetian Lustreglass. Exces is a semi-opaque cherry red. It does have a tendency to settle into lip lines, though. This is a shade that doesn’t seem to have any micro-shimmer, it’s just a glossy cream kind of finish. Like Emoi, it is rather neutral, but if pressed, I would say it leans orange-red rather than blue. It’s a sheerer, glossier, non-sticky version of Russian Red–oh and not as blue-based. All in all, they’re a nice gloss. Not exactly groundbreaking, but for those looking for a little more color than the Glossimers and Aqualumieres have to offer, Extrait de Gloss fills that void. These also remind me of Guerlain’s Kiss Kiss Gloss Serum–which also debuted this fall. My favorite part about the gloss is actually the packaging, which is sleek, long, and hefty. Not heavy as in you’ll break your back, but it’s weighty; and there’s something about a little bit of heft that makes it feel like you’re holding onto something of quality.

['2012-10-17 00:00:00'],"[""Chanel Reverie Natural Finish Loose Powder Sample Reviews Oct 17, 2012 October 17, 2012 Chanel Reverie Natural Finish Loose Powder Chanel Reverie Natural Finish Loose Powder ($52.00 for 1.0 oz.) is described as a “rosy golden beige.” I think Chanel missed a vital component of the description, though: LOTS AND LOTS OF SPARKLING BITS AND BOBS. The base color is a soft, candlelit beige with a hint of warmth and pinkness that features flecks of sparkle. It seems less sparkly compared to last holiday’s Feerie (which I don’t own but saw briefly). If you’re not a fan of loose sparkle in your face powders, I’d pass on this. It’s a finishing powder that mattifies and sets makeup, but it also had noticeable bits of sparkle everywhere I applied it. I barely patted it on, and there was a healthy blanket of sparkle all over my face (well, the half I applied it to). The good and bad news is that you can’t really see it in the photos. You can definitely see it in person, though. We were waiting for some to-go food when I was testing it, and my husband looked at me strangely and said, “You have glitter all over your face.” Why, yes, yes, I did! I’d describe the particle size to be more that of sparkle, so noticeably smaller than glitter but larger than shimmer and more reflective. It’s not so densely-packed with sparkle that every inch of your skin is sparkly, but it’s definitely apparent. I’m not keen on it as a finishing powder; I think the random sparkles take away from the mattifying, finishing effect of the powder itself. I’d rather grab one of the flesh-toned shades (although, this is really quite transparent on, as finishing powders are designed to be) that do just that but do not have any sparkle. However, The Muse loves it, so give her a review a look-see for some balance. With the amount of sparkle in this, I thought it was better suited for holiday glitz on shoulders and decolletage. It would even work well on legs and arms. Now that I think of it that way, it reminds me of an old Benefit powder that was a sparkly powder that came with an elegant, over-sized pouf to apply, which was quite fun and pretty for body. The powder itself does mattify and finish off foundation quite well, and it helps keep my foundation in place and to last longer by extending the wear an hour or two hours. I don’t think it hides imperfections, though, because the sparkle draws attention to them. It’s extremely finely-milled and feels truly like silk against the skin. It’s lightweight, doesn’t look cakey, and should work well on many complexions. 6 6 Reverie 6 6 Reverie A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Chanel Dillard's 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 91% Total Read Full Review""]",20edaccc13fbbf119e92bc6b2d61351c77a1a617,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tag/chanel-reverie-natural-finish-loose-powder/

It’s pretty in the simplest way.” — Antoinette Beenders for Aveda Hair How-to: Apply Aveda Damage Remedy Daily Hair Repair to damp hair to repair and protect from heat styling. Blow dry straight with a Mason Pearson brush. Use a fine-tooth comb to create a center part, dividing the hair into two sides. Loosely braid each side and secure at the ends with elastics. Spray with Aveda Air Control Hair Spray for light hold. Starting at the top of each braid, apply a few seconds of gentle pressure with a flat iron. Section by section, move slowly down so that the entirety of each braid has been pressed. Gently pinch the sides of each braid between the thumb and forefinger and tug gently to loosen. Remove the elastics and use fingers to loosen the curl. To create a soft wave, brush lightly with a Mason Pearson brush and set the look with Aveda Control Force Firm Hold Hair Spray. Behind-the-Scenes Q: What was your inspiration for this look? How did you collaborate with the designer to create the look? “Christian’s collection was inspired by the graceful beauty of orchid flower petals. We wanted a hair style that captures that natural elegance.” — Antoinette Beenders for Aveda Q: How could a woman achieve this look on her own? “This look is very easy to recreate and works for anyone with a little length to their hair. To protect hair from heat damage, use a small amount of Aveda Damage Remedy Daily Hair Repair on damp hair and blow dry straight. Then make two braids, one on each side of the head, and spray with Aveda Air Control Hair Spray for light hold. Use a flat iron to gently set each braid, pressing small sections from top to bottom. Finally, undo the braids, loosen waves with your fingers, and set the look with Aveda Control Force Firm Hold Hair Spray.” — Antoinette Beenders for Aveda Q: What is the inspiration for your collection? What is the look you are capturing? “My collection this season is inspired by intricately beautiful details found in plant life, like the petals of a Dracula orchid.

As far as I’m concerned, there is always more room in the world for metallic/chrome eyeliner . These do remind me of L’Oreal HIP Chrome Eyeliners in many ways, though these are a little firmer and more metallic than chrome finish. They’re definitely similar, though. Liquif’Eye is soft, smooth, and richly pigmented eyeliner. It glides on like my beloved U rban Decay 24/7 Eye Liners and looks just as smooth. I get good wear out of these–no smudging, budging, or migration eight hours later. They don’t look faded either! Surprisingly, they stay well on my waterline, too, for several hours (but I do have a more watery waterline at times), which isn’t something most liners can do for me. At just $5.49 each, they’re hard to resist. Not only are they excellent in every way–quality, long-lasting liner that is rich in color and smooth in texture–but they’re priced just right. I tried out four of the five shades, and I found each one to be just as good. I hope to see Milani release more shades in the future–how about a green, copper, and violet? Black (#01) is a rich, deep dark black. It’s an absolutely smoldering black that’s truly black–there’s no gray here. Silver (#02) is a bright and shiny silver with a metallic finish. Gold (#03) is a toned down, burnished gold. It’s not a true yellow gold, but it’a step down from that. Little more “antique” gold in it. Aqua (#04) is a bright aqua-blue. It isn’t quite as metallic as either the gold or silver shades, but it still has that metallic sheen. Even the packaging is anything but cheap . It’s a matte black that looks and feels sleek. If you blindfolded me, I couldn’t tell you that these didn’t feel like other high-end eyeliners, like Smashbox and Urban Decay. Have you tried these yet?

I’ve always found the Pocket Rockets to be a little gimmicky for my taste, but the formula is really cushy–it gives lips a slightly plumper, fuller look (without actually plumping). After reviewing a fair amount of Urban Decay lip products, I’ve noticed that there’s a definite debate on whether the scent of their lip products is yay or nay. It doesn’t bother me, but if you’re sensitive or particular about your scents, you may want to give these a sniff in-store before purchasing. Max is a semi-opaque pinky-nude cream with a glossy finish. Since it’s creamy and pale, it does settle a bit into lip lines, but it’s not too bad. Colin is almost like a coral-red that applies sheerly for the most part, but it does add quite a bit of red to your pucker. It kind of looks like you’ve been eating cherries and slicked some gloss on afterward. I found it did fall into my lip lines a tad, but again, from a normal viewing distance, it’s not a big deal. I did, however, think this one tended to give my lips a more splotchy look–I think the color may not work for me so much!

At first, I thought she was wearing this look while dancing a bit, but I think the looks are different–the one she wears while dancing (also around the four minute mark) seems cleaner, not quite as dark, though the lips seem really similar. Anyway, this is inspired by and not so much as an exact replica. If you wanted to be more on target, I’d say to go for a slightly messier smoky eye, add a little bit of gloss to make it look wet and have a sheen, and then go for a very dramatic cheek contour. The shape of the black portion on the eye also goes up quite close to the inner brow bone and then comes down. The lashes should also be bigger and flair out more on the outer lash line. Also, this look is actually REALLY easy. No, seriously! It’s pretty much any cream black base all over the lid. I used the same technique I did back in 2007 to create this black smoky eye tutorial . The lashes took me infinitely longer and still didn’t adhere correctly–but it was good enough to fake it in photos (and my eyes were burning from upper lash line irritation, so it was a hurry-up-and-finish situation). You will need the following… Eyes : Blacktrack fluidline (black), Carbon eyeshadow (matte black), Vex eyeshadow (duochrome white-purple), Bisque eyeshadow (matte highlighter), Feline kohl power (black), false eyelashes (anything big and dramatic), Zoom Fast Black Mascara (black) Cheeks : Sculpt sculpting powder (dark shadow), Dior Amber Diamond Skin Shimmer (bronzy highlighter) Face: Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (#140) Lips : Red No. 5 lipstick (deep red), Violetta lipstick (bright purple), Vino lip pencil (dark red) Brushes : 266 (firm, angled brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 214 (smudge brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 129 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Red No. 5 = New York Apple Directions: Apply Blacktrack fluidline all over the lid as the base with the 249. With the 239, pack Carbon eyeshadow on all over the lid. Using the 226 brush, lightly blend the crease with Vex eyeshadow. Sweep Bisque eyeshadow underneath the brow bone to highlight. Finish with Feline Kohl Power on lower lash line, and apply false lashes to upper lash line, then lightly apply Zoom Fast Black mascara on lashes. Sweep hollows of cheeks with Sculpt sculpting powder using the 168, then highlight with Dior Amber Diamond Skin Shimmer with the 165. Apply Red No. 5 lipstick to lips, and then top with Violetta for color and shine. Check out more photos !

Lusty Lee is a bright silver-gray with a frosted finish. Envious Erin is a pale, creamy white with soft golden warmth. Racy Kacy is a coppered brown with a frost-metallic sheen. Safe Bet Annette is a pastel pink with a white frosted finish. Runaround Rebecca is an olive green with a khaki brown base and frost-metallic sheen. Come-Hither Heather is a mauve-y taupe witha frost finish. Open to Offers Olwen is a rich, vibrant blue with a touch of teal and frost finish. All the Way Annie is a red-based purple with soft silver flecks of micro-glitter Guilty Gwen is a softened charcoal black with silver flecks of glitter. This was the only shade I had issues with–I had to scrape out the product to get it to show. It was so poor, I thought it was actually defective. (It is really packed on in the swatch to get it to show.) my thoughts on the formula: With the exception of Guilty Gwen, these eyeshadows are soft, silky smooth, and packed with pigment. They apply evenly, blend out beautifully, and aren’t powdery at all (sometimes a side effect of really soft eyeshadows). The formula is the same as the individual eyeshadows–no skimping or cutting corners. This palette has a good mix of colors, and I can see some combinations coming from the palette, though I see these more easily mixed with other products you already own. They are all rather shimmery/frosty finishes, which makes them easy to blend. The quality is really phenomenal, excluding Guilty Gwen, and well worth the price tag. value: theBalm’s single eyeshadows retail for $16.00 and contain 0.12 oz. worth of product, while this palette retails for $39.50 and comes with 0.51 oz. worth of product. Single eyeshadows work out to be $133/oz. and the palette works out to be $77/oz. The palette is also an excellent deal, because each shade is approximately 0.057 oz. each (the average full-sized eyeshadow is 0.05 oz.), so you get more variety. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 28/30 Value : 10/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 final thoughts: I had to take off two points because of Guilty Gwen, but I would have loved to give this palette full marks–it really is a beautiful palette with so many well-pigmented, easy-to-use shades. where to buy: Sephora Read Full Review']",193c79ba53d99e8c7641fdc92e18dcf1fa3c59dc,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tag/thebalm-racy-kacy-eyeshadow/

Fun to wear alone as an ultra glossy coat or to lighten any too-bold-to-wear-right-now lipstick. Love Rules is a brighter, deeper pink, but not quite hot fuchsia pink. The shimmer/reflects in Love Rules is pink with a touch of opalescence.

E stee Lauder Peach Nuance Blush ($26.00 for 0.25 oz.) may have escaped your notice, but it is now highly touted as a perfect dupe for MAC’s Ripe Peach . I was quite confused at the hype over Ripe Peach after it came out, to be honest. It’s pretty, but I am completely surprised at how collectible it has become. When murmurings began comparing Estee Lauder’s Peach Nuance , I knew I had to find out for myself. Peach Nuance is incredibly close, but I found it was a little lighter and a smidgen pinker–it also doesn’t have the shimmer-sheen of Ripe Peach . It’s close, truly, but it’s not a perfect dupe to me. When worn on the cheeks, the difference is much, much subtler, but when swatched, the difference is more noticeable. Peach Nuance is a lightened coral-pink with a very silky, nearly matte finish. If you want to get closer to Ripe Peach , stay more on the coral side of the blush and avoid the lighter side, which does most of the lightening. This is all to say that Peach Nuance is a lovely color, worth getting if you missed out on Ripe Peach and would love a gradated coral blusher. ( Estee Lauder also carries several other Nuance shades, which seem to all have the gradated look. ) It’s smooth and easily blended, though the color is soft and sheer and needs to be built up for a more intense look. It’s a great coral for both cool and warm skin tones, though, so it’s a very universal shade. It could be a little more pigmented, but it’s on par with the pigmentation of Ripe Peach.

Essie gives nail polish fans six lovely sheers to choose from as spring arrives in beautiful hues of soft pastels. These polishes apply easily, smoothly, and just to show what kind of color you can build, each color was applied with three coats (keep in mind that these were done strictly as swatches, so the aren’t perfectly polished!). Pictured above, Hi Maintenance , was my favorite of the six, because it was such a flattering pink. It wasn’t so cool that it looked awkward on my warmer skin, but it also wasn’t a warm pink that looked a bit too peppy for my tastes. Hard To Get is a brighter pink that’s fairly opaque–it kind of reminds me of Don’t Be Shy blush from MAC’s Barbie launch–it was really close to being my perfect pink, but it was just a few shades too bright to be that absolute perfect pink. Secret Affair is a fun, shimmery pinky-white shade that looked surprisingly nice with my skin; I thought something with that much white in it could never look right all over nails. Looking For Love is a lovely lavender color that was just gorgeous, but I found that it did apply a bit streaky in terms of depositing the color – I think you may have to be a bit more meticulous when applying this particular shade, but it’s too beautiful to dismiss. Body Language was a flatter white with gray-purple undertones; kind of an odd color for my nails personally, but I see it working better on lighter skinned hands. Great Expectations has a silvery-purple cast to it, and like Looking For Love, it didn’t apply as evenly as the others did. I found this shade to be too cool for my taste, making it my least favorite. Overall, I liked that I could build up these sheers with three coats to get decent color, since I don’t usually wear sheers. On the same note, for more professional or subdued affairs, sheers are fabulous choices, and this gives you a polish that can multitask! Also, sheers are amazing on top of a more opaque polish to give it a different sheen or color.

['2010-06-02 00:00:00'],"['NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base Review, Photos, & Swatches Reviews Jun 02, 2010 June 02, 2010 NARS Pro-Prime: Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base ($24.00 for 0.26 oz.) is much-needed primer addition to NARS’ core range. In addition to the eyeshadow base, NARS also launched their Pro-Prime Face Prep ($30.00) (which, at this time, I am not planning to review). I picked up a sample tube of the primer with a recent Sephora order, and the sample tube allowed me about four or five uses. From the images I’ve seen online, the packaging is similar–just a longer tube for the full-size version. They both have a doe-foot applicator (like the kind you see in lipgloss). It has an incredibly thin, slightly creamy consistency. When applied, it looks white on the applicator, but it is virtually colorless. This colorlessness is actually my only–albeit marginal and nitpicky–complaint. It’s so colorless, even from the get-go, that it is difficult to determine where you’ve applied the primer. This makes covering the entire lid a little more difficult than when one would use a colored, even subtly so, primer. I’ve noticed that if I’ve missed an area, that area will look duller and flake, since there is no primer there. The problem is just it’s really difficult to tell if you’ve missed an area! Aside from that, if you’ve covered your entire lid, it works really well. It lives up to all the claims NARS makes about it: lightweight, extends the wear, smooths the surface, and maximizes color. I didn’t experience any budging, smudging, creasing, or migration when I used this as a primer underneath my eyeshadows. It is a clear, matte primer that merely smooths over the lid and acts to hold and bond all the eyeshadow together. Colors definitely didn’t look muted at all, and they held their intensity throughout the day. NARS Smudgeproof is most comparable to Urban Decay Primer Potion and Too Faced Shadow Insurance . The consistency is very similar–they are all very thin and a little creamy. However, NARS definitely feels more velvety once it dries–which is very quickly. They are all nearly colorless, though NARS is definitely truly colorless–UDPP has a slight nude tone to it and TFSI even less nude. I’ve always found that UDPP seemed to have a slight shimmer to it, and NARS is completely matte (which is a good thing, if you want to keep your matte eyeshadows matte!). Of course, the major difference between the two is the price — UDPP goes for $18 for 0.34 oz. while NARS is $24 for 0.26 oz and TFSI is $17 for 0.35 oz. Between the three, I’d actually go NARS. I really didn’t think I’d like it more than the other two, but I would. One of the issues I have with TFSI is the product can separate a bit in the tube. I do really like that you can squeeze out what you need and easily apply with a brush. Both NARS and UDPP have doe-foot applicators, but NARS is a simple tube, so it’s not nearly as wasteful as UDPP is. I’ve never finished a bottle of primer in my life, so even if $24 is a higher upfront cost, I really don’t see it not being worth the investment, since a tube should last you many, many uses. Fun Fact : Ironically, since I revisited my TFSI review , which was made back in 2008–OMG!–TFSI, at the time, was $1 more than UDPP, which was $16. The whole point? UDPP has raised its price $2 in two years and is now more expensive than TFSI. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! ? Product : 29/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : If you’re looking for a lightweight, colorless eyeshadow primer that stays on all day without budging, smudging, or fading, you may want to give NARS Smudgeproof a try.

MAC Paint Pot in Black Ground was then set on the lids and then layered with MAC Eye Shadow in Carbon was added on top for impact.

['2007-09-10 00:00:00'],"['New York Fashion Week 2007 (Spring 2008) – MAC Backstage Day 4, 5, 6 zArchived Sep 10, 2007 September 10, 2007 MAC Cosmetics artists describe the looks they created for specific designers from days 4, 5, and 6 of New York Fashion Week 2007 (Spring/Summer 2008).Â For specific look break downs and more photos, check out this post from yesterday: New York Fashion Week | MAC Cosmetics Look Breakdowns DAY 4 CHAIKEN The Chaiken woman has come into some cash. “She’s a jet setting expensive woman who gets off the red eye looking great,” said makeup artist Polly Osmond. “But that’s because she’s been in first class! Call the look “beachy done” – and we’re seeing it all over the NY spring runways; cheeks highlighted and accented on the brow bone. Beigey lips (the famous Spice lip pencil filled in with Subculture lip pencil and 2N lipglass) with a tint of pink and white eye pencil inside the eyes. Remember the smoky eye? This season, it’s on hiatus. Wide eyed is where it’s at. J. MENDEL How many times do we have to hear the name “Lauren Hutton” before we smell a trend? For J. Mendel, Charlotte Tilbury evoked that seventies glamazon – and a Jerry Hall feeling – in the makeup. Last spring’s words like “fresh” and “pretty” have been replaced by “diva” and “expensive and glamorous.” On top of the glowing skin and the ubiquitous 4N lipstick (paled down by concealer), Tilbury bronzed out the models’ eyes with MAC Paint Pots, placing a copper shade right over the eyeball. You could almost hear Roxy Music playing in the background. “More than this…” BABY PHAT Okay, so perhaps the predicted death of colour for the Spring ’08 makeup palette was just tiny bit premature. But then Baby Phat always breaks all the rules. For Kimora Lee Simmons’ collection, makeup artist Lisa Butler used fuchsia like Giorgio Armani uses greige. She blended strong fuchsia blush for both the cheeks and eyes, but applied them in a light dust of powder. But when it came to the lips, she didn’t hold back – blending three different red fuchsias together to get the perfect dark pink pout. PORTS 1961 Designer Tia Cibani’s spring influence was African safari so makeup artist Greg Wencel kept the faces slightly moist (“from humidity”) and put emphasis on tanned cheeks and matte terra cotta mouths. “Think African clay paintings,” he explained. The eyes were opened up by a trend we’re starting to see everywhere for spring: a white line painted close to the lash line. So forget that fifties cat eye – and stat thinking; white eyeliner! Keep reading to see what trends were created on Day 5 and Day 6 at spectacular Fashion Week! DAY 5 CATHERINE MALANDRINO To Pecheux took Catherine Malandrino’s theme; a petal palette – and ran with it. “Think of the sunrise in St. Tropez,” he said. “But think of it rising over a beautiful old French hotel, where all the artists live and work.”In others, flowery – but arty flower. Kind of Renoir. The rose colours went on the cheeks. The jasmine, lavenders, and lilacs went on the eyes. And the mouths were a pouty purplish pink reminiscent of peony. Think Flower Power a la Francais. RUFFIAN The theme of Madame Pompadour was taken pretty seriously at Ruffian. The models’ hair was in literal pompadours – and Polly Osmond applied white powder base to the outlining areas of their faces, reminiscent of powdered wigs. Then she painted on China Doll-like pink cheeks for a regal feeling and matched them with a soft pink mouth. On the eyelids – only gloss. The effect? Marie Antoinette goes clubbing. ROSA CHA Okay, we already know that Spring ’08 is about channeling the casual jet set chic of Lauren Hutton. But at Rosa Cha, Gordon Espinet was going for the looks for all the great cover girls of the seventies. “Think Francesco Scaullo,” he said. To Espinet, seventies makeup implies, “No structure in the makeup – but lots of strong textures.” He made the skin shine with gold and bronze highlighters applied to the cheeks, eyes, and lips. “It’s about taking beach style,” he said of the famous bathing suit line, “and making it fashion.” TEMPERLEY LONDON We’ve seen a hint of fluorescence slipping into makeup for Spring ’08 – in the form of the matte electric orange mouth. Charlotte Tilbury invoked it to balance the palette in Alice Temperley’s frocks: we saw a lot of whites, neutrals – and orange. Tilbury used a combo of three MAC tools to create the look: a MAC Orange Lip Pencil, the Lipstick Morange, and Lipmix. The mouth was counterbalanced by a large “C” shape of gloss painted in a semi circle from the brow and eye bone over the cheekbone. “I think of it was 1930’s makeup that’s mixed with rave culture,” Tilbury noted. Face — Face and Body Foundation was applied to even out skin discolorations and Blot Powder was dusted where necessary. Mâˆ™Aâˆ™C Gloss was applied on the nose, cheekbones and temple for an all-over, sexy look.Face and Body Foundation was applied to even out skin discolorations and Blot Powder was dusted where necessary. Mâˆ™Aâˆ™C Gloss was applied on the nose, cheekbones and temple… Eyes — For a futuristic, wet looking glow, Mâˆ™Aâˆ™C Gloss was applied all over lids. Lashes were curled and coated with Plush Lash Mascara in Black. Tip Lips — Mâˆ™Aâˆ™C Pro Orange Lip Mix was blended with Mâˆ™Aâˆ™C Pro Creme Color Base in Flaming Fuschia, defined with Lip Pencil in Redd and topped with Morange Lipstick for an extra punch of color. RODARTE James Kaliardos went eye to eye with Rodarte’s punk ballerina look for spring by creating an unusual and highly artistic eye makeup design: back lines underneath and above the eye that met in an exaggerated cat formation somewhere out in the nether brow bone area. The lids were dabbed with turquoise or cobalt, reflecting Rodarte’s major colour theme.An art statement or a new way to apply eyeliner that’s post modern and pushes the makeup envelope? At Rodarte, it was actually both. The rest of the face was dewy, natural, and young – as were those Belle du Jour ponytails dipped in coloured ink. DAY 6 DKNY Remember – if you’re old enough – Scavullo’s photos of Patti Hansen in the seventies? Her gold hair, large, teased and waved, on the beach in a printed jersey caftan, with a beautiful pink pout and matching cheeks … the eye took a major backseat in Charlotte Tilbury’s DKNY spring face. The lips and cheeks matched like a purse and pumps, in a sheer shade lilac pink – while the eyes were naked and shiny. Anyway, who needs eye makeup when they’re wearing a caftan? RICHARD CHAI James Kaliardos did perhaps the most minimalist makeup of the week at Richard Chai. There wasn’t even any foundation – just concealer where needed. The eyes were dotted with Soft Ochre paint pot, touched with a little Nanogold eye shadow on the top of the lid. Coppering eye shadow was dusted on the crease and lightly under the eye. And Beurre cremestick liner adorned the mouth radiating from the center out – so there were no harsh lines. It was practically a nudist camp for the face. Face — To keep skin clean and minimal, MAC Select Moisture Cover was applied where needed. Loose Blot Powder was dusted over t-zone to complete a soft, clean look. Eyes — MAC Paint in Bare Canvas was applied to lid as a base. All That Glitters Eye Shadow was then layered over with a MAC #239 Brush to give the eye an opalescent, golden goddess look. Copper Plate Eye Shadow was added to crease and underneath the lower lash line to create a soft, deep ethereal eye. Lashes were liberally curled with a MAC Eye Lash Curler MAC Paint in Bare Canvas was applied to lid as a base. All That Glitters Eye Shadow was then layered over with a MAC #239 Brush to give the eye an opalescent, gold… Li ps — MAC Lip Conditioner and Lip Erase in Dim were applied to lip as a base and Cream Stick Lip Liner in Buerre was buffed on to create a natural stain. TULEH If Grace Kelly went to the beach – which she probably never did – but IF he did, she’d be this season’s Tuleh girl. As envisioned by Polly Osmond, she looks beautiful – but does not appear to have a lot of makeup on – but she does. Osmond worked with bronze powder to highlight and low light areas of the face and cheekbones – using her favourite color, MAC’s Taupe. In the crease of the eyes, she applied a pinkish gold eye shadow called Hey – and then used the all important concealer on the lips, covered with Subculture lip pencil and 2N lipglass. Are you getting a hint of the trends now? 2N, Subculture, Taupe, and a white eye pencil inside the eyes have turned up at more than half the NY shows. BERARDI Mariel Barrera kept it chic and simple at Berardi, using safari warm hues on the lips and cheeks, and only a pale copper on the eyes. But the effect was terra cotta meets red earth; a bronzed goddess who goes Big Game Hunting with Peter Beard.']",508509a8adfb2c0b1602b5fbb3f10fb9899e2c95,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/new-york-fashion-week-2007-spring-2008-mac-backstage-day-4-5-6/
['2007-09-10 00:00:00'],"['Tutorial – Soft, Subtle Warm Neutral Eye with Goldmine, Bronze, Carbon, & Indianwood paint pot Tutorials Sep 10, 2007 September 10, 2007 This tutorial is designed to walk you through, step-by-step, a very easy and subtle neutral eye that’s perfect for any occasion. Skill Level : Beginner Eyes : Indianwood paint pot (Warm golden brown cream shadow/base), Grain eyeshadow (light neutral), Goldmine eyeshadow (warm, rich gold), Rye eyeshadow (antique gold), Bronze eyeshadow (rich warm brown), Carbon eyeshadow (matte black), Graphblack technakohl (black kohl liner), and black mascara. Face : If you’d like to compliment the eyes, use Other Worldly blush (warm dirty brown) on apples of cheeks with Taupe blush to contour. Lips : For matching lips, try Strawberry Blonde lipstick with Tartlette lipglass. Tools : MAC 249 firm shadow brush, 239 shadow brush, 219 detailed crease brush Here are the products that you will be using. Start with a naked/bare eye. Using the MAC 249 firm, flat shadow brush, pick up a small amount of Indianwood paint pot – the amount of product shown on the brush is all you need for each eye. Applying the product you picked up with the 249, begin applying the color on the inner portion of your lid. Cover your entire lid and just above your crease with Indianwood paint pot. It should be smooth and fairly even, but it does not need to be perfect. Using the 239 brush, apply Grain eyeshadow to the inner lid. This is how it appears. Pick up a generous amount of Goldmine eyeshadow with the 239 and apply to the middle of the lid. Bring the brush downwards as pictured to cover the entire middle portion of the lid. It should resemble this photo at this point. With the 239 brush, pick up some Bronze eyeshadow and apply it to the outer third of your lid. As always, bring the color from just around the crease area downwards to the lash line. This is why this is called an easy neutral eye, because we haven’t even started to blend! Repeat the step before, only this time place the Bronze eyeshadow in the very outer portion of your crease. Move the 239 sideways towards the outermost portion, just to darken slightly. This is what you should have right now. With the 239, pick up a very small amount of Carbon eyeshadow and move your brush to the outer half of your crease and sweep outwards. By sweeping outwards you will deposit the black shadow in the portion you want. It should be a very obvious black line, almost, because it has not been blended, only applied. Using the same method as used to apply the black shadow, use this method, only with less pressure, to sweep back and forth across the area with the black shadow to help blend it into the other lid colors. When meshed with the other colors, the black becomes a smokey brown color and less drastic and harsh. With the 239, pick up a generous amount of Grain eyeshadow and begin applying it beneath the inner portion of your eyebrow. Use a sweeping motion towards the outer edge of your eyebrow as pictured. This is what you should find yourself seeing. Continue to apply (and pick up more shadow if necessary) the highlight color directly below the first sweep of color and above the crease to help mesh the colors together. This is how all the highlight should be looking at this point. You can add more if you feel you need it (pictured here, more could be applied closer to the inner lid, directly below the inner brow) or less by dabbing the area with your fingertip (gently!). Using the 219, apply Bronze eyeshadow along the outer lower lash line. Like so. Again, using the 219, apply some Goldmine eyeshadow to the inner half of the lower lash line. Your lash line should look something like this. Apply Graphblack technakohl or your choice in black eyeliner to the lower lash line, keeping clear of the water line. Your finished product will be a subtle neutral eye that can be worn throughout the day, at just about any occasion.

['2007-10-31 00:00:00'],"['MAC Cosmetics – Curiositease Collection Review, Swatches, and Product images, Photos Reviews Oct 31, 2007 October 31, 2007 Overall , Curiositease is a gorgeously packed opportunity for MAC fans to try out a variety of lipglasses, plushglasses, soft sparkle liners, and pigments without buying them individually at higher prices. I felt like each set had a good mix of colors – some bold, some soft. I loved the stylish packaging of the canvas holders with crown motif emblazoned on the side. If you were wondering what to do with these, they make excellent makeup holders for brushes, liners, mascara, etc. If I had to pick favorites, I’d probably go with the warm lipglass/lustreglass and cool pigment sets. Keep reading for detailed individual color and product reviews, as wella s swatches and product photos! Cool Lipglass/Lustreglass Be Seen is a shimmery white lipglass with lots of glitter particles; it’s obviously going to be incredibly sheer and tone down a bold lipstick. Spirited is a pink-mauve lipglass with pink shimmer, good opacity. It would help to make a great toned down vampy lip when paired with a very rich and dark lipstick. Nymphette is a gorgeous dirty pink with gold pearlized particles. It’s a color I’ve never owned, but always kind of wanted to. It’s in the medium pink family, but it has a touch of “dirtiness” to it. Star Nova is one of loveliest lustreglasses, because it has pretty good opacity, relative to most lustreglasses. It is raspberry hued with pink-purple shimmer. Flash Mode is a bright pink with raspberry undertones and less shimmer than the other items in the set. Warm Lipglass/Lustreglass Expensive is a pale yellow with white-gold shimmer, which is quite pretty. This color makes a great way to add some va-voom to any lipstick. It just manages to alter the lipstick color in such a subtle, but fabulous way. Bada Boom is a gorgeous medium-pink with subtle shimmer gloss. It is fairly opaque, but sheer enough to allow some buildability. Pink Grapefruit is a cult favorite, because it is such an excellent coral gloss. It is a peachy-orange with gold shimmer, and it’s definitely one of my staple glosses for a good coral lip. Beaux is a dirty plum-mauve with multi-colored shimmer in gold and pink-purple. With the shimmer, it takes it from a would-be brown-purple to something gorgeous. Ornamental is another great lustreglass to grab, because it’s such a rich orange with pinkish-purple reflects in it, even some gold shimmer. It always reminds me of the holidays! Plushglass Pretty Plush is an incredibly sheer color (it does not show up as more than a few sparkles and the faintest sheen on me), which makes it a great alternative to add high shine to a lipstick without altering the base color(s). Bountfiul is a frosty cool pink, very shimmery. It might seem a bit “pornstar pink” at first, but the plushglass formula makes all the choices fairly sheer, so it shouldn’t be overwhelming. Pink Luxe has one of my favorite names out of the Curiositease sets, and it’s a hot pink with cool pink reflects. I think people will really love this particular color, because for some reason most of us are drawn to bold, bright glosses! Hot Stuff is a darker medium-pink with subtle shimmer, kind of a dirty pink. I was thinking Hot Stuff and Pink Luxe should switch names, personally. Wet, Wild, & Wonderful is a warm brown with gold reflects, and while it’s not a color I’d immediately grab for, it would definitely ring some bells for darker skin tones. Cool Pigment Set Reflects Blue is a white-based glitter that shows up with a shimmer of white-blue. I personally love Reflects Transparent Teal more, because it has a much finer texture. Helium is a gorgeous cool light pink with purple undertones, and I swear it feels more finely milled than its original version. I wonder if they reformulated it at all, because it went on smoothly, not in chunks. Softwash Grey is a lovely purple-gray color; it’s one of the more unique colors that MAC has put out in pigment form. I truly find this really adds diversity to looks because of the duochrome nature of it. Naval Blue is a deep navy blue with purple undertones. Very winter-esque! Forest Green is a deep, dark green with subtle shimmer. It’s such a great cool color, because it lends itself well to combinations with Femme Noir or Humid for a bit of a brightening touch. Warm Pigment Set Reflects Gold has incredible gold reflects with a dirty base, kind of like antique gold. I liked this one over Reflects Blue, but all the glitters are fun to play around with. Lily White came out almost as a light pink-purple on me, rather than a brighter version than I remember. It might have been the lighting on this one! This also seemed less chunky than the full-size release. Dazzleray is one of my favorite colors, because it is such a great peachy-gold color. It looks good on nearly everyone, in my opinion! Sunpepper is much like Blue-Brown (you don’t need both unless you’re a pigment collector). Reddish brown base with bluish shimmer. Coppersparkle is chunky as ever, but I’ve found this to be one chunky pigment that works well despite its texture. It’s a gorgeous bright copper color with so much shimmer. Those who aren’t a fan of shimmer/frost, steer clear of this one! Softsparkle Pencil Set Nightsky is a faded black with silver glitter. Peacocked is my favorite out of the bunch, because it is medium-teal with silver reflects. Iris Accents is a medium-to-dark purple with silver reflects, but I’ve never found it to be that usable when I do my looks. Reflecto is the pale blue of the collection, again with silver reflects. Goldenair is gorgeous, but harder to use; it is a white-gold with gold reflects. It’s pretty, but I’m not sure where I’d use this besides the waterline, though I’m not positive if the glitter is waterline safe. Each set is $29.50.

This is the modified version, and the tutorial should be up on YouTube shortly ? I layered Free to Be and Coppering to get pretty close to Firecracker –though you could certainly use one or the other and still get something quite pretty out of it! I was also all out of the NARS base I had used in the original look, so I used UDPP instead. By the by, theBalm will be featured on MTV’s Hired tomorrow at 6:30pm! I’m kind of excited, because it would be fun to see the inner-workings of a beauty brand. theBalm will be looking at three final applicants to fill the role of their office assistant. You will need the following… Eyes : Urban Decay Primer Potion (neutral eyeshadow base), Urban Decay Free Love Eyeshadow (melon-peach), MAC Free to Be Eyeshadow (coral), MAC Coppering Eyeshadow (reddish copper), MAC Amber Lights Eyeshadow (copper), MAC Bronze Eyeshadow (bronze), MAC Nylon Eyeshadow (white-gold), MAC Goldmine Eyeshadow (gold) , MAC Rich Ground Fluidline (copper), Urban Decay Lucky 24/7 Liner (copper), MAC Black Black Chromagraphic Pencil (black), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder (translucent) Cheeks : MAC Get-Away Bronze Blush (reddish bronze) Lips : MAC Thrills Lipstick (rosy copper), MAC Flurry of Fun Lipglass (sheer tangerine with teal reflects) Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Firecracker = Paradisco; Get-Away Bronze = = Format; Thrills = La Prairie Rose Bronze; Easy Lounger = Prr For eyes, start by applying Primer Potion as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Using the 239, apply Free Love eyeshadow on the inner half of the lid and blend upwards into the tearduct. Lightly blend Free to Be eyeshadow on the middle of the lid with the 239, then layer Coppering eyeshadow on top to darken. With the 239, apply Amber Lights eyeshadow into the lower crease and then blended towards the outer corner and lid.Next, apply Bronze eyeshadow into the crease with the 226, lightly blending outwards and upwards to fade to the brow bone. Blend Nylon eyeshadow with the crease shade and highlight the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Lucky eyeliner on the lower lash line and Black Black pencil on the lower waterline. Line the upper lash line with Rich Ground fluidline applied with the 208; then pat Goldmine eyeshadow on top to lighten. Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Get-Away Bronze blush on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Thrills lipstick first, and then layer Flurry of Fun lipglass for a complementing lip.

['2007-02-11 00:00:00'],"['MAC Cosmetics – Barbie Loves MAC Review Reviews Feb 11, 2007 February 11, 2007 Hey ladies & gents! I got back from the Barbie Loves MAC unveiling event a couple of hours ago, and I thought I’d share my thoughts on the event as well as the launch (my usual long-winded review is here!). They had velvet ropes, security, and people letting you in/out. Each person received a pink piece of paper so you could indicate what products you wanted and the quantity. They had “runners,” which were MAs who would go and get the products you listed on your sheet while you waited at the cashier. There were many MAs at the event, and everybody was decked out in Barbie-wear from pink shoes to hot pink bras to men in Barbie-drag. They had a DJ spinning in the corner of the store, as well. There were a ridiculous amount of people in the event, so hearing/talking was basically impossible with the noise of customers & the DJ/music. I didn’t stay long because although flattering, I kept having customers come up to me asking for help, thinking I worked there. Several of the MAs asked me what store I worked at, and I had to tell them I’m nowhere close to working for MAC, LOL! It was quite flattering, as I said, but sort of frustrating when I was trying to shop! I met a couple of LJers, so hey girls ? As I was leaving, it was adorable – three young girls (maybe 12-14) came up to me and asked if I did my own makeup. I told them yes, I did, and they said it was so pretty and they loved it. So all in all, it’s a good thing I wore the look I posted yesterday because it got me a ton of compliments! BTW, I totally ate a Barbie Loves MAC sugar cookie (which didn’t taste so hot, sorry MAC! stick to cosmetics, not cooking!), but I got you all a picture of it before I ate half. I thought about keeping it and selling it, but eww, gross. BARBIE LOVES MAC REVIEW Eyeshadows Magic Dust: This color reminded me a lot of Gold Dusk pigment (and also the white-yellow shadow launched in one of the Raquel quads), so I was quite disappointed with it. The texture of all the shadows were nice, and they all seem to have decent payoff. Whistle: This seemed like a pinker version of Pink Opal, and quite similar to Rite of Spring eyeshadow, released with Danse. It does have a great texture, though, which helps with the color payoff. Playful: A soft, pastel pink that looks like a very pink coral to me. I could see this working well for many complexions, compared to MAC’s penchant for launching more frosty-pale pinks. Springtime Skipper: A gorgeous green that is cooler rather than warmer; you might say it has a bit of minty color in it, but it still is quite green with a touch of warmth. It seems similar to Swimming eyeshadow, but with a better texture and color payoff. Beautyburst: This color seems so odd amongst the other five shadows, because it is almost matte in texture, but I do love the warmth of this chocolate brown color. It is quite smooth and versatile if you enjoy browns. Mothbrown: I bought Moth Brown when it was released with Madame B., and I hated it. I thought it was such an ugly color, and after seeing Moth Brown again, I can say that it is definitely a lovely shade. It is almost like a dirty silver–a silver with some rustic brown thrown in it for dimension. Overall , the eyeshadows were all lovely colors, but the best part about them was that they had real color payoff. The second best feature was how smooth and workable each one felt when I swatched them on my hand. I only bought Springtime Skipper, but I was certainly tempted by Playful, Beautyburst, and Mothbrown. Lipsticks Style It Up: A lovely nude with a touch of pink that has enough color in it to work well lightly, but it is also buildable. Real Doll: A cute little pink lipstick that is quite sheer and a bit too pale for me. Modern Ms.: A deeper brown-red color, but the color payoff isn’t intense, so it makes it more wearable. It did remind me a bit of Sundressing lipstick, except more in the red family than plum. Sweet & Single: An incredibly sheer pale pink lipstick that was next to impossible to get a good swatch of because of its sheerness. I found this the worst of the lipsticks because it was terribly sheer and wouldn’t do anything if I put it on my lips. Rocking Chick: This is probably the most hyped up lipstick of the collection, but while it is definitely a gorgeous bright pink, it is not original. In the swatch photo, the top half of the Rocking Chick swatch is Rocking Chick, while the bottom half is Fashionably Fuchsia. Rocking Chick might be a touch sheerer, but they look the same in color. Overall , the lipsticks seemed lackluster compared to what I expected from the collection. I didn’t realize how similar Rocking Chick was going to be compared to Fashionably Fuchsia, so I was thoroughly disappointed by that. I expected to be buying that lipstick for sure! I found all but Modern Ms. and Rocking Chick to have very sheer textures, which makes it easy to move on from the lipsticks because sheer just doesn’t cut it. You only need a handful of sheer lipsticks! Because I don’t have too many nude lipsticks, I did purchase Style It Up. Lipglass Sweetness: It appears MAC must release one lipglass that looks like every other sheer white-pink-nude shade they’ve launched before. It is a good item to purchase if you do not have a similar color at home yet, but it will add a nice shimmer and sheen without altering the color of the lipstick beneath it. Fashion Pack: A sheer coral-pink with shimmer that looks awfully pretty, but it doesn’t stand out. Cute, but MAC makes tons of cute glosses. Happening Gal: I thought this was an interesting lipglass, although it reminded me of Glamoursun lipglass… This would look lovely on top of Modern Ms., and I would say that this is the most original lipglass out of the four. Malibu Barbie: I did like the shade of pink in this lipglass, but it reminded me a lot of Sweetie Cake lipglass. I think Sweetie Cake lipglass might be sheerer than Malibu Barbie, but the colors are quite similar. Overall , the lipglasses were a touch disappointing, because the two standouts ended up not being so thrilling. Happening Gal is one I might reconsider if it really doesn’t look similar to Glamoursun, but I think I can pass on Malibu Barbie. Liquidlast liner & Nail polishes Visionaire: It is a true frosty pale pink, so if it that is what you’re looking for, MAC has the solution, but I just didn’t think I’d get any use out of it. Steamy: This is the perfect Barbie hot pink nail polish; I thought it was lovely, and if I didn’t wear more nude/neutral shades on my nails, I would have definitely snatched this up! Toast of the Town: I personally thought this was kind of ugly, but I don’t think I’ve ever been a fan of brown nails either. This seemed more watered down compared to Steamy. Blushes Don’t Be Shy: A pretty cool baby pink that has a good amount of color payoff, especially on lighter skintones. It isn’t too shimmery either, which is nice; I’m not sure how well this is going to look on darker complexions, but I purchased it at the insistence of an MA, so we shall see how that goes. Fab: A much darker brown with a touch of red-warmth, but I find it is probably too dark for me to wear as a blush very often. Nice, but not something I see myself using frequently. I think this might be awesome for darker skintones, though. Beauty Powders Pearl Sunshine: I thought this was gorgeous, although it does look a bit like Melon pigment! The texture and lightness of beauty powders do distinguish it from being similar to Melon pigment. Plus, I think the shimmer in Pearl Sunshine is significantly less compared to Melon pigment. Pearl Blossom: This is a pinker beauty powder, which reminds me of Pretty Baby beauty powder (Diana Ross collection), and I could see it working as a nice highlighter for several people. OVERALL I thought the Barbie Loves MAC collection was a good launch with something to offer everybody, but I didn’t end up buying nearly as much as I had thought I would. I feel pretty good on the items I passed on, and I know that I will be purchasing one or two on Tuesday when I go to the Macy’s counter, namely Pearl Sunshine beauty powder.

I adore the packaging of the lipsticks; they’re white cases with the Antiquitease gold/silver crown motif on them. The lipglasses are mini-sized, but their caps also have the white casing and detailing of the lipsticks. I’m not lovin’ the bag so much, only because I have no clue what I will do with them! I know I’m not storing my Finery products in them, otherwise I’d never reach for any of it. I’m quite pleased with the colors that came out with each set, too. There really isn’t a set I’d want to miss, but if I had to pick, my favorite Plum lips or Pink lips. Have I mentioned that I adore the names of all of the holiday products? So classy and fun. Keep reading for individual color and product reviews, swatches, and product photos. 3 Plum Lips Ultra Madame is a sheer medium-pink lipstick, but it does have some buildability to it. There doesn’t appear to be much shimmer in it, because it’s a very soft gold shimmer that looks more like an undertone. I see this color being a quick wash of lip color for lazy days, or underneath a very bold gloss. Culture Class is a gorgeous coppery-plum lipstick with soft golden reflects. Contessa is a lovely darker pink lipglass with plum undertones and pink and gold shimmer (and it has the best name, ever!). 3 Coral Lips Aristo-Chic is a medium-pink lipstick with peach undertones with a very creamy texture, a touch sheer. It doesn’t seem like a terribly unique color, but on the other hand, I find it quite wearable because of its consistency and coloring. It’s not cool, or even that warm, so it could work well with most complexions. Ruling Class is a frosty pinkish brown lipstick with a lot of shimmer; I’d probably have to tone done the frost by adding some sort of gloss. Splendid! is a lovely bright medium pink with white-gold shimmer, fairly opaque for a lipglass. 3 Tan Lips High Tea a very sheer, light nude beige lipstick with soft gold shimmer. I think this was a holy grail lipstick for a lot of ladies, so it’s nice to see it in a set. Haughty is a darker warm brown with subtle gold reflects with good color pay off and very creamy. Lovely for darker complexions, for sure, but I’m not sure how well fair ladies will find it to be. I think with Honorable lipglass on top it would be much more universally wearable! Honorable is a shimmery white with pink undertones lipglass with high shimmer. 3 Pink Lips Snob Appeal is an incredibly frosty pink and gold lipstick; it’s like a lighter Cockatease, but I think it might be even frostier. Blueblood is a softer medium pink, which is quite frosty, and it seems like it has less reflects and more of an all over shimmer. Gentility is such a pretty lipglass, with its soft gold, high sheen finish. Each set is $32.00 U.S. / $42.00 CDN.

Latest Collections Nov 14, 2007 November 14, 2007 This fall, the MAC AIDS Fund is marking a momentous milestone – $100 million raised to help fight HIV and AIDS around the world. The money represents the sale, over the past 13 years, of more than 7.1 million VIVA GLAM lip products of which 100 per cent of the sale price has gone to the work of the Fund. Our $100 million landmark has been reached with enormous commitment from our VIVA GLAM spokespeople, MAC makeup artists and dedicated customers, said MAC AIDS Fund Executive Director, Nancy Mahon. The only thing more exciting about reaching this milestone is the prospect of setting and reaching our next fundraising goal and continuing our grant-making and partnerships around the world. Helping to drive fundraising for the MAC AIDS Fund have been a cadre of celebrity spokespeople. Each connected with a specific shade of VIVA GLAM Lipstick, these 16 spokespeople have made public appearances and appeared in advertisements over the last 13 years to raise money and awareness for the fight against HIV and AIDS. The inaugural VIVA GLAM spokesperson was performer, RuPaul. Since then, others have joined the ranks, including k.d. lang, Mary J. Blige, Sir Elton John, Shirley Manson, Lil’ Kim, Missy Elliott, Boy George, Linda Evangelista, Chlo Sevigny, Christina Aguilera, Pamela Anderson, Debbie Harry and Lisa Marie Presley. Currently the face of the MAC AIDS Fund is R&B artist, Eve and burlesque star, Dita Von Teese. The celebrities who have joined us over the years embody the spirit of MAC and the MAC AIDS Fund. Every Race, Every Sex, Every Age, said MAC AIDS Fund Chairman and MAC President, John Demsey. By bringing these new faces to VIVA GLAM, we have been able to keep not only the brand but the cause fresh for consumers, helping to drive the MAC AIDS Fund to new levels. Among the first fundraisers in the HIV/AIDS arena to develop a consumer-based giving model, the MAC AIDS Fund has worked to replicate a firsts model throughout its grant-making. It is among the early funders of sometimes-controversial programs, like prevention education for sex workers in India and needle exchanges for street youth in Russia. ABOUT THE MAC AIDS FUND The MAC AIDS Fund, the heart and soul of MAC Cosmetics, was established in 1994 to support men, women and children affected by HIV/AIDS globally. MAF is a pioneer in HIV/AIDS funding, providing financial support to organizations working with underserved regions and populations. As the largest corporate nonpharmceutical giver in the arena, MAF strives to raise awareness of four key issues in the fight against HIV/AIDS: prevention, the link between poverty and HIV/AIDS, access to care, and adherence to medications and treatments. To date MAF has raised $100 million (U.S.) exclusively through the sale of MAC’s VIVA GLAM Lipstick and Lipglass, donating 100 per cent of the sale price to fight HIV/AIDS.

Louise Zizzo created this retro-glam look that puts an emphasis on a large, natural brow (which she totally fauxed on some models by using mascara or Blacktrack fluidline) paired with a plump red lip using Mahogany lip liner nearly all over the lips and then Russian Red lipstick on top. One side of the tent were all the MAC artists dealing with creating all the fabulous runway looks, while on the opposite side were hair stylists creating fabulous dos. Louise managed to catch herself in this shot, but you can see just how crowded backstage can be when everything is done in a small tent on the sidewalk of San Francisco! A veritable feast for any true MAC-aholic, as four or five long tables were covered with a decadent display of every MAC product you could possibly wish for. Here is a model sporting one of the looks for Pink Elf. Victor Cembellin was responsible for the creation of this look, and he accomplished this by doing a strong smokey eye using Graphito paint, Blacktrack fluidline, and Smolder eye kohl. He paired it with a great neutral lip using Illicit lipglass and cheeks with golden bronzer. This next set of photos are taking you through the process of a demonstration of a look by Louise Zizzo so that her team of 4-5 MAC makeup artists could recreate it on their own models for the show. The model shown here is Alexa, who had enviable natural brows. Louise mentioned that it was very, very important for the skin to look absolutely flawless, and as a result, she spent a good amount of time showing the ways to blend and perfect the model’s complexion so that when she was on the runway, it would come off nearly plastic in its perfection. If only you and I had that kind of time (and skills!) to accomplish such absolutely divine skin. Louise used a mixture of studio select concealer/coverup, as well as various shades of Studio Fix Fluid. Louise did a dramatic eye for this particular designer, and she takes a generous amount of Blacktrack fluidline to cover the entire lid and just above the crease, and then a gentle wing on the side. Using an angled brush, the 266, she accomplishes such detailing as seen here. I was totally reminded of the black smokey eye that I do using Blacktrack as a base, actually! Surprisingly, despite how bold this makeup appears here in this shot, on the runway it is hardly noticeable. Check out that palette Louise is creating on her own hand. You can see the various colors of foundations and skin products that she used to give the model’s skin such clarity. Louise makes sure that her shape is flawless and that both eyes are about as even as she can get with the naked eye. What, I didn’t mention it already? Oh, Louise created this look of pure Blacktrack-ladened lid with a splash of thick, double liner in three different shades of liquidlast liner (pink, green, and purple). The whole theme of the look was icy, ice princess, ice queen. She chose green for this particular model. It’s the magical 266 again, look how precise that line is! Sigh, so jealous. To add further drama, Louise put false lashes on both the top and the bottom lash lines. She also doled out a great tip – if you have trouble putting on false lashes, try cutting them into thirds and attaching each third by third. Here’s the finished eye look! Louise used Pink cream colour base on the cheeks and the lips, with Hush cream colour base to highlight. Pink cream colour base is a PRO only color, and you can see how it matches perfectly with the ice princess theme. Here is the completely finished look! And see how dramatic it is with the eyes closed? I’m still totally marvelling at the definition of those shapes. A quick snap shot of the look Victor did for the Vian Hunter line using Silver (metal) pigment on lid and Blacktrack fluidline to create the defined crease. Christine (makeup artist), two models, and Louise Z. posing for photographers. Still posing, as you can see, right next to the runway, behind the curtain. Kind of crazy, huh? Christine on her knees moisturizing one of the model’s legs, but really, check out those HEELS? My feet hurt just looking at them! Back in the dressing room, models chit chat and get ready while Victor does last minute touch ups. I swear, the dressing room was about as big as my own closet back at my parents’ house when I lived there. It was quite tiny! So that concludes my little photo-experiment-journal from Backstage at San Francisco Fashion Week 2007. I had SUCH a blast, and it was an amazing opportunity (so glad I was able to take it, too). I meant several other beauty bloggers, like Karen, and it was awesome to see professional makeup artists working in their element. For photos of the actual fashion show, check out this post .

['2007-09-11 00:00:00'],"['New York Fashion Week 2007 (Spring 2008) – MAC Backstage Day 7 zArchived Sep 11, 2007 September 11, 2007 LUCA LUCA Tom Pecheux was on a seventies supermodel tip but it wasn’t Lauren Hutton. “I have in mind the young Jerry Hall,” he described. When she was starting out, she had a babyface but the sophistication of a woman. That manifested in the idea of playing with colour, just as Pecheux did he does bright Parrot blue shadow on the eyelids, then covered the creases with a shimmery dark grey to give what he called true sophistication. There was an obvious lack of cheek colour, and the mouths were dabbed with N3 lipstick a putty-ish pink nude. The effect? A grown up in the eyes and a tender young girl in the mouth. Face — MAC Face and Body Foundation was applied all over the face. Blot Loose Powder was then dusted over skin with Brush # 136. Eyes — Sea Me, a blue-green M.A.C Shadestick was applied all over the lid and under the bottom lash line. Knight Divine Eye Shadow was then applied densely in the crease and faded out toward the brow for a subtly colorful eye. MAC Pro Lash in black was used for both top and bottom lashes. Lips — For a neutral mouth, Hug Me Lipstick was patted gently onto the lips. PHILOSOPHY DI FERRETTI The Philosophy show was a study in dark minimalism at least in the faces. While the clothes were perky stripes and checks, the face by Charlotte Tilbury was bare (except for concealer) but for soft and charcoal grey crescents painted under the eye. So instead of the south of France lushness we’ve been seeing all week, it was a dose of Italian modernity. NANETTE LEOPORE To complete Nanette Lepore’s inspiration of Picasso’ Mistresses, Polly Osmond channeled, well the look of a Picasso. So of course she did a heavy brow, clumpy spiky lashes achieved with rows of MAC lashes on the top and individuals on the bottom. A peachy cheek was followed by a juicy orange lip of Morange lipstick with lip conditioner added. It was absolutely Andalusian. Think Guernica hanging in the Prado. Face — The face was primed with Face and Body Foundation to even out the skin. Select Moisture Cover was applied under the eyes and evenly over skin. Pleasureful and Lady Blushcremes were applied gently the cheeks. Eyes — When Daryl Kerrigan says her collection is about body-conscious silhouettes, she’s not referring to bustier tops and form-fitting frocks. It’s about how everything feels on your body, she explained. In other words, her clothes are easy with a capital E: T-shirt dresses, drawstring vests, relaxed shorts and trousers, all to typical louche effect. Despite the sporty undercurrent pulsing throughout, Kerrigan managed to work in plenty of that rocker reference, from studs embellishing necklines, hems and sleeves to belt-like straps that crisscrossed low on the hips. When Daryl Kerrigan says her collection is about body-conscious silhouettes, she’s not referring to bustier tops and form-fitting frocks. It’s about how everything feel… Lips — MAC Morange Lipstick was mixed with Orange Dare Lipstick and applied with a #228 brush. Gloss Texture was layered on top for a soft, juicy look. CAROLINA HERRERA The Carolina woman is always very chic, but Diane Kendal made her eve a tad chicer, with a sophisticated minimalist face. The brows were filled in naturally, the eyes were glossed and shiny. But it was the mouth that was the standout. To go with Carolina’s fruity palette, the lips were dabbed with orange lipstick, then double dabbed with red in the centers of their mouths. Then a light wash of fuchsia was applied all over in a filmy layer the effect was a tangerine berry colour that was more like a Sex and the City cocktail colour, or the hue of a faded sunset, than a lipstick shade. Face – Moisture Cover Concealer was applied to face with #242 Brush and set with Loose Blot Powder to create a velvety texture. MAC Iridescent Powder in Silver Dusk was sprinkled onto the bridge of the nose and cheek bones for a highlight. Eyes – MAC Retrospeck Eye Shadow was applied to the entire lid. Boot Liquid Eye Liner was lightly wedged in between lashes for a thick lash line and Plush Lash Mascara in Black was used to coat top lashes. MAC Retrospeck Eye Shadow was applied to the entire lid. Lips – Orange Lip Mix was feathered onto lip with a Concealer Brush. MAC Pro Lipstick in Full Fuchsia and Mattene Lipstick in Classic Dame were then mixed and layered onto the center of the lip for an intense, burst of color. For a touch of shine, Clear Lip Glass was patted onto the lips.']",f39d6a483a747271a15264459ac6c2a6cfdcecb6,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/new-york-fashion-week-2007-spring-2008-mac-backstage-day-7/

In addition, MAC Cosmetics is releasing a very, very limited edition (1200 copies) BoomBox book, which is bound to become an extremely coveted collector’s item — how I wish I could get my hands on a copy! Keep reading for the official press release… The phenomenal Sunday night rollercoaster BoomBox collaborates with M.A.C Cosmetics to launch the BoomBox book at London Fashion Week in the only way they know how.”BoomBox is just downright good fun, born from a time when wine bar culture and shit uptight clubs prevailed in London; jumping around and falling over in EC1 came as a breath of fresh air.”– Katie Grand Editor-In-Chief POP MAGAZINEPublished by founder Richard Mortimer who started BoomBox in June 2006, he has invited friends and BoomBox regulars to contribute, namely resident photographer Alistair Allan’s carnival of carnage – featuring: Agyness Deyn, Gareth Pugh, Jeremy Scott, Henry Holland, Katie Grand, Pat McGrath, Wolfgang Tillmans, Chris Cunningham, Kelly Osbourne, and many more – whose cult dirtydirtydancing.com site reminded you how you looked the night before, when you could never remember the morning after, as well as written work by: Paul Flynn, Charlie Porter, Hanna Hanra, Katie Grand, and Lauren Cochrane. A black and white photographic portfolio by Johnnie Shand Kydd offers vital portraiture, while Katherine Hamnett1s blurry vision soft-focuses on some questionable regions, and contribution from foxy queen of downtown erotica Ellen Cantor; Wolfgang Tillmans imagery is so real you’ll wonder why you’re not sweating like his subjects.“I spoke to Wolfgang and, as a regular at the club, felt that he would be perfect to document the club. I was excited by his approach to the project and his unique interpretation of the night. He came down to the club on several occasions to shoot, and we are both extremely happy with the resulting images.” — Richard Mortimer Founder BoomBoxFashion is part of the DNA of M.A.C, inspiring their artists and products worldwide. They were the obvious sponsor for the book, which bursts with colour, and raw creativity at source, dripping in full throttle visual artistry and smudged shadow, coloured paper helmets fashioned that night, MC Hammer-style sequin harem pants, and regulars living such a fabulous life that Monday morning doesn’t even figure on their schedule.”BoomBox has initiated an incredible cultural movement in the most irreverent manner that marries music, fashion and makeup.

What’s the problem? I think the problem is I never have a very long list of wants, but mostly that’s a result of the fact that I don’t ask my friends or family to purchase beauty products for me as gifts. It took me a bit of deliberation, but I think I will ask my parents for a “designer” coat, which I fully blame my wanting on Karen , because if I wasn’t a regular reader of her blog, I would have totally never seen this coat.

I played with the Pink Raspberry Face Palette; Pink Raspberry and Wild Raspberry lip crayons; and Black Raspberry lip sheer. Pink Raspberry Face Palette is a palette meant for more subdued looks, because Navajo is a light white-gold shadow with soft shimmer, while Fog is a deeper, smoky charcoal-gray with light shimmer as well. They both feel more semi-matte to me than anything; they’re definitely not frosty or over-the-top, so they’re perfect for just about anyone. The Pink Raspberry blush is a bright medium pink that will need a light hand when applying it, because it is easy to go overboard. I adore both of the lip sheers for their soft, pink-berry hues; knowing that they are meant to be sheer, I was not disappointing with their opacity. I found that Raspberry was a deeper berry with pink undertones whereas Blue Raspberry was definitely a cooler, sheer pink. Black Raspberry lip sheer is a berry-brown with more color than the lip sheers included in the palette, which makes it a nice alternative to those with more pigmented lips. Both Pink Raspberry (warm pink with berry undertones) and Wild Raspberry (gorgeous brighter red-berry) lip crayons felt so glossy and smooth when applied. They’re kind of like jumbo lip pencils, which means they’re great as liners, glosses, or lipsticks–my kind of tool!

['2007-09-24 00:00:00'],"['MAC Cosmetics – New Lashes & Interview with Christina Smith (Lash designer!) Latest Collections Sep 24, 2007 September 24, 2007 MAC COSMETICS LAUNCHES NEW LASHES CREATED BY CELEBRITY MAKE-UP ARTIST AND LASH DESIGNER CHRISTINA SMITH Lashes have reached a whole new level No longer are lashes just for special nights out or glamorous events, they have become an everyday staple being worn by women of all ages. This fall, MAC takes Lashes to the extreme whether it’s a natural effect or a more dramatic look you want, it’s easily achieved with the re-launch of MAC Lashes. Acclaimed celebrity lash designer Christina Smith who has designed custom lashes for Hollywood leading ladies including Liza Minnelli, Kate Hudson, Hayden Panettiere and Gisele Bundchen, created 11 exclusive Lash styles with original, new features and streamlined packaging. NEW LASH FEATURES AND BENEFITS: Color – MAC Lashes have a unique blend of black and brown natural hairs, so they blend more naturally with your own lashes. Great for even the fairest of lashes. Clear Band – MAC Lashes feature a ground-breaking thin, clear band for easy application and flexibility. Lashes can move, bend and blend. Shorter Width – Say goodbye to trimming false lashes to fit. MAC’s newly designed Lashes have a shorter width, so they fit comfortably to the length of your natural lash line. Intentional Imperfection – No two lashes are the same or perfectly symmetrical. MAC created intentional imperfections in each lash design to create a more natural effect. NEW LASH PACKAGING : The new MAC Lashes are packaged in a unique white tray that holds the lashes around a circular post. The post is used for ease of identification, with the left lash on the left side, and the right lash on the right. The white inner tray slides into a clear outer case and locks into place for secure portability. In addition to beautifully displaying the lashes, the new case also allows for easy storage and reuse. LASH CARE : MAC Lashes will last through approximately 3-6 wears , with proper care. When removing Lashes from packaging or the lash line, gently lift one end and peel off slowly and carefully to keep Lashes intact. Store lashes in a cool, dry area as humidity or warm temperatures (often found in the bathroom) may compromise the curl of the lash. Christina Smith Questions & Answers M.A.C Lashes Q: Why do you feel lashes are an important part of a women’s regime? A: Lashes create fullness, evoke sexiness, and can be used in many capacities. They open the eyes, and frame the eyes, they can create an emotion or mood depending on the style worn and most importantly they can positively affect someone’s confidence. Keep reading to see the rest of the interview with Miss Christina Smith, plus learn more about the new lashes available! Q: Why did you collaborate with MAC to develop a new Lash Collection? A : First and foremost, lashes are fabulous! Everyone should have access to buy, wear and enjoy lashes. You can change the entire look of someone by simply adding a great pair of lashes. Part of the success of my business is largely due to the fact that I make the only handmade, made-to-order lashes in the industry, which explains why a large portion of my clients are celebrities. As you can imagine making custom lashes takes time and energy, which can result in them being a little pricey. It was important for me to work with a cosmetics brand that cares about their professional clientele as well as their customers, and by working with M.A.C, we were able to take all the design elements that I use in the creation of my custom lashes, and make an entire collection that is affordable; unique and wearable for everyone. Q: What are the special features and benefits that make these lashes different from other lashes on the market? A : False lashes look best when they blend with your existing lashes and lash line. When developing the collection, we implemented the following characteristics throughout all the lash designs: Intentional Imperfection: lashes are not perfectly symmetrical. We created intentional imperfections in each lash design to create a more natural effect. Shorter Width: to provide a more custom fit to the inner corner of the eye the lashes have a shorter width, so they fit comfortably to the length of your natural lash line. Clear Band: the lashes include a clear, flexible and uber thin band for ease of application and blending with the natural lash line Color: Black and brown hair is blended into each lash so they blend with your own lashes for the most natural effect. Q: Please walk us through the steps for applying false lashes? Step One : Hold a mirror below your chin, look down into the mirror, so that your eyelid is fully extended. Step Two : Apply a thin amount of Eyelash Adhesive evenly to the lash band. Step Three : Let the adhesive dry for about 30 seconds, until it becomes sticky, and not wet. Step Four : Affix lash on top of your own lash line. Use an orange stick to push the lash securely onto your last line. Let dry for a few seconds. Note : I recommend curling and applying mascara to your own lash before applying the false lashes. Q: How do you care for M.A.C lashes? A : If cared for properly, MAC lashes will last approximately 3-6 wears. When removing lashes from packaging or the lash line, gently lift one end and peel off slowly and carefully to keep lashes intact. Store lashes in a cool, dry area as humidity or warm temperatures (often found in the bathroom) may compromise the curl of the lash. Be sure to peel off the old glue completely before you use them again.

['2007-12-19 00:00:00'],"['MAC Cosmetics – The Originals Review, Product Swatches Reviews Dec 19, 2007 December 19, 2007 Overall, I enjoyed this collection enough that I found several products interesting enough to purchase. I felt like the lipsticks and lipglasses turned out to be my favorites, but I have been on a bit of lip kick lately. I really loved Back to Del Rio, Rozz Revival, Supersequin, and Utter Pervette! The glosses were all lovely, but of course I was attracted to both Avarice and Real Desire–two shades I would rarely wear. Nico Now is gorgeous and I think will be popular with most as it is quite the universal shade. Surprisingly, I found that I adored Daisychain and Ochre Style out of the eyeshadows–if we didn’t have Smoke Signals come out, I would love Charred and Clue, too. Parrot is as to be expected; I can’t see any difference myself from the original formulation. The pigments are all permanent, but they at least selected three shades that rock (Golden Olive, Melon, and Violet). The reflects glitters are to die for, but you should have already known that as I covered them in their entirety from my PRO store haul! Antique Gold is the must-get, if you like playing with color; Very Pink is a great glitter to use on cheeks and lips, though. The collection offers something to everyone, even if addicts had expected their favorite hard-to-find products. Don’t knock it ’til you swatch it! For an in-depth review of individual products and shades, plus additional swatches… LIPSTICK Rozz Revival is a hot, bright watermelon pink with no sheerness to it, so it’s really quite bold. This is one everybody has been a bit excited over, and I can see why – it’s a lovely shade of a deep coral-orange-red with slick texture (go high sheen). Chintz on Chintz is a sheer, warm chocolate brown – great for ladies of color, for sure. Too dark for me on its own (definitely would need a lipglass to lighten it up), but you’d be surprised what you can mix it to make it an awesome shade on you. I think I own the original Chintz! Utter Pervette is such a lovely sheer, frosty cool pink shade. It has plenty of shimmer in it, though, so those who are wary of frost may want to skip this one. This one is excellent for spring! Back to Del Rio is one of my favorites! It is a subtly wine-berry with brown undertones and gold shimmer. It’s just this shade that’s dark, yet not at all bold and so wearable on an everyday basis. Nouveau-Frou is the sheerest of the bunch, and it is a pale lavender with gold shimmer. This is the most passable one, only because it wouldn’t show up well on me or anyone with pigmented lips whatsoever. Retrofluid is a deeper brown than Chintz on Chintz with purple and gold reflects. I’d really love to see this on darker skintones! Supersequin is probably my favorite, because it’s a gorgeous semi-frosty medium pink. It’s warmer rather than cooler, and I love the gold shimmer. I am reminded of one of the lipsticks from the Finery sets, though – I want to say Blueblood. Twig-Twig is completely contrary in color to the description. I honestly don’t see much brown in it at all! I am pretty certain it is Twig Twig (I swatch in alphabetical order so I *don’t* forget, ha!), too. It’s lovely, though. It’s very much like Supersequin, only cooler and with purple undertones. It is a relatively frosty look, not as much a silky lustre like Back to Del Rio. Sandy B is a lovely shade of light neutral-pink, sheer enough that it starts out light but it can be built up. This is a permanent shade already. Russian Red is a bright, bold matte red with blue undertones. It’s part of the permanent of the line. LIPGLASS Full on Lust is a gorgeous opaque watermelon pink hue with gold shimmer in it; this is totally the one that matches Rozz Revival, though it’s much subtler. Avarice is a rich orange-red with gold reflects, very deep and bold. Real Desire is the darkest of the five, and it is a really rich burnt red-burgundy with red reflects. Nico Now is a lovely shade of purple with pink hues with lots of shimmer. I think this is my personal favorite, even though it’s not insanely original. It’s just quite pretty. C-Thru is a white-neutral gloss with soft white shimmer that goes on fairly sheerly, though it will lighten up any dark lipstick for sure (take that, brown lipsticks! I’ll wear you yet!). EYE SHADOW Daisychain is actually one of my top picks from the nine shadows, because it will be the most gorgeous highlighter! I am such a sucker for white-gold colors with touches of shimmer. It is as if Nylon lost half of its shimmer and got a better finish. Ochre Style is another top pick, because it is this lovely shade of a brown-gold with gold shimmer. It reminds me of Juiced in the texture and feel, but the color is more wearable on most people (Juiced can make some look sallow). It is up my alley — when have I resisted a gold? A Little Folie is a warm, matte chocolate brown. I think this would make an excellent crease color (kind of like Soft Brown is a great choice) for warmer neutral looks. Memorabilia is a luxe dark purple with a matte texture. I found the formulation of this matte to be incredibly workable. It is not like mattes of the past, nor is it like Matte2s; I like this, and I think the shade is great for spicing up holiday looks. Clue is a shimmery gray-blue color – much prettier to the actual eye than the camera lens. I kept thinking Clue would be much bluer for some reason. As to the texture, it reminds me of the shimmer of Black Tied, with better color pay off. Alum is a mid-tone gray in a satin finish, so it has very subtle shimmer – perfect for older lids as well as any smoky eye with a lighter twist on it. Charred is a rich, charcoal gray-black with plenty of shimmery particles. It is a lovely color that would make for gorgeous smoky eyes. Again, like Clue, the amount of shimmer is similar to Black Tied, but you get more color than you do with Black Tied. Frisco is a soft, pastel pink in a matte finish; it is a little bit chalky, but not much. It’s one of those afterthoughts you have and makes you go, “Hmm,” since you’re not quite sure. I am reminded of the shade I wanted Pink Venus to be, if it didn’t have shimmer. It’s nice to see this pink added to the MAC line up (though it is close to Pen ‘N’ Pink from Matte2). Parrot is exactly as I remember it being. I have owned Parrot in three forms (including it as Kicky Blue) over my time as a MAC fan, and I never end up keeping it. It is a gorgeous color, but I never felt like, “Wow! This is worth $40!” I would suggest picking this up purely out of the addict-factor, which means this is sure to sell out quickly. It is also the boldest, brightest eyeshadow from the collection, which is also a big pull. But yes, I found the texture and color to be nearly identical to the original (I no longer own it, otherwise I’d have compared the two!). PIGMENT Kitschmas is a bright pastel purple with high sheen and frost-factor; and it is constantly being repromoted. All of the pigments are permanent to the MAC line, so there is no reason to jump out and get them all. Violet is one of my favorite pigments, because it has such great intensity in its purple hue. Melon makes an excellent summer blush and highlighter, because it is a great shade of gold-peach. Golden Olive is a delicious shade of olive green with gold sheen (the same really does ring true!). If you love green eyed looks, you must have this! Steel Blue is a subtle dark blue with chunks of gold glitter particles – it has a chunky texture compared to Melon or Golden Olive; it is chunkier than Kitschmas, from my experience. GLITTER — Check out my swatches from the PRO store for better pictures here . Reflects Blackened Red is a glittery deep red-brown with red reflects. In my other post, this is the one listed as “Charred Red” (because I spaced on the name and didn’t check, bad me). When they say blackened, it’s more like a burnt reddish brown – it’s not black. Reflects Very Pink is a medium pink with lots of light pink glitter reflects. This makes an excellent color for lips – just mix it with any gloss (including clear) to make a pout stand out. Reflects Transparent Teal is a glittery white base with small particles that reflect a tealish-green light. Great for body glitter! Reflects Antique Gold is my absolute favorite out of the four reflects glitters launched in this collection. It is such a gorgeous mixture of gold, brown, and antique gold that results in the most lovely shade. I bet you wouldn’t think of it, but you can rock this as a lip color or mixed with a red gloss!

['2007-10-29 00:00:00'],"['Interview with Toya Smith Marshall Freelance Make Up Artist zArchived Oct 29, 2007 October 29, 2007 Temptalia had the pleasure of interviewing Toya Smith Marshall , aged 29, who works as a freelance artist with her own company Makeda Make-Up Artistry . She’s been working as an artist for three and a half years, and she works in the Baltimore/Washington D.C. area. She is a graduate of the Von Lee International School of Aesthetics. Toya also runs her own beauty blog, The Life of a Ladybug , which makes for a great morning read. Temptalia: What surprises you most about working as a makeup artist? Toya: How stressful it can be! You haven’t seen pressure until you’re faced with an anxious, nervous bride and her 11 bridesmaids who all have different ideas on how you should make them look beautiful! Temptalia: What’s your favorite way to achieve the perfect natural look? Toya: The perfect natural look is different for everyone, but, by and large, concealer only where you need it (usually under the eyes and around the nose), a dusting of powder, some highlight under the brow and on the cheekbones, a healthy pop of blush (peachy-pink is a great color for most, but on women of darker hue, a saturated apricot or darker orangy-red works well), and sheer glossy lips. Carmindy got it just right and I love her book, The 5 Minute Face – every woman who seeks the “natural look” should buy it! Temptalia: What feature do you love to accentuate? Toya: Again, each woman is different. I really look at a client to see what feature stands out. For some women, it’s the lips – beautiful, full lips should be played up with gloss. For women with quite expressive eyes, experimenting with shadows that bring out the color of the eyes and adding false lashes or lots of mascara is interesting and fun. For women with round, youthful faces, adding a bright color to the apples of the cheeks accentuates that healthy, young look. Temptalia: Do you love working any specific brands or lines? Toya: Well, I’ve been a MAChead for quite a while. But I don’t just stick to MAC. That’s part of why I became a freelance artist, rather than work for a particular brand. I have products I love from all across the beauty brand continuum and I want to use them all! Besides MAC, I love NARS’ blushes, CARGO’s blushes and bronzers, Bobbi Brown, KLS, Stila, Laura Mercier, Mally Beauty, L’Oreal … the list goes on and on. Temptalia: What are three important skills required to be a makeup artist? Toya: Patience, creativity and a sense of whimsy. You have to be able to call up unbelievable patience when you are faced with a client who may not see or understand your vision – you have to be willing to explain your ideas and also understand that make-up is a very personal thing – your idea of beauty may not gel with the client’s and that’s okay. It is our job as artists to not only get our vision across, but also to make our client feel her most beautiful *and* comfortable. You have to be creative enough to be able to interpret the trends without becoming a slave to them. And, most of all, you have to have fun! This is just make-up, not brain surgery. It’s not meant to be serious. You have to be open to having new ideas occur and come through – that’s how trends are started and how great artists are made, I think. Temptalia: Could you share your three beauty tips you could not live without? Toya: 1) Highlight your cheekbones and brow bones. This gives your skin such radiant beauty. 2) Find the perfect concealer for your needs and skin type/color. Concealer is what makes me presentable on the worst of days. It’ll change your life! 3) Wear blush – every day! It wakes up your face and makes you look fresh and healthy, even when you’re dog tired. Temptalia: What’s the best part about running your beauty blog AND being a makeup artist? Toya: Having practical experience on a wide range of women. I think it gives me a unique perspective. I test products, not just on myself, but on other women, so I know what works and what doesn’t.']",f842bc4c37876fcbb564bcbf5a4215ae0ad7d11f,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/interview-with-toya-smith-marshall-freelance-make-up-artist/

['2007-02-17 00:00:00'],"['Tutorial – Black Smokey Eye Tutorials Feb 17, 2007 February 17, 2007 Silver/gray smokey eyes video tutorial! For a soft, gray smoky eye, check out this tutorial instead. The following tutorial is for a very dramatic smokey eye that is basically black. It is considered sultry, sexy, and some might refer to it as the “Victoria Secret Model” look. You will need the following products: a matte black base (Blacktrack fluidline), a matte black powder eyeshadow (Carbon eyeshadow), a matte highlight that’s similar to your skintone (Performance eyeshadow), another matte highlight that’s similar to your skintone, but darker than the one before (Malt eyeshadow), a black eye kohl (Graphblack technakohl, Blacktrack fluidline) and [optionally] a shimmery silver or black eyeshadow if you want a shimmery look (Silver Ring eyeshadow). You will need the following tools: a separate brush or sponge-tip applicator to use with the black base (like the 252), a blending brush for the black shadow (cheap Target brush), and a blending brush for the highlight colors (Philosophy blending brush). To clean up fall-out, using a cosmetic remover wipe works best and is easiest to quickly eradicate the black fall out underneath the eyes. Using a firm, flat brush, pick up just a dab of Blacktrack fluidline. This is all we are going to use for one entire eye, and yes, it will really be enough. A little goes a long way, and it is better to start small and add as required rather than deal with an overabundance of product! Begin applying Blacktrack fluidline as your base on the inner portion of your lid. You want to place the brush as pictured and pull the color upwards and outwards to begin covering the lower part of your lid. You want to make sure you establish some sort of shape, whatever your preference in. I prefer something similar to the curvature of my natural eye. Do your best to make it fairly curved, but it does not have to be perfect – a few imperfections will disappear through the process. You have applied most of the product initially on the brush, and you will spend the next few steps spreading it out by pulling the color upward and outward from the middle portion of your lower lid. Continue covering your lid in Blacktrack fluidline by making sure to color your outer lid as well. Pulling the color upwards and outwards will cause the color to look faded and streaky. This occurs and is expected, but is easily remedied by simply brushing downwards once you have pulled the color the appropriate height. You can also gently pat the color back into a smoother place. This is the positioning of your brush when you are patting color into place or if you wanted to pull your brush downwards to ensure a flat surface, rather than a streaky one, as mentioned in the previous step. This is what your finished product should look like. Using a separate blending brush, pick up Carbon eyeshadow. You may need to return and pick up more of the black shadow as you work on the look. In a similar fashion as applying the base, start packing on Carbon eyeshadow all over the black portion of your lid. You want to make sure you get the shadow on all of your base, because it helps the eyeshadow and the base to set. You want to go all the way to the edges, and if you go over, that’s perfectly okay! Keep your brush at this angle as you apply Carbon eyeshadow to the outer edge of the base. This will help you be more precise with application and keep you in the same line as the base itself. To help soften some of the line, gently swish your brush back and forth over the outer edge. It will take a few times before you see the edge soften. Do not spend forever doing this, because we will help soften the edge further using our highlights. Using a separate brush for the highlighter colors, pick up Performance eyeshadow with your brush. Apply Performance eyeshadow directly underneath your brow onto your browbone. You want to place it towards the inner portion of your brow. Gently slide your brush over the space beneath your eyebrow as you make your way towards the outer portion of the brow. You can choose to continue using Performance eyeshadow, or you can use a slightly darker color like Malt eyeshadow. Keeping the brush at the pictured angle, cover the very outermost edge of black with Malt eyeshadow. Do not worry about all the fall out on the black eyeshadow – it is such a cinch to fix. Gently brush the black shadow into the highlighter colors to help soften the harsh edge of black. Using the brush you used to apply Carbon eyeshadow, hold it horizontally against your lid, along the outer portion of the black shadow and brush upwards and outwards, to help create a gray area that creates a gradient of black to highlight. Gently swish the brush along the curve of the outermost edge of the black shadow. This is what you should have when the eye is closed. This is what you should have when the eye is open. I prefer the shadow to go higher, so I am using my brush from applying Carbon to help heighten the black portion of the shadow by repeating the previous steps. Similarly acting out the steps before, only this time increasing the amount of black space. Using the brush you used to apply Carbon eyeshadow, pick up a touch of the black shadow and hold your brush horizontally against your outer lower lash line. Gently dab the brush against the outermost portion of your lower lash line and then carefully move it towards the inside of your lash line, but ensure that you stop one third to one half of the way. This is what it should look like. You can clean up as you go, or you can clean up when you are finished (there is a fairly prominent stray black line underneath the lower lash line that will be cleaned up). I find that kohl pencil liners are easy to use, but Blacktrack fluidline is fabulous for staying on the waterline. Both Graphblack technakohl and Blacktrack fluidline will give the same dark, black liner, though. I take my technakohl and dip the tip into Blacktrack fluidline, just to get a touch of the fluidline. I apply the fluidline I had picked up with the technakohl liner by starting in the middle of my lower lash line and moving outwards in both directions, continually sliding back and forth over my lower lash line and lower waterline. Add mascara of your choice, curl lashes if desired, and your eyes are finished. To complete the look, minimize focus on cheeks and lips by using a light-handed blush like Pearl Sunshine beauty powder and a deeper contouring color to dramatize features. Lips are best if left in either neutral or nude shades, but a slight pink or coral coloring will not destroy the look. If you wanted a shimmery black shadow look, then read the following four steps. Using your blending brush, pick up a shimmery black or silver eyeshadow like Black Tied eyeshadow or Silver Ring eyeshadow. Since I do not have Black Tied, I will be using Silver Ring. If you have a shimmery black shadow, you can simply apply that on top and you really do not need to do more. This is what it looks like after you’ve applied Silver Ring shadow. Using the brush you used to apply Carbon eyeshadow, pick up more of it and apply all over lid; make sure to cover the silver portions. This is what it should look like – a bit more shimmery than before. Alternately, you can use a shimmery base and a matte black shadow to achieve the same effect. For my typical shimmery smokey eye, I use Silver pigment as my base, which has plenty of shimmer in it.']",055dc130f9c6c1856848d7b880fc2894287126d9,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tutorial-black-smokey-eye/

['2007-10-02 00:00:00'],"['Make Up Tips – Temptalia’s Top 10 Makeup Tips Tutorials Oct 02, 2007 October 02, 2007 Last week I asked readers to give their three best makeup tips to beginners when it came to makeup. Now, I’m going to share my top ten make up tips I think are important for anyone at any level or skill. These are in no particular order! Accentuate your favorite features, and remember that focusing on one feature per look tends to achieve a better overall look. Doing dramatic eyes, cheeks, and lips can sometimes take away from beauty because it comes out overdone and perhaps even “clownish.” This is not to say you shouldn’t or you can’t do bold eyes and lips; it is more a word of caution when it comes to doing multiple focal points. Confidence is the most essential piece to what you wear out. Anybody can rock any color eyeshadow, blush, or lipstick/gloss as long as they have the confidence to back it up. Being comfortable in your makeup is vital, because the awkwardness or self-consciousness will definitely be picked up by others. So, honey, take that bright blue shadow you’ve been lusting over, but haven’t dared to wear, and pull it off by just realizing how amazingly beautiful you are and how much fun can be had with experimentation and trying colors that aren’t your norm. Looking polished is easily achieved by complimenting your makeup and not forgetting the parts of your face. Those with naturally fabulous skin can do well simply by moisturizing (and if you feel the need, a light powder or concealer), and others who have less-than-perfect skin have so many variations and formulas of foundation available to them to turn that skin into even, smooth, flawless-looking skin. Perfecting the skin can do wonders on your confidence, because so many of us fret over those teenage acne scars or the slight rosacea some of us have, and other various skin “flaws.” Sparse eyebrows are easily turned into glamorous sisters by gently filling them in. Lips are defined by lip liner and/or lipstick, or even a light gloss with only a hint of color to give off an image of lush puckers. Eyes can be enhanced with nothing but natural brown mascara, to lengthen and thicken lashes just slightly. Finding your natural or preferred brow shape is something that can brighten up your face without even putting on a single swipe of makeup. It’s important to maintain your eye brows once you’ve found the right shape to compliment your eyes as well as your face. I really do suggest having them shaped professional for the first time or two, and then you can do upkeep and maintenance of that particular shape. I personally made the mistake of having a friend do mine years ago, and it has taken me a good two to three years to get them to a decent shape! Experiment, experiment, experiment. I cannot say it enough. You will learn what kinds of techniques work for you, what shapes and colors you like the most on yourself, and how to have fun with being creative when it comes to makeup. When makeup is a chore, that is the first sign that you are not experimenting enough! Try things that are out of your comfort-zone; it isn’t as if you have to leave the house with whatever look you attempt. That’s one of the best aspects of makeup: it washes off. It’s not permanent. Try blue and orange and green together, try Russian Red lipstick. Just don’t be afraid to test the waters, because makeup can be an amazing outlet for all of your artistic inclinations. Take good care of your skin, because as mentioned earlier, skin is a piece of beauty that will always be a feature you want to accentuate regardless of where you are in life. Make sure to moisturize regularly, be religious when it comes to sunscreen usage, and take the time to thoroughly cleanse the skin at least once daily to remove the day’s dirt and grime (and makeup!). Also, one of the easiest ways to improve and maintain your skin is by drinking at least eight glasses of water a day. Tools and the quality of them can really make a difference in the application process. Quality tools do not necessarily mean high priced, high-end. There are reasonably priced alternatives, and it is a matter of looking around and being creative. Craft stores often carry brushes made for painting, and the kind of brushes you would use for makeup application will often be cheaper, but still good quality, than a high-end line’s similar brush. Also, Sonia Kashuk is a line found at Target that makes decent brushes for a price worth noting. Of course, high end brushes are often going to be better in quality, they are not necessary to have the skill and talent to do flawless makeup. Skills far outweigh brush quality in the end. It is important to wash your tools periodically, and more often for ones used for skin products or cream products to minimize bacteria growth and transference. Even using baby shampoo on brushes is an easy and cost-effective way to clean them. If you are just entering the world of beauty and makeup, don’t feel compelled to buy every product you see if your pocketbook does not allow it. Not everybody has a lot of disposable income to spend on makeup, and it is important to discover inexpensive products to supplement more expensive ones. Think of products like mascara, eyeliner, lip liner, etc. as accessories to good makeup, and think of a well pigmented eyeshadow or blush as a classic piece. Dress up those few classic pieces by using inexpensive accessories. Neutral eye shadows do not need as much pigmentation as does a bright pink eyeshadow, so going drugstore means you won’t necessarily sacrifice quality. Drugstore lines have come a long way, and there are comparable products to be found. Many drugstores also offer a return policy, even if you’ve used/open the product, which allows you to test and see what works (and what doesn’t). Beauty holds a different meaning for each person. Don’t be afraid to do your makeup the way you want to, the way you feel best accentuates your features and enhances your beauty. Think of all beauty “rules” more like guidelines as to what often works but doesn’t always work. Just like the tip that states that bold lips, cheeks, and eyes can be overwhelming is more of a guideline than an absolute “do not do this.” Breaking so-called beauty rules takes confidence — can you see how some of these tips really tie together? Criticism comes in many forms , some of them quite hurtful, and others with good intentions. Try to be receptive to criticism that means well, and try to let hurtful criticism roll off your back. We never stop learning in our lives, and the same can be said when it comes to beauty and makeup. Listen to what someone has to say, and try to see whether you agree, can see where they’re coming from, or if they’re crazy. For a long time, I focused on my eyes and forgot the rest of my face, and it took me awhile to see that people who told me to think about using blusher or lipgloss had good intentions, and now I love to use both.']",45cf03675b840bdb489fd4d7f4240dae65767a58,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/make-up-tips-temptalias-top-10-makeup-tips/

NARS describes this shade as “[a] shimmering, spicy pine named for the monsoon – natural and unpredictable … [i]t has richness and depth, yet allows for a surprising range of intensity.” They later describe the color as “silver sage.” Mousson is is an antique gold with a green tarnish and silver sparkle. It’s creamy, dries to a mostly powder finish fairly quickly (but not so fast you don’t have time to work with it), and I’ve found it fairly crease-resistant. I would say it’s much better and doesn’t crease easily when set with a powder base or layered over an eyeshadow base like Urban Decay Primer Potion or Too Faced Shadow Insurance . The shade itself is exactly something I’d wear and a color I’d feel compelled to own–you know me and (antique) golds! NARS’ Cream Eyeshadows aren’t my absolute favorite cream formula to work with ( Benefit’s are my current favorite), but I do like it. I just find it does have a slight tendency to crease if you apply too much or you don’t set it with an eyeshadow. For me, I rarely wear cream shadows alone anyway, so it’s not a big deal to use it in conjunction with powder eyeshadow. Bottom Line: For a fun, sparkly shade of antique gold with a green cast, Mousson might be something you’d like.

Last Minute Shopping Tips Gift cards are easy, no-fuss ways to get that last minute gift on-time. I know some loathe to give gift cards, but it’s always fun to pick out what you want later on. Tons of retailers offer e-gift cards, too, so you can still do it online and not hit the holiday madness at the mall! If you’re going out, GO EARLY! Malls are open bright and early this week, and probably next as well. I know mine opened at 8am everyday this week, and it truly is a ghost town at 8-9am. Think about other shops, too, like specialty grocery stores, stationary shops, etc. Gifts are everywhere, you just have to think about what kind of items you’re looking for and be inventive. Homemade gifts can be done in the next few days, and you won’t have to worry about expedited shipping, biting your nails wondering if FedEx is going to get to your door step on time (ahem). Try making your own ornaments, or a set, to give to a friend or family member. Craft stores sell tons of clear ornaments that you can fill with various decorative items, or toss in a photo or two of you and the giftee. Even a semi-homemade gift isn’t bad–fill up a basket with the giftee’s favorite foods and drinks, or splurge and get a fancy bottle of champagne or wine for them. Bake something delicious. Go for the gusto with a superb pastry that takes an hour or two in the kitchen. Or do what my boyfriend’s mother does: bake about twenty different holiday treats! She makes so many different desserts and cookies during the holidays, and then she makes goody bags for everyone she knows! IOUs may be frowned upon, but it can be done in a way where it isn’t the worst gift to be received. Try making a booklet of IOUs for your sweetie or even your mom. Make them like coupons so they can be redeemed; be creative and think of things the giftee might want done. Here are a few ideas: “Good for one back massage,” “Will wash dishes for a week,” “Good for one dinner out on me,” and “$100 shopping spree on me.” Share your last-minute shipping deals in the comments!

['2007-10-02 00:00:00'],"['MAC Cosmetics – Alexander McQueen Collection & Inspiration Latest Collections Oct 02, 2007 October 02, 2007 View Additional Product Photos MAC for McQueen is the culmination of the collaboration between celebrated designer Alexander McQueen, leading makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury, and MAC Cosmetics for the Alexander McQueen Autumn Winter 2007 show. The collection includes 16 products, 12 hand blended specifically for the AW 07 McQueen show by Terry Barber, MAC Cosmetics Director of Makeup Artistry and lead makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury just days before the show. The classic MAC Cosmetics packaging is stamped with the Alexander McQueen logo, as if plucked straight from the makeup artists table backstage. When we embarked on the packaging, I wanted to have the sense that these are really just imprints by Alexander McQueen, fresh, hot off the runway. They are meant to be direct from the runway and feeling on trend, says James Gager, Senior Vice President/Creative Director for MAC Cosmetics. Since 1996 MAC Cosmetics has worked with Alexander McQueen backstage by providing makeup and artistry support. â€œThe makeup for a show plays up certain elements of the clothing, changes the overall feeling, and mood. I work with the key artist, Charlotte in this case, to take the makeup in a certain direction, and discuss my original inspiration for the collection as well as the mood, theme, and focus for the show. This time inspiration was derived from Elizabeth Taylor in the 1963 film Cleopatra. The Egyptian influence plays up a very feminine sexual strength that was present in my inspiration for the collection, says Alexander McQueen. This marks the first time Alexander McQueen has partnered with a cosmetics company. Keep reading for detailed information about the Eyes and Lips, as well as collection information, on Alexander McQueen’s inspiration behind the collection. The Eye The look features a highly structured eye achieved with Kohl Power Eye Pencils, Paint Pots and Eye Shadows. Eye brows are drawn in Velvetone to create the stark handsome brow that frames the brightly pigmented lids and brow bone. Paint pots in colours created by Terry Barber and Charlotte Tilbury specifically for the AW 07 show range from Pharaoh a creamy yellow green, Otherworldly a mid-tone sea blue to Electro Sky an intense royal blue. Another dimension is added to the eye by layering eye shadows over the paint pots in matching shades designed specifically for this collection. Eyes are outlined with Kohl Power pencils in Jealous, Black Karat, and Feline. MAC 20 lashes reinforce the thickly lined eyes. â€œAlexander McQueen was very specific about the makeup direction and I translated his ideas of Egyptian, graphic, bold coloured makeup into a look that was strong yet hypnotic; which was very much in the spirit of the show, said key makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury. The Lip Custom created by Terry Barber and Charlotte Tilbury, Archetype and Masque lipstick, were used as a base layers with Nothingless, or White Magic Lipglass on top to create the soft pale lips. The Glow Mineralize Skinfinish in New Vegas was polished into the cheeks to give the final gilded touch to the look. A makeup artist favorite, MAC Mineralize Skinfinish gives skin a subtle glow, casting the slightest metallic hue over cheekbones. Four time winner of the British Designer of the Year award and 2003 CFDA International Designer of the Year, Alexander McQueen left school at 16 to begin an apprenticeship with several well known London tailors. His study of design and career in fashion grew as he moved on to work for theatrical costumiers, designers and completed his Master’s Degree at London’s St Martin’s in 1994. His entire degree collection was purchased by Isabella Blow, former Fashion editor of Tatler and famously eccentric matron of fashion. He is now one of the most internationally renowned fashion designers, known for incredible tailoring, pairing of the dark with the romantic and ingeniously theatrical runway shows. MAC Cosmetics expresses its support of the fashion world by working with makeup artists at over 160 shows during the international collections with the MAC PRO team behind the scenes in New York, London, Milan and Paris. MAC (Make-up Art Cosmetics), a leading brand of professional cosmetics, was created in Toronto, Canada in 1985 and is now part of The Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. The company’s popularity has grown through a tradition of word-of-mouth endorsement from makeup artists, models, photographers and journalists around the world.

Whole Body subivision about mineral makeup and natural cosmetics, which I thought might be interesting for some of you. I know mineral makeup is a great trend that’s been emerging in the beauty industry, and you can learn all about the basics and why you might want to make the switch with Jen Gaum from Mineral Fusion (Whole Foods’ makeup partner). The video is done in a makeover fashion, where there is a model that Jen applies makeup on from eyes to face, so it’s also a bit tutorial-esque, which makes it worth taking a look at even if you’re a mineralize makeup guru! As a great way to introduce customers to the world of mineralize makeup, Whole Foods as one awesome deal going on. Not only is it an amazing deal ($20 for $120 worth of products), a portion of the proceeds will be going towards the fight against breast cancer! For shoppers wanting to try mineral makeup, Whole Foods Market stores will carry an exclusive â€œfresh face starter kit’ by Mineral Fusion for $20 during the month of October (a $120.00 value), with a portion of the proceeds going to Pink United, a nonprofit organization that supports the fight against breast cancer.

It’s a vibrant red with a slight blue-base, but on me, it doesn’t run too cool and almost ends up neutral (not too blue, not too orange) on my lips. It has a matte finish, but it does have a slight sheen when applied. It’s creamy, applies opaque with ease, and it stays put for hours (partially due to the fact that it is a matte). Even though the finish is matte, it’s creamy enough not to be drying (which is a huge plus, as some of MAC’s mattes can be). This is really one of those shades that I feel must be tried at some point in your lifetime, whether you’re a fan of red lips or not!

Here’s the company’s philosophy: Principessa is dedicated to the art of pampering the urban princess. They leave out all those nasty fillers like mineral oils & petroleum products. Instead, these decadent products are made with sweet almond oil, shea butter, botanicals like aloe vera and peach extracts, and antioxidants vitamins E & C. Principessa Beauty products did not let me down in my try-out session with them. The first thing I noticed was there was the slightest scent to all of Principessa products, very subtle, which made me fall in love because it’s a lovely scent with a touch of sweetness, but not much at all. I love products with lighter scents for daily usage because then I can top my outfit off with a few spritzes of my favorite perfume without worrying about some crazy scent mix. I tried the Bellezza Box , which provides sample sizes of a wide range of their products. This will make a great holiday gift, because it’s a reasonable $45 and you receive 7 products in good sizes (these aren’t made for just one use, you get plenty of body-lovin’ goodness out of these!). I always enjoy a company that allows customers to try products in smaller sizes before committing to full-size products. Bacio Me — A cute tin of pink solid balm that melts slightly as you apply pressure from your fingertip into it to make it easy to put on your lips. It has plenty of shea butter and vitamin E, which helps to soften your lips. Bagno Bliss — A shower body cream that’s meant to give you a taste of how it feels to be treated like a princess at a spa, only for far less and in your own home. It really helps to soften skin all over, and all you have to do is add water! Massage gently into skin and voila. Candela-to-go — I’m not a huge candle person, just because I always forget about them (I have several around the house), but the tin is adorable with its pink and black motif. I imagine this would be a darling and easy-to-hide candle to take with you on a romantic getaway. It’s made out of 100% pure VegeSoy wax, too. Cattiva Diva — I have awfully dry hands sometimes, because I have a tendency to wash my hands far too many times throughout the day. What I liked about this hand cream is how lightweight it is; it’s not oily, heavy, and it dries in a matter of minutes so you can quickly go back to what you were doing. You don’t need too much to thoroughly moisturize your hands either, which is a great thing in my book — better value for your money! Dolce Dreams — Just like the hand cream, this product feels lush and rich during application, but as it softens the skin, it dries quickly and leaves you feeling fresh and smooth. Fresh Fiore — I love a good body wash! I also love the slight fragrant scent that lingers behind after using this cleanser. I was able to work up a good lather when using it, and afterwards, I had that “clean” feeling (who doesn’t love that?). Principessa pouf — Like I mentioned before, the Bellezza Box makes an excellent gift, because of how many products are in it, the reasonable price tag (totally get your money’s worth), and how self-contained it is. They even provide this adorable pink pouf to use with their products, like Fresh Fiore, to help exfoliate your skin.

The kit includes: mineral fusion’s signature Pressed Base in two different shades; the Luster Bronzer Duo, a duo bronzer with a sheen glow as well as a matte finish; Kabuki Brush ; and the Hydration Mist, a blend of antioxidant and anti-aging nutrients in an instantly hydrating mist. Luster Bronzer Duo I really loved the Luster Bronzer duo – it’s a combination of a dark bronze color (be light handed with it, it goes on with punch otherwise!) and a lighter warm golden powder. I found the lighter color made an excellent sunkissed cheek, which I love for quick mornings or days with little makeup. I thought the packaging for all the products was tantalizing, as everything came in sleek, thin compacts. I loved that the products were light, because I could easily toss one in my purse and go. And knowing Temptalia readers and how much some of them carry in their purses, lightweight is essential! I liked the finish of the products (matte), but I found the coverage to be too light for my personal taste. I think I’m more of a liquid girl when it comes to foundation, I suppose, and a pressed powder just isn’t enough for me. I know a reader mentioned the harshness of the kabuki brush, but I didn’t find it too harsh. The Hydration Mist is refreshing, but I think I’d probably end up using this more as the winter comes and my skin dries out a bit more. I wouldn’t imagine a mini kabuki at this price (plus all those other items) to compare to a more high-end kabuki brush. It is mini, so it gives you a bit more control and precision. All in all, for $20, this is really a bargain, and I think it is an excellent way to check out Mineral Fusion as a brand, as well as mineral makeup on the whole.

It is described as a “lightweight, long wearing luxe liquid formula” that is a self-setting foundation and powder in one. It sets to a soft velvet finish (very matte), which is quite dreamy. My skin feels softer than it normally does when properly moisturized! What do I look for a holy grail foundation? I want my complexion to look flawless, and I don’t care what it takes to make it look that way. If it means a dewy finish, I’m there; if it means no SPF, I’m down! I have found through experience that I have a definite preference for a foundation that sets or dries to a matte finish, has a high liquidity, provides light to medium coverage (preferably the ability to build from light to medium easily), and wears all day without requiring touch-ups. How does this one stand up? Very well. I honestly couldn’t feel the product on my face once it set (this product is designed to give you several minutes to add blush, contour, etc. before it sets), which is an absolute for me. I also love that it does have SPF 15 in it, because I’ve been using Napoleon Perdis’ Dream Cream beforehand, which doesn’t, and I just have to have SPF! Initially, I was shocked by how small the tube is, but when I looked at it by weight, (30ml), to discover it is the exact same amount in my usual foundation (MAC Studio Fix Fluid). However, this is a creamy foundation, not quite a liquid in my opinion, so you may use a touch more. Nonetheless, you do not need much for good coverage. The line comes in four colors – I was look 3, which only leaves one darker shade, two lighter ones. For a comparison point, I am a NC30 in MAC foundations. China Doll evened out my skintone subtly, and it looked very natural. It also photographed well, which is a concern to be noted for any foundation containing SPF (as it can reflect light at times). The foundation also lasts throughout the day with no need for repair – no melting or sliding off that I noted. I love that it is a foundation and powder in one, because I never bother using a powder to set, so I finally reap the benefits of it without changing up my routine! I used MAC’s 182 brush to apply this, sometimes gently spritzing the brush with water to thin out the foundation, and I enjoyed the results. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who’s been curious about China Doll or in need of a great lightweight foundation that finishes with a polished look.

Although some feel she should be wearing less, the look itself is still pretty. Begin by applying your base of choice (the cult favorite is Urban Decay’s Primer Potion ) all over your lid. Apply MAC’s Silver Ring eyeshadow to the inner lid with the 239 brush, while applying MAC’s Print eyeshadow to the outer lid. With the 224, lightly tap MAC’s Knight Divine eyeshadow into the crease, blending towards the outer lid. Using the 239, gently apply MAC’s Embark eyeshadow above the crease, blending upwards, letting it fade towards the brow. Highlight the brow with the 239 brush and Shroom eyeshadow, making sure to blend with the darker shadows to ensure a soft line, rather than a harsh one. Apply MAC’s Blacktrack fluidline with the 266 brush along the upper lash line. Forego lining the lower lash line, but instead add an extra coat or two of black mascara to the lower lashes (as well as to the upper lashes). We recommend MAC’s Studio Fix Fluid or Make Up Forever’s Mat+ Velvet liquid foundation. Using a concealer brush (194), dab on a touch of liquid foundation to cheeks, chin, forehead, and nose. Spritz a fluffy powder or buffer brush (129, 150, or 182) with a mist of water or Fix+, and then buff the foundation onto your face. Work your way outwards to ensure full coverage. Apply more dabs of foundation if you so require. Set with any loose powder if have oilier skin (or feel the need to) using a fluffy powder brush (129). Brighten up cheeks by using the 129 and picking up a small amount of Margin blush and dusting onto the apples of the cheeks. Blend outwards using the 129 brush, softly swirling it on the cheeks, and finish by buffing the color into skin with the 182. Keep lips looking subtle and glossy by applying MAC’s Pinkarat lustreglass to lips–skip the lipstick, just pump up your natural lip color. What do you think of this look?

It’s not really a blue-based red, nor an orange-based red–it’s truly one of those shades that works well on many skin tones. (Kind of like MAC’s Viva Glam I Lipstick!) It has a redder, richer look than VGI, plus it has the glossy sheen (though no shimmer). It applies opaque in just one layer, and it clings to lips without being drying. It holds up and wears for a good four or five hours and afterward, it does leave a slight stain behind. Definitely one of MAC’s must-haves! What about you? Would you wear this red? The Scarlet Season is a series of posts showcasing and featuring my favorite shades of red lips–from glosses to lipsticks that runs through December 2009.

My eyelids were a touch dry on the inner lid, and the mattes really enhanced that dryness. The same thing is true if you have drier skin and opt for a matte finish foundation; it doesn’t always go so well! Winter is being particularly brutal to my skin lately, but I imagine that has more to do with the fact that we’ve seen some below 50 temperatures here in California (hey, WE freeze at 50 degrees here!). Happy Friday! You will need the following… Eyes : Soft Ochre paint pot (neutral beige base), Blanc Type eyeshadow (matte white-beige), Malt eyeshadow (pinky-beige), Wedge eyeshadow (soft brown), Bisque eyeshadow (pink nude), Lancome Plum Tease Gel Artliner (plum), Urban Decay Rockstar 24/7 Liner (dark purple-plum), Plushlash mascara (black) Face : Kiehl’s Tinted Moisturizer (medium) Cheeks : Petalpoint blush (raspberry-pink), Dior Rose Diamond Skin Shimmer (icy rose highlighter) Lips : Giorgio Armani #600 Rouge d’Armani lipstick (fuchsia plum), Lancome Untamed Plum La Laque Fever (muted plum) Brushes : 266 (firm, angled brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 214 (smudge brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 129 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Petalpoint = Well-Dressed + Breath O’ Plum Directions: Apply Soft Ochre paint pot all over the lid as the base with the 249. On the inner and middle lid, apply Blanc Type eyeshadow on using the 239. Apply Malt eyeshadow to the middle and outer portions of the lid. Darken crease with Wedge eyeshadow using the 226. Sweep Bisque eyeshadow underneath the brow bone to highlight. Finish with Urban Decay Rockstar Liner on lower lash line, and Lancome Plum Tease Gel Artliner on the upper lash line using the 209.

Whether you’re traveling for a few days or a few weeks, by plane or car or foot, you’re going to want to bring a few items of beauty necessity along with you, right? Now, when you go by plane, it is important to observe the 3 oz or less rule for all liquids, and all liquids must fit within a quart-size clear, plastic bag. Otherwise, it’s about how much you want to carry.I remember the first time I traveled for a week after becoming a beauty junkie, and I also remebering lugging far too much through the airport (a whole carryon’s worth – this was pre-liquid restrictions). It is important consider what kind of makeup and how much of it you really need when traveling, but I also love travel-size sets for when you want to bring everything, but those big bottles just don’t do it for you.Here are some of my favorites (though all those holiday gift sets are also perfect for travel, most often, but hey, if you haven’t gotten your holiday loot yet, try these!): Philosophy “All-Stars” Travel Set is a perfect way to keep all your skincare organized and in mini-size. You’ll find Hope in a Jar, Hope in a Tube, Shear Splendor Shampoo, Shear Splendor Conditioner, and Kiss Me Red. Not a bad way to go for $35.00. Available at Nordstrom.com . Bobbi Brown Organizer is great for organizing what you do end up taking with you on your journey. I love that it has a brush holder as well as zipped up pouches. So all-in-one! $55.00. Available at Nordstrom.com . Bobbi brown Empties are amazing for taking travel-size portions of your full-size products. Reduce your traveling weight by filling these empties up with your favorite products! You should also be able to find empties at a local drugstore for about the same price. $10, available at Nordstrom.com . Lippmann ‘Three Times a Lady’ Nail Color Set is great because it has a good trio of colors that are occasion-friendly and easy to carry in their miniature size. $21, available at Nordstrom.com . Bobbi Brown Mini Tube Tints Set comes in four lovely colors: Champagne Glitter, Rosy, Baby Pink Glitter, and Burnt Sugar Shimmer. Cute and travel-friendly, we love! $28, available at Nordstrom.com .

['2006-12-03 00:00:00'],"['Brushes I Use Regularly – Details and Photos zArchived Dec 03, 2006 December 03, 2006 From left to right: 1. Benefit 05 2. Loew-Cornell 1/8 7400 Angular (craftstore) 3. Loew-Cornell 1/4 793 Angular Flat (craftstore)* 4. MAC 194SE 5. Philosophy “Shadow”* 6. MAC 190SE 7. [Unknown] Stiff, thick angle* 1. Benefit 05 Benefit 05 brush is ridiculously soft and versatile. It is softer than my MAC eye brushes, actually, and it picks up color easily. This used to be my all-time favorite brush to apply and blend eyeshadow with, and sadly, it is discontinued as far as I know. Occasionally I will use this brush when I am using black eyeshadow, so I do not dirty up my regular shadow brush (#5) Also, it can be used to pick up shadow along the edge to apply more precisely, especially on the lower lash line. 2. Loew-Cornell 1/8 7400 Angular (craftstore) Yes, I use craftstore brush. Why not? I’ve yet to hear a compelling reason to avoid using them; they can be substantially cheaper compared to high-end brushes. You can always spend a little extra for a higher quality craftstore brush, as well, and still be under budget in comparison to cosmetic line brushes. This brush is insanely small, stiff, and thin. It is for absolutely precise lining, and I primarily use this brush when applying MAC’s liquidlast liners. This allows for you to have a lot more control over where you are putting the liner than with the liquidlast’s applicator. 3. Loew-Cornell 1/4 793 Angular Flat (craftstore) I adore this brush. If you’ve wondered how I’ve managed to get my eyebrows not to look like they want to run away… This is one of the two tools that do it (#7 is the other). It has extremely soft bristles, but it is also quite firm, which is perfect when I go to pick up MAC’s Expresso eyeshadow to fill-in my eyebrows. I use this to refine the edge of my inner brow and to fill-in the thinner parts of my brow, including the “tail.” It is thin enough to be able to give me a fine line, but not so thin that I get a sharp line, it naturally pushes the color out so it looks more natural from the get-go. 4. MAC 194SE I have only recently accumulated this brush, and I personally do not have many uses for it. It is meant to apply concealer, and I have used it to build up foundation in certain spots. Usually I will take a dab of Studio Fix Fluid with this brush and place it on the problem area, blend it out just a tad, and finish up the blending process with MAC’s 187 (#14). 5. Philosophy “Shadow” Hands down, this is the most important brush in my daily makeup application routine. I apply all my dry eyeshadow products with this brush, and I also use this brush to blend everything together or as I go. It essentially performs all of the functions to bring together any eye look. It’s fluffy, but still has a touch of firmness so you can have control over what you’re doing with the brush. In terms of picking up color, this brush accomplishes it fairly easily. I rarely have to pack on shadow in order to get pay-off (only when the shadow is fussy, not the brush!). However, the bristles of this brush could be softer, and I would say that is the only downfall of this brush. I use this brush to apply and blend shadow both on the lid and crease and on my lower lash line. 6. MAC 190SE Another recent acquistion, and I personally do not use it much, if at all. For me, it is simply not necessary, as I apply and blend my foundation with MAC’s 187 stippling brush (#14). However, this brush can be good to initially apply and brush out liquid foundation, because then you can smooth it out with the 187 or fluffy dome brush to buff it out to give your foundation an “airbrushed” or “flawless” look. 7. [Unknown] Stiff, thick angle* My aunt gave me some random makeup kit, and it happened to include this brush, and it somehow became an essential brush in order for me to fill-in my eyebrows. As I mentioned with Loew-Cornell’s 793 (#3), this is one of the two brushes I must use in order to fill-in my eyebrows. I simply pat this brush with Expresso eyeshadow and apply it to my inner brow portion (the thickest part), and it really is that easy and all that I use it for. Bristles are hard, but it is a stiff enough angle brush with a good width to cover the majority of the inner portion of my eyebrow. Currently, I am considering replacing this with a higher-end brush, because it is quite rough. From left to right: 8. MAC 168SE* 9. Loew-Cornell 3/8 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore)* 10. Loew-Cornell 3/8 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore)* 11. MAC 219 12. MAC 252 13. Loew-Cornell 1/2 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore) 8. MAC 168SE I bought this brush only a few weeks ago, but it has become a staple brush in my everyday look. It is meant to contour, and I use it for that purpose. I pick up a touch of bronzer (just a bit darker than my skin itself) and contour my cheeks. I consider this brush to be fairly soft, and it does a good job of taking a little product and making it go a long way. I personally do not like white brushes because you can see them getting dirty as soon as you use them (and sometimes they can get stained). The angled dome shape is perfect size to fit into the hollow of your cheeks in order to contour them. I have yet to use the brush to contour other parts of the face, and it could be harder to use in smaller areas that require more precision. 9. Loew-Cornell 3/8 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore) If Philosophy’s Shadow brush (#5) was the most important, this brush would be the second most important. I use it in every single one of my looks so long as there is a pigment involved. I apply all of my pigments wet, so I have to keep a separate brush that can take the wetness without having to worry about wanting to use dry shadows later on. I have two of these, because I like to have one for lighter pigments and one for darker pigments. They are small enough to allow for precision, but not too small that covering your entire lid is difficult. They do stain easily (which may be the nature of pigments), though. The bristles could also be a touch softer, but overall the firmness and shape of the brush make pigment application easy and worry free. 10. Loew-Cornell 3/8 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore) See above ? 11. MAC 219 At last we get to a MAC eye brush! One of many I bought, but this is one I was too lazy to return. I do not feel this brush is particular exceptional, and it is definitely not a must-have by any means. It is soft, but quite firm with the bristles coming to a slight point at the tip. The only use I have found for it is to apply shadow on my lower lash line, and I probably only use the 219 to accomplish this 4/10 times I apply shadow to my lower lash line, anyway. 12. MAC 252 Another MAC eye brush I forgot to return, so here it sits. It’s a flat, large shadow brush, but I find it too large to deal with application. It does not really allow for precision in terms of initially applying the shadow, nor the blending process. It isn’t too firm, but it’s not very fluffy, and I feel like it tends to eat up the shadow I pick up with it. I currently use this brush for extremely dark eye shadows (again, so I do not dirty up my main shadow brush), like if I use MAC’s Carbon eyeshadow. 13. Loew-Cornell 1/2 270 Maxine’s Mop (craftstore) This is a larger version of #9 and 10, and as a result of its size, the brush is less useful than its smaller counterparts. I do use it to apply pigment on my cheeks, sometimes, but I have not used this much lately. It tends to be a brush of the last resort. From left to right: 14. MAC 187* 15. Philosophy “Blush” 16. MAC 187SE 14. MAC 187 I am positive that most people have heard of this brush, and they have also heard numerous raves on it. I like the 187 (first positive MAC brush experience!), but I do not think it is the best brush ever made, and it is not my holy grail brush, either. Of course, I do not use mineralized skinfinishes, and I know most people use the 187 to apply those, so take what I say with a grain of salt. This brush is so soft and fluffy, and it is perfect for blending liquid foundation (I use Studio Fix Fluid) so that the finish is flawless. I did not find that it applied blush as nicely as my regular blush brush did (#15), so I’ve kept the 187 purely for foundation. Plus, I find that using it for liquid foundation makes it seem gross to use it for other things, too, unless it has been washed! 15. Philosophy “Blush” This used to be a staple brush for whenever I was applying blush and/or bronzer. It is reasonably soft and fluffy, not at all stiff and immovable. It picked up color well, and it did not seem to apply the blush heavily, either. There is nothing inherently wrong with this brush, because I have used it regularly since I have got it (at least a year ago), but since purchasing MAC’s 182 buffer brush, I have favored that instead. 16. MAC 187SE This is a smaller, machine-made version of MAC’s 187. I travel frequently, so it was worth picking up this miniature version of my staple 187. Plus, it was hard to pass it up with the price tag being so low (because you get four other brushes, too). In a comparison of this 187 and the regular 187, it isn’t quite as soft, and it feels denser than the larger 187. From left to right: 17. MAC 182 (Couture)* 17. MAC 182 (Couture) My newly acquired and beloved 182 buffer brush, Couture edition. This has to be the best MAC brush I have been able to use, and it accomplishes what it is supposed to do exceptionally well. I have been using it apply my blush on my cheeks, and also to blend the blush and contour lines together. Sometimes I use it to apply pigments as highlighters for my upper cheekbones, too. It works fabulously to blend all the various face products I have used throughout an application to help bring everything together. The brush is luxuriously soft and dense, picks up color like a dream, and applies wonderfully. I absolutely recommend this brush — so much so that I am seriously contemplating purchasing a second 182.']",584087335e5b7c749cbad0134ffd975b65a87d7b,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tools-brushes-i-use-regularly-details-and-photos/

The same thing is true if you have drier skin and opt for a matte finish foundation; it doesn’t always go so well! Winter is being particularly brutal to my skin lately, but I imagine that has more to do with the fact that we’ve seen some below 50 temperatures here in California (hey, WE freeze at 50 degrees here!).

['2007-10-08 00:00:00'],"['TINte Cosmetics – Welcome to TINte, Review of Peppermint Flavored Lip Color, Double Bubble Flavored Lip Shine, and Vanilla Sky Shimmering Face Pearl Reviews Oct 08, 2007 October 08, 2007 TINte Cosmetics is a line that is love-inspired, and the simplistic packaging and elegant detailing reflect that. Founder Stacy Provines was inspired by her romance with her finace Matthew, and she used it in a creative way by putting together a line of lovely beauty products. “When I was little,” Stacy explains, “I used to play in my mom’s Indigo Earth powder and steal her sample lip sticks…bu tmy favorite was always flavored lip glosses.” It is clear that Stacy’s love for cosmetics started early on, and she was never afraid to try and dig into her mom’s beauty goodies. It was only a matter of time before she grew up and created her own line where she wants to make women feel great about themselves. TINte is a throwback to a feeling of a simpler time, one everyone cherishes–“the essence of youth and freedom.” Stacy says, “I wanted the women of today to apply our products and remember the simpler times. The memory of a scent can trascend you from stress filled days, back to a sweet memory of childhood and innocence.” I recently tried three different TINte products: Flavored Lip Color in Peppermint , Flavored Lip Shine in Double Bubble , and Shimmering Face Pearl in Vanilla Sky . Plus, TINte is offering Temptalia readers 20% off when they purchase from the TINte website using the code “GLOSS” – how awesome is that? Peppermint Flavored Lip Color comes in a vintage tin, and these are almost like lip balm meets lip stain, because Peppermint is a dark hued red and gives me such a lovely reddened pout. Moisturizing and not really glossy, so they’re a great go-to if you’re on the go or need something quick. Light and easy to take with you anywhere, which makes this an ideal choice for purse-beauty. Slight tingle, too! $14 Double Bubble Flavored Lip Shine is delicious smelling and even tasting – definitely dead ringer for bubble gum! It’s a bit sticky, but I kind of like when my gloss is sticky, so I wasn’t bothered by it. It is a high shine lip gloss with a touch of shimmer. I feel like the lip gloss itself is a bit small for the price tag, though. The packaging makes it adorable, because of its petite size. Even the wand is tiny! $17 Vanilla Sky Shimmering Face Pearl makes an awesome brow highlighter and adds subtle shimmer on cheekbones as a neutral highlight. Everyone knows that I love loose color (like pigments), so this was a great product for me to try out. It is mineral based, which makes it great for sensitive skin. You can use these on eyes, cheeks, lips, and body, and I love a multitasking product since it really lets me use it to the fullest. There are eight shades in total, and some are more neutral like Vanilla Sky, but there are also some very vibrant, deep colors like Midnight Platinum and Emerald Velvet. $14 Find TINte products at www.tintecosmetics.com ! BTW, get 20% with code “GLOSS” just for reading the review on Temptalia!']",8f0d64b3606294360b73429a9eeaafb1c3b5c92f,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/tinte-cosmetics-welcome-to-tinte-review-of-peppermint-flavored-lip-color-double-bubble-flavored-lip-shine-and-vanilla-sky-shimmering-face-pearl/

Siss is permanent, by the way, so you don’t have to rush out and purchase that one if it catches your eye and you’re on a budget. (I didn’t own it previously, though, so I still picked one up.) My favorite was easily Warm Me Up — it’s totally a shade I’d gravitate towards, and the finish is truly lovely. Spiced Tea was definitely the disappointing one of the three. Siss is a fleshy-beige with a peachy undertone. It reminded me of the color of foundation (well, a darker foundation than my own, I suppose). It’s not flattering on my lips, and I doubt I’d wear it alone — perhaps layered with a coral gloss or even a red. Warm Me Up is a creamy medium pink with a little warmed-up yellow in it. I know MAC says it’s a neutral pink, but I think it has a lil’ warmth in it still! It has a nice amplified finish, so it’s rich in pigmentation and goes on smooth. It reminded me of a much pinker version of Brave New Bronze for some reason… Spiced Tea is a semi-sheer coppery bronze with an orange warmth to it. It has a golden shimmer in it. I thought it wasn’t so bad at first, but on my lips, it looks a little splotchy. I just found it really trying to get an even finish/color with this particular shade. See more photos and swatches!

With five limited edition shades from Sugarsweet and four new (but still limited edition) shades from Warm & Cozy , it makes me wonder if we’ll be seeing more of these in 2010. Relaxed is a deep, chocolate bronze with a soft frost finish. It has the least frosty finish out of the four, but it’s still noticeably shimmery and has that frost edge associated with frost textures. I thought this was the most pigmented and smoothest of the bunch as well. Warm & Cozy is a burnt copper shade with sparkly glitter particles. I actually felt like this had a very chunky, gritty texture–it wasn’t a winner for me. Shadesticks should be smooth, and I didn’t find that this one was nearly as smooth as I’d expect. It felt like a lustre eyeshadow almost, with the way the glitter flecks were so obvious. Nurture is a pink champagne with a neutral feel. It’s not a bright, nor pastel, pink and it looks very fleshy-pink-beige in a way. It has the same frost finish appearance as the other shadesticks in the launch. Cuddle is a frosty white-gold with yellow daffodil feel. It definitely has a frost finish, and since it is so light, yet covers well, it would make an excellent base as well.

But whether you’re jonesing for a touch of summer in your life or are already breaking out your booty shorts, bronzers are often turned towards for a subtle, sunkissed glow that is an earmark of summer and fun. Urban Decay Baked Bronzer ($24.00) looks very much like a the famous MAC mineralize skinfinishes, so if that’s your bag… you should definitely get your butt to your nearest Sephora to check this out! What I like about the Baked bronzer is that you can use it either wet or dry, and using it wet won’t ruin your product or leave a wet stain/spot behind. I actually tried a coming-soon shade in Gilded , which will is part of Urban Decay’s Summer 2008 launch. Original shades Baked and Toasted are fairly uniform in color throughout the product, but Gilded has gold spun through it (very much reminiscent of MSFs!). Clinique True Bronze Pressed Powder Bronzer ($23.50) is an ultra lightweight powder compact that goes on so smoothly and lasts awhile. I like that it comes in four shades, which gives possibilities to different shades to go for subtle bronzing or deeper color as they please. The compact is sleek and transportable, which is great for doing makeup on the run as I know many of us will be spending plenty o’ time outdoors once weather permits. Xen-Tan Perfect Bronze Perfect Bronze ($28.00) is a velvety smooth bronzing powder that is designed to “never look orangey or pink, even on fair skins.” Unfortunately, as I’m nowhere near fair, I can’t report on the accuracy of that statement, but it does give me hope for those who have been hesitant about getting into bronzer because of the orange-effect. Guerlain Terracotta ($42.00) is a luxurious bronzer (hello, it’s Guerlain) that is moisturizing and lasts all day. The powder is also supposed to help protect your skin against free radicals. According to Guerlain, “neutral bronze” is suitable for all skin colors, though the product does come in four shades. If you’re a fan of this brand and have extra cash in your wallet, this isn’t a bad item to splurge on. Though I personally find that for bronzing, since I rarely use straight bronzers by themselves, that I do not need a product like this (then again – it would last me eternity!). Stay tuned for part two, with even more bronzers to choose from! Find these bronzers and more at Nordstrom.com or Sephora.com .']",efe762b5231e783054dc1c293fa02cb767f3fbb6,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/summer-bronze-your-guide-to-bronzers-part-1/

I e-mailed her for some advice on how to make my new PRO additions really work for me, and I thought I’d share what I learned! (Don’t you love her? I do!) Where to use the glitters? “Because they are sold at pro, ideally they are amazing for body and face work , and can be applied easily by using a little bit of lip conditioner and then tap on the glitter with a brush. Lots of fun can be had especially with Halloween coming up.” Nudes and Shapers? She recommended I try this combo (can’t wait to try it!): “Highlight brow bone and cheek bone with Emphasize, Contour cheeks and eyes with Bone Beige; Deepen eye crease with Definitive, add Warm light to apple of cheeks; Use Shadowy to line your eyes; Absolutely gorgeous and don’t forget lots of mascara!” Where to use the beauty powders? “The Beauty powders can be used anywhere; Paperwhite is my fave for highlighting on cheek bones for some extra dazzle.” How to use the beauty powders? “My trick for cheeks is to use any blush and mix with the beauty powders and then apply. Just dip in the beauty powder and then in your blush, it looks fabulous, I like to use Micro Pink or Drizzle gold for this. These can also be used on the eyes, a little tap in the center of the eye lid can spruce up you look from day to night.” P.S. – If you haven’t been able to purchase these, you can always call up your nearest PRO store (even if that’s eight hours away!) and place a phone order. Shipping is only $7, which isn’t bad at all. However, if you can wait, later on this year, you will find that MAC will launch a few beauty powders from the PRO line plus new ones to consumers in MAC of Beauty. There will also be Nudes and Shapers coming in the form of Sculpting duos! I’ve heard rumors that a few of the reflects glitters will also be making an appearance!']",e5ab5db1a85db162f4376ff5297dd0c61df9794f,0d7e-4c6a-a9fa,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-louise-zizzo-dishes-out-advice-on-pro-reflects-glitters-nudes-and-shapers-and-beauty-powders/

It is incredibly easy to use, the formula is velety and creamy, and it does a superior job of hiding dark circles and minimizing fine lines. I also use it on minor blemishes and recent scars and have found it to work beautifully on these types of skin issues, too. It’s in a pen/brush form, which means it is great to keep in your purse or use on the go. I personally prefer to buff my concealer in using a buffer brush, but for a quick fix, the brush applicator still works. You click the end of the concealer to get the product out and simply swipe onto areas you want to conceal. It is available in only three shades–light, medium, and dark–which may make it a limited option for some. However, concealers do not need to have as wide of a range as foundations (though I think they could probably stand to add another shade or two). Price is a little steeper than I’d like, but the results make me regret all the money I’ve spent on other concealers. To get fancy on you, Kanebo Concealer includes Reflecting Beads to help diffuse light, Silk Extract to reduce moisture loss, and Phyto Squalane to enhance moisture retention.

It’s been a pretty rough week over at Temptalia HQ, which is my excuse for lack of looks (that and I really wanted to play with Starflash, and I didn’t have it yet!). Jury duty this week (unscathed, total score!), and Magellan (my puppy) was neutered on Wednesday. We also asked our vet to check his hips, and we consented to an x-ray (it’s a painful x-ray, so it requires him to be under anaesthesia). Turns out, poor Mellan has severe hip dysplasia. We haven’t decided what to do yet, and we don’t see the orthopedic surgeon until the 11th. Hopefully he’ll drop some knowledge on us so we can decide then (surgery now, let nature take its course/surgery later). But yes, tough week! Can’t wait for it to end, LOL. You will need the following… Eyes : Baselight paint (pale white-gold cream), Dreammaker eyeshadow (shimmery white-gold), Mink & Sable eyeshadow (golden olive green), Smoke & Diamonds eyeshadow (gray with gold flecks), Feline kohl power (black liner), Plushlash mascara (black) Cheeks : Nuance mineralize blush (soft peach-pink) Lips : Ripe & Ready/Soft & Lush Pro Longwear Lustre Colour (coral-pink lipstick/sheer pink gloss) Brushes : 266 (firm, angled brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 129 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Dreammaker = Nylon; Mink & Sable = Sumptuous Olive; Smoke & Diamonds = Silver Ring; Feline = Graphblack; Nuance = Peachykeen; Ripe & Ready/Soft & Lush = Skew lipstick/Slicked Pink lipgelee Directions: Define brows using a coordinating powder shadow applied with the 266 brush.

I could only get my paws on six of the eight, but I’m loving the ones I do have! (The ones I didn’t get to see/try were Nebula #122 or Mirage #132, FYI — hopefully they’ll be out at Nordstrom today!) Chanel also released two lacquers in Mica Rose and Cosmic Violine. Lip swatches to follow! ? Venus (124) is a pop of bright, shimmery pink with pink and gold shimmer. It’s fairly sheer when applied to lips, but the gold shimmer really pops. Silex (126) is a sheer, lightly coral-toned gloss with noticeable peach and gold shimmer. Again, it is sheer when applied to lips (this is, ultimately, the nature of most glossimers!). Meteore (128) is similar to Silex, only the shimmer is a bit more muted and there is faint light pink glitter and less noticeable gold/peach shimmer. Cosmo (129) is an opaque, glossy coral with reddish tones shade. It has silvery-white glitter that sparkles in it. This is one of the more pigmented glossimers from the launch. In the tube, it looks more like a browned-down coral with red and silver shimmer. Mica (131) is a sheer, glossy mix of opal and purple shimmer with a milky pink color base. It is sheer, but it does noticeably make my lips a milky pink shade. Jupiter (134) is an opaque, glossy reddish-pink shade with just a touch of coral in it. The shimmer is a fuchsia-pink almost, just a touch of gold shimmer to accent. See swatches and more product photos !

Selections are based on quality, universality, uniqueness amongst the line, and the like. Limited edition shades are deliberately excluded to make buying easier. Readers’ comments act as a supplement to these lists of their favorites and must-haves. You can find the entire series here . Orange eyeshadow is the truest orange available by MAC. It’s an oldie, but it’s a goody. With a matte texture, Orange can provide a ton of dimension whether used on the lid or crease. Motif eyeshadow is a peachy-orange duochrome with a shimmery finish. I love it for the different ways it’ll look, depending on the colors next to it. Gleam eyeshadow is a light, highlighter peachy shade. It’s pretty and easy to use for even someone who may be color shy. See three more must-haves , plus get pairing recommendations! Arena eyeshadow is an orangey-brown, almost a deep peach color for me. I love it for neutral looks, but it’s also nice to use in the crease for brighter looks. Rule eyeshadow is a slightly dirty orange color. It’s matte, like Orange, but it’s not quite as true orange in color. Samoa Silk eyeshadow is a smooth, veluxe-finish peach-orange color. It’s pale without being pastel, and it is a great all-over-lid color. Pair these shadows with… yellows (like Chrome Yellow), golds (like Goldmine), browns (like Amber Lights), reds (like Coppering) Check your stash for a few awesome limited edition finds… Fab & Flashy, Firespot, Orange Tangent, D’Bohemia, Sunsplosion, Juiced What are your favorite orange eyeshadows?

What’s nifty about these is that they look matte, but there is still a healthy dose of shimmer in it, so while it has that flat look, the shimmer adds depth and makes them more interesting. Keep in mind that matte-based polishes have a lot shorter wear time, particularly because a lot of top coats add shine/glossiness (which defeats the purpose of matte). Without a base or top coat, you’ll get chips pretty quickly. (Of the three nails I did, Loredana is half gone, while the other two show minor tip wear, and it’s been about 12 hours.) But, but… there is a benefit to these… they dry incredibly fast. Like insanely quickly. No quick-drying top coat required, these babies dry down completely within a few minutes (so work quickly). Dovima is a grayish-black with silver shimmer. I didn’t find it to be a true black, but more of a subdued charcoal. This one was my favorite of the three. Loredana is a silver with silver shimmer shade. It’s not a light bright silver base, but it’s noticeably bright without being too much so. Posh is a rich, jewel-toned ruby red. It has a beautiful jewel-tone ruby red base with soft, silver shimmer. I really love this shade of red, and being able to wear it matte is fun. Product : 8/10 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 7/10 Packaging : 8/10 Recommendation : If you’ve always been curious about matte-finish nail polishes, these are for you. If you don’t mind re-doing your nails after a few days, I’d strongly urge you to sneak a peek at these lovelies. They’re fun, hip, and definitely a trend for fall.
