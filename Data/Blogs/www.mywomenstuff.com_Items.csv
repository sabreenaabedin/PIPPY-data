If you missed the earlier featured cushions, find them all here . This week, the cushions are a mixed bag, featuring a Japanese brand, a couple of Western brands, and featuring some Korean brands too. The categories will be kept as per previous posts, so you can refer back to them all and it’ll look fairly familiar. The difference will be in the products featured. Also, I will do a round up at the end of the week, just to give closure to this week. Cushion Foundation Week 3 Day 3 brings a sense of deja vu. Did I not already feature the Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation Cushion Compact prior to this? Yes I did. If you remember, the packaging is a sleek black case. This time, Bobbi Brown has released something different as part of their Extra Glow collection, in a sleek white case. This is the Bobbi Brown Skin Radiant Glow Cushion Compact SPF50 that comes in just 1 shade – Rosy Glow. The purpose of this rosy-pink tinted product is to diffuse harsh light, and infuse complexion with a youthful, soft luminosity – why don’t you decide if it does ? Cushion Foundation: Bobbi Brown Skin Radiant Glow Cushion Compact SPF50 This one technically isn’t a cushion foundation. Bobbi Brown doesn’t market it that way, and that is a good thing. However, they are also fairly vague about what this really is, which complicates matters. The Bobbi Brown Skin Radiant Glow Cushion Compact is to me, rather like a CC base, targeted at colour and complexion correcting, not exactly at adding any colour to the skin. It comes in only 1 shade – Rosy Glow, a pink tint cream. From what I can tell, this appears to be sold only in the Asian market for now. Usually, pink tinted creams are targeted at brightening the complexion and helping it look more radiant. This helps those with a sallow skin tone, as it makes your skin look a little brighter. However, I’d personally go for the Bobbi Brown Illuminating Moisture Balm in Pink Glow for this purpose. That one is easier to understand, does everything it says on the box, and feels more comfortable on skin. I find this one a little tacky, and the single shade isn’t suitable for everyone. If your skin is too deep, it may look ashy going on. If your skin tone is too warm, it may look too odd, having a pinkish tone on your face, and a warm tone elsewhere. Above all, I feel this to be most unnecessary. If I needed a colour corrector, Bobbi Brown makes a CC Cream that already serves this purpose . ml for ml, it makes better sense using one of the liquid products than to use this cushion. Sunscreen protection : SPF50 PA+++ The SPF 50 rating is a plus of course, if you use a cushion foundation in place of sunscreen (and you should not!), but if you are truly the lazy sort, then I suppose this is better than nothing. Packaging & Refills The Bobbi Brown Skin Radiant Glow Cushion Compact comes with one case and one refill, each are sold separately. Unlike Korean brands, you do not get a spare refill, which I feel reduces the value somewhat. The case is different from other brands of cushion compacts, in that Bobbi Brown uses a coffee pod style of compact. The cover of the cushion is attached to the main case, while the product is in a pod, rather like a Nespresso coffee pod. You pop in the capsule when you are done and each capsule comes sealed. The Cushion The cushion is different from the norm, in that it does not come saturated. This is similar to what Bobbi Brown did for their cushion foundation. Instead, the sponge sits on a well of product, with only the slightest amount of product peeking through. It will saturate, as you use it, but you will have to press on the cushion to get the product onto your sponge. This, they say is to prevent it drying out more quickly (which is a common lament amongst cushion foundation users) and maybe it works. But it still looks a little odd. The Sponge Puff The sponge puff is a good, dense sponge, that picks up product easily and applies it easily on skin as well. TO USE: Slip your fingers through the loop (it only accommodates 3 fingers for me so I find it a little small), dab the sponge on the surface of the cushion (you can see this is just 1 dab) and then dab it on your skin, in a press and roll motion. Press on skin, and roll it off. It helps the product adhere better to your skin. Texture, Coverage & Finish The texture is fairly light, and the pink tint will go on your skin leaving it very bright. It will settle in a little, but if I find it a little too bright (I wear quite light foundations generally), I can’t imagine how others will find it. This one is definitely more tailored for those with a light-fair skintone, and maybe even targeted primarily at customers in China, Japan and Korea, the latter of which I’ve learnt took very well to the BB Cushion Foundation. In these before-after pictures, I’m wearing the Bobbi Brown Skin Radiant Glow Cushion Compact in shade Rosy Glow . On left is me in my sick, bare skinned glory. On right, is with a layer of the Bobbi Brown Skin Radiant Glow Cushion Compact in Rosy Glow. You may notice that it has noticeably brightened my skin tone, but offers little to no coverage. However, the sallow and dull parts of my skin, especially around my eyes look a little brighter. I then applied a layer of the Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation Cushion Compact in Porcelain over Rosy Glow. There is a little more coverage, and a more natural tint to my skin (not so pink) I guess it works. I just cannot see the point of it, because it is more finicky to use the cushion than it will be to use an illuminating primer or colour correcting cream all over. Shade selection There is just 1 shade – Rosy Glow. I’m not sure if they’ll be releasing others in this range. Perhaps they might, like they did with the Illuminating Moisture Balm. That said, my observation is that this appears to be available only in Asian markets for now, so I’m not sure about availability elsewhere. Scent Yes, there is a slight scent but it isn’t too strong, and will dissipate. If you’re sensitive to fragrance in skin products then be wary. Do I like this? I’m not sure what this is. Granted, it isn’t a cushion foundation, so maybe it didn’t have a place in this week’s round up. If you are of a fair skin tone, and have sallowness then maybe this will help infuse your complexion with some radiance. I wouldn’t use it on its own however. You can use it under your foundation, or as Bobbi Brown suggests, over foundation, perhaps to add a little glow where you might want it. For me, I find it too finicky and too hard to get my head around why I’d need this. IN A NUTSHELL The Bobbi Brown Skin Radiant Glow Cushion Compact SPF50 in Rosy Glow is less of a cushion foundation, and more of a cushion colour corrector. It comes in only 1 shade, Rosy Glow, a pink tinted cream. It adds radiance to skin complexion and brightens up the skin. The compact is totally different from regular cushion foundations, in that the refill is a capsule that you pop into the case. You cannot buy the refill without a case, as there is no cover. Sneaky! If you think of this as a colour corrector, it does serve its purpose to add some radiance to your skin tone. But otherwise, it is a rather confusing product. PROS: Pink tint adds radiance to sallow skin tones, Brightens skin complexion, Not heavy on skin CONS: Pricey, No extra refills included, Little coverage, Refills do not come with a cover, Texture is heavier than most cushion products WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a convenient colour correcter in a compact form PRICE: RM190 for the case and refill. Case is RM40, refills are RM150 each sold separately WHERE TO BUY: Bobbi Brown counters and stores – Does not appear to be available outside of Asia at time of writing I don’t have the ingredient list for this right now, but will update if I get hold of it in future. Does this Bobbi Brown Skin Radiant Glow Cushion Compact intrigue you? It took me a while to get my head around it. Once I accepted that it was not a foundation, I was fine with it as a product that adds radiance to your skin. But really, for the price and the value, I’d just get the Extra Illuminating Moisture Balm in Pink Glow . That one has WINNER! written all over it!

If you like it, you better put a ring on it ? Its what Bobbi Brown hopes you’ll do with her Luxe Eye Palette launched for the bridal season to help you create your look for your big day. The Bobbi Brown Bride. But you know what? That rather puts me off, if I’m to be honest. Whilst its a great idea for a bride-to-be to consider, what about someone who isn’t a bride-to-be? Does it put some sort of pressure on women who just want to own this palette because they happen to like how it wears? Does even looking at it in store set off the clanging of wedding bells in the air? (If that happens, run – it might be the fire alarm ? ) Well, this were exactly the thoughts that ran through my mind when I read about the palette and also why I set it aside after I received it, not overly keen to look bridal. When I eventually picked it up and tried it, I was quite simply, blown away by how much I liked this NOT for a bridal palette, but for a very lovely, very wearable, very mistake proof eyeshadow palette. If you too feel the same way I do about marking this down for a bridal palette, don’t. You might miss out on a very lovely piece. The Bobbi Brown Luxe Eye Palette comes in a very compact and shiny metal case. There is good heft to the case which does allow it to live up to the “luxe” claims. Open the palette and you have 6 eye colours chosen to be very safe, very neutral colours. Nothing exciting, nothing that makes you go “OMG Look at that!” but at the same time, nothing brown. Nothing makes my stomach turn as much as opening up a ‘neutral’ palette to see 6 shades of brown staring at me in the face. With the Bobbi Brown Luxe Palette you get the following 6 shades which (correct me if I’m wrong) are available as singles. Here’s a quick run down starting from the Left column, running top to bottom. Cream Eyeshadow – Described as a creamy beige this is a matte shade that practically disappears into my skin. This would be the ‘base’ shade that you use all over your lid to create a base for other colours to build on. Pink Opal Shimmer Wash Eyeshadow – A shimmery nude beige with a hint of pink. Not something I’d call pink to its face because I see it as just being a shimmer neutral beige. Oyster Grey Metallic Shadow – I love this shade. Despite the ‘metallic’ tag, its not metallic at all and has a lovely satin finish. It isn’t very grey either and looks to me like a shimmer cream. I like using this one over Espresso for a very simple, very fast eye brightening look. Pink Pearl Metallic Shadow – I don’t know where all these pink references are coming from, but this looks like a lilac to me. Again, unlike the ‘metallic’ tag, its not metallic at all, and like Oyster Grey, has a lovely satin finish. It too works beautifully on its own over Espresso or just on its own with Espresso to line. Pink Lilac Sparkle shadow – Again another pink reference I don’t get. This one is sparkly as the name implies and looks to my eye like a light lilac shade. Strictly highlighter use. Espresso – A matte dark chocolate brown that is almost black. Espresso appears in almost every Bobbi Brown eyeshadow palette as the crease/liner shade. I’ve had a few BB palettes in my time and Espresso features in every single one! Can’t deny that its useful though. Here are the swatches to accompany the description. Swatched from Top to Bottom, Left column first then right column. Left-Right: Cream, Pink Opal Shimmer Wash, Oyster Grey, Pink Pearl, Pink Lilac, Espresso All the colours look light and shimmery which I can imagine will make many of you wrinkle your nose. Espresso felt and swatched a bit dry to me, and even when I use a brush it feels the same – a bit dry and patchy going on. So I have to be careful with how I apply it. Its very pigmented however, and makes a lovely liner or base. I’ve been wearing this palette exclusively for a week and guess what? I’m not tired of it. It says a lot, because these aren’t colours or textures I usually wear. I am in fact, slowly crawling out of an eyeshadow rut where all I’ve been using is just 1 single colour swiped across my lid. No inspiration. So this palette is a good way to ease into things. Here’s an idea of how I usually wear the Luxe Eye Palette. I wear Espresso close to the top lashline and smudged upwards, then I take Oyster Grey and apply it all over the lid and blend with Espresso so it gives a hint of depth as you may notice. I then take a fluffy brush, dip it into Pink Pearl and Pink Lilac, brush it over my lid and up to my brow. Done. I like the gentle shimmer it gives to the eye area and how it brightens the eye area without making it look too heavy with colour. I’ve also learnt that if I really wanted to, I can use Espresso to deepen the base for a stronger evening look. I took it with me for a quick work trip this weekend and it was lovely worn in the evening for a softly smokey look, amd transitioned into a glowy eye for the day.vIt really is quite a versatile palette and a very user friendly one, and importantly, very fast to work with. Sure, you could wear it on your wedding day, I suppose. But me, I just like wearing it everyday because it just works ? Eyes: Bobbi Brown Luxe Eye Palette | Cheeks: Bobbi Brown Apricot blush | Lips: Chanel Rouge Coco Shine Elise | Face Lunasol Skin Modelling Foundation + Nars Creamy Radiant Concealer in Vanilla In a nutshell The Bobbi Brown Luxe Eye Palette is a palette created to entice brides-to-be but I feel that it rather gives a wrong impression because the palette in fact, works very prettily for daily wear. The colours are soft and shimmery but not overly so and if you blend it out, the lids look like they are glowing which is lovely. The use of Espresso is quite important in this palette to tone the shine down and to bring depth to what are otherwise very flighty airy colours. Espresso helps give dimension to the lids and can even be used to create an evening look with this very same palette. I don’t know or think it’d work for the very dark skinned or very tanned so I do believe this palette will work best for light to medium skintones. A lovely palette. Put a ring on it ? Pros: Easy to use, light blendable colours, Gives a glow and fresh look to the eyes Cons: Light shades will not suit deeper skintones, Light colours look too similar on skin Who will like this: Anyone who isn’t keen on bright eye colours, Anyone who wants an easy to tote palette that can work easily and effortlessly for day or night I used to have a number of Bobbi Brown eye palettes and they are really nice if a little boring and I do notice that they are making more shimmer ones these days instead of satin/matte shadows as they used to before. You don’t go to Bobbi Brown for bright, striking colours but when neutrals and daily wear shades call, Bobbi Brown is usually a good place to start. Have you checked out the Luxe Eye Palette? Do you have a favourite Bobbi Brown eyeshadow or palette? I have and love Rockstar, a metallic grey that is just beautiful and super bling! I still pull it out now and then when I’m feeling like a rockstar ? Its the first time I’ve checked out Bobbi Brown shadows in a while and I must say, I better revisit so hit me with your fave shades! What say you – put a ring on it or let it go? ?

I have to say that as I rarely pay a lot of attention to Nars blushes these days (after poor experiences with their packaging ) I overlooked this one. I was however sent a blush in the titillatingly named “Sex Fantasy” along with a Satin Lip Pencil in “Villa Lante” so I thought I’d quickly tell you what I thought about them because one was a surprise hit and the other, a rather expected, washout. It’s also limited edition, so don’t pause for too long if you’re contemplating something from the collection. The question of course, is which is which?! Wouldn’t you like to know eh? ? A little tidbit of information re: naming of the rather more exotic Nars blushes here in Malaysia and I’m told in a couple more conservative countries, is that numbers maybe used in place of the name we know. So for example, Sex Fantasy will be labelled 4006 at the display. Less shocking, but if you know the name of the blush, the Makeup Artists will be able to help you ? Another thing I learned recently also, is that the infamous Nars rubbery packaging has been reformulated and improved upon to withstand heat and humidity. Guess they were listening to us after all! Someone I know showed me her blush compact that she carries around in her bag and has been for the past 6 months and although a little dusty, it wasn’t yet sticky and melty so perhaps there is some truth in it after all! I do find that it feels smoother. So onto Sex Fantasy and Villa Lante. Are these colours you’d wear? Let’s just say that the Villa Lante Satin Lip Pencil (RM85) isn’t one I’d have picked for myself. I don’t generally fare well with pale sweet pinks like these for lips as they have a nasty habit of making my skin look sallow and my teeth yellow. Granted, when I actually tested it, it doesn’t look too bad. I suppose I could top it up with a bolder gloss or apply it over a base of a deep toned lip pencil to warm up the colour a little. I’ll keep experimenting ? The texture is quite nice, with a nice slip and I didn’t find it too drying. I own a Satin Lip Pencil in Hyde Park that I bought a while ago and I might tell you about that at a later stage. They aren’t matte, but they aren’t glossy either. Satin is quite an apt description. It is also surprisingly quite small. All these close ups that I see online doesn’t help me manage my expectations at all! It’s quite small and short much to my surprise and it doesn’t come with a sharpener, which is sold separately. I bought the sharpener the last time so I already have one but if you don’t want to buy theirs, I suppose you could try a jumbo sharpener from a stationery shop ? I’ve got a swatch of this below, if you’d like to scroll a little further down. As I said, it’s not a pink I’d wear usually but I can make it work, as it doesn’t wash me out very much. But I have to make sure I wear something a little stronger on cheeks and eyes. The moment I laid eyes on Sex Fantasy blush (RM120) , I wondered aloud, just how this very pale cool pink blush could ever conjure up a Sex Fantasy. Maybe one filled with fluffy cotton-tailed rabbits? ? Hmm… maybe scratch that thought ? Sex Fantasy in pan is a very pale powder. Very very pale, cool, pink. Quite unexciting if you ask me. However, I found that when worn on skin, it translated into a lovely soft pink flush that was very alluring. The powder is pretty pigmented and quite true to what you see in the pan, except that I found that when I wore it on cheeks, it warmed up a little so it was much more flattering on skin. However, the caveat is that this will likely work only for the fair skinned since it is so light. So if you have a fairly light skintone, I urge you to give this a try because you, like me, may end up being quite surprised at how sweet a look it gives you. I also caution against applying too much because it can look a bit powdery. But it looks nice even as the day wears on, giving you that “Look! I’ve got a sweet healthy glow… or is it blush? You can’t tell can you?!” sort of look. I did have it last for at least 6 hours without problems and even a little longer so that’s practically a whole work day. A surprise hit for me! Note: As Legeeque has pointed out in her comment below, Sex Fantasy does appear to be the pink counterpart to Sex Appeal (permanent). That too is a very pale powder blush with peachier undertones that I’m assured looks better on skin than in pan. I thought I’d show you a quick comparison with some other pale pink blushes I own. I didn’t have time to trawl through my whole stash but some pale pinks I have can be found here . I’ve compared it here to Benefit Dandelion and Shu Uemura M Pink 33E (which I don’t know if it still exists because this one’s quite old). In terms of colour in pan, Sex Fantasy is closest to the Shu Uemura one. Dandelion has a little more peachy tones as you can see. Here are the swatches then, swatched heavily as I these light blushes don’t show up very well otherwise. Sex Fantasy isn’t similar to Dandelion at all, which as a slightly more peach cast. Shu Uemura M Pink 33E is a little brighter and warmer compared to Sex Fantasy. You may also notice that Sex Fantasy doesn’t look very pale does it? It has a significantly cool toned base with a light pink tone that is sweet but anyone with deeper skintones will not appreciate it, that I will guarantee! You will likely appreciate colours like Love or Final Cut more, or New Attitude if you want something pink. Oh and one more thing I liked about Sex Fantasy – it’s a matte blush! I have been warming up to using matte makeup in recent times (Is this a sign of age catching up, I wonder ? ) and I have and liked Angelika blush which is full of shimmer but a lovely pink. So having a matte pink blush that is easy to use and makes me look perky and sweet without having a face full of shimmer is a boon! ? Here’s how Sex Fantasy blush and Villa Lante Satin Lip Pencil looks on me. In terms of the blush, I applied it as I would to work, so I didn’t want to put on a lot. You may just see the hint of pink on the apples of the cheeks? I hope so ? The lip colour as I expected, wasn’t something I’d fancy. I can make it work but I’d prefer something that isn’t pink-pink ? In a nutshell The Nars Final Cut collection has 4 blushes, 4 Satin Lip Pencils and an Illuminator. Of the 4 powder blushes, Sex Fantasy is the lightest colour and I am sure, will be hard to show up on deeper toned skin. On light skinned gals however, I’d say it’s worth a look. Or at least, a try on your skin to see if you like how it looks on you. I’m not saying it’s a must have. But if you are afraid of wearing blush and want something easy and fool proof, it’s worth giving Sex Fantasy a look. Villa Lante is a cool toned pink which is a colour I personally don’t wear a lot of as it doesn’t quite flatter my skintone as much as something with a bit more colour or warmth does. The texture is nice and easy to use but the pencil doesn’t come with a sharpener which I wish wasn’t the case. Pros: Sex Fantasy blush despite the pale pink colour in pan goes on skin a surprisingly complimentary gentle pink that perks up the complexion, The Satin Lip Pencil applies smoothly and comfortably Cons: Sex Fantasy blush will not show up on deeper skintones, Villa Lante lip pencil may not suit all skintones and will accentuate yellowness on teeth, Lip pencil doesn’t come with a sharpener Who will like this: Anyone who wants a light toned matte pale pink blush, Anyone looking for a cool pink lip colour Here’s an overview of the Final Cut collection for your viewing pleasure ? Sex Fantasy in person is quite underwhelming but I’d say it’s worth asking one of the Makeup Artists to give you a test on your cheeks. I wasn’t impressed till I wore it and then I was quite happy to wear it for a week straight ? Does anything from the Final Cut collection catch your eye? Would you wear something like Sex Fantasy blush or Villa Lante lip pencil? I never thought I’d take to Sex Fantasy blush but I did! Did you check out anything from the collection? ?

Loads of product, great value! Smells amazing!” and you know what I thought? Wait a minute – Bobbi Brown? They do skincare?! Apparently they do! And apparently I’m told that some of their skincare isn’t too bad which made me curious, because I don’t always associate known makeup brands like Bobbi Brown and Nars with skincare. But when you know of the big companies backing them who do do skincare (Estee Lauder Group and Shiseido Group respectively) then it sort of makes sense doesn’t it? ? So one day, I was given the opportunity to try the Bobbi Brown Extra Rinse Balm cleansing balm and after I’d finished up a few of the ones I had in rotation, it was time to break this out and see how I felt about it. I use the word “break” in a rather hesitant way, as this product comes in a large, heavy glass jar and that just spells disaster all over the bathroom! So I am very careful to keep this out of the wet area and as I use dry hands to handle it, accidents can be minimized, but not eradicated. Please be very careful because it is large and unwieldy. I’ve given this almost 2 months use to see what I think about it, and apologies to the fans out there, I’m afraid I’m a little on the fence about this one. I can’t fault the quantity. Although it’s expensive at about RM245 a jar, there’s a hefty 200ml of product in there which is a lot more than many other cleansing balms in the market. So once you break down the price, it isn’t that bad. Oh and it will last you a long long time, because you don’t really need that much each time you use it. See? It’s large! The yellow balm is as the name implies, a balm texture. It is sticky and doesn’t come with a spatula but that doesn’t bug me. I just dig right in with fingers. Dry ones mind you! You don’t want to use wet fingers because I’m sure it’ll spoil the product. As with most cleansing balms, this operates on a dry hands, dry face method of cleansing. Scoop out a generous amount of cleansing balm depending on your personal preference. I am quite generous as I like to perform a little massage and you need lubrication. You will notice that the texture is sticky. It’s like the balm sucks at your fingers when you try to scoop some out and when you do, it’s sticky. See? You may notice the texture, which is a translucent yellow and a balmy texture that is unlike that of the Antipodes one which has a more buttery texture. I’ve read of people experiencing problems using this because it’s so sticky and hard to use on skin but I didn’t experience problems. So here’s how I use it to give you an idea. Scoop out a generous amount and place in palm of hand. Using the other palm, rub at the balm to warm it up and spread it out in your hands. It starts out sticky but gets easier to work with as it warms up. Apply to face and massage. There is a warm sensation on skin and it’ll soften further. After a few minutes, add some warm water to melt the balm, continuing your massage, to emulsify the product. After a few more minutes, rinse off. Warming it up in your palms makes it easier going on your face and minimizes painful tugging at your facial skin. As you massage, the balm will feel softer and it gets easier to handle. There is a strange warming sensation on the skin for a short while that I can’t explain. However, unlike balms like The Body Shop one or even Clinique, it does not turn into an oil. It remains a balm and I like that. I am not much of a fan of those that turn into oils. Another point to note is that this balm is easily washed off without using a face cloth. You can just rinse it off after emulsifying it a little with warm water. I however prefer to use a face cloth and although I enjoy it, I know people find it a hassle so if you don’t like those wipe-off balms, you will prefer this one. Another thing to note – the strong citrus smell. It is very strong and very sweet. I always feel like I’m washing my face with orange cordial or an orange rind whenever I use this because it is so strong! Some people will enjoy this, and although I do enjoy citrus scents, I actually find this a bit too much. A light scent is fine, but something this overwhelming doesn’t sit well with me. Also, because of this strong citrus smell, I took a look at the ingredients and noticed that it contains citrus fruit extracts which I will warn can be irritating to sensitive skin so I will exercise a little caution if you do have sensitive skin. It cleans my skin well enough, leaving it soft and feeling smooth and lovely but the strong citrus smell doesn’t sit well with me and I have a feeling that it dries my skin a little so I don’t use this every evening as I would usually do. I’ve been alternating this with another simply because I feel that my skin doesn’t tolerate this cleanser as well as it should. It is however, convenient due to it’s rinse off formula so what I’d like to see is for this to come in a smaller, handier tub, maybe not in glass so we don’t have accidents in the bathroom and a lower pricetag. It’s not a bad product, I don’t think, but it can be prohibitive for people who may not be sure if the formula or ingredients will suit them. I’ll use this up, as I did the one from The Body Shop that I emptied just recently, but this isn’t one I’d repurchase. The hunt is back on! In a nutshell The Bobbi Brown Extra Balm Rinse is a balm cleanser that can be easily rinsed off with water instead of having to use a wash cloth or face flannel. The texture is quite sticky but once you warm it up in your hands, it’s quite easy to apply to skin and massaging it lightens the texture somewhat. The strong citrus scent appeals to many, but it does not appeal much to me and I will caution anyone with sensitive skin to take note of the citrus oils used as that can be irritating to skin. This cleans my skin well although if I use this too often it feels a wee bit drying so I use it on alternate days, alternating with another balm cleanser. I will suggest following up with another cleanser as this is the first step of a double cleansing routine and it does remove makeup although I didn’t test it on my eye area. The citrus makes my eyes water. The glass jar is large, heavy and unwieldy so this is one instance when I think a plastic jar will do better in a bathroom. Pros: Cleans skin well and leaves it soft and clean, Balmy texture makes it useful for massaging over skin, Those who enjoy the scent will enjoy using this, Rinse off formula makes it very convenient Cons: Glass jar is heavy and awkward especially in the bathroom, Citrus scent is far too strong Who will like this: Anyone who enjoys strong citrus scents, Anyone familiar with using a balm cleanser and prefers a rinse off formula Here is the ingredient list for anyone keen to see if you can use this Some of you may be wondering if you can use this as a makeup remover and cleanser in one. My answer is yes you can, however I don’t recommend it. The reason I say so is because I would never use this around my eyes (too strong and too much tugging) and if you’re going to remove your eye makeup first, it would also make sense to remove your face makeup first. That’s what I do as I do not believe in all in one products. So I’d remove my makeup first with a cleansing water (I don’t bother if it’s too clean) and then I follow up with a balm cleanser for my face area (never eyes!) and end with another face cleanser. That’s me ? Have you used this Bobbi Brown Balm? Have you tried other Bobbi Brown skincare? I haven’t tried other Bobbi Brown skincare but they actually have a treatment lotion that intrigues me! Also I’ve read their face moisturiser is quite good. Thoughts? ? Paris B Bobbi Brown Extra Balm Rinse Price: RM245/200ml Availability: Bobbi Brown counters and stores']"

Have you managed to catch your breath? Naturally, I will not have ALL the brands in the market for this head to head comparisons – Korean brands aren’t all that generous at providing samples, unlike the Western brands I worked with before this – but I have enough to take you through 7 (yes, count that) SEVEN days of Cushion Foundations. This time, we will have a whole WEEK of cushions and then on Day 8 (if I have not yet collapsed from exhaustion), I’ll give you a round up, and on Day 9 (Yes, I’ve thought this through) I’ll do you a quick comparison of Korean vs Western brand cushions based on what I’ve tested so far. Whew! There’s a lot to get through so, fasten your seatbelts, here we go! Day 3 of Cushion Foundation Week 2 the K-Beauty edition) features my favouritest (that IS a word ? ) ever cushion – Hera UV Mist Cushion . I guess I could have saved this for last, but heck, why should I when it stunned me from the get-go! I love this one, and I’m going to tell you why! Cushion Foundation: Hera UV Mist Cushion SPF50+ PA+++ I bought this one on a whim online one day. I was aware of Hera, which is a higher end brand of Korean cosmetics that are sold in department stores. As we don’t have much accessibility to the brand locally, and because I wasn’t much into Korean cosmetics, it hovered on the edge of my consciousness, but never really registered. So, I picked it up, literally on a whim because I was curious about trying a cushion foundation and for some reason, I liked the name. I would. I’m a huge fan of Greek mythology and anyone familiar with Greek myths know of Hera, Zeus’ long suffering and jealous wife and Goddess of women. She was a crafty one, that Hera! I later found out that the Hera cushion foundations are very popular, because they are supposed to be very good. Talk about picking a winner blindfolded! The cushions come in 2 types – C for Cover (more coverage) and N for Natural (sheerer) I didn’t know a thing about this. I picked mine in shade C21 because I wear C21 in Iope and I assumed therefore it must be the same! LOL! ? Sunscreen protection : SPF50+ PA+++ I’m not sure why I kept this section in, because all Korean Cushion foundations come with high SPF rating. That said, if you’re using a cushion foundation in place of sunscreen , come, let me smack you ? However, what is good about cushion foundations, is their portability and lightweight texture, like this one, so you can use it as a touch up for your sunscreen through the day, or to touch up your makeup in the afternoons after it’s faded off a little. The lightweight texture feels comfortable, and the light-medium coverage means you can boost your base makeup, if you have to, for the evenings. As I’ve noted, many Korean brand cushion foundations use zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in their ingredients which are physical UV blockers. These are my preferred choice of UV protection and I’m happy to see them in this one as well. The Packaging & Refills The Hera UV Mist Cushion comes in a box with a sealed refill and sponge. Quite normal for a mid-high end Korean brand cushion. The compact is a little thick with a nice heft, and a pretty pearlescent sheen to the white parts, and a subtle lilac tone to the metallic parts. The case is like a donut with a cover, so you clip the refill into place and it fits nicely without any rattling. I find that the cover clips and stays shut and it is otherwise just a well-constructed compact. I will note also that Hera is a brand under the large Amore Pacific brand umbrella, and their refills fit nicely into the cases for Sulwhasoo and Iope. In that sense, they are all interchangeable, and I notice this flexibility in the higher-end Korean cushions, not in the lower end ones, as we have seen with Innisfree and Laneige . The Cushion The cushion for the Hera UV Mist Cushion is fairly traditional, being the flat porous sponge that we have seen from the start. The cushion is dense and firm, and seems to hold the product well. I do find that I have to press the sponge into the cushion a little to pick up product, but due to the texture of the product, you don’t need that much each time, so it isn’t a problem for me. I’ve been using this one quite a while and quite often, and it hasn’t shown signs of drying out yet. The Sponge Puff Again, this was a category I kept in from the previous Cushion Foundation Week series, and I’m not sure why, because the Koreans know their sponge puff applicators! This Hera one is no exception. I will tell you right here right now, that for best effect, ALWAYS USE THE SPONGE PUFF! The Hera UV Mist Cushion puff has a purple base and mine is quite well used as you can see. It is a little soft, but with a surface density that has a nice bounce on the skin. TO USE: Slip your fingers through the loop (it only accommodates 3 fingers for me so I find it a little small), dab the sponge on the surface of the cushion (you can see this is just 1 dab) and then dab it on your skin, in a press and roll motion. Press on skin, and roll it off. It helps the foundation adhere better to your skin. Like the Laneige BB Cushion , I find that the density of the puff surface is such that it doesn’t absorb the product too quickly, and the texture of the product is such that I can cover about 1/3 to 1/2 of my face with just 1 dab of cushion foundation. I then go over the areas where I want better coverage. This actually makes application faster and more even than with multiple dabs of product. Texture, Coverage & Finish This is where the Hera UV Mist Cushion really shines for me, and made me fall in love with this. Before trying this, I was quite enamoured with the Sulwhasoo cushion. I still like it, but I’d pick Hera in a heartbeat! The texture of the Hera UV Mist Cushion is lightweight and feels like nothing on the skin. I do find that it offers medium coverage straight from the sponge, but it is also because I’m using the Cover version, in #C21. I am assuming the Natural (N) version would be a little sheerer, but without testing, I cannot say for sure. All I can say is that I LOVE the coverage, because that was always a bit of a bone of contention with me and BB Cushion Foundations. The name UV Mist implies that this one is more moisturising, and it feels very comfortable on my skin. However, I do not find it particularly dewy or glowy, which is what I like. I am not a big fan of the shiny faced look, no matter how in-trend it may be. Shiny skin doesn’t quite translate into healthy skin for me, especially with our heat and humidity here. I can understand how it is appealing in a cooler, colder, drier climate like in Korea. This one sets very comfortably on skin to a semi matte texture, and importantly for me, stays put for most of the day without fading or slipping off. If anything, it looks better as the day wears on. WHAT IS THIS SORCERY?! ? In these before-after pictures, I’m wearing the Hera UV Mist Cushion in Shade #C21 . This is just the Hera UV Mist Cushion – nothing else. I love the coverage, which is medium-full, yet transparent, if there’s such a thing. It isn’t thick or cakey on skin, and it covers up redness and evens out my skin tone, but also allows my natural skin to come through. Pigmentation or blemish marks aren’t covered 100%, but enough that I’m comfortable with them. If I layer on product, it just looks better. Not heavy, not unnatural, not fake. Seriously guys, this is one of the best bases I’ve come across today, whether cushion foundation or liquid foundation! I get crazy compliments every time I use it – smooth glowing skin being the most popular – and I usually get that when I wear my Cle de Peau foundation (another star product). The difference is that this is a fraction of the price of the CdP! ? If I want a more flawless visage, I use this trifecta that I swear, is a game-changer. Use this trick that I teach you here , using these 3 products – Nars Creamy Concealer dabbed where you need it, Hera UV Mist Cushion all over, and then a light dusting of the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder in Diffused just to set. It is all very thin layers, but the effect is stunning, flawless, natural looking skin that looks better as the day wears on. Not cakey, and it doesn’t even look like you’re wearing makeup! Now you know my little secret! ? If I had to give up all my cushions, I’d fight you to keep this one. I never ever thought I’d ever say this of a BB Cushion foundation! Shade selection Shade selection is fairly poor, which I believe is because this is primarily a Korean based brand. So, there are only 2 shades available #21 and #23 for light and medium in 2 types of coverage – C for more coverage that I use, and N for a sheerer coverage. With this limited shade selection, I’d peg this as one for those with light to light-medium skintone only. Nothing much deeper or you risk looking ashy. Scent Yes, there is a slight floral scent that reminds me of the scent in Laneige, except it’s lighter so it doesn’t bug me. If you’re sensitive to fragrance in skin products then be wary. Do I like this? Didn’t I say I’d fight you to keep this one? So yes, I bloody love this cushion. It makes me look so good each time I use it, and I honestly cannot get over it. This isn’t easy to find, so I will have a second best option for you in the coming days, that is easier to obtain locally and comes in slightly deeper shades too ? I don’t know if my opinion of using BB Cushion Foundations have changed due to the improved condition of my skin, but hey, I’m never too old to say I’m happy to change my mind! ? IN A NUTSHELL The Hera UV Mist Cushion SPF50+ PA+++ is very good. If you can find a shade match, get it because you will love it too. The packaging is sturdy and elegant, the texture is lightweight on skin and does not slip off nor fade, the coverage is out of this world for a cushion foundation, and so natural besides. I don’t think I’ve anything bad to say about this one! PROS: Lightweight texture feels featherlight on skin, Evens out skintone very naturally, Low to high coverage depending on how much you use, Easy to use, Has a semi-matte finish on skin that is not too shiny, Not drying nor oily, High sunscreen protection, Portable packaging, Comes with a refill which makes it value for money CONS: Scented, Some people may not like the sponge for application or hygiene purposes, I don’t mind, Sponge feels a little small, Hard to get but nothing against the product! WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes using cushion foundations, Anyone who is new to using cushion foundations, Anyone who wants a higher coverage cushion foundation that gives a beautiful smooth and flawless finish on skin PRICE: US$40-50 for a box containing 1 case & 2 refills. Prices will vary depending on where you buy from as it is available on many different websites WHERE TO BUY: I bought mine on Strawberrynet , but I’ve since seen it on iHerb for less (on offer! Code MPW213 gives you an additional 10% off) so I’ll buy mine there next, Peach & Lily , Amazon and various other websites or Korean sites if you know where to look If you’re interested in what’s in there, here’s the ingredient list Sea silt extract, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, cyclopentasiloxane, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, PEG-10 dimethicone, butylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, phenyl trimethicone, cyclohexasiloxane, butylene glycol, arbutin, lauryl PEG-9 polydimethylsiloxyethyl dimethicone, dimethicone, myrciaria dubia fruit extract, chenopodium quinoa seed extract, euterpe oleracea fruit extract, ilex paraguariensis leaf extract, prunus mume fruit extract, acrylates/ethylhexyl acrylate/dimethicone methacrylate copolymer, acrylates/stearyl acrylate/dimethicone methacrylate copolymer, dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, polyhydroxystearic acid, aluminum hydroxide, trisiloxane, stearic acid, triethoxycaprylylsilane, silica HDI/trimethylol hexyllactone crosspolymer, ethylhexyl palmitate, lecithin, isostearic acid, isopropyl palmitate, polysorbate 80, polymethyl methacrylate, disteardimonium hectorite, polyglyceryl-3 polyricinoleate, hydrogenated lecithin, ethylhexylglycerin, trimethylsiloxysilicate, silica, sodium chloride, sorbic acid, phenoxyethanol, disodium EDTA, CI77492, CI77491, CI77499, fragrance Have you tried this Hera UV Mist Cushion? Any other Hera products I should try? It’s hard for me to get Hera products outside of Korea, but I hear that Hera actually makes quite many varieties of their cushion foundation, and UV Mist is just one of them. Incidentally also, they have just revamped this one in 2016, and naturally I haven’t tried it. But I hope they’ve kept the awesomeness, because I want to continue using this one, which I’ll buy wherever I can get it from! ? Paris B More cushion foundations can be found in this category .']"

When I find a brand that works, I tend to try to stay with it, and I rarely if ever use anything below SPF50 PA+++ Honestly, in our tropical weather and being so near the Equator, I think anything less is just not enough. But this isn’t going to be a discussion about SPF. I’ll leave that to the experts (which I will not profess to be). I’d just like to tell you about a sunscreen I’ve been hmming and hawing over the past couple of months, a little unsure about how I feel about it. Ultimately, I like it but there are a couple of things that does make me pause when I consider a repurchase. The sunscreen in question is the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF 50+ PA+++ which I believe replaces something similar currently in their line up. I have heard a lot of good things about Shiseido sun care products but I never tried them because I’ll be honest, I got confused. They have a range with blue bottles, they have a range with white bottles, and they have loads of sub-brands. Which do I choose?! Well this is the one I’m using – the one that comes in a white 50ml bottle. The slightly odd bulging shape of the bottle is quite recognizable as coming from Shiseido. And notice how keen Shiseido is to be Perfect in everything they make? Perfect Foundation , Perfect Foundation Brush , Perfect Mascara … and now Perfect UV Protector LOL! The bottle isn’t a flat white, but has a slight iridescence to it, which is quite nice. Packaging, no matter what anyone says, is as important as performance. And this one performs very well. It claims to be a very water resistant formula, that shields skin from UVA and UVB rays with SPF50+ and PA+++ protection. On top of that, the formula is light and absorbs very quickly, leaving a matte finish so skin does not feel oily, clogged, sticky or anything that might make you dislike using sunscreen. I must say that it does deliver on many accounts. You have to shake the bottle before use and the product dispenses through a nozzle. It makes it easy to control so I’m good with it. When I apply sunscreen, I go by the “1 finger 1 portion of face” method. I squeeze out a generous dollop of product and apply on cheeks, forehead, nose and chin, working area by area. That’s 5 dollops in all applied in sequence, blending in as I go. I am quite particular about it, so I try to make sure that all my skin is covered. I’ve swatched it here to show you what the lotion looks like (I know, a sunscreen swatch. Whatever next?!) Straight out of the tube, the lotion is quite thin but not very runny. It will hold its shape as you can see here. The white lotion has a slight iridescent tint to it, but it is very light. When blended into my skin, it disappears. There is no white cast and it does feel matte to the touch. There is no shine either but it does not feel powdery or drying as many sunscreens of a similar texture feel. That’s my biggest concern with Japanese lotion type sunscreens. I tend not to use them because whilst they are light, they have a tendency to be a bit drying and make my skin feel dry and “papery”. This one does not make my face feel that way so it is very comfortable and here’s another benefit – it is an excellent base for makeup. Seriously, I have no need for any other base, because foundation sits very well on this, and lasts without producing too much shine. Another way I “test” my sunscreen is to wear it when I know I’m out in the sun or outdoors a lot. I find that with this, my skin doesn’t turn red, nor does it feel hot. My pigmentation also seems to be under control, not multiplying by the day. I also used it on my arms and I noticed that over the past 2 months or so, my arms have stopped tanning. I drive around, so although my face is protected most of the time, I am a bit lax about my arms and they are usually darker than the rest of me. But recently, I noticed that the skin on my arms looked better. Not as tanned and they don’t get blotchy and red when I’m out and about. Win! So far so good right? Well what’s not so good then? The scent. There is a light floral sort of scent and a slightly sharp under note that makes me think of alcohol. It dissipates, but it bothered me to the extent that I was hesitant to repurchase due to that sharp note. I’m still weighing it up because I do like how this sunscreen seems to be doing much more for my skin than many previous ones I’ve tried. I put this on a head to head test with a previous fave – Clarins UV Plus HP and I felt my skin burn with the Clarins after an outing, but in similar conditions, this one felt fine. If you are wondering, yes, I applied each on each half of my face so that’s how I knew LOL! Another thing I’m a bit iffy about is the texture. On my face, it seems to work well. It doesn’t feel too drying and because I use a makeup remover everyday, everything is taken off. But on my arms, its quite a different story. I found after about a week, that soap isn’t quite sufficient to remove it. I could still feel a bit of a “layer” on my skin and water droplets would just slide off. But when I applied a thin layer of oil cleanser to it, then it felt cleaner and water would actually spread on my skin. Also, I found the need to use a body lotion/body oil daily or the skin on my arms would feel a bit dry otherwise. But the skin on my arms look clearer and better and not as tanned! So that’s the other toss up. I’m one of those who isn’t afraid of sunscreen feeling a bit oily on my skin or of cream based sunscreen. So products like La Roche Posay and Kiehl’s sunscreen work for me even if they turn a little oily over the day. Yet, if I complained about the price of the Kiehl’s sunscreen before (RM140/30ml) then this Shiseido one makes more economic sense at RM130/50ml. So there’s my conundrum. I like how this performs, in particular in how my skin seems to have benefited from regular use of this – less sun damage, matte feel, does not feel hot after being out in the sun but yet I’m a little iffy about the sharp note in the scent, texture and price. Conundrum indeed! In a nutshell The Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF50+ PA+++ is a liquid lotion sunscreen with high sunscreen protection and a light feel on the skin. It leaves no white cast and does not break me out at all which is surprising because it contains zinc oxide. My skin seems to have benefited from using this over about 2 months. Sun damage seems minimized (less tanning), skin does not feel warm after being out in the sun and the texture is very light and comfortable on the skin. It seems to live up to its water resistant claims because droplets of water just seem to slide off my skin. As a result, I have to use a cleansing oil on my arms to ensure the sunscreen is properly removed. Its a bit curious but there you go. I do like this one very much. If I can get over my hang ups I will repurchase when I’m done, because my skin seems to have benefited from it. Pros: Light texture, Matte feel on skin, Skin does not turn red or warm, Tanning is minimized, Excellent makeup base Cons: Floral scent with a bit of a sharp note, Pricey for first investment, A little drying on arms Who will like this: Anyone who wants a sunscreen with high UVA and UVB protection, Anyone who wants a sunscreen that feels light on the skin with no white cast and makes a good makeup base, Anyone who wants a sunscreen that does not make the skin turn oily throughout the day Here is the ingredient list for those interested. My primary concern when trying this sunscreen was the presence of Zinc Oxide. My skin dislikes Zinc Oxide and will usually break out when a sunscreen uses this as its blocker. When I started using it, I did experience some minor spots but after 2 months I can safely say its not attributable to this sunscreen because I haven’t had any serious breakouts since. No clogged pores either. After about 2 months and with daily use on face and arms, I am just slightly over halfway through the bottle. I suppose on a cost-per-wear basis, the RM130 goes a much longer way than other sunscreens in a similar category ? If you didn’t already know, good sun protection products and practices are the best anti-aging treatment you can have. UV rays damage the skin and can cause it to look older than it really is. Till today, I gasp in mild horror whenever someone tells me that they don’t use sunscreen for whatever reason. There are loads of different products with different textures in the market. I’m sure there’s one for everyone ? Do you use sunscreens from Shiseido or have you tried this by any chance? Its been out for a couple of months but as I have noted, it is a revamp of an existing one. I used to be recommended sunscreens by Shiseido everytime I asked but as I said, I never knew which to try. So since I’ve tried this one, I can safely say that it gets the thumbs up for sun protection, provided you get past the scent ?

Grit your teeth and hope for the best, while ensuring you have at least 1 bottle left as back up; or run around screaming “The sky is falling! The world is ending!” and buy up all the products you can find to stockpile into the next century. Unfortunately, with sunscreen, there’s a shelf life that you’d be well advised to observe (2 years, after which they degrade I’m told) so when it’s a favourite sunscreen that is being replaced, I sob a little into my pillow, grit my teeth and hope for the best. And with a lot of melodrama, that was how I felt when I was told that this Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF50+ PA++++ Wet Force would be replacing my daily staple, the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF50+ PA++++ . What’s the difference? Well, other than the fact that one bottle is white and the other blue, you mean? ? You see, it’s kind of funny the U-turn that Shiseido did when it came to their packaging. Shiseido’s suncare range was always this bright blue with orange trim before this. Always. I didn’t try it back then, because I was into other brands. But when they revamped their formula and launched the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF50+ PA++++ it came in a a white bottle with blue trim (they also have one with grey trim that I’ve not used). I’m not sure if you can get this outside of Asia so if you know, please holler! 3 years later, Shiseido has come full circle by going back to their blue and orange packaging with their improvements to the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF50+ PA++++ by adding what they call “Wet Force technology”. What they claim, is that their already very efficient and very good sunscreen is now boosted by contact with water! So, instead of fretting that your sunscreen is deteriorating when you sweat or go for a swim, we are assured that moisture (whether through perspiration or water) boosts the sun protection efficacy of the product, as the negative ions in the product bond with positive ions in perspiration and water, to create an even more water repellent layer to boost protection to 124%. Numbers, they are impressive no? Truth be told, it sounds pretty amazing, especially because when its time to whip out the sunscreen, the odds will be that you will be going somewhere hot, or humid or you are planning to get sweaty or wet. Erm… yeah ? For us who live where it’s hot and humid all the time, and where stepping out for 5 seconds leaves us melting into a puddle of perspiration, this sounds pretty much like a God-send. But the fact is, we can’t really tell if it’s working. I mean, it’s great if it does, but I wouldn’t put too much hope in it you know? So, be diligent and reapply your sunscreen every 2 hours or so if you’re out in the sun, or perhaps less often if you’re not. Because it’s inconvenient, I actually don’t reapply my sunscreen during the day if I’m indoors, but then I don’t go out into the sun either. For me therefore, if this “wet force” technology works, then all well and good. What was more important to me, as a fervent and loyal user of the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF50+ PA++++ (sans wet force) was, whether it would still remain my HG sunscreen. Would it slide off my face? Will it dry me out the way many Japanese brand sunscreens do? Will this new formula break me out? Happily, the answer is no it doesn’t. It feels the same on my skin as its previous incarnation in the white bottle. The texture is pretty much the same as before, even down to the slight pink iridescence in the product you squeeze out after diligently shaking up the bottle. It still serves as an excellent makeup base for me so I still eschew using a primer; and it seems to protect my skin as well as its predecessor. I judge this by the fact that my pigmentation does not get worse nor do I burn nor turn red after sun exposure. So I suppose my melodrama was for nought. I am still a huge fan of this Shiseido sunscreen which I’ve convinced numerous people to use, all of whom love it, despite the price tag. If there’s one thing I’m loathe to stinge on, it’s my sunblock. So, I’m sure there are budget options out there (and I do want to find one ever since I found out that my other budget favourite by Hada Labo has been discontinued ) but I’m picky so it’s a slow process. I guess for the time being, I’m still holding on to this. Yes, it’s still pricey and yes, I know I’ll be tightening my belt to repurchase this, as I have been every couple of months as I run out. I’ve been through uncountable bottles of this and my wallet would like me better if I found a cheaper substitute! ? IN A NUTSHELL The Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF50 PA++++ Wet Force is said to be an improvement on the previous incarnation that came in a white bottle. As the white bottle is my daily sunscreen and has been for the past few years, I find no discernible difference in texture or performance of this new Wet Force version so I’m happy to continue using it. It acts as a good makeup base (primer), does not turn oily nor dry out my skin and protects my skin well. HG material levelled up! PROS: Compact packaging is portable, Does not dry out my skin, Does not turn oily or greasy, Absorbs well and makes a very good makeup base, Protects my skin well from the sun and uv rays CONS: Pricey WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who doesn’t like sunscreen that feels thick or oily on skin Here’s the ingredient list for anyone interested. I’ve included the ingredient list for the previous version, which to my untrained eye looks fairly similar, except that the order of the ingredients are a little different. It might explain why it feels the same to me ? Have you been using the Shiseido Perfect UV sunscreen before this? Ever since I was introduced to the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector I’ve looked at no other. I mean, why look further when you’ve already found your Holy Grail right? ? I’m happy the reformulation hasn’t changed that for me. Finding a new sunscreen can be quite a pain! ?

Are you tired of me banging on about using sunscreen daily already? Well, sorry babes, gonna keep banging on about it! With the huge selection of affordable sunscreen on our shores, there really is no excuse not to use it. I have my favourite one and its pricey, I acknowledge, but for those on a tighter budget (and that includes me because I’ve just put myself on a beauty diet!) here are some new and affordable alternatives from Mentholatum. Mentholatum brought in their Skin Aqua sunscreen a few years ago and like many Japanese style sunscreen, it has a very lovely light emulsion texture that makes wearing it very comfortable. For some reason, the Japanese have done for sunscreen what few Western brands have managed to do – make sunscreen comfortable to wear! Previously, we had the Skin Aqua UV Moisture Milk but now there are another 2 products in their arsenal. The Skin Aqua UV Silky Smooth Milk SPF50 PA+++ and Skin Aqua UV Whitening Moisture Milk SPF50 PA+++ priced at an affordable RM35.90 each. As part of the Skin Aqua sunscreen range, the products contain hyaluronic acid to keep skin moist and zinc oxide operates as one of the UV blockers. Zinc Oxide is well known to be one of the best UV blockers because it is a physical blocker that blocks both UVA and UVB rays very effectively. Unfortunately, I belong in the very small minority of the world’s population that breaks out from products that contain high zinc oxide content. Frustrating? Yes. I broke out a little from the previous Skin Aqua UV Moisture Milk so I am leery about trying either of these new versions. The pink UV Silky Smooth Milk has a light lotion texture and leaves skin looking and feeling smooth and shine free as it contains oil absorbing powder. So this one appears targeted at those with oily skin. The white UV Whitening Moisture Milk has a similar lightweight lotion texture and as the name implies not only protects skin from the harmful UV rays, it also acts to brighten and even out skintone. Not so sure about that, but these are the claims. Since I can’t use these on my face, I will instead be using them on my arms. That’s what I have been doing with all my other sunscreens that I find I can’t use or don’t want to use because I’d much rather use my favourite. It’s a good way to use them up and my arms get as good protection as my face does – win! ? Another 2 new products in the Mentholatum Sunplay stable are the Sunplay Water Cool Body Mist Sunblock with SPF75 PA+++ (RM49.90) and the Sunplay After Sun Gel (RM26.90) . The After Sun Gel is essentially aloe vera gel which serves a variety of functions, not just to soothe your skin after going out in the sun. If you go out in the sun a lot, then it is useful having this on hand because I have learned over the years that aloe vera gel is one of the best things to use on skin that is overexposed to the sun. Sometimes, we may forget to reapply our sunscreen or just don’t have the chance to or if you are the sort who are out and about a lot, and find your skin getting red and irritated, this gel will come in handy to cool and soothe the skin. The Watery Cool Body Mist Sunblock is one I don’t quite like. Yes, I tested this and I have tested something similar a while back . This is an aerosol spray can and you spray it all over your arms and legs in lieu of applying sunscreen all over your body. From a practical point of view, this is very practical when you are out and about and want to top up your body sunscreen. It sprays out a fine mist that does cool your skin quite rapidly so on a hot day, its quite fun. Unlike the previous incarnation, this one didn’t leave an oily feel on my skin, but it made my skin feel dry instead. If there is one thing I dislike about most Sunplay sunscreens that come in the colourful bottles is that they leave my skin feeling papery dry. This one is no exception. My skin felt papery dry and I didn’t like it. So, I like the cool mist but not the after feel. Probably fun to use, but I’d rather just stick to regular lotion sunscreens. Are you already using Sunplay Skin Aqua sunscreens? Do you have a favourite from the pharmacy brands? Apparently, the Skin Aqua sunscreens are the No. 1 selling sunscreens in Malaysia! I’m not surprised because they are affordable and comfortable to use. For something that you go through quickly, being affordable is always a plus point! I can’t use these on my face because I break out so my favourite pharmacy brand would have to be the Hada Labo ones . You?

Every time I mention sunscreen, inevitably, someone will pop up and say “Is there a cheaper option that’s just as good at the Shiseido one you recommend?” and inevitably, I’ll say “I’m afraid I have not found one.” Well, now I have. Almost. Ladies and gents, may I present to you the Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Aqua Booster SPF50+ PA++++ that steps up to the plate as a more affordable option to the sunscreen that, in an Apocalypse, you’ll have to pry from my stiff dead fingers . There is one snag – there always is – us poor sods here in Malaysia have no local access to it. ( UPDATE FEB 2018: The Shiseido Anessa sunscreens have been spotted in selected Watson’s stores in Malaysia. Keep your eyes peeled!) Cue a cacophony of wailing and beating of breasts in anguish ? I’d heard of the Shiseido Anessa sunscreen for a while but had never tried any, for the simple reason because it was not available locally. It is however, available in neighbouring countries and in most other Asian countries. This bottle was kindly gifted to me by a reader, Liz, whom I met earlier this year. I must say that I’ve thoroughly enjoyed meeting readers over the months, some of whom have become friends ? Liz was a girl after my own heart, for she knew I was a sucker for sunscreen, and she told me she enjoyed using this one, and wanted me to see if I liked it. Well Liz, I do and now, I’m bummed that it isn’t as easily available here haha ? Anessa is a subsidiary brand of skincare giant, Shiseido, and there are a few different types of sunscreen available. This Annessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Aqua Booster comes in a gold bottle, with yellow plastic packaging, and boasts SPF50+ PA++++ UVA/UVB protection. I believe this is the highest protection in the brand. Like most Japanese brand sunscreens, the texture is light, like a lotion. However, if you prefer watery type textures, then you will not like this one, for this has a heavier milky-lotion texture. Compared to the Shiseido Perfect UV, I find this texture a little heavier. It is rather comparable to the Shiseido Perfect UV Hydrofresh formula, although that one is heavier. So, this sits somewhere in the middle. You may notice how it is a little runny. If you click over to the Shiseido Perfect UV Hydrofresh review , you can see that that one is thicker. This one reminds me a lot of the Shiseido Perfect UV Face & Body (Europe version) in terms of texture. You must shake it up before use, and it feels comfortable. While the creamier texture will lead you to believe that only a little is required to cover your face, I must disagree with this notion. Unlike a face cream, where this statement might hold true, this is NOT TRUE with sunscreen. With sunscreen, you need enough to protect your skin. A THIN LAYER OF SUNSCREEN IS NOT ENOUGH! And I’m frankly tired of people who spread this disinformation. I use a very generous amount all over. My gauge is very simple. One finger’s length of sunscreen for EACH section of my face i.e. cheeks, forehead, nose and chin, down to my neck and chest. Not one tiny dollop to cover my whole face. That said, having had to battle pigmentation problems, I am probably more aware than most of how reactive my skin can be to the sun, and so I take greater pains to protect myself. I find the texture comfortable. But I do have drier skin, which might explain why. But more importantly, I find that this Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Aqua Boost sunscreen offers me sufficient protection from the sun. How do I gauge this? By the fact that my skin does not react by heating up when I’m out in full sun, and by my not developing more pigmentation spots caused by the sun unlike this useless P.O.S . Is it as good as my holy grail Shiseido Perfect UV Protector? Well, it’s close. I do still think the Shiseido Perfect UV makes a better primer, and texturally, feels better on the skin. It is not as heavy as this Anessa Aqua Boost sunscreen and it doesn’t smell as strongly of alcohol. Comparing the ingredient lists side by side also throws up a lot of similarities between both the formula, which is encouraging. I will observe that this, like the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector, offers both physical (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) and chemical (octixonate, octocrylene, uvinul A plus, tinosorb S) UV protection. I always go for a formula that offers both, or at the minimum, physical UV protection, as I have little faith in only chemical UV filters. I hesitate to call this a “cheaper option” to the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector, but it is more affordable and comes in a 60ml bottle. You can get it in Singapore at Watson’s for S$39.90, and also in Thailand Watson’s (THB859), Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan, if you’re heading there. Look in the pharmacies (drugstores). For us sad sods in Malaysia, your best bet will be to travel, or have family or friends buy it for you when they travel. You have the option of buying it online of course (there always is). I have seen it on sites like Lazada and 11 Street but I have no confidence in these sort of sites , and no confidence in their sellers when it comes to beauty products. Buy at your own risk, but I personally will not. Personally therefore I will not recommend them. I will also suggest sites like Sasa or Cosme-de, both of which I have better faith in as I’ve purchased from them before. Sasa in particular, is big enough to be trusted. However, I have my reservations about buying sunscreen online (although I have before). Unless there is an indication, you do not know how close to expiry a product is, or how old their stocks are, and how they are stored. With some skincare, it may not matter. With sunscreen, it is very important that the product is fresh, because the ingredients that protect your skin will break down over time. The closer it gets to expiry, the less protection it gives your skin. 2 years from manufacture is a recommended cut-off period for optimum sunscreen ingredient preservation. So, buying online is an option, but do so at your own risk. Because I am so particular about my sunscreen, I no longer buy online, nor do I hoard product, and now suck it up and buy at counters for freshest product, even if it means paying top dollar for a good one. IN A NUTSHELL The Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Aqua Booster SPF50+ PA++++ is a more affordable sunscreen, as compared to my regular recommendation from the same mother company. I find the texture more creamy than the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector, but lighter than the Hydrofresh option. It is a creamy milk-lotion texture that might suit drier skin types better, due to the amount you should use for best UV protection. I do like this formula very much. It is comfortable on my skin, and it offers my skin the protection I need and is supposed to be water resistant. My skin does not heat up even with intense sun exposure, and my skin seems to be well protected from reacting to UV exposure (I don’t develop new sun spots). It is not cheap in the truest sense of the word, but it is more affordable than the department store option. If I had better access to it, I will be happy to switch over. For Malaysians, you can buy it online, but read above, my thoughts on shopping for sunscreen online. You decide for yourself. As for me, I’ll buy whatever I can get close to hand at any given time. PROS: Comfortable hydrating formula, High UVA and UVB protection, Mix of chemical and physical UV filters, Fairly affordable, Portable size, Protects my skin well from the UV rays CONS: Not available in Malaysia at time of writing Pricey for a pharmacy/drugstore brand, Strong scent of alcohol WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a more affordable but good quality sunscreen with high SPF and UVA/UVB protection PRICE: S$39.90 | THB859 | US$30 or US$40 for 60ml depending on where you look WHERE TO BUY: Watson’s in Singapore and Thailand, Sasa stores in Hong Kong and online , pharmacies (drugstores) in Taiwan, China, Japan etc but not in Malaysia at time of writing, Online at Strawberrynet , Cosme-de , YesStyle For those interested, this is the ingredient list for the Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Aqua Booster.

(Well, some of them anyway. Senka is also by Shiseido and look where that led me!) Well, except for makeup as well, for which Japanese base products, powders, blushes and brushes cannot be surpassed! ? UPDATE: Is the Shiseido Anessa sunscreen better than the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector? I have been using the Shiseido Anessa sunscreen for a while now. I also bought a few bottles when I was in Bangkok because they were on sale, and at the time, unavailable in Malaysia. What I can say after extensive testing, is that my preference still lies with the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector . The texture is more refined, and the scent of alcohol is not as strong. It makes an excellent makeup primer, and feels more comfortable on my skin. More importantly, I feel like it protects my skin better. Having stopped using it for a while, I have noticed an odd pigment spot or two developing. As someone who battles hyperpigmentation, this is a big deal. For this reason, I will be reverting to the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector. This one will do in a pinch, and perhaps for use on my body where I can be more lavish. Have you tried this Shiseido Anessa Aqua Booster sunscreen? Do you like it? Not like it? Wish you could get your hands on it? ? I have very strong views about the online options available, but if you trust them more than I do, then I suppose you can go there. I wouldn’t, so once I’m done, I will go back to my Shiseido Perfect UV Protector, until the opportunity arises for me to get my hands on this one again ? Paris B']"

I’m revising my view. This one has been relegated to No. 3 after this other one ? I go through sunscreens like water. I’ve gone through 2 or is it 3 bottles of my favourite Shiseido Perfect Protector sunscreen and my wallet was killing me! So, when a friend told me to help her pick up a bottle of the Kose Sekkisei Sun Protector N on my last trip to Hong Kong (where it was cheaper than locally) I picked up a bottle for myself. I’d heard a lot about the Kose Sekkisei range which I hear is terribly popular, but I’d only used their cleansing oil which I don’t remember being very impressed with. I believe its the lotion that gets lots of raves but this is the first time I’m trying anything from the brand. What I like is the high SPF50+ PA+++ rating. I rarely use anything below SPF50 but that’s my personal choice. I know of people who can’t tolerate SPF sunscreens or who just don’t believe in anything over SPF30. I’ve had people tell me that SPF15 is more than sufficient but all I’d say is I’ll agree to disagree on this ? After about 2 months of using this Kose Sekkisei Sun Protector N, would I replace my Shiseido sunscreen with this one? Well, lets just say that I’m not ready to give up the Shiseido one just yet, although I’m prepared to alternate the two ? I’d call this my back up sunscreen. Its not to say that this is a bad product. I in fact think its pretty good. You get a 60ml compact bottle of product which is pretty generous. Like many Japanese brand sunscreens, you do have to shake up the bottle before squeezing it out from the handy nozzle. However, unlike many Japanese sunscreens the product squeezes out a rather creamy milky lotion that is quite hydrating on my skin and I like how that feels. I like that because it makes it very easy to spread and importantly, it does not leave a dry papery feel on my skin. My beef with Japanese sunscreen. It in fact, almost feels like I’m applying a moisturiser on skin which makes it feel very comfortable, and it isn’t drying at all. Apparently, this product also has whitening effects and helps prevent uneven skintone etc but if I’m to be perfectly honest, my skin looks the same as it did 2 months before I started using this. So in terms of efficacy for skintone correction, I’d say this doesn’t hit the mark. As sun protection, as I can’t measure it, I’d just have to assume that its working if my dark spots don’t get any darker. However, I also find that it does not give me as good a base for makeup as the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector does. It takes a little while to absorb into skin and while comfortable, just doesn’t perform well as a makeup base. So, if I want to have my makeup looking better for longer without using a primer/base, I still have to use the Shiseido Perfect UV. Its compact and easy to tote about and 60ml is generous especially when I’m as generous with my use of it. So, if I can get this at the price I did in HK (it cost me under RM100 there) I can consider using this as my backup sunscreen. But my primary one will still be the one from Shiseido for ticking the right boxes, even if it ticks my wallet off ? In a nutshell The Kose Sekkisei Sun Protector N SPF50+ PA+++ is a sunscreen with high UVA and UVB protection factor which is useful for our hot weather. The product comes in a generous sized 60ml bottle and the texture is a creamy milky lotion which is very comfortable on skin. You do have to shake it up before use to ensure the product is mixed up properly. I had no problems using this – no breakouts or white casts, but I did not find it giving me as good a base under makeup as it did the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector. I will use this as an alternate product but I will go back to the Shiseido as my primary sunscreen. Pros: Light textured and easily absorbed, High UVA and UVB protection Cons: Does not make a good enough base for makeup, Did not work to even out skintone or whiten as alleged Who will like this: Anyone who wants a milky lotion textured sunscreen with high UVA and UVB protection I picked this up from Hong Kong where I’ve found this range to be cheaper there. Sasa and Bonjour stores have it but its among the pricier items in the store so if you don’t see it, ask the SA. However, it sometimes comes in a pack with a mask or a lotion which makes it better value than if you buy it on its own. I think mine came with a lotion but I can’t, for the life of me, find it now ? Also, there’s no ingredient list because I can’t find my box anymore ? Have you tried anything from the Kose Sekkisei range? Have you tried this sunscreen before? I’ve always been rather curious about the Kose Sekkisei range but I’ve never really tried anything from it because I tend to over look it. Its not a cheap brand, but neither is it a very expensive product range so if you have recommendations on any must trys, please share! ?

Fascinating. Does suede have a smell other than it just being leather? I was quite intrigued by it and took a healthy sniff of it at the preview launch a little while ago. Not available yet folks! Look for it in stores in September. The thing that hit me was how floral it was. I don’t know what peonies smell like and I won’t pretend to. I don’t know what suede smells like either because the last suede item I own has fallen apart. Suede doesn’t hold up as well as regular treated leather, for me. But to me, suede will smell of leather. So the idea here is for the scent to open up with a sweet floral and dry down to that of a musky leather. Sadly, it didn’t smell like that on me when I spritz it on my skin. That’s the thing about fragrances you know. The description can sell it to you, but then you spritz it on your skin and you go “Whaa…??? What was THAT?!” During the product launch, I tested the scent on my skin and I will say that I don’t smell any leather at all, not even after it has had the opportunity to dry down on my skin hours later. The overwhelming scent I received was flowers. Lots and lots of flowers. On my other wrist, I sprayed my favourite Pomegranate Noir. That one left me feeling all warm and cozy and in the words of a friend who was there – sexy and mysterious. Peony & Blush Suede left me feeling…. normal. It basically evoked no feelings in me save that it smelled nice, if it wasn’t on me. The description tells you to expect a burst of red apples at the top followed by roses and peonies and then drying down to warm leather. I get a sweet fruity opening and a floral note but that’s where it stops for me. I don’t get the warm feeling I associate with leather. I see myself in a flower garden surrounded by flowers and my car smelled of flowers as I drove but the dry down was almost boring on me. My personality is such that I don’t pay well with strong, sweet, floral, feminine scents and it is for this reason that I knew that the Jo Malone Peony & Blush Suede fragrance will not be one for me. Now, we know that Jo Malone scents are made so you can layer them, and suggested pairings are English Pear & Freesia and Orange Blossom. I can’t test them seeing as I don’t have a sample of the Peony & Blush Suede on hand, but you can always go to the boutique in September and get a whiff of it and see if it’s you. What I did like however, was the scent itself in the air and for that, I may consider investing in one of the candles. I love scented candles for the home and one of my favourite candles scents now accompanies me to sleep every night. It relaxes me and the flickering light from the candle is comforting as I read. The smell of the Peony & Blush Suede candle does freshen up a room or your house infusing it with a very lovely fresh floral scent. Candles are a perfect way to clear your house of musty scents or just to freshen up the room as you unwind after a long day. I have an unhealthy obsession with them hehe… ? I had to get this out quickly because chances are that by September, I’d have forgotten what Peony & Blush Suede smells like and whether I liked it, without being able to refresh my memory. As of now, I’d say this isn’t a scent for me. I can’t tell if it’ll grow on me for now. I like trying to persevere through a week of wearing just 1 scent to know if I’d like it on me so maybe I’ll try for a sample when it launches, or maybe not. I generally prefer warmer, spicier, woody scents with a hint of light florals. You could say, a more masculine scent suits me better than a soft feminine floral. Full on floral gives me a headache and sweet scents make me nauseous. Maybe it’s just my personality. I’m not very sweet nor feminine LOL! ? Does the Jo Malone Peony & Blush Suede fragrance sound like something you might like? I honestly do think many women will like this one. Everyone was cooing over how lovely and feminine it is as a scent and if you are the sort who loves floaty pink dresses, twirling flowers in your long hair and wearing soft pink lipstick, or just like soft feminine floral scents in general, I think you’d like Peony & Blush Suede ? Sitting here in my jeans, running my fingers through my short hair and having red lipstick on, it just isn’t quite me ?

This troubles me and my wallet, because sunscreen is something I don’t skimp on in terms of use, and something I run through quite quickly. Often, when I make this lament, I’m requested to try something cheaper. Often, one brand that pops up quite frequently, is Senka. Incidentally, Senka is one of the drugstore brands under the Shiseido umbrella. One day, when I was at a Watson’s store, I noticed that Senka products were on sale. They had a few different types of sunscreen on offer, but I noticed one called the Senka Mineral UV Essence SPF50+ PA++++ . I included the packaging in this shot so you know what it looks like. I find that pharmacy brands tend to have different packaging or more simplistic packaging, and that can sometimes make it harder to identify a product. This is more so when the tube itself is very plain, with everything on it written in Japanese. Without the backing card, I’d have no idea what it says! The real reason I picked up the Senka Mineral UV Essence sunscreen is because it boasts high UVA and UVB protection, while promising a light texture and more importantly, only set me back a mere RM20 (US$5). I. KID. YOU. NOT! OK, it was on sale. But it regularly retails for RM39.90 (under US$10) for 50g. Hey, it was worth an experiment! ? After using it for a while, and before I sat down to pen my thoughts, I did a quick search online. Much to my surprise, this Senka Mineral UV Essence sunscreen is very highly raved. Leaving aside those who got comped, there was still a sizeable part of the Asian Beauty skincare community who loved this sunscreen. Ok, here’s the rub. I don’t. It isn’t the texture. I quite like the texture, which is heavier and more creamy. My drier skin likes it because it sits on my skin very comfortably. In a dry or cold environment, you may like it as well, as it will feel more comfortable. If you live in the tropics and have oily skin, don’t pick this one. You will use too little, and it will not do its job properly. You see, as I repeat ad nauseum , you need to wear enough sunscreen. Enough means a liberal amount to cover every bit of exposed skin on your face (and body). In my case, I apply one finger’s length (I use my 3rd finger which is the longest) to each part of my face. I am liberal with my use. I believe it’s the only thing keeping my sunspots at bay. If you have oily skin and pick this one, you will wear very little, because it will feel uncomfortable. You then aren’t using enough, and may as well not bother. Texture-wise therefore, I am happy with this. It has a lotion-cream texture and feels comfortable (on drier skin). My makeup sits well over, and there is no white cast (the composition is why as you’ll see below). Why I don’t quite like this Senka Mineral UV Essence sunscreen however, is because it didn’t seem to protect my skin as well as I was hoping it would. I was a little misled by its name on the pack. You see, it says on the pack “Mineral UV Essence” or “UV Mineral Essence” however you read it. “Mineral” here, I thought to mean, meant it contained mineral UV blockers. I did a quick scan of the ingredient list in store, but I was in a hurry (and it was just RM20 – which brings me to my post yesterday ) and couldn’t tell off hand if there were any. So I thought I’d go home and do my research there. This is the ingredient list for the Senka Mineral UV Essence sunscreen. I was correct in my initial view. There are no mineral UV blockers, usually Titanium Dioxide or Zinc Oxide. It is these that tend to give the white cast associated with sunscreen, which is why this one does not have a cast. Instead, what this is, is a sunscreen with chemical UV filters and UV absorbers (Avobenzone – Butyl Ethoxydibenzoylmethane, Octinoxate – Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, Polysilicone-15, Octocrylene, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate). This makes this a chemical based sunscreen. Not that I have anything against that, I was just curious why the use of the word “mineral” if there were no mineral UV blockers in there. I later found out on a search online, that “mineral” here referred to “mineral WATER from Mount Fuji”. You know what? I don’t give a flying fish where the damn water came from! I just wish it said “Mineral WATER” on the pack! I felt it to be rather misleading in this regard. Perhaps the Japanese words say so? I don’t know, since I can’t read Japanese and only have the English words on the pack to go by. And when I realised that this was a chemical sunscreen, I understood why I did not like it. You see, my skin does not play well with purely chemical based sunscreen. I have learned over the years, that to be effective on my skin (which seems to react quite quickly to UV and sun exposure by developing pigment spots and heating up) sunscreens I use must also contain zinc oxide, titanium dioxide or a combination of both. These are what are popularly known as “physical blockers” because they are literally ground up minerals that sit on the surface of your skin to block UV rays from reaching your skin. They are also known as “mineral sunscreens” if they have a high concentration of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide or both. For me, a purely chemical based sunscreen does not protect my skin sufficiently from the damaging UV rays. I did notice new sun spots appear, which distressed me greatly, because I already face an uphill challenge dealing with what I already have. So, I’ve stopped using this sunscreen. I’ll use it on my body. But it’s not going anywhere near my face ever again. I’m not saying here that this is a bad product. From a formulation point of view, I think it is decent. There is a good selection of UV filters in there to filter both UVA and UVB rays and if your skin can tolerate chemicals then it’s fine. The formula is comfortable on skin and it does not leave a white cast. But I have a nagging feeling that it does not protect your skin as well as the significantly more expensive Shiseido Perfect UV Protector (which contains both Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide aside some chemical filters) does and will. For this reason, this is no substitute for me. IN A NUTSHELL The Senka Mineral UV Essence SPF50+ PA++++ Sunscreen is a very affordable sunscreen. However, despite the misleading name, it contains no physical mineral UV blockers and is a purely chemical sunscreen. The word “mineral” refers to “mineral water”. The formula is a lotion-cream that can feel heavy on oily skin so will suit drier skin or those living in a cold and drier climate better. For me, this does not work well enough to protect my skin. I developed new sun spots and I feel that the chemical filters are insufficient. However I am no expert, so you’ll have to judge for yourself. PROS: Very affordable, Feels comfortable on drier skin CONS: Did not protect my skin well enough from UV rays, My skin heats up even though I wear a significant amount of product, and I developed new sun spots, Can feel heavy on oily skins WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who is comfortable using a chemical filter sunscreen, Anyone who is comfortable with a heavier textured cream PRICE: RM39.90 for 50g (often goes on sale) WHERE TO BUY: Watson’s stores I also noticed after leaving a dollop on my skin for a while, that it breaks down a little, similar to this one by The Body Shop . Incidentally, I also hated that one ? Have you tried this Senka Mineral UV Essence sunscreen? I hate to say this, but barring a major reformulation, I doubt I’d ever stray from the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector sunscreen. What’s important for me is that it’s easy for me to replenish. There’s no use my buying something that might be good, but which is unavailable locally. It doesn’t stop me shopping around, but I’m staying away from purely chemical filter sunscreens from now on. Now tell me. Are you a fan of this one? It’s really cheap! ? Paris B']"

But pair the bronzer powder with a blush and my sights zero straight on to the product – no blinking, do not pass Go, do not collect $200. This was the 1 item from the Dior Bird of Paradise Summer 2013 collection that I was most excited about – the Dior Nude Tan Paradise Duo Blush and Bronzer duo . In Asia, we only get Pink Glow (001) while the collection boasts 2 shades – Pink Glow 001 and Coral Glow 002. What the product is, is a 2 in one face colour with a bronzer on one side and a pink toned blush on the other. You can blend all the colours together when applying to skin, or just use each side separately. I’ve pictured it here with the limited edition Dior Summer Brush, which is a fluffy face brush for light coverage, and has distinctive red bristles. I’ll tell you about it and also about the Pink Glow bronzer-blush. If you are a blush fiend though, I suspect you already own it and can tell me a little more about it yourself! ? You don’t need the Summer Brush to use the product, actually. The Dior Nude Paradise Duo comes with a mini kabuki brush. Don’t be fooled by its diminutive size. This soft, dense and full kabuki brush picks up colour very easily and very well, and applies it to skin very easily too. I find that using a gentle hand and applying the product in circular motions on skin gives a smooth, even colour, and you can buff it to blend as well. A very worthy inclusion, just as they did with last year’s bronzing powder. A+ for execution! The compact is similar to that of the Diorskin Nude Tan bronzing powders. The palette is a heavy shiny metal case with the Dior signature cannage print on the top. I have to say, packaging wise, they made sure you got your RM198 worth! ? Diorskin Nude Tan Aurora Bronzing Powder (2012) and Dior Nude Tan Paradise Duo Pink Glow 001 pictured with the Summer Brush Here is the comparison with the Diorskin Nude Tan Aurora Bronzing Powder from Summer 2012 for comparison purposes. Aurora was the lighest shade available in the Nude Tan Bronzing Powder collection and had pink tone to give me a more natural, gentle touch of colour to my skin. By contrast, you will notice that the bronzer side of Pink Glow has a deeper tone. On the pink side, you get 2 shades of pink – a light pink and a deeper, brighter pink. I personally found that the colours were rather pigmented when I use a brush with them, but when I tried to swatch the shades, it wasn’t so easy. Here is my best attempt ? Left-Right: Top Left quarter, Bottom left quarter, Top Right quarter, Bottom Right quarter You may notice that the shades don’t show a dramatic change in colour gradation, but are fairly pigmented. The bronzer half is rather warm while the pink blush side has a slightly cooler edge to the colour. Personally, when used alone, I find that the bronzer side pulls some strong orange tones on my skin and can look much too warm. The pinks when used alone, have a warm rose-pink tone that is quite flattering even on their own. However, you won’t be using it quarter by quarter. You’d just swirl your brush all over in a circular motion and then blend. You could also use it half and half – bronzer to contour and blush for colour. I just do an all over colour because of the previously noted orange tones. I also find that the blush side has very fine milled shimmer but the bronzer side is matte. So I don’t quite agree with the reviews that say that the Paradise Duo bronzer-blush applies matte. It applies with a hint of shimmer on skin so do note that if you prefer something matte. It isn’t obtrusive, but there is most certainly a glow. If you are a touch heavy handed, you end up with something like this ? I used the Summer Brush initially, and I was very surprised at how much product it picks up. So, I strongly suggest that you swirl the brush over the product and be sure to tap off excess before you apply to your skin. I spent a while blending out the colour before I could comfortably step outdoors LOL! ? But I showed you this, because I wanted to show just how different the colour looked on skin as opposed to in the pan. In the pan, I expected to get a light pink toned powder but on skin, it turned out peachy-pink! The rose pink tones blend with the bronzer to create a peachy shade that I think will flatter most of us. If you have a skintone that’s deeper than mine, you will find it much easier to wear this product because it will give you a very pretty glow to the skin. The pink tones add colour while the bronzer side adds warmth and the result is a healthy glow. If you have light skintone, I will warn you to please be a little light handed or you may end up looking like you spent a little too long in the sun. I just spent the weekend sitting by the beach so as you might imagine, I look a little like my photo above… without using Pink Glow! LOL! ? After I blend it out a little more, I get something a little better. Other products: Giorgio Armani Eyes to Kill Silk Eyeshadow in #15, Dior Addict Extreme lipstick in Lucky A peachy pink glow with a touch of warm base. I like to add on a little more pink on the apples of the cheeks for a little pop of colour. Also, I found that if you use the little kabuki that’s included, you actually end up with a slightly more forgiving colour on skin and its very easy to blend. A very soft blush brush too gives a softer, more forgiving colour. I do however, also find that the product is rather powdery. So, after using, I have to blow off the excess powder from the surface. Nothing that really bugs me, but something I have to mention ? Is it for everyone? Well, nah it isn’t. But its a beautiful piece of work, it stays on well on my skin, its incredibly easy to blend, it gives you a beautiful glow and for me, its really pigmented so I’d say its bang for your buck! ? The accompanying product launched in the collection is this Summer Brush Blush Brush . The bright red bristles are, I’m told by the SA, synthetic and it is pretty soft, although not as soft as other synthetic brushes I’ve used. It is supposed to be a blush brush, so it is tapered to allow for easy blush/bronzer application. I have to say that the red bristles do add a bright, fun pop of colour to the usual black brush arsenal most of us will own, but its actually a bit of a damper, because its not easy to see just how much product you have picked up. I find that it does pick up product very well, having tried it with various blushes I own, but its hard to tell just how much you’ve got on the brush. So its actually quite easy to make mistakes. In terms of application however, it does live up to its claims of offering light coverage and easy blending. If you tap off excess colour, it will apply a light veil of colour to your skin, just enough to give you a gentle blushing glow and blending product is also very easy. It feels soft on skin, not too scratchy and it does a pretty good job overall. I’m just not too sure about the colour. Left: Dior Backstage Powder Brush Right: Dior Summer Blush Brush Here’s a comparison between the Dior Powder brush and the Summer blush brush for an idea of size. Its not as fluffy or as dense as a powder brush, and the longer bristles mean its more pliable which results in a softer application of product and colour. Its nice to have but not a must have, in my view. I’d still stick by my Lunasol blush brush ? In a nutshell The Dior Tan Paradise Duo Pink Glow bronzer-blush is a limited edition offering in the Bird of Paradise summer collection. The product can be used by swirling the included mini kabuki brush around the colours, tapping off the excess and then applying to your cheeks as you would a blush. I personally find its best use this way. You can however, also use it separately as bronzer to contour and then blush for colour and a pop of colour on the apples of the cheeks. For me, I find that Pink Glow applies to skin a rather peachy pink tone that will be flattering to most skintones. There is another shade in Coral Glow that isn’t available in Asia. The Summer Blush Brush is a limited edition red bristled blush brush. I’m told by the sales assistant that the bristles are synthetic but they do pick up product very well, and do apply and blend product well on skin. I do find that the red bristles, albeit very eye catching, can be a bit hard to use in that you can barely see how much product you have picked up. I already have a blush brush I adore so I’d say that this one is a nice one to have, but not a must have. Paradise Duo Pink Glow Pros: Flattering to most skintones, Pigmented, Kabuki brush included is practical and very usable, Fine milled powder and very easily blended on skin Paradise Duo Pink Glow Cons: Limited edition, Very fair skinned ladies will need a very light hand Who will like this: Anyone who loves a pretty blush or a peachy pink blush Summer Blush Brush Pros: Bristles are not scratchy, Easy to apply product and blend Summer Blush Brush Cons: Red bristles make it hard to see how much product is picked up Who will like this: Anyone who wants a fun and usable blush brush in their collection Asia doesn’t get Paradise Duo in Coral Glow so you can see it in action on Tine . To say I wanted Coral Glow badly after reading her review is an understatement. I wanted it so badly, I told my Aussie beauty/bag buddy to hoof it down to her closest Dior counter and test them both side by side for me to tell me if I needed Coral Glow. I trust her views implicitly and I knew she would tell me if I did. This was A$82 we’re talking about here. Waaay more than RM198! Thankfully (or maybe not) the report was that no, I did not need Coral Glow. Swatched alongside each other, they look similar enough that I could forsake one for the other. Christine of Temptalia agrees. That’s A$82 saved for … Tom Ford makeup brushes! LOL ? Did you pick up the Paradise Duo in Pink Glow or Coral Glow? Is the Summer blush brush something that you might like to own? I had my eye firmly on the Paradise Duo powders the minute I saw the promo images. I have to say I’m very happy with this and I think its quite worth what you pay for, if you’d like to get a workable bronzer and blush in one handy compact. I’m less crazy about the brush. I love the colour red, but red bristles on a brush is rather unnerving LOL! ?

Not my forte. That’s what I told The Love Jars when I was offered the Yes! Nurse Hand Cream to try. Next to eye creams, hand creams take second prize for products I should use but don’t. Please tell me I’m not alone! But I’ve been trying to be good to my hands (they show your true age you know!) so I’ve been applying a hand cream nightly just before bed. I do have to say that the Yes! Nurse hand cream is pretty nice as far as hand creams go. This was developed by a former nurse who wanted to develop something to help nurses look after their hands. As nurses, they would be washing their hands a lot in the hospital and that results in dry hands so the Yes! Nurse hand cream claims to not only address this dryness, but to protect. It is the latter quality that I think makes this hand cream special, especially if you wash your hands a lot. You see, if you read the instructions, you are supposed to apply this hand cream BEFORE you go about your duties. That’s how it protects your hands. By putting on a layer of protection to prevent the skin on your hands from drying out. Then, it goes on to nourish your hands when you apply it through the day. So if you fall into this category then you may like this hand cream. The packaging is cute. The cream comes packaged in a cardboard box, with a cute picture on the inside dedicated to the nurses for whom this hand cream was made. The tube itself is similarly sleek, slim and well designed with a flip top cap. It is a 50ml tube but it is so slim, it doesn’t feel that way because it’s so flat. The flip top cap makes dispensing product so much easier, and the slim tube slips into handbags for those of you who tote your hand creams about. The texture of the cream feels a little thick but it isn’t greasy and it absorbs very easily. This is extremely important for me because I cannot abide hand creams that are sticky or oily. It’s the reason I refused to use any for a long time. There is no or a faint clean scent that doesn’t bug me. It smells almost clinical. Nothing fragrant which makes sense, if it is targeted at nurses who are supposed to use this at work. If you check out the reviews for Yes! Nurse hand cream, they are glowing. People have said it helps with dry skin on hands, eczema, psoriasis and that it is especially helpful for those who wash their hands a lot. The thing however, is that I don’t belong in any of those categories. I don’t obsessively wash my hands, I don’t have eczema or psoriasis and I don’t carry hand cream in my bag, nor use it in the day. When I had dry skin thanks to some strong detergent I came into contact with, this cream didn’t help me. The only time I use a hand cream is before bed and and for this sole purpose, I find that the Yes! Nurse hand cream is just ok for me. It’s not a marvel, it’s not a wonder, and my hands don’t feel softer nor look better after nightly use. In fact, I prefer how my hands feel when I use the Clarins Hand and Nail Treatment cream (the hand cream that changed my mind about using them) or the Biotherm Age Delaying Hand Cream . For treatment purposes, the way I use a hand cream, I think those work better for me. In a nutshell The Yes! Nurse hand cream is an affordably priced hand cream that comes in very cute packaging, in the shape of a postage-paid parcel. The reason is because in the UK where it originates, it is despatched this way and is a subscription service. Locally in Malaysia, it is distributed by thelovejars.com. As a fussy hand cream user, I think this one is good because it isn’t oily, greasy or sticky and absorbs quickly. The tube is also slim and flat and very portable. However, as I don’t use hand cream throughout the day and do not have dry skin on my hands, except for times when I come into contact with strong detergents, I don’t find this one particularly helpful for treating my hands. When I had very dry skin after encountering some detergent, this one didn’t help me either. I can’t say I’m sold on this hand cream but if you like something unfragranced and non greasy and something portable, this is a good option. Pros: Affordable, Portable, Not greasy oily or sticky, Absorbs quickly, Not fragranced Cons: Did not help me when I had dry peeling skin on my hands after contact with detergent Who will like this: Anyone who uses hand cream daily and often, Anyone who washes their hands a lot as this claims to protect hands from repeated washing as well Yes! Nurse hand cream is supposed to be natural so here is the ingredient list for anyone interested. I’ve been using this one for a month or so now, and as I said, it’s not bad as far as hand creams for regular use goes. I cannot vouch for it’s protective qualities. As I use a hand cream purely for treatment purposes and only once a day, this doesn’t quite cut it for me so I will be going back to my Clarins one after the Biotherm one is finished. My hands just feel (and look) better when I use them ? Have you tried this hand cream? Do you use hand creams daily or repeatedly in the day? I don’t. Hand creams are like lipbalms for me. Once a day is enough for me. Never got the hang of it but now I keep a tube by my bedside so I treat my hands before bed. UPDATE: If you buy this Yes!

A while ago, the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion + was launched and I took it for a spin. I wasn’t too enamoured with it but then the original formula didn’t wow me either. However, I noticed from the comments I received, that Sam of Sam Still Reading was a long time DDML user and fan, and I was curious whether a long time DDML user and fan would like this change in formula. You know what they say – if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! But Clinique did and I was curious. So I offered Sam a job as a lab rat … I mean guest reviewer and sent my bottle Down Under for Sam to try and here’s her review after using it for 8 weeks (dedication, Sam!), with her thoughts on how it compared to the previous DDML. Take it away, Sam! ########## I’ve been a Clinique DDML (that’s Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion) user since I was 14. Sadly, that was quite some time ago and it’s scary to think I’ve been using the same moisturiser at night all through high school, university, more university and work. In the same period, there have been a lot of scientific discoveries and breakthroughs in skin care, but I’ve been using the same cream that a naysayer once told me was ‘yellow sorbolene cream’. Despite knowing that part of my skincare regimen was stuck in the twentieth century, I was strangely reluctant to move on when Clinique’s new DDML+ was launched earlier this year. Why hadn’t they told us so I could buy up all the stock? (I did that once for a foundation – on the third bottle, I realised that there were much better versions around). So when the lovely Paris B offered me a bottle to try and review, I decided this was a sign to get my moisturising up to date. In the previous eight weeks since receiving the bottle, I’ve put DDML+ through its paces all for you, dear reader. I worked for twelve days straight to see how it coped with skin under stress. I went on a chocolate binge to see if I could induce blemishes (all in the name of science). I got a cold to see if it dealt with the flaky skin well (this was not in the name of science). I varied my foundations to see if I could induce them to slip off with the DDML+ underneath. I came up with nothing. My skin looked slightly less tired after the long working period and if anything, I developed less stress related blemishes. The chocolate did nothing to my face, only my hips. My skin looked surprisingly well hydrated during my cold, plus all my foundations stayed put. Is there a difference between DDML and DDML+? I know that Clinique is meant to be fragrance free but I felt I could detect a slight ‘clinical’ smell at the start. I can’t smell that any more. The consistency of both is very similar and they are an identical shade of yellow. The DDML+ sinks in a little more quickly (which will be of benefit in the summer or on tropical holidays). Apart from that, I can say that there’s no need to be afraid. DDML+ does the job just as well as its predecessor – perhaps even a little better. Plus, there’s the benefit of more modern ingredients – it’s not the cutting edge, but it’s definitely better. ########## PB Says: I finally tracked down the ingredient list for the new Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+ so here it is. Ingredient list: Water, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Oil, Urea, Lanolin Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seedcake, Propylene Glycol Dicaprate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Yellow 6, Yellow 5, Red 33. I have thus far, read mixed reviews about this new DDML+ formula. I have read of people hating it, as well as of people who like it. I guess as with all skincare, we can’t account for what is happening with our skin. Sometimes, it might just be that our skin tolerates ingredients differently at a different age or different condition. I found it interesting and gratifying that Sam liked it. Would have hated for her to break out from this experiment! Thanks for the review, Sam and I hope this helps those of you who have been wondering how the DDML+ really fares in comparison to the old version. Are you too a Clinique DDML fan? Have you tried the DDML+? Sam blogs at Sam Still Reading a book review blog in Australia that I follow from time to time. If you are looking for a book review blog then Sam’s your man… I mean girl ?

When that runs out, I’ve got my back up in place . But I recently put to test a lesser known sunscreen from Taiwanese brand Naruko AM+PM and I’d be blown if it didn’t wriggle its way into the cockles of my heart, nestling itself comfortably between the Shiseido and the Hada Labo. This is the am+pm 10 Peptide Total-Defense Sunscreen with SPF50 and it’s by Naruko, a Taiwan brand created by popular Taiwanese beauty guru Niuer. I understand he is terribly popular in Taiwan and products he recommends always fly off the shelves whenever featured on his beauty show. But because I don’t read and speak Mandarin, this is a world of beauty that is unfortunately closed to me. Pity ? But coming back to this sunscreen. If I’m to be honest, I doubt I’d have given it a second look had I seen it on the shelves. I’m just a little wary about trying new things these days, which I know backfires on me as a blogger but what the hey ? However, this bottle ended up in a bag of items I was given to try for the Cite Cosme Beauty Awards 2014 and I thought I’d give it a go. Turned out, I really liked it! Being unfamiliar with the brand, I did a little research on it and found out that am+pm or AMPM is one of the brands under the umbrella brand of Naruko. am+pm as the brand says, is a skincare range that is designed to take you from AM to PM and is tailored for those living a busy office life and needs something to keep your skin in top condition while you undergo work stress. Interesting! The sunscreen comes in a very compact bottle and has the usual shake up formula popular here in Asia. However, unlike many other similar type of sunscreens, the texture is what really got to me. The product dispenses out as a slightly runny creamy lotion. It isn’t watery nor, if I’m to be particular about it, is it particularly lightweight. It isn’t a bad thing ? If you are familiar with the texture of Shiseido Perfect UV sunscreens then I’d say that this am+pm one is a wee bit creamier. I like it. It isn’t oily or heavy on the skin, and it does absorb nicely into the skin and doesn’t feel a bit drying at all through the day. The only thing is that if you wear this over a creamy moisturiser, then it might feel a bit heavy. Or if you wear a creamy foundation over this, then the foundation may slip a little as the day wears on. In addition to its primary function as a sunscreen product, this am+pm sunscreen contains 10 peptides to protect and boost the skin’s functions and anti-aging capacity. Here’s the 10 peptides and their functions that I got off the Naruko website. If I’m to be perfectly honest, I cannot tell if they work as advertised. I can vouch for my skin feeling well moisturised all day, which is probably due to the Hyaluronic Acid. I can’t say if the rest are showing much of an obvious result but I’m not using this product for the peptides. I’m using it because I really like it and it seems to work well enough for me. I’ve been using this since I ran out of my Shiseido sunscreen a while back, and it’s been a good substitute. It isn’t as good a makeup base as the Shiseido one because of the creamier texture, that much I’d admit. However, it seems to keep my skin more moisturised, and although I was out in the sun, I haven’t noticed my pigmentation getting worse. That’s my gauge of a sunscreen’s efficacy. If I discover my pigmentation getting worse after an unavoidable bout in the sun, I drop it like a hot potato. Ultimately, for the very affordable retail price of RM59 (or RM45 on the official website or at various sale prices in Watson’s pharmacies) I’m a happy camper. I think I’ll put this before the Hada Labo Whitening sunscreen for now ? In a nutshell The am+pm 10 Peptide Total-Defense Sunscreen is a very affordable sunscren from Taiwanese brand, Naruko. It has a slightly creamy texture but is otherwise lightweight and absorbs and sets well on skin. I find that creamier foundations will not sit as well on this so it doesn’t make as good a makeup base as the Shiseido Perfect UV sunscreen. However, I otherwise like it very much. It keeps my skin feeling moisturised and not dry, it protects from the uv rays and it feels comfortable without clogging my pores or breaking me out. It is also very affordable and there isn’t much else you can ask for! Pros: Lightweight lotion texture, Slightly creamy texture feels more comfortable on drier skin types, Does not feel drying on skin, High SPF protects skin from UV rays, Affordable Cons: Can feel a bit heavy on skin if worn over a heavier moisturiser, Does not work as a very good makeup base for creamier liquid foundations, Nozzle tends to over dispense product Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for an affordable sunscreen, Anyone who has slightly drier skin, Anyone who light lightweight sunscreen textures that are a little creamier and not drying Here is the ingredient list for those interested. I’m not that great at reading ingredient lists, but from what I can tell from the active ingredients, this sunscreen has both UV-B and UV-A blockers so that’s all good then ? Naturally, if you are sensitive to silicone, it is present in here so do take note; but I’m not and it does not have the horrible slippery feel of most products that have a lot of silicone, so I’m not terribly fussed about it. All in all, I’m happy with this and although I’m not now the most adventurous person out there when it comes to trying new skincare, I’m happy I gave this a chance ? Have you tried this am+pm 10 peptide sunscreen before? Are there any other Naruko or am+pm products you like that I should try? I tried one or two Naruko products a few years ago but wasn’t wowed. This one however has me intrigued by the brand again so if you use or have tried any product that you think is absolutely worth a go, please share! I’d definitely be interested, especially since they carry affordable price tags! ? Paris B p/s On this note, please expect a stretch of silence on the blog for a week or so till I get back on even keel. I should be able to get back to my regular schedule soon, but you will find me on my usual social media channels, Instagram being the primary one if you want a quick reply and like irrelevant and irreverent pictures about beauty, food and various titbits ?

It could even be for about half a year while I try to get my head around it. You see, online reviews are almost overwhelmingly in love with See by Chloé EdP , which was launched some time last year (2012) and which was made available here in Malaysia earlier this year. There were some contests and campaigns surrounding this fragrance which might explain the overwhelming love. You see, I don’t deny that there is a lot to love about See by Chloé, which is also the name of the clothing line that is the trendy younger sister to Chloé. The bottle is adorable. Styled like a vintage bird cage, it is different. There is a ring at the top that invites you to hang this on a branch. Don’t, I implore you. That ring is attached to the cap so hang it up and watch it smash to the floor. So no, don’t. A small attention to detail that I really liked discovering, were 3 tiny “feet” at the base of the glass flacon. They didn’t need to be there, but they were and that is what attention to detail is all about. However, perfumes are all about scent and scent are very personal things. So if you love See by Chloé, please don’t come and sling mud at me for disliking it. I’ve had months to figure it out ? At first sniff, upon spritzing from the bottle, I am reminded of thick sweet honey blended with a sweet but slightly tart apple note. No one mentions this thick syrupy smell but I noticed it almost immediately. This is a very sweet. VERY SWEET scent and I just don’t play well with sweet scents. My dabbling into fragrances has taught me as much. For me, this is a scent that smells good on paper. In fact, it does smell good on a blotter. It is supposed to have notes of bergamot and apple blossom to open, jasmine and ylang ylang when it mellows and vanilla to anchor its base. Think therefore sweet and floral. A light, fun, young scent that doesn’t quite suit my more tetchy character. If I give it a while, the heady syrupy note drifts away to be replaced with a floral note that smells quite comforting on my skin. It isn’t something I like, but it doesn’t make me smell like cat pee either, for which I’m thankful. I therefore run into my next big problem – longevity. See by Chloé on my skin is like the most fleeting of breezes. I feel like I have just walked through a flower garden and out again because in half an hour or less, this EdP disappears on me. I’ve taken to sniffing my wrists every now and again, hoping to catch a whiff of the more interesting note at the base of the scent but come up with nothing. So if you were to ask me, I’d tell you that See by Chloé is not for me and it won’t be for you too if you don’t go for sweet, floral scents. When I first spray it, I feel like I’ve fallen into a vat of cotton candy. When I allow it to settle, it reminds me of a flower garden, but like a flower garden, the scent lingers just for an instant in the air before dissipating into the ether, leaving me feeling a little lost. It’s almost playing a game of “now you see it, now you don’t” with me and I don’t like that. It is a lovely and young scent that I think will appeal to many, but I’d suggest that you wear it and see how it wears on you. I believe that a perfume should be worn on the skin because it is the unique chemistry of our bodies that turns a scent into one that is ours. Spraying it on clothes doesn’t cut it as far as I’m concerned. I think like the clothing side of things, See by Chloé will appeal more to the young and young at heart who favour sweet, slightly gourmand and floral scents. If the description of honey gets your skin going all tingly at the thought then this one is for you. If it makes you shudder, like I did then I’d just skip this. Have you taken a sniff at See by Chloé and is it a scent you love? Do you like sweet, floral perfumes? I am the anti-thesis of sweet, floral perfumes except for a handful. I wear J’Adore with its strong floral scent very well which surprises me as much as it does you, and I also wear Petite Cherie for a burst of ephemeral fruitiness. But for the most part, I go for lasting spicy, woody, musky scents. It makes me feel comforted ?

When I finished up the cleansers I decided not to repurchase but to try instead cleansing waters. I’ve heard so much about these micellar solutions and how they act as all in one makeup removers, cleansers and toners while being gentle enough for even the most sensitive of skins. The most famous one that most would have heard of is Bioderma. I actually have 2 really large bottles of them which I probably should tell you about some day… but you know what. I find it really hard to write about something I find at most average, when its so much more fun sharing about something I like! ? So yes, my introduction to cleansing waters on this blog will be the Caudalie Cleansing Water because I like this one. I bought this online a little while ago when it was on sale so I think it was something like £11. I don’t know how much it retails for locally but it shouldn’t be too pricey. Micellar solutions or cleansing waters were popularised by the French so you will see many of them appearing under French skincare lines of which Caudalie is one of them. My skin seems to take well to French skincare in general. I looked around for information on what is micelles and micellar water but its so bloody technical, I need a scientist (will Larie please step up to the task? :P) In a nutshell, in this liquid which approximates that of water are molecules that will bond with dirt and makeup on your skin and lift it off, leaving your skin clean. All without having to rinse with water. This is also known as the waterless cleansing method. But I use this one slightly differently. Whilst Micellar solutions and cleansing waters are supposed to be sufficient to cleanse skin at one go without rinsing, I use it instead as my first step of a double cleanse routine. I find its better for my skin and this way, I never really need the cleansing water to do an excellent job at removing eye makeup and foundation because I have my backup solution. Its a personal thing and it works for me. This product is supposed to be safe for all skin types, including sensitive skins. How you use it is very simple. Wet a piece of cotton pad and wipe it over your skin. You will notice your makeup being removed and if you really do not want to wash your face again thereafter you can do it a few times until the cotton pad is clear. As a makeup remover, I think this isn’t perfect. Neither is Bioderma, no matter what anyone says. The difference is, Bioderma is more affordable so using more of is doesn’t seem as sinful as using more of the Caudalie. I find if I want a truly clean face (after a day’s worth of makeup to work) I have to go through at least 3-4 pieces of cotton. It works around the eye area to remove my eye makeup although mascara does take more work. It does remove though, but you just have to work harder at it. A dedicated eye makeup remover does the job more quickly. What I like about this is, although I just make one pass over my skin with a dampened cotton pad, to remove the most of my makeup and the day’s dirt and crap, my skin almost immediately feels clean and refreshed. When I touch it, it feels smooth and clean and cool. It feels lovely! My skin seems to have benefited as well from using a cleansing water, in that it seems less irritated, and less sensitized. I have come across complaints about the scent but to me, it just smells faintly of grape juice. I find it refreshing. For a spell, I was using this in the morning in place of a face cleanser. I was testing the theory that our faces don’t get that dirty in the night while we sleep, so we don’t really need a heavy duty cleanser in the morning. This cleansing water was refreshing in the morning, and did make my skin feel clean without feeling stripped, or uncomfortable. Unfortunately, I just like splashing my face with cool water in the morning. It wakes me up better than gently wiping a cotton pad over my face so I’m back to using a face wash ? Would I use a cleansing water over a cleansing cream? Yes actually I would and I have. Cleansing waters aren’t drying on my skin and not as messy as using a cream. I’ve all but abandoned cleansing oils for the moment because I tried using one recently and it made my skin feel so dry almost immediately. Boohoo! Can’t say I haven’t given them a good run for my money! ? In a nutshell The Caudalie Cleansing Water Micellar Solution is a watery liquid that acts as a makeup remover, face cleanser and toner so it effectively takes the place of 3 products. I personally use it as a makeup remover and pre-cleanse routine, following up with a foaming face wash because I prefer it this way. It doesn’t work too well to remove all makeup and dirt at one go, so you will need a few passes with a damp cotton pad to get it 100% clean. That makes it quite pricey, but my skin feels lovely, cool, clean and smooth which is very nice. It is importantly also, not drying and not messy and very convenient. I’ve replaced my pre-cleansers with a cleansing water because I like the way my skin feels with it and I am not in the market to find others! Pros: Cleans skin and leaves it feeling comfortable, Convenient, Skin feels clean, cool and smooth Cons: Scent may not appeal to everyone Who will like this: Anyone who wants a convenient pre-cleanser and cleanser in one, Anyone for whom cleansing oils don’t work Here is the ingredient list if you’re interested. My skin seems to like this better than Bioderma in that it feels more comfortable as compared to Bioderma. Bioderma isn’t bad either but I’m just not enamoured with it like most people are. Some day, I’ll get around to sharing some more concrete thoughts on it ? Have you used the Caudalie Cleansing Water before? Do you have other cleansing waters that you like? Cleansing waters don’t seem to be very popular locally but it could well be because the big one (Bioderma) isn’t available here yet. For now, I know of Caudalie and Melvita that both have micellar cleansing waters but we don’t hear much about them. I haven’t tried the latter but I plan to. I hear the one from Vichy is good (no more Vichy here boohoo!) and so is the one from La Roche Posay (neither is this one boohoo!) so I guess trying out cleansing waters is going to be my next big thing after my cleansing oil exploits! ?

First, let me figure out how to turn this thing on. I swear, I’ve almost forgotten how to blog LOL! Well, yes, actually I have and I’m still living in a flux but I thought I’d ease into things with a quick post. Also, just to let you know I’m still here ? A week or two back, I was telling you about a very lightweight gel moisturiser from Olay and how I disliked the scent. Well, the hot hot weather isn’t letting up at all here, so here’s another lightweight gel cream that I have been using and liking, and which you might like too ? Now wait, where have you seen this before? Ah, this isn’t new. The Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Oil-Free Gel Cream was launched about 3 years ago when I first tried it and liked it. But as is wont to happen, the formula has been upgraded because apparently, the previous formula didn’t sit too well with oily skinned folks, so it has been made even lighter now with 24 hour hydration. I will tell you I don’t have oily skin, but I now have something approximating normal skin. I know, what’s considered ‘normal’ eh? For me, it means I don’t get too oily in the day (just sitting down doing nothing vs sweating) nor do I dry out to a husk. So I use this, but only in the day, and I like it! I didn’t have a problem with the previous formula so I don’t have much to add. I went through about 3 tubs of this back then, but I haven’t used it in at least a year, so I don’t really have a basis for direct comparison per se. Kiehl’s says that this new formula has a refreshing cool feeling on the skin but I was quite surprised to read about it because I didn’t experience any cooling feeling. I wouldn’t have liked it if I did, if I’m to be honest. The texture of the gel cream is still a very lightweight gel er… cream. It is translucent, and feels like a burst of water on the skin which is very lovely and comfortable. In tub, it looks like an opaque white, but it is in fact, a translucent gel that does not feel heavy at all. I couldn’t say that it’ll suit dry skinned folks, because this just wouldn’t cut the mustard. It’ll be far too light in a dry environment so I wouldn’t pick this one. However, if you live in a hot and humid environment or have oily skin, and have not yet found a product that helps keep your skin hydrated while feeling comfortable, then this is one to try. My skin does feel hydrated with this on, and I find that when I pair this with heavier sunscreens like the AM+PM sunscreen I’ve been using recently, it doesn’t make my skin feel as oily as it does with a heavier moisturiser, and it sits well under foundation. Best of all, it’s fragrance free. I love that, because so many similar gel moisturiser products out there are heavily scented so my preferences lean to a product that has no scent. For normal-dry skinned ladies, I wouldn’t use this in the evening. It’s far too light especially if you sleep in an air-conditioned room. I tried and it just wasn’t sufficient for me. So, I use this one strictly for the day only. Reader Victoria asked me on Instagram if I liked this better than the Origins Make A Difference+ moisturiser and my answer is no. I personally prefer the Origins MAD+ because it makes my skin feel better, it’s a little heavier and makes my skin look and feel like I’ve made a difference. This one delivers lightweight hydration, which is about all it does so I’d personally still pick Origins to repurchase, but since I have this, I will use it up ? In a nutshell The Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Oil-Free Gel Cream sports a new and upgraded formula in 2014 in a more lightweight formula more suited for those with oily skin, and delivering longer lasting hydration to the skin. I liked the old formula and I like the new one as well but I only use it in the day time as I do not have oily skin but normal-dry skin. I like that it is fragrance-free and very light on skin and absorbs very easily and quickly without feeling sticky. It does help my skin feel and stay hydrated for most of the day which is nice but it is ultimately all that it does. Pros: Lightweight gel texture absorbs quickly and easily into skin, Comfortable and hydrating, Not sticky nor oily, Affordable, Fragrance-free Cons: Contains alcohol denat. so those who are sensitive to alcohol on skin should take note Who will like this: Anyone with oily skin who needs hydration in a lightweight gel formula Here is the new ingredient list if you’re interested:- Water, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., Dimethicone, Isononyl Isononanoate, Carbomer, Imperata Cylindrica Root Extract, Dimethiconol, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Sodium Hydroxide, Xanthan Gum, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate, Menthoxypropanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Fmla 685677 Code F.I.L. D164354/3 The ingredient list in this 2014 version of the Ultra Facial Oil Free Gel Cream is largely similar to the previous formula which you can see here , with slight changes in the composition of the ingredients, but alcohol is still present so if you are sensitive to it, this will not be for you. I personally did not experience any drying, nor discomfort. Are you a fan of the Ultra Facial Oil-Free Gel Cream? Have you tried this new 2014 version? Some have asked if I prefer this to the Olay Aquaction Gel, the answer is yes. It is less sticky and there is no scent so I’d pick this, even if it’s double the price of Olay because I prefer it.

I don’t do it too often as most brushes I do buy do work as advertised for me. However, now and again, I come across one that doesn’t and then I have to find another use for it or let it rot. This was the problem I faced with the very popular Real Techniques Blush Brush . I bought this because blush is my crack and I naturally gravitate towards blush brushes as well. However, as you can probably tell, this brush is quite a whopper of a size. Like all other Real Techniques brushes, the bristles are synthetic and very very soft. The brush head is also very thick but it isn’t very dense, so you get some give as you brush it against your face dreamily, regaling in the cottony softness against your cheek. But try as I might, I couldn’t use this to apply blush. As you might be able to tell, the brush head is quite large. Ok, not “quite” large, but large. It’s slightly tapered, although you can’t quite tell from the photo, and it spreads out somewhat to a fluffy head. Here’s an approximation of size of the brush head to my hand. It’s large and as large as my face is, and as chubby as my cheeks are, I found that this blush brush just applied too much product to my cheeks and didn’t define them as nicely as they should. When I got this a while ago, and after experimenting with it, I just left it aside. I have read many reviews on the Blush Brush that make this comment, but everyone seems to be able to work with it one way or another. Unfortunately, I’m not everyone, so I couldn’t make it work for blush. I didn’t have to. I have lots of other blush brushes that do a better job. So, what was I do to with this monster? I found the solution in using it as a powder brush instead! ? It says “blush brush” but it’s too big for my face! The size of the brush head, being so large, and the thick, compact brush head that isn’t too dense applies loose or setting powder very nicely. Being dense, it picks up more product and applies more on skin than a fluffy face powder brush, but this still works for me. But what I really like using it for these days, is for applying the Guerlain Meteorites Pearls . I was using the Trish McEvoy Bronzer Brush 37 before this, but when I put it to wash one day, I picked up this Real Techniques brush instead and I haven’t looked back since. This brush picks up sufficient product, and the density and thickness of the brush head allows for more of the magical powder to be applied to skin, which means that the diffused glow is a little more noticeable. Also, the lovely softness of the brush head means that you can apply and buff product into your skin without it feeling scratchy or pokey. Guerlain sells brushes which they say are for Meteorites, but the quality of their brushes is abysmal. They’re scratchy and pokey and are nothing except cute, with their coloured bristles (I don’t find them cute, but most people do ? ) The Meteorites are expensive products, but the brush you use them doesn’t have to be ? So, if you haven’t yet found a good brush for applying Meteorites or loose powder, try the Real Techniques Blush Brush. After all, what is in a name, eh? ? In a nutshell The Real Techniques Blush Brush is a synthetic brush that is supposed to be used for applying blush or bronzer. The brush boasts a thick and relatively dense head, that tapers slightly. I find it too large to use to apply blush and I don’t use bronzer, so I use this brush instead for applying loose powder and it works especially well for applying the Guerlain Meteorites Light Reflecting Pearls. The bristles are super soft on skin and it dries quite quickly after washing. It isn’t expensive and works very well and the pink aluminium body will appeal to many. It’s a good brush. If you can use it for blush, good for you but if you find it too large, don’t fret, there are other uses for it too! Brush Hair: Synthetic, Taklon Pros: Affordable, Dries quickly, Multi-tasker brush can be used for blush, bronzer or powder, Works very well for applying Guerlain Meteorites for a more visible, diffused effect Cons: Too big for blush application Who will like this: Anyone who prefers using synthetic brushes, Anyone who hasn’t found a brush to use for their Guerlain Meteorites powders Real Techniques Blush Brush vs Lunasol Cheek Brush N The only reason I’m showing you both these brushes is for size comparison. I love the Lunasol Cheek Brush N and I use it almost daily. As a blush brush, the size is perfect for me as it isn’t too large and fits my cheeks. I then blend product out and the super soft squirrel hair blends product very nicely. I know I’ve said that it’s a brush I can’t live without but I have found another brush from Hakuhodo that works even more impressively, if I want a more sculpted cheek look. I’ll share that another time ? As you can see, as the Lunasol Cheek Brush is the perfect size for me (for my preference) it is no wonder I find the Real Techniques Blush Brush too large. But as I’ve said above, it does perform a different function for me, and it works well so I’m not complaining ? Do you own the Real Techniques Blush Brush? Do you use it for blush or do you too, find it too large? It’s far too large for me, but I’m glad I found another use for it. I honestly am not sure how people use it for blush. Maybe it’s because I prefer a smaller brush head for applying blush, so I have more precise placement? Or maybe I’m just not very good at it LOL! ? Apparently this works very well for applying bronzer too so give it a go, if you haven’t yet found a bronzer or loose powder or Meteorites brush ?

Hiya! ? Hope you’re all keeping well during my enforced break and discovering, or in my case, rediscovering some beauty goodies. One of the things I rediscovered was just how much I like the Chanel Rouge Allure Velvet lipsticks . It’s quite something for me, because in general, I haven’t had a lot of luck with Chanel lipsticks (I find them a bit drying for me) and matte lipsticks in general (too drying and makes my lips look too lined). But for some reason, these work for me. I find it quite fascinating, because I wouldn’t personally pick a matte lipstick at any time of day. My choices always gravitate towards those that offer shine and a touch of gloss. The texture of the Rouge Allure Velvet lipsticks are, like their names imply, like velvet. The lipstick in tube has a satiny velvety look, with a touch of shine to it. What that means also, is that when applied, I don’t find it to be fully matte. Like velvet, there is a general matte finish, but with a bit of a sheen that I find flattering. Chanel calls it a “luminous matte” and while it sounds rather oxymoronic, I tend to agree. I have 2 colours at present, a coral-peach shade called La Ravissante 32 (The Beautiful) which is unfortunately discontinued, and a lovely bright pink which has been described as a hot pink (although I disagree) called L’Exuberante 37 (The Exuberant) which thankfully, isn’t. Chanel Rouge Allure Velvet Top: La Ravissante 32 (discontinued) Bottom: L’Exuberante 37 I started out my Rouge Allure Velvet experience with La Ravissante and I didn’t quite know what to expect. Most matte lipsticks dry my lips out and a peachy matte lip shade tends to look quite ageing. I was however, quite impressed at the fact that I did not find this drying at all, and it applies smoothly and opaque. You do need fairly flake free lips so it looks smooth and flattering, and if you feel the need to wear lip balm underneath, realise that it will give the lipstick a bit more shine than it should. I don’t wear lipbalm so I wear this on its own and it’s fine. These lipsticks swatch opaque in one swipe which is impressive. I do however find that when new, and when you haven’t used them for a while, they seem to harden, so it feels harder and the colour pay off is poor until you warm it up a little, then it applies very smoothly. The plus point however, is that I find that it doesn’t transfer very easily so you don’t walk around leaving much of a mark on coffee cups as you would a glossy lipstick, and it feels very comfortable on. The packaging is quite typical of Chanel – sleek and chic. You depress the gold bit at the end for the lipstick bullet to pop up and when you return it back into the case, you depress it again so it stays closed. Very sleek and impressive. Chanel Rouge Allure Velvet Lipstick Left: La Ravissante 32 Right: L’Exuberante 37 Swatches on lips were done with one swipe straight from the bullet. La Ravissante 32 (discontinued) is a warm peach-coral that on me, shows up more peach with little pink. It isn’t a colour I’d normally wear but then we should move out of our comfort zones shouldn’t we? It goes well when I have on warmer eyeshadow colours and a warm peach or coral blush. L’Exuberante 37 is described by many as a hot pink but which I’d just call a pink. It’s very pretty and there is enough of a blue base so teeth aren’t made to look yellow, yet is warm enough so it doesn’t wash me out. I wasn’t sure about this, but it turned out to be a very flattering and face brightening colour on. In a nutshell The Chanel Rouge Allure Velvet lipsticks are described as a “luminous matte” which is quite apt, as it is a matte lipstick with a touch of a satin shine so it does not look flat as most matte lipsticks are wont to look. I do not find it drying for a matte lipstick, and it lasts at least 4 hours for me without settling too much on my lips. You do however, need to have flake free lips to wear these so they look at their best. I don’t generally wear a lot of matte lipstick, but if I had to pick just one, this formula would be it. It doesn’t age you and doesn’t dry my lips and the colours are flattering. That’s all we ultimately want in a lipstick. Pros: Not drying, Matte texture is not flat and unflattering, Does not settle into my lips, Flattering range of shades Cons: Feels hard if not regularly used but once warmed up a little applies smoothly and evenly Who will like this: Anyone who hasn’t been able to find a good matte lipstick I’m still working on finding the right light so here’s the best I could do for now in terms of a quick FOTD to show just how the lip shades look in an overall look. La Ravissante works with a warmer overall face and green shadow straddles that balance between warm and cool, so it keeps the look warm enough. I do however, find that this colour makes me look more matured so I pull it out when I want to carry some clout at work and throw my weight around ? But I think L’Exuberante looks far better on me don’t you agree? It brightens my complexion and gives off a more youthful vibe that belies the more matured matte texture. In fact, I think the velvet texture of the lipstick works very well with this shade, as it doesn’t make it look too rah-rah young, but grounds the colour more than a glossy lipstick in the same shade would. I love it! ? Have you tried the Chanel Rouge Allure Velvet lipsticks? Are you a fan of matte lipstick textures? I can’t say I love matte lipstick because they do tend to feel quite dry and look flat don’t they? Yet, some colours, like bright pink for example, lend themselves well to a matte texture so I’m really happy I discovered and rediscovered these Chanel ones. Best matte lipsticks I’ve used! ?

This was back in 2010 but I say 3 years because we’ve just entered 2014 haven’t we? Or should it have been 4 years? Either way, I was terribly excited. At the end of last year when I got wind of another reformulation and new packaging, I had to go back and check just when the last one was because it just seemed like yesterday it was repackaged! But reformulated it has been and for the Meteorites Blossom Spring 2014, Guerlain has unveiled their new Meteorites Light Revealing Pearls of Powder . Slight tweak in name, formula and packaging but for all intents and purposes, the same product. Guerlain kept the tin packaging which is of course great news. I had the older cardboard box and that was quite a let down (If you remember the cardboard box, give yourself a pat on the back!) So, what’s new then, other than a new design of the tin? Do they work better? Do they still give your skin that illuminated finish that has grabbed me since cardboard box days and kept me on as a fan? Is this a must have? I have some comparisons for you with the old ? Must have? I’m afraid you’re asking the wrong person here LOL! ? If my ravings over the years have anything to go by, yes the Meteorites in any incarnation are a must have. They are the last thing to go on my skin and just ties my whole look together flawlessly. But I’ll also be the first to tell you that no, it’s not a must have because not everyone will appreciate this. It’s one of those things that you either get, or you don’t, so listen (or read) my ravings but decide for yourself after you’ve had a try. What’s different in these new Guerlain Meteorites Pearls then? Well, a couple of things. New Packaging To start, the design of the tin has been changed. Guerlain’s Spring 2014 collection which is very small by comparison to past collections, is themed Meteorites Blossom and the design of the tin incorporates this theme with design of a flower on the top of the tin. Still the iconic Guerlain Gardenia, but tweaked. The sides of the tin remind me of fish scales LOL! I dare you to tell me otherwise ? New Formula Product wise, Guerlain says that the powders have been reformulated so even as they continue to colour correct skin (You’d be surprised at how well they do it without you noticing) and illuminate (blurred lines ftw!) the product is now softer and easier to pick up and more visible on skin. My first impression when I received 02 Clair is that it appeared more shimmery and powdery than 01 Teint Rose that I use almost daily (I interchange with Teint Beige quite often as Teint Beige is less illuminating). I was afraid of a face full of sparkles. But using it, I was quite happy to note that this wasn’t the case. It went on the same on my skin – diffusing, evening out complexion and not making me a discoball. Was it easier to pick up with a brush? I did a side by side test with the old and new version. Guerlain Meteorites Perles Left: Teint Rose Right: Clair ~ Test: Brush was tapped on the powder 3 times, no swirling I used the softest powder brush I own, which is the Lunasol Face Brush (so soft!) to see how well a soft brush would pick up product. I must make a note here to say that I actually don’t experience problems applying Meteorites powders. Picking up product has never been an issue for me so maybe I just don’t get why it’s an issue that needed reformulation ? But anyway, I found that it is very slightly true. It was easier for my brush to pick up product from the new Meteorites as compared to the previous version. It is even more powdery. My test involved just tapping on the perles 3 times with the brush. You may notice that the brush with Clair has a tiny little more product on it than the one with Teint Rose, especially at the tips. Imperceptible otherwise. See what I mean when I say I don’t have a problem? ? What this means is that I no longer swirl my brush in the new Meteorites. I find it then picks up too much product and can make my skin look too pale (I’m using Clair) so I recommend just tapping on the product. That thin layer of powder on your brush is more than sufficient for you. With previous versions I could tailor it more easily because the brush picks up less product and deposits it more evenly on skin. With this new “easy to pick up” formula that is significantly more powdery, you risk putting on too much. The pearls are also much softer, as evidenced by the layer of powder at the bottom of the tub. This was never an issue before but it’s very obvious now so travelling with this means breaking up the balls further. Not cool for me but for those who used to complain about how they never could see anything nor pick up product, this was for you. Boo for the rest of us who actually liked it as is. So this improvement is both a pro and a con depending on how you use your Meteorites perles and what you expect it to do for your skin . Colour comparison – 02 Clair and 01 Teint Rose Meteorites Light Revealing Pearls compared with Illuminating Pearls Left: 02 Clair Right: 01 Teint Rose Are the colours different? The Meteorites Blossom starts with 02 Clair (Pure Light) which is tailored for light skintones. The green powder corrects redness, white powder reflects light, lilac and pink powder adds radiance and champagne gold adds glow. Notice that there is essentially no difference then between Clair and Teint Rose. None whatsoever. My Teint Rose is of course a little battered as compared to the more pristine Clair, but essentially nope. You don’t need Clair if you already have Teint Rose. But if you are new to Meteorites then Clair would give you the same effect as Teint Rose and the even older Mythic. Same things, just different generations. Less product The biggest difference however comes in the product weight which I have to say came as the biggest surprise to me. The new Light Revealing Pearls of Powder contains 25g of product while the older Illuminating Powder Perles had 30g. 5g when it comes to powder is quite a lot of product and that made me quite nonplussed because the price is higher too (not just locally but worldwide). I get it about raising prices (this is inevitable) but to cut the product by 5g? No, I’m not happy about that at all. This is actually visible the minute you open the tin. I noticed the markedly lesser product because I use Meteorites almost everyday and there are usually about 3 layers of powder balls but in the new tin there are only 2 layers at best. You can see it for yourself in the picture above. So as much of a Guerlain and Meteorites fan as I am, unless you absolutely dislike the Illuminating Powder Perles or have a significant problem picking up product, I’d recommend that you hunt down and buy the existing ones named Teint Rose, Teint Beige or Teint Dore for a slightly smaller pricetag and significantly more product. Sorry Guerlain, it’s got to be said by someone! There are 3 shades available, and this time they are clearly targeted at different skintones. 02 Clair (Pure Light) – Light skintones, adds radiance and tones down redness in skintone. Similar to Teint Rose and Mythic 03 Medium (Tone on Tone Light) – Medium skintones, complexion perfecting and glow. I believe this is similar to Teint Beige which I also use to add some warmth to my skin and I find it less glowy but I’m not sure about this new version. 04 Dore (Warm Light) – Golden skintone adding warmth, deeper complexion and rose powder adds radiance. I’m not sure if this is similar to Teint Dore because my memory tells me Teint Dore is more brown and gold but if you have significantly warm and tanned skin then this is the one you should look at. Meteorites Brush – I personally dislike the Meteorites brush because it feels scratchy and rough. I use either my Trish McEvoy brush or my Lunasol Face Brush to apply my Meteorites. But the new one is supposed to be softer so maybe it isn’t as bad (I haven’t seen it though). In a nutshell Guerlain reformulated and repackaged their iconic Meteorites Perles for Spring 2014 Meteorites Blossom collection and have renamed them Light Reflecting Pearls of Powder which describe these powders quite perfectly. Briefly, the packaging has changed as has the formula which makes it more powdery and easier to pick up product with a brush. Be careful then as you can pick up too much product. Shade wise, I find them similar to the existing Meteorites except for Dore which may be slightly different. The biggest difference is in the product. It’s now 25g which is a 5g reduction and in a powder, that is a lot. I love these but if you can get the Illuminating Powder, get those for the same result and more product. Pros: Easier to pick up powder and apply on skin, More visible results more quickly, Not sparkly or shimmery on skin, Gives a lovely glow to the skin, Evens out and diffuses skintone and slight imperfections, Works as well as the existing Meteorites powders so previous reviews apply (read previous reviews on Guerlain’s permanent Meteorites here and here and here ) Cons: 5g less product, Pricey, New formula means you can pick up too much product, Softer product results in more pearls breaking up and a more powdery formula Who will like this: Anyone already familiar with how Meteorites finishing powder works, Anyone who wants a transparent powder that subtly colour corrects skintone while adding illumination and glow If I seem a little less effusive about this new version of the Meteorites, chalk it up to the reduced product and the more powdery finish. I just can’t quite get over that, no matter how much I love these. I still highly recommend these powders for giving you that beautiful diffused glow to the skin (Just be sure to pick the right shade for your skintone and use a light hand) and if the content doesn’t bug you, this is a wonderful product that everyone should own or at least experience to see what the fuss is all about. Are you a fan of the Guerlain Meteorites pearls or balls as I like to call them? I’ve been hooked since the days of Mythic and I collect and use the different limited edition pearls that are released from time to time so yeah, I guess you could say I am a fan ? But I’m also practical so if this isn’t within budget, it’s ok not to own it. It’s not THAT life-changing. If it is, and you still don’t own one, I suggest checking out the existing ones before they are replaced by the new versions because 5g of product is nothing to sneeze at!

It just looks like so much same-old, same-old that I was quite happy to overlook it altogether. I have to say however that despite feeling a little humdrum about it, I was a little taken with the Golden Snow 644 5 Couleurs eyeshadow palette, which is one of 2 limited edition palettes released for Christmas. Golden Snow is the cooler of the 2 palettes, the other being Golden Flower #643 which you can see here . Since I prefer cooler tones, this was something I was ready to test. If it had been Golden Flower offered to me, I’d have passed on it immediately. I found the Golden Snow palette to have a consistent quality with the rest of Dior eyeshadow palettes. What this means is that if you never liked other Dior palettes (common complaints are sheer textures) then you won’t like this one either. I did however, find that the quality of the shadows were better in terms of colour application and blendability and I could quite easily pack on colour without it looking heavy. This being a Christmas and festive palette, there are 2 glittery shades included in a gold and white. They both add a festive sparkle to the eyes and for me, swatch fine and smoothly. You wouldn’t wear them alone of course. What I do is tap them on for a stronger glitter application, or blend them out for a smooth shine without looking glittery. Whilst the 2 glittery colours add the much needed holiday sparkle to the eye (let’s not be Grinches eh? ;)) my favourite colours in Golden Snow are actually the 2 colours at the bottom. The colour on the right looks a bit like a midnight blue in the picture, but is in fact a dark charcoal grey. The colour on the left is a light purple (if it could be called that) that I was quite afraid of, but have warmed up to it. I’ll give you a brief run down of colours and textures using the swatches below. Dior Golden Snow #644 Eyeshadow Palette swatches – Swatched clockwise from bottom left. Each colour 1 layer swatched with fingers Shimmer purpley-taupe – a taupe shade with brown and purple tones and finely milled shimmer that worried me initially but which has quickly become my favourite colour especially when paired with the charcoal Shimmer light pale pink – a pale pink with iridescent shimmer that serves me as a highlight colour only Glitter Gold – A golden glittery shade that applies smoothly when swatched but needs to be packed on for glitter to show up A satin charcoal – Not black, not grey, this charcoal shade is a brilliant addition to this palette as it anchors all the other colours and provides depth. Use it as a liner in a pinch too Glitter White – A white glitter that applies smoothly when swatched but needs to be packed on for glitter to show up. If you don’t want the glitter, blend it out for a touch of shine For me, the textures of the shadows are up my alley. I don’t go for very strong bold colours and for my flat Oriental eyes, a touch of shimmer is important to prevent my lids looking too flat. Here’s an example of how I’d wear the Golden Snow palette. Charcoal on lashline blended halfway up the lid, Taupe on the outer corner and blended with the charcoal and the pink to highlight. Taupe to line lower lash. Charcoal to tightline. It turned out surprisingly easy and very elegant. One of those palettes that you can easily wear day to night and then to a party ? Here’s how it would look in a full face shot. For me, I experienced no fall out and the textures were very easy to work with. If you have oily lids, you may need a lid primer but for me, the lasting power was good enough for a full day at work. I do like this palette but I hesitate to say that it’s a must have because I’m sure if you have a decent sized collection, you’d be able to pick out some dupes. But if you don’t, then this is a nice palette to own. In a nutshell The Dior 5 Couleurs Golden Snow #644 eyeshadow palette is limited edition for Christmas 2013 as part of the Golden Winter collection. The colours in Golden Snow are slightly cool toned and there are 2 glittery colours for the festive touch. The other 3 shades have shimmer and an iridescent, satin finish which I like. I found the pigmentation fair although it isn’t for someone who prefer bolder, stronger colours. I like how the easy it is to blend the colours and to create a very elegant, simple look very quickly. It is potentially easy to dupe, but if you don’t have colours like these then it’s worth taking a look. Pros: Easy to blend formula, Colours are easy to wear and elegant, Combination of colours make it easy to wear from day to night Cons: Pricey, Limited Edition, Some may find it too shimmery or too light and sheer Who will like this: Anyone who likes cool toned neutral eyeshadow shades, Anyone who is familiar with the textures of Dior shadows I won’t say this is a must have, but it’s a nice to have, and if you aren’t looking for anything too exciting and want a multitasker, I’d say Golden Snow fits the bill. There’s a light shade to highlight, dark shade to line and contour, interesting lid shade and 2 party shades. It will last you long after Christmas and for many Christmases to come. I can’t say it excites me, but I like it ? Did you get anything from Dior’s Christmas collection? Have you started picking out your Christmas beauty finds yet? Truth to tell, I have been quite underwhelmed by most of the Christmas offerings this year, bar Guerlain that had me hook line and sinker , despite the dud that was the Crazy Meteorites Perles. I might have overlooked this lovely palette but I’m glad my attention was drawn to it. It was a surprise hit for me.

I was never interested in trying natural or organic skincare because I ran into problems at the start, where the products reacted badly with my hands (gave me contact dermatitis that necessitated me seeing a doctor) and turning my skin oilier than normal. I have thereafter, approached organic skincare with a caution usually reserved for radioactive products ? Perhaps things have changed lately, or my skin has changed, or the quality is better but there are some organic or natural skincare that I can now use and actually enjoy using. Today, I’ll show you one of them ? The brand is Blissoma Solutions which hails from the USA and is locally carried by online site Brown Bag , a new online retailer of natural skincare products. They’re still small but I’m assured, are planning to increase the brands they carry. The folks at Brown Bag sent me a couple of products to try from Blissoma Solutions, but I’ve only tested this so far – the Fresh Mild Rice Facial Cleanser . I’d run out of my morning cleanser (I use different ones in the mornings and evenings) so this arrived at the right time. The packaging was interesting, I thought, because it came in a metal (aluminium?) bottle. Interesting, but potentially frustrating because it means you can’t see how much product is left. Perhaps this has to do with the formula of the product? Or to keep it fresh? I don’t know, but I like the product! I like using a gentle cleanser in the mornings and this one fits the bill perfectly. The Fresh Mild Rice Facial Cleanser is a very gentle non-soap based cleanser that takes some getting used to, because it won’t lather. It has a creamy texture that I initially was a little surprised about because I’m just not used to it. Although it’s not conventionally popular to admit it, I do like using foaming cleansers still. So, sue me ? This one is a cream and pumps out a creamy yellow colour. I usually use 2 pumps on a damp face and hands to help it spread out better. Because it doesn’t lather, it needs a little more to work with. What you will immediately notice is that there are very fine grains in the cream, which are supposed to be ground brown rice. It’s interesting to note that locally, traditional skincare uses ground rice and water from soaking rice to clean the skin. Locals would be familiar with ‘bedak sejuk’ or rice powder which we use as a mask, and when younger, I’d actually wash my face with the water used for soaking rice. No kidding! ? So, I knew all about the benefits of rice in skincare. This cream cleanser spreads quite easily on damp skin but takes a bit of getting used to because it won’t lather so it feels like a bit of a film on skin. What I do is rub it all over and the ‘bits’ feels like they’re exfoliating the skin but very gently. Then, I rinse it off by splashing with water. This is where it gets interesting, because the cream will get washed off quite easily, without leaving a film on the skin. Yet, it leaves the skin feeling hydrated and moisturised. If you’re used to a foaming cleanser that leaves the skin feeling “clean” then you may not like this feeling. I admit, it took some getting used to for me, but now, I love it and it only took me a month or so haha! Ok, not really, I really warmed up to it after about a week and while I can’t vouch for it clearing up my skin the way many people claim it does, I like how soft and moisturised and clean my skin feels after using this. Based on what I’ve read online, this Mild Rice Facial Cleanser seems popular among those who suffer from oily or acne prone skin. I know, cream cleansers aren’t usually used by those with oily skin but this seems to work for them. I have normal-dry skin and I like this. It doesn’t strip my skin, makes it feel clean, smells lovely (herbal yet fresh) and is a treat in the morning. Love it! ? In a nutshell Blissoma Solutions is a brand from the USA that makes 100% vegan and 100% natural products that are predominantly organic based. The Fresh Mild Rice Facial Cleanser is a cream based cleanser with ground brown rice bits in it that perform a very gentle exfoliating function. It is soap free and does not lather up nor foam up so will take some getting used to. There is also a scent that people will either love or hate. I love it. It smells of fresh herbs that is refreshing in the morning. I do find that I need 2 pumps of product to effectively wash my face in the morning, but it rinses off quite easily leaving the skin feeling fresh and clean and does not dry out the skin at all. It’s a very lovely cleanser and one I’m quite happy to keep in rotation. Pros: Not drying, Gentle yet cleans skin well, Gentle exfoliating every time you wash your face, Lovely fresh scent Cons: A little pricey, Some people may not like the slightly herbal scent, Some people may not like that it does not rinse off to leave a squeaky clean feeling on the skin, Can’t tell how much product is left due to the packaging Who will like this: Anyone who uses vegan, natural and/or organic skincare, Anyone looking for a very gentle non-drying facial cleanser What may be off putting to some will be the price tag. While this has won awards for being a budget friendly line of products in the USA, and while many consider this to be their Holy Grail cleanser, the price of RM138 (US$31.99)/112g feels a little steep for a cleanser. That said, it’s very lovely and I’d be quite happy to pay for it and I plan to alternate this with the Antipodes Juliet cleanser . Love both of these for use in the mornings! ? Here’s the ingredient list for the Fresh Mild Rice Facial Cleanser:- Infusion of Althea officinalis* (marshmallow), Stellaria media* (chickweed), Plantago major* (plantain), Rosa damascena*, Arthemis nobilis* (chamomile), Glycerin*, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) Oil*, Oryza sativa* (brown rice), Cocos nucifera (coconut) Oil*, Prunus armeniaca (apricot) kernal Oil*, Glyceryl Stearate, Salix alba* (willowbark) extract, Cannabis sativa (hemp) Oil*, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Echinacea purpurea Extract*, Essential Oils of Lavandula angustifolia, Litsea Cubeba, Cymbopogon martini (palmarosa), Canarium luzonicum (elemi), Boswellia carterii (frankincense), Vetiveria zizandoides (vetiver), Xanthan Gum, Rosemary Oleoresin Extract, Grain Alcohol*+ essential oils in this product contain: linalool**, geraniol**, limonene**, citral** *from Certified Organic Agriculture **natural components of essential oils Do note that if you are sensitive to essential oils, you may want to be a little careful trying this. Have you used any products from Blissoma Solutions that you’d care to recommend? Have you used rice powder or rice water for your face? This is my first time trying anything from this brand and I have to admit that it’s left me confident enough to try other products from the brand. I usually tiptoe around organic/natural skincare due to my bad experience before, but this time, I’m quite happy to experiment. If you’ve used anything from this brand that you like, do share, I’d love to know what else is worth trying! ?

Truthfully, no. I’m not about to make that shift although I know it’s the “in thing” right now to do. I just use whatever I like, as long as I’m comfortable using it. Occasionally however, I’m reminded that organic products exist, and when they are a local brand that is easily available at pharmacies or online, I look a little more kindly on them. I like supporting the local beauty industry, when they make something I can get behind; not just pick up an OEM product from some beautyexpo or Alibaba, slap on some terrible, pretentious sounding name on a label and try to push it as a local product at a high mark up. I can smell bullshit like this from a mile away because it’s what I see in 80% of the pitches I receive. Esmeria however, is a brand I’ve featured a few times before this. I thought they were pretty decent, for their facial skincare, and they are a local company, and impressively, have EcoCert – which makes them a certified organic brand. They were kind of aggressive for a while quite a few years ago, but then they disappeared off my radar, and from what I could tell, off the beauty scene. But what I’ve learned is that in that interim, they revamped their packaging and released a range of hair and body products under the name of Esmeria Soothing Organics . If I have one thing I’d note about the brand, is that it’s too inconsistent to have some products called Esmeria Organics and some called Esmeria Soothing Organics. Something tells me they have to get their house in order on that front. But when they asked if I wanted to give these a go, I said, Oh alright. Let’s take a look because I don’t have sensitive skin, but I wanted to see if I had any luck with their shampoo. I don’t have a lot of luck with organic brand hair care for some reason. They tend to feel too “mild”. Esmeria Soothing Organics Soothing Shampoo & Soothing Conditioner – RM59.90 (250ml) & RM49.90 (150ml) There are 2 types of shampoo available – Soothing Shampoo for Sensitive & Irritated Scalp and Soothing Shampoo for Dandruff Scalp. For the Conditioner, there is only 1, the Soothing Conditioner for Sensitive & Dandruff scalp, which means it serves double duty. The Soothing Shampoo is a clear gel, and you don’t actually need very much. It doesn’t lather up very much, but it does lather a little. So, if you are used to shampoo that lathers up but want something a little more gentle, then this might be something you’d look towards. The other option that does not lather might be too big a mindset switch. While my scalp isn’t what I’d term sensitive, nor do I have dandruff, I have to say that I like how the shampoo and conditioner leaves my short hair feeling soft, and my scalp comfortable. It doesn’t feel dry nor does my hair feel unclean. I wash my hair daily, and this doesn’t dry it out at all, so my hair feels like hair and not like a head full of hay. This, unlike a previous Esmeria Organics shampoo I tried , that left my hands feeling dry and peeling, this did not. So I think the formula has been improved. If you wash your hair often like I do, then maybe this could be something you could look to try. I’ve attached the ingredient list below. Esmeria Soothing Organics Soothing Shower Gel for Sensitive & Eczema Skin – RM59.90 (250ml) Not having sensitive skin nor eczema, the only thing I can really say about this Soothing Shower Gel is that it does feel gentle, and importantly, not drying after use. I have to mention the scent that I find quite delightful and refreshing. There is a hint of citrus and lavender so it’s at once comforting and refreshing. Not too strong, so it doesn’t linger, but a delight in the hot shower. Like the Soothing Shampoo, it doesn’t lather up a lot, but just enough to be comfortable and it spreads easily, so again, a little is sufficient for a clean and refreshing shower. As I don’t have dry or sensitive skin on my body, I cannot say how well this will work for those who do have skin problems, but I can attest to it being non-irritating and not drying, so it is a nice one to use. For those interested, here is the ingredient list. Overall thoughts about Esmeria Soothing Organics In many ways, the hair and body products from Esmeria Soothing Organics reminded me a lot of their skincare that I’d used before. The scents and texture was very similar. I was also sent a hand cream, which I hated as it did nothing for my hands and smelled funky. I loved a hand cream from Esmeria that they discontinued, and I’ve been pissed about that ever since because that was GOOD. This Esmeria Soothing Organics Soothing Hand Repair Cream (RM79.90!) was MEH! Boo! ? However, I was not informed if the Esmeria Soothing Organics is a new name or an offshoot of Esmeria Organics, and that puzzles me because I’m familiar with the old brand. I’m not a new user who only just discovered this because it was sent to me. I am quite familiar with it from years ago, so the inconsistent branding troubles me. And finally, although the products I’ve shown you here are decent, and I would even say, good products, I have to say that I find their prices a little steep. While certified organic brands do have slightly more premium pricing, at this time, economically speaking, I feel that paying RM59.90 for a body wash or RM79.90 for a hand cream is more of a luxury than an everyday affair. More so, when this product is sold at most pharmacies. The consolation of course, is that there are likely to be discounts offered from time to time. But if you have sensitive skin, then you may appreciate this, price notwithstanding. IN A NUTSHELL The Esmeria Soothing Organics range is an EcoCert certified organic range that appears to encompass hair and body products and are made by a local Malaysian company which also has other product ranges under the Esmeria Organics range. A little confusing, but there you go. I found the products non drying and comfortable on skin so their claims of being suitable for sensitive skin and scalp and even eczema skin might hold true. The scents are pleasant and not too strong, and the products clean hair and body well without drying out the skin. The downside is that I’d say that the prices are a little steep for pharmacy based products, especially when there are many options out there for those who aren’t fussy about natural, organic or even certified organic products. PROS: Not drying on skin, Pleasant scent that isn’t too strong, Shampoo does not leave my hair feeling dry or stripped, Conditioner leaves hair feeling soft but not limp, Body wash is comfortable and refreshing CONS: A little pricey, May not be easily found at easily accessible locations WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who has very dry or sensitive skin on their scalp or body, Anyone who has skin issues with eczema, Anyone who prefers using organic shampoo and body washes PRICE: From RM49.90 to RM79.90 AVAILABILITY: Most local pharmacies or some organic food shops Have you tried this brand before? Are you using an organic hair and body product and if so, which? I’m not very fussy as I’m not particular about products being natural or organic. I suppose I’m not very “green”, but at least I don’t pretend to be! LOL! ? But when I do come across organic/natural products that are nice, and unpretentious, then I don’t mind using them. But they do tend to be a little pricey don’t they? That’s a major stumbling block right there! Paris B']"

So attached, I even made my case out for them . They are the only body moisturisers I use. Not lotions, butters or creams. I hate those. But I love a good body oil. I also know my tastes in body oils run to the expensive ( REN Moroccan Rose and Antipodes Heavenly Oil come to mind). Not my fault that you need good oils to make a good body oil, you know ? But there are 2 oils that I’ve been using for a while that are relatively affordable and which are quite good as well. So I thought I’d let you know about them, if you want to experiment with body oils but aren’t sure about plonking down the cash for the pricier ones. There is a slight problem in that I’m not sure if we get either one locally in Malaysia. They both happen to be natural/organic skincare brands and I don’t hang out enough in stores selling organic or natural produce to know if they stock these, so if you do know, please feel free to share the information in the comments. Weleda Lavender Relaxing Body oil – RRP US$21/100ml Weleda is a natural based skincare brand which (I believe) originates from Germany but is found worldwide. I haven’t tried other products in the brand although I did also recently purchase a cleansing milk to try. This Lavender Relaxing Body Oil was my first time trying anything from the brand. The bottle is a nice hefty dark green glass which brings to my mind a medicine bottle. I liked it though. It felt solid and I always feel that oils keep better in a glass bottle than a plastic one. The thing I did not like about the packaging is that it isn’t a pump bottle. When you twist off the cap, there is a stopper in the mouth of the bottle, to control the flow of the oil, but it is still something you have to pour. You know how it is, it gets hard to estimate use and if you are not careful, you can overpour. But its a small bother. The oil is a clear oil that has a lovely strong, soothing lavender scent. I have run out of my favourite Dollymoo lavender body oil and its far far too expensive to ship anymore here so this has had to take its place. The oil is not very thick, and it absorbs very quickly and easily into my skin. If you apply it on damp skin, it’ll be quick, but I like applying it on dry skin before bed, so it stays on longer, but I don’t mind that. I love the gentle lavender scent and the texture and its very affordably priced for a nice body oil. I purchased mine on iherb.com for US$16.13 (approx RM49) and I don’t think it gets better than that! (You can use my iherb code MPW213 to get 5% off your order if you like ? ) Ingredients: Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, fragrance (parfum)*, limonene*, linalool*, geraniol*, coumarin*. * From natural essential oils Pangea Organics Body Oil – Pyrenees Lavender with Cardamom – RRP US$24/120ml The Pyrenees is a range of mountains that separate SouthWestern France and Spain. Its a lovely region but I didn’t know they were famous for lavender. Anyway, the Pangea Organics brand uses Pyrenees Lavender blended with Cardamom in their rejuvenating body oil. Like Weleda, this is my first proper brush with the brand Pangea Organics. Pangea Organics hails from the USA and is USDA Certified Organic for most of their products. The body oil is certified organic with the “Made with Organic Ingredients” label which allows for 70% organic ingredients. It gets too complicated delving into the intricacies of organic products and certification and I’m not well versed in the subject matter. I’m not 100% into the whole organic movement so its just a personal thing for me. I got this body oil also from iherb.com for about US$20.40 (approx RM62) and it was mostly because I was curious how lavender and cardamom would smell like. Cardamom is a spice commonly used in South Asian and South East Asian cooking and is quite spicy. Pangea Organics say its purifying, invigorating and uplifting the senses, while lavender is soothing, tension relieving and relaxing. Quite a bit of contradiction there, but you know what? It works. The usually sharper scent of lavender oil is tempered by the spiciness of the cardamom so the smell is more rounded and soothing. The smell in this oil isn’t as strong as that in the Weleda oil so I dock points for that. I like them more strongly scented with whatever essential oils it contains. The product comes in a pump bottle that is very practical and the oil feels a little thicker, but works well, absorbing quickly and keeping my skin moisturised. I’m already more than halfway through my bottle because its just easier to pump out a portion, than it is to unscrew the Weleda bottle and pour out what I need. Ingredients: Helianthus annuus (organic sunflower) seed oil, simmondsia chinensis (organic jojoba) oil, sesamum indicum (organic sesame) seed oil, olea europaea (organic extra virgin olive) oil, cocos nucifera (organic coconut) oil, citrus aurantium dulcis (organic blood orange) oil*, lavandula angustifolia (organic lavender) oil*, elettaria cardamomum (cardamom) oil*, lavandula mailette (lavender mailette) oil*, mixed tocopherol (vitamin E). *Essential oil I like both oils and I think they are both nice quality body oils that absorb well into skin and is thick enough to be used as massage oils, without leaving that sticky residue behind as is usually found in most massage oils. If you like the scent of lavender then you will prefer the Weleda Lavender Body Oil. I personally prefer it too because the scent is stronger and more all-enveloping as you massage it into your skin. The Pangea Organics rejuvenating oil has a much lighter scent and although my skin feels comfortable, I don’t find it as relaxing to the senses. Matter of what you prefer, really ? Are you sold on using body oils yet? What scents do you like in your body moisturisers? I like relaxing scents like lavender or its variants and also am not above a nice fresh rose scent. The “problem” I’d say is that high quality lavender and rose essential oils are pricey so the products too tend to be a bit pricier. Still, these 2 featured here are relatively wallet friendly so they are a good place to start experimenting ? I plan to pick up some other types next time so if you have tried either brand and have a fave please share! Paris B Local available of Weleda and Pangea Organics is unknown. Prices are as set out above in USD and my purchases were made from iherb.com through friends and family members. You can get 5% discount off your order using this code MPW213']"

I was however, too busy running round to really pay attention. I did however, file one eyeshadow palette away in my head as one “to check out”. It was, without surprise, the very neutral City Lights eyeshadow palette . During the event however, I noticed many of the girls trying out the new Chanel Road Movie eyeshadow palette , and they looked stunning! However, when I was actually faced with the palette at first, I was a little taken aback. The bright teal in the top left corner was throwing me for a loop. Having shied away from using colours like these for a while (I’m playing very safe in my dotage ? ) I was not sure if I was brave enough to try it. However, when I eventually did dip my brush into the palette, I realised that it was, at its heart, a neutral coloured palette. The teal adds a pop of colour, or shade, but for the most part, it is supremely wearable, and quickly entered daily rotation. While the Chanel Travel Diary collection puts at forefront the Palette Essentialle face palette, with the concealer, highlighter and blush, I’m unfortunately not sold on that one. It’s a good concept, if you like carrying your makeup around, and if you can find a shade that suits you, that you might like. While the concept fits right in with a collection conceptualised around travel, it is, I feel, not a product that will appeal to many. My pick from the Chanel Travel Diary collection therefore, is this eyeshadow palette, because I think it’s unique enough, yet practical enough to serve you well with different looks. In the Chanel Road Movie eyeshadow palette are 2 shimmer shades, and 2 matte satin shades. I feel that it is the matte satin colours that really make this palette what it is – a very wearable and easy to wear palette. The top two shades are shimmer shades, with a very fine textured shimmer without a hint of glitter. All they do is add that touch of shine to your lid, to give it a lovely 3D effect. The 2 shades at the bottom are satin matte and feel drier when swatched with fingers, but when you use a brush, they apply and blend beautifully on the lid. In case anyone missed it, this is the post-2014 Chanel eyeshadow formula , which has blown me away every single time. Previous formulas were crap. I owned 2 palettes and they were so bad with no colour pay off and chunky glitter all over the place. But post 2014, they are now well pigmented, blend beautifully and have graduated to a finely textured shimmer. I’ve loved every palette since. Well, most of them anyway LOL ? And I freely admit to being a little biased in their favour unless proven wrong. These are the swatches I’ve done with my fingers. Teal (shimmer) – The deep teal has shimmer, as you can see, and comes off on my skin a little more green. If you like, you can use this colour all over your lid, to really make your eyes pop. Or use it for a smokey eye look with a difference. Bronze (shimmer) – This is a light bronze with fine shimmer, that makes it a pretty stand-alone lid colour, or if you like, as an accent colour in the middle of your lid, or as a base shade. It blends out smoothly and easily. Beige-brown (satin matte) – Applied with a brush, colour is easily picked up and it blends out easily on the skin. I use this as a base colour, or as a blending colour to blend out any deeper colours along the eye socket Dark Blue (satin matte) – This feels fine, but applies with fingers more patchily than with a brush. I recommend using a brush because it picks up colour easily and blends it out very smoothly. I find that the pigments are easy to blend out, and they aren’t patchy, but smooth. This makes a good shading colour, which I usually use along the lash line to create shadow. Here’s a look I did using these shadows, just to give you an idea of how I’d use them. I skipped the Teal shade in this one. In this, I used the bronze as an all over lid shade. Then, I used the dark blue along the lash line, and then lightly smudged upwards at the outer corner (This is how I do my eyeshadow most of the time, as I find it most flattering for my eye shape) Then, I used the beige-brown to blend out the outside edges along the eye socket and “crease” where the lid folds. Believe you me when I say that this has to be one of the most effortless eye makeup I’ve done, and I was so surprised at how flattering it was, and how quickly it all came together! It was as if the colours literally melded into each other on their own. I loved it, and I love this palette, and I think that you will too! ? IN A NUTSHELL The Chanel Road Move eyeshadow palette (288) is rather bold looking eyeshadow palette but which is very wearable. The colours are easy to pick up with a brush, and apply smoothly and evenly on the skin. They are very easy to blend, and come together very well and very quickly. I love how easy it is to use, and how the teal can easily add a pop of colour to liven up a look. Truly, this is one of those palettes that you don’t think much about at first, but which surprises you so much, it ends up being a permanent fixture in your makeup kit! PROS: Smooth pigment, Easy to blend, Bold colours, Compact palette, Beautiful colours CONS: Pricey, The teal colour can be intimidating, The sponge applicators are useless WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a neutral palette with deeper tones, Anyone who wants a palette that can function both as a neutral palette and with some fun colour as well PRICE: RM210 | US$61 WHERE TO BUY: Chanel counters and boutiques, Chanel online I wanted to also show you a couple of the Fall-Winter Chanel Travel Diary lip products which I was gifted. There is one from each of the lip categories that Chanel currently has. In the big scheme of things, considering prices of makeup these days, I think that at RM120 | US$37, they are pretty decent for an entry into the brand :- Chanel Rouge Allure Ink – Chanel’s Rouge Allure Ink is their answer to the soft matte liquid lipstick trend and this is the only one that I can safely say I like . In this collection, there are 2 – 156 Lost (a very nude beige) and 158 Highway (LE) (a bright neon coral) . The one pictured here is Highway, which looks like a pale pink in the matte frosted tube, but which swatches a neon coral, as you’ll see below. It’s so mind boggling LOL Chanel Rouge Coco – This is the regular lipstick in bullet form, in the moisturising formula. In this collection are 2 shades – 472 Experimental (a bright red) and 474 Daylight (a nude) . I have it in Daylight, which you see in the lower tube, looks like a warm beige. However, it swatches a much more wearable beige with very slight pink undertones. Another surprise. Chanel Rouge Allure Velvet – This is Chanel’s answer to the matte solid lipstick, and again, the only one I am very happy to wear . 2 shades are available – 63 Nightfall (a deep red) and 64 First Light (a warm bright orange-red) . In tube, it looks vermillion. I am quite scared of wearing orange on my lips. It doesn’t flatter my complexion. However, this one has more red tones in it, enough to allow me to wear it quite easily. Another mind boggling difference between the colour in tube and the colour on skin. The colours look a tad more muted in the photo than in real life. In real life, that swatch of Rouge Allure Ink in Highway on the right is neon coral! Not a colour I’d wear, but if you are young and carefree, you’ll embrace it. In fact, if it’s a colour you think you might wear, leave a comment below and mention it in passing so I know you’re interested, and if there’s more than one of you, I’ll just do a quick draw (I’ll send within Malaysia only, sorry). I had a suspicion I wasn’t going to like the colour (I don’t wear pale pinks either) so I used a cotton bud to swatch ? Did you pick up anything from Chanel’s Travel Diary collection? Does Road Movie eyeshadow catch your eye? I was very pleasantly surprised at how Road Movie turned out on me, so I’m very happy with it. Definitely a palette I can travel with, and make my own travel diary with! ? Paris B']"

For some reason, when I first came across Leahlani Skincare on Instagram (where all lemmings are born), I was drawn to it. Was it the pretty pastel packaging? Or perhaps the quirky names of products like “Siren Serum” or “Mermaid Mask”? Or perhaps the lovely, relaxed vibe the brand gave off. I could almost feel the warm, balmy Hawaiian breeze against my skin. But I ran into a snag. It was very expensive to have it shipped to me here in Malaysia from Hawaii. So I heaved a regretful sigh, and resigned myself to admiring it from afar. Until one day, the brand popped up on one of my favourite etailers, and I hauled! One of the first items I added to my cart was the famed Leahlani Mermaid Mask . Like unicorns, mermaids were enjoying their day in the sun for a spell, but it seems more shortlived. Unicorns are still going strong aren’t they? ? Leahlani Skincare is a natural skincare brand, with a holistic slant. The owner, Leah, wanted to create a skincare range that was not only good for the skin, but that people would enjoy using. Each item in the Leahlani Skincare range is a sensorial delight. The colours are different from what you’d see in most skincare, ranging from deep green in the Mermaid Mask, to the warm pink of the Bless Balm, and to the golden champagne liquid of Siren Serum. The glass packaging is luxurious and the scents are intoxicating, soothing and delicious. This is a brand I am definitely looking to delve further into, but I’ll kick off with the Leahlani Mermaid Mask . The Leahlani Mermaid Mask is truly a cult product. So cult that I have not really seen it outside of most skincare-centric blogs or Instagram accounts. It is out there, yet not out there. A bit of an open secret. What it is, is what Leahlani says is a “superfood for your skin” that feeds your skin to reveal a radiant and vibrant complexion, as it purifies and renews your skin. The deep green colour comes from organic chlorella and spirulina, 2 ingredients you rarely hear outside of healthfood stores or green juices. But like a green juice, these superfood ingredients feed your skin. What it is supposed to do is to purify and renew the skin by boosting circulation, fight breakouts, and boost skin moisture. What really seals the deal for me, isn’t the strange pond-scum green, nor the idea of slathering superfoods on your skin. It was the honey. The primary component of the Leahlani Mermaid Mask is raw honey, and I personally swear by honey for all the benefits that this mask claims to have. Honey is well documented to be a natural antiseptic, and has antibacterial properties, as well as boosting moisture. Thus far, my experience with honey in skincare has been from Manuka Honey, which I ingest as well as apply to my skin. So, that was what interested me most about the Leahlani Mermaid Mask. Here’s a very important point to note. When you first receive your Leahlani Mermaid Mask, you will notice a dry crusty layer, and crumbly texture to the product. What you need to do is to take a clean spatula or teaspoon (if you don’t have a spatula), plunge it deep down into the jar till it hits the bottom, and then stir. It will feel thick and it will be hard to move, but persist. Stir it like you’re one of MacBeth’s witches LOL! ? Very quickly, you will notice how the product will combine, and turn into a thick, viscous, texture, that looks shiny. When you no longer see lumps, stop. Your Leahlani Mermaid Mask is now ready to be used. This texture will remain, and it will not return to its dry, crumbly texture again. You can see my jar above. It has been a while, but it retains its semi-liquid texture. If you don’t use it for a while, you may notice that the top layer will harden a little. But it’s fine. Just scoop it up with a spatula or your clean fingers, and spread it on your skin. The bottom layer will be easier to spread. I do find that when you first remove the product from the jar, it is quite thick and hard to spread on the skin. But the warmth of your skin will help it melt and soften a little, and then it is easier to handle. Leahlani suggests that you warm it up a little between your fingers before applying to the skin. I sometimes apply it onto damp skin. When you spread it on your skin, it will look like that swatch on your left. It looks thick, with a slightly glossy sheen from the honey, and what I’d call pond-scum green LOL! I’m not very romantic. To me, it isn’t emerald. More like verdigris ? But what’s interesting is after you’ve left it on your skin for a little while, it looks like the swatch on your right above. It seems to almost dry up (without really drying up) and dissolve against your skin. You can leave it on for 5-15 minutes as Leahlani recommends, but I have left it on for up to an hour. After an hour, a lot of the product seems to have gone. I’m not sure where it goes to though. It does smell quite sweet, with a natural honey scent, and almost seems to be edible. As I’ve noted, the product will warm up on contact with your skin. So, be prepared for it to slip. For this reason, I do not recommend using too much product. A thin layer is sufficient, there’s no real need to pack it on thick, so you resemble Aquaman. Just a thin layer will do, because it can otherwise be wasted. Do note as well, that if it does slip, it a) tastes pretty good, sweet like the honey that it is and b) it can sting your eyes something awful! ? It does not dry or harden on the skin, and it rinses off quite easily. I notice that when you start rinsing it from your skin (it will make a mess of your bathroom sink so I suggest you do this just before you shower) there is a slight grainy feel, that almost feels like an exfoliation of your skin. I believe that it is this, that leads to the smooth feel of your skin after washing off the product. I do notice an almost immediate brightening of the skin (which I attribute to exfoliation and a general cleansing, nothing magical) and a boost to moisture. Skin feels softer, smooth and with a general moisture boost. But as much as I enjoy using this, and the fun factor I derive, I hesitate to call this one magical, or to be head over heels for it, as many are. It is a good product, I do not deny. But I’d go back to my Antipodes Aura Manuka Honey mask , if I were forced to choose between the two. The reason being that I feel this Leahlani Mermaid Mask, with its exfoliating properties, less suitable to be used daily (if I wanted), too messy to use and less portable. The Leahlani Mermaid Mask is one you’d use at home, maybe once or twice a week. It is fun. Being organic and natural, you’d want to use it up in a short time so it does not go bad. The Antipodes Aura mask is one you’d be able to use daily if you wanted, as it does not exfoliate, it is portable and treats spots (which I don’t notice with the Leahlani Mermaid Mask) and you can leave it on overnight if you’d like without creating an unholy mess. I hesitate to say I’d repurchase the Leahlani Mermaid Mask for these reasons. It’s a fun product, and one I’d use up. It does what it’s supposed to – brighten, add moisture and soften skin. But I’m not sold down the river, I’m afraid. Maybe it just feels a little too gimmicky for me right now, albeit an effective, fun, gimmick. IN A NUTSHELL The Leahlani Mermaid Mask is a mask with a raw honey base, blended with spirulina and chlorella as its primary ingredients. If you are sensitive to marine products, you may want to be a little careful as it also contains algae. This gives it its distinctive deep green colour. When you first receive it, be sure to use a spatula or spoon and mix it up properly, so it turns into a thick, goopy liquid texture. Do not apply too much to the skin, as the warmth of the skin can cause the product to slip. It does taste quite good, but it can sting the eyes. It does not harden on the skin, but after 15-40 minutes, you can rinse it off quite easily. I find it to quite gently exfoliate the skin, as I feel little grains under my fingertips. It does almost immediately brighten the skin, and leaves it feeling soft, smooth and with a boost of moisture. Due to its exfoliating texture, I do not use it more than twice a week. It is a fun product, that does what it says on the tin. But after the rainbows and glitter blow away, I do feel like it can be a little more trouble than it’s worth, for quite basic results. PROS: Fun to use, Skin looks immediately brighter after use, Skin feels softer and more plumped with moisture after use, Does not dry the skin, Fun to use CONS: Not portable, Can be hard to spread on skin initially, If you use too much, it can slip into your eyes and sting, Messy WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a fun, effective mask, Anyone who uses natural and organic skincare and wants something a little different PRICE: US$32 | RM175 | £34.00 for 50ml WHERE TO BUY: Leahlani Skincare , Cult Beauty (International), Caliata (MY) Here is the ingredient list for the Leahlani Mermaid Mask A point of note about where to buy. I bought mine from Cult Beauty. I later met with Caliata and found out that they were going to bring in the brand. For those of us in Malaysia, Caliata now carries Leahlani Skincare. Due to the nature of the ingredients used in this brand (natural) I’d prefer to purchase this locally. I am unaffiliated with Caliata for this, but I say so because this brand comes from Hawaii, and it is shipped here directly, and then onto the customer. By contrast, purchasing from Cult Beauty means that it is first shipped from Hawaii to London, and then onto the customer here. Carbon footprint aside, I have a real concern about natural products degrading in transit from heat or motion. I have less of a concern with synthetic ingredients. For this reason, and this reason only, I’d buy my Leahlani skincare locally ? Have you tried this cult favourite Leahlani Mermaid Mask? I know lots of people are very taken by it. I was one of them who got suckered in thanks to the hype. I’m happy to report that the hype is real. I’m just a little more real too LOL! ? Paris B']"

But I love them because they give my skin the loveliest kiss of colour and glow without ever looking like I fell into a vat of clown makeup, and they’re light so mistakes are minimised. Late last year when news came out that they had been reformulated, I approached it with some trepidation. I don’t like it when my favourite items get discontinued and reformulated. It’s like if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, ya know? But fix it they did and Dior rather quietly launched their new Vibrant Color Blush in 12/13 new shades with more to come. The new Dior blushes don’t come in the split pan 2 formulas anymore. Now, we get the rather more conventional 1 shade blush, packaged rather similarly with the Rosy Glow Blush in Petal which has been made permanent (I love that one!). Externally, it looks the same. Internally, it’s different. But is it a good difference? I purchased one last year in Coral Cruise 676 after hemming and hawing at the counter for ages. I now tend to gravitate to pink blushes but coral. I could work with that! The colour in pan is pretty vibrant. In fact, they all are, and that certainly lives up to their name. Coral Cruise is a peachy coral-pink shade of blush that I might have passed on if the SA did not insist that I try it. Happily, she did know better. I love this colour! Despite the rather frightening bright coral in pan, the blush isn’t as pigmented as the name implies. Colour is easily picked up by a brush and I find that it diffuses quite prettily on cheeks. There is no discernible shimmer but there is a glow and it does give me that blush from within, that we all seek. If you like bright pops of colour therefore, you may wrinkle your nose at this because it may not live up to your expectations. However, Dior in anticipating this, now has some very interesting deep shades of blush that rival that of NARS so if you like the texture and have a deeper skintone, or just want a brighter colour blush, you now can wear Dior blushes unlike the rather paltry pale offerings before this. Here is a picture of all the new Dior Vibrant Color blushes available as of now and the colour range is quite friendly to most skintones, which makes me happy of course. The texture is lovely and fine milled and now, if you have deeper skintones, you can quite easily find a colour to suit you ? I am considering that rose toned one that’s 4th in row from the top though. I think it’ll be pretty albeit a challenge to work with. We’ll see. Maybe the next time I’m feeling flush – after all I can always do with another blush ? Here’s a small swatch comparison of Coral Cruise alongside some other blushes I own of similar tone. (1) Dior Vibrant Color Blush – Coral Cruise 676 (2) Benefit Coralista blush (3) Bobbi Brown Apricot blush (4) Lancome Blush Subtle in Peach Nuance You may notice from the swatch on skin that it isn’t shimmery nor is it purely matte. The shade is also a nice touch of coral, with just the right amount of pink. On my skin, I find it quite flattering and it’s very easy to build up colour if I want it to look a little more obvious, or just wear it as a very light barely there flush of colour. Is she blushing? Is she not? ? So here’s how it looks on me. A very pretty pop of colour on cheeks. I’ve been using it so often since I got it simply because it’s so easy to get it right, and to blend it into my skin. Love it? Oh yeah. Dior got this reformulation right! In a nutshell The new Dior Vibrant Color blushes have been reformulated and repackaged. The new blushes come in only 1 colour instead of the split pan and the colours now come in more vibrant shades ranging from the very light to the very deep red to suit most skintones. Despite the vibrancy of colour in the pan, the product does not swatch as strong so it’s quite easy to control the colour on skin. I find a soft natural hair brush applies the colour in a softer more diffused manner and it gives a lovely glow from within that lasts for hours. I love these and am already thinking of the next shade to get! Pros: Soft, diffused colour on skin, new vibrant shades of blush for variety, not shimmery, easy to blend on skin for a transparent natural flush Cons: Pricey, Some people may find it too sheer, but it can be layered and colour controlled Who will like this: Anyone who likes soft coloured blushes that can be layered for intensity The brush included works in a pinch so don’t toss it out just yet. I rarely use it but it can come in handy if you’re on the go and want a quick touch up. It does pick up a little more colour than I like so be lighthanded! Have you tried the new Dior Vibrant Colour blushes? Is there a colour you think I should take a look at? I was worried I wouldn’t like these but I shouldn’t have. They’re pricey, I’d admit so I can’t in good conscience tell you to run out and buy one but if you are in the market for a nice high end blush, in this price category, it’s absolutely worth taking a look. Dior knows their blushes and they did well with these new ones. I think the new brighter colours will also appeal to a wider group of people, which is great ?

Previously, it wasn’t even sold in Malaysia and when it was, it was only in Sephora. But these days, you can spot Clarisonic counters in some major department stores e.g. Parkson Pavilion KL as well as Sephora stores. I was told also that you may even be able to get them at selected Biotherm or Lancome counters but I haven’t seen it for myself so I can’t say for sure. But if you’re thinking of getting on that bandwagon, let me introduce to you the newest addition to the Clarisonic family – the Clarisonic Aria . The Clarisonic Aria was launched here in Malaysia about 2 months back and I was told it’d be available in April 2014. However, I have also been told that it’s been available for about a month already so I’m guessing some of you may have already bitten the bait ? Before I tell you about the Aria, let me just say that my previous thoughts on the Clarisonic face cleansing system still stand. I still think that it is best used not daily but at most twice a week unless you have very oily skin and I still think that you should not over do it. Which will bring me to a feature of the Aria that bugs me. But let’s talk about the good things first. The Aria is rather larger than the Mia but seems to fit in the hands better. The size and design is at once ergonomic and comfortable to hold. The set I have is in White but it comes in other colours too, I believe. What makes the Clarisonic a little different from its competitors out there lies in the system. Most competitor systems operate on a spinning brush head but the Clarisonic’s brush head moves differently. It oscillates at a sonic frequency that produces about 300 movements per second. On the skin, it feels like it’s spinning, but it isn’t because there is a pulsing motion as well as it cleans the skin. So, what Clarisonic promises and what many people experience, is cleaner skin. It is supposed to be able to remove makeup with just a cleanser and cleanses skin better than just using your hands. And cleaner skin usually translates as clearer, healthier skin. I disagree, because I don’t think a gadget should replace proper cleansing – makeup remover or cleansing oil/balm and facial wash but that’s me. I’m a little anal about proper cleansing ? In fact, Clarisonic is so confident you’ll love their gadget, they are offering a 30 day money back guarantee along with a 2 year product warranty! But how did I like the Clarisonic Aria and how different from the Mia is it to me? Well, I like the Aria about as much as I liked the Mia, which is to say, not much. The reason is primarily because I prefer not to use a cleansing gadget on my skin. My previous experience with the Mia has taught me that these gadgets are actually quite harsh on the skin and the brush acts like a scrubber. So, if you aren’t recommended to use a face scrub daily, why use a brush like this daily? So for me, a face flannel and a cleansing balm does a good enough job and keeps my skin happy. (I know purists will stop me at this juncture and tell me it doesn’t exfoliate. It does. Perhaps not as vigorously, but it does. Anything that brushes against the skin that way exfoliates in every true definition of the word) I do have one caveat and that is that Clarisonic sells a Sensitive and Delicate brush head. I find that both the Sensitive and Delicate brush heads most skin-friendly if you really want to use this gadget. The brush supplied, which is the normal brush, is really far too harsh even if I know a lot of people like it. I’m just sayin’ ? So if you use either the Sensitive or Delicate brush heads, then it is more gentle on the skin. The other thing I wasn’t too keen on with the Aria is that it comes in 3 speeds. Fast, faster and fastest ? I tested the 2nd and 3rd speeds and found the brush was too harsh for me especially if you aren’t careful and press it on your skin with too much pressure. I personally do not see the need for those sorts of speeds and I’d tell you to proceed with caution. In that sense, the Mia is quite sufficient, with its one speed that does the job well enough. If you are planning to purchase the Clarisonic though, I’d recommend you buy it here or in whichever country you are living in because of the plug and voltage. I bought my Mia overseas and it came with a US plug. It charges up well enough with a universal adapter but that’s a hassle. So if you buy it here in Malaysia, you’ll get the plug and voltage suitable for use here which I can tell you will mean you’ll use it more, because I can’t be arsed to charge up my Mia ? Recognising this probably, the Aria comes with a USB type charger which makes it very easy when you travel with this. I know of people who can’t live without their Clarisonic and this makes it much easier to take it with you. You can just plug it into a laptop to charge, or into a wall plug that accepts USB ports. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy! ? All said and done, the Aria is pretty much an upgraded Clarisonic device. The selling points would be the 3 speed control and the USB charger. Otherwise, if you already use other Clarisonic gadgets, there’s no need to upgrade. If you want to get on the Clarisonic bandwagon, this is one to consider, but then the Mia is more affordable, especially because I’d advise you to buy the Sensitive or Delicate brush head and swap out the one supplied. Ultimately, all the Clarisonic devices serve the same function – to clean your face. Many people love it and can’t live without. I’m one of the rare few who’d tell you to skip it but I can also tell you that it’s not going to stop any of you from buying one in your lifetime, just to see what the hype is all about ? So go on then. Buy one, but do consider getting the Delicate or Sensitive brush heads. I swapped mine out and I prefer it. I rarely use the gadget but with the water shortage going on , I’m a bit more lax about my face cleansing than I should be and a once or twice a week run of the Clarisonic over my skin does seem to help. Are you a fan of the Clarisonic devices? Are you thinking of getting one or has the hype got to you already? As I have them, I use them occasionally. In fact, I’d suggest you read my previous review together with this one because my thoughts are the same. I maintain that it’s important not to overdo (it caused my skin to over-exfoliate and break out really badly and dry out with daily use) and it’s important not to put too much pressure on the skin (make my skin over sensitive). I maintain oily skin types will benefit most from this because it does clean your skin incredibly well but if you have drier skin, reconsider. I’d only suggest you use it once or at most, twice a week and really, do you need a RM600 gadget for that? I’d tell you to invest instead in a pile of face flannels that you can use daily.

Let’s be honest. It takes A LOT to wow me these days. Otherwise it’s usually “Yes, that’s pretty but haven’t we already seen something similar?” So, when I tell you that here’s a product that made me sit up and pay attention about 2 months ago, you betcha it’s something quite impressive. And it’s coming out of left field for me because it’s coming from Bobbi Brown, a brand from which I never quite expected a product that leaves me absolutely BURSTING to tell you all about it! ? Even better when it’s a product that isn’t all that revolutionary – eyeliner. How much more revolutionary can you get?! Ah but these Bobbi Brown Perfectly Defined Gel Eyeliners are so good! Imagine if you will, the smoothness and lasting power of the iconic Bobbi Brown Longwear Gel Liners but in a pencil form. No more faffing about with brushes and little tiny pots. Just twist, swipe and go! Not new right? True. But these stay on all day long, all through a vigorous house cleaning session and a quick yoga workout. Now how many eyeliners can boast that? ? The Perfectly Defined Gel Eyeliner is new from the Bobbi Brown stables and I was first introduced to it in a preview by BB Makeup Artist, Kai Vinson a few months back . He showed me this new product and used Pitch Black to line my eyes. The colour is truly, as the name implies, a pitch black! If you’re looking for a true black liner, this is it! I have been waiting for these to launch since then because I just knew, I was going to go crazy! There are 6 colours available, of which I was sent 2 by the lovely folks at Bobbi Brown Malaysia, and the minute I knew they were out at counters, I ran off to buy another 2. I couldn’t decide on the balance 2 which is why I only have 4 for now, but they are permanent so I have time to decide ? This operates like a retractable pencil liner. Twist it up to expose enough product to draw a line and then twist it back to avoid breaking. My advise is not to twist up too much, because it can and will break off and that will be heart breaking because they are rather pricey. When they come brand new as you see from Pitch Black and Sapphire, the tip is fairly sharp so you can draw a thin line very easily. Scotch and Violet Night are used and have been sharpened (a little more on that below) so you don’t get as precise an appearance. Bobbi Brown calls these Gel Eyeliners, and if you can imagine, they are rather like the gel liners but in pencil form as opposed to being in a pot. The product is very creamy and very pigmented and it draws a line very smoothly on skin, without skipping or tugging at your lid. The best part is their lasting power. I’m serious, it’s incredible! After Kai used it on me, I went home, cleaned my house (yes, with a full face on makeup on – you mean you don’t do that? ? ) and then did a quick half an hour session of yoga. When I went to clean off my makeup, I was quite stunned that after all the vigorous activity, I only have the mildest of smudges under my eyes. For the most part, the eyeliner was intact. That takes a hell of a lot of doing! If you apply it on your hand (though I’m not sure why you will) you will realise just how hard it is to remove it. You do need a waterproof eye makeup remover or cleansing oil for this one so take note of that! Here are the swatches of the colour I own in relative natural light drawn with just 1 swipe down my hand. I’ll describe it for you thus:- Pitch Black – a matte deep black Violet Night – a deep violet with some shimmer Sapphire – a matte deep dark sapphire blue Scotch – a medium toned brown with shimmer Scotch and Sapphire are colours you can wear on their own without any eye makeup and with Scotch, if you apply a thick line and blend out the edges, you can even wear it like a cream eyeshadow. It makes the colour very versatile and I like wearing it that way. On its own. Violet Night looks like a black when you draw it on, except that there is some shimmer (not as much as in Scotch) and gives a softer appearance as opposed to black. Pitch Black is as the name implies, a deep dark black. As you can see, the pigment is very strong and the texture is very smooth and creamy. Absolutely freaking fabulous! Here are some swatches I took in store under store lighting. The other 2 colours are:- Steel Grey – a medium toned matte dark grey Chocolate Truffle – a matte dark brown I may pass on Steel Grey but I may go back and get Chocolate Truffle. The reason I didn’t was that I wasn’t sure if I already had it or Scotch but it turned out I had Scotch! Chocolate Truffle reminds me of the pot gel liner in Sepia, which is a colour I used to the last bits. The reason I stopped using them was mostly due to the hassle having to use a proper brush etc etc. But now with this, it’s just a twist, swipe and go! I must say however that although it is pretty much budge proof, I do get some shadow on my lower lid when I use it on my lower lash line, to tightline and when I squeeze my eyes shut when I sneeze or laugh a lot. If I don’t do all that, I’m pretty much smudge free for most of the day. The thin nib allows you to apply the product very close to your lash line so tightlining isn’t quite necessary, and the tip also allows you to do a cat eye flick if you like that. I will say however, that for a more precise line, the pot gel liner and a brush does a smoother, cleaner job but this pencil gel liner version makes it more convenient. I do find that it blunts very easily and I only found out in store that the back end hides a mini sharpener! So if you want a sharp tip, you can sharpen it quite easily. This explains how I got the Scotch and Violet Night to have the tip again, in the picture above. They were already flat ? The other down side to the price is that I forsee it to finish quickly if you use it often. The texture is so soft that drawing on your liner results in this being used up fairly quickly. Of course, if you just draw a thin line and not thickly line to define it’ll last longer than someone who does, but it’s a point to note. Otherwise, this my friends, has me bouncing up and down in my seat with glee at its arrival. If Bobbi Brown discontinues this, I think I’ll cry. And my eyeliner wouldn’t budge even then ? In a nutshell The Bobbi Brown Perfectly Defined Gel Eyeliner is a pencil version of the pot gel liners that the brand is famous for. I like how creamy they are and how easy they are to use. It is thin enough that you can get close to your lash line and draw in a nice strong line and there is a hidden sharpener at the back to allow you to get a sharp nib if you want. The colours are fairly dark and incredibly pigmented and opaque. One pass is all you really need especially with colours like Pitch Black or Violet Night. For me, they last and last through sweat and tears and thus far, have been the only product to have truly wowed me. Absolutely worth trying, if dark, pigmented, budgeproof liners are your thing! Pros: Longlasting, Deep dark pigmented colours, Creamy and soft, No tugging or skipping on skin, Easy to use, Mini sharpener allows you to get a fresh sharp tip if you want, Budge-proof Cons: Pricey, Soft texture results in you using up more product more quickly Who will like this: Anyone who has trouble using pencil eyeliner, Anyone who wants a deep dark black liner, Anyone who likes using gel liner but wants something in a more convenient packaging Here’s an idea of what it might look like when worn. I wore Violet Night here (you can’t even see the shimmer although you can in Scotch) and this is the same look in this post if you want to get an idea of an overall look. If the nib is blunt, it’s harder to get a defined cat eye flick, so for that, the pot gel version might be a better way to go. Am I raving too much? I am aren’t I? I’m all *flaps hands* “Oh gawd! These are like, you know, the bestest liners everrrrr!!” Ok I’ll shut up now ? Does this product interest you? Do you like the Bobbi Brown gel eyeliner? I used to have Sepia, Cobalt and Hunter. The one I used up eventually was Sepia but I found having to use brush daily was a hassle so I never repurchased. It might interest you to note that I’ve replaced my old HG pencil liner ( Guerlain Kohl pencil liner ) with this one, and I tightline with the Wayne Goss Brush 8 . Yes, it’s that good! ?

Ugh I say, because they’re such luxurious treats that cause a serious dent to the wallet, and to the head of someone who you throw this at. I always say the Rouge G is like a weapon. When they called it a lipstick bullet, I didn’t think they meant it literally until the Rouge G came along LOL! ? I have quite a thing for the Guerlain Rouge G formula and while the regular heavy silver bullet is luxury personified, Guerlain shows off their playful side in their few limited edition Rouge G offerings. I have a few of them from previous collections so when I saw that there was a new one out, I was champing at the bit to get at it! As luck would have it, one of the limited edition beauties landed on my messy desk and with a squeal of delight, it was the one I was lusting after – Rouge G in Rose Grenat 864 . Guerlain has gone after all pink lovers’ hearts by making a limited edition bright pink case to house the limited edition Rose Grenat and a pale pink case to house its sibling Rose Glace (866) which is a light pink – a colour I wouldn’t wear. But let me tell you about Rose Grenat, because it’s flying off the shelves, despite the hefty pricetag and if you still don’t know what the fuss is about Rouge G lipsticks, you have to get Rose Grenat because it embodies everything that’s wonderful about these creamy lipsticks. I hesitate to say “must have” but if pockets allow, this is a must have… unless you have Provocative ? Let me show you what I mean. We should be familiar with the Guerlain Rouge G packaging by now, but if you aren’t, this is one of the heaviest lipsticks out there. I haven’t weighed it but trust me, when you’re carrying 3 of them in your makeup pouch at one go, you definitely feel the weight. Aside from the hot pink enamel cover, the packaging is pretty much the same as the regular Rouge G line. The lipstick fits with a magnetic click into the cover and when you pull it out, it pops open to reveal a very handy mirror. It’s saved me countless times from having to pull out a separate mirror for touch ups (that you don’t really need anyway!) The bright pink cover is a surprise departure. Previous limited edition designs had the body come in a black case or a cover with a design on it. This one’s different and while pink or hot pink isn’t a colour to get my blood rushing, the lipstick colour is. Rose Grenat 864 is a beautiful rose red with a slightly cool base. This colour is one I can quite safely say will flatter most skintones, light or dark, cool or warm. It has a wonderful mix of shades and tones that makes it so wearable. The texture is creamy as with all Rouge G lipsticks, it is opaque in one swipe and it feels and looks incredible on lips. I love the colour to bits, but I couldn’t help feeling that it looked rather familiar. It wasn’t until I did a side by side swatch test that I realised why I fell in love with Rose Grenat. It is almost a perfect dupe for the Limited Edition Provocative Rouge G that was released for Christmas 2013 ! Just look at the swatches above (just 1 swipe mind you!) and tell me I’m not seeing things. Madame Batifole (another fave – what am I saying, I love all the Rouge G colours I have!) is a much cooler and deeper fuchsia as compared to Rose Grenat and Provocative. The latter two are practically the same colour! So, if you already have Provocative then you won’t need Rose Grenat, unless you love pink and want the pink cover, or you are kicking yourself for not getting another Provocative Rouge G when it was available. Now you can get a colour that’s practically the same. I don’t quite mind having 2 of the same or similar shade because I love this colour. It’s a colour that really brightens the complexion and makes you look alive. The opacity and pigment is incredible, staying put for hours if that’s your thing and even lasting quite well through food and drink. Did I mention how incredible the Rouge G formula is? I have haven’t I? I’m raving aren’t I? ? Ok I’ll stop now. But for the sake of completeness, since I realise that few of us wear lipstick on our arms, here’s how it looks when I wear Rose Grenat. The colour is absolutely stunning, and I love bright shades like this because it means I can downplay the rest of my makeup! It’s far easier and quicker to slick on a bright lip as opposed to messing about with the eyes and getting it wrong (as I’ve been wont to do lately) so Rose Grenat has been quite a saviour for me in the mornings. So if budget permits, run, don’t walk to your nearest Guerlain counter and pick this one up ? In a nutshell I love Guerlain Rouge G lipsticks as is well documented on the blog whenever I come across it. The texture is creamy yet light, the opacity and colour pigment is incredible and the staying power is wonderful for a product so opaque. Rose Grenat is a limited edition colour for Spring 2014 and comes in a limited edition case with a hot pink cover. The colour is a beautiful rose-red-pink that I feel will flatter almost every skintone but it is incredibly similar to Provocative from Christmas 2013. So, if you have Provocative, you can pass on Rose Grenat. But if you missed out on Provocative or want a back up, then this is it. Love! Pros: Creamy texture yet light on lips, Opaque in 1 swipe, Strong pigment, Good lasting power on lips, Beautiful lip shade that will flatter most skintones, Mirror included in the cover is very useful, Beautiful packaging as befits the brand Cons: Pricey, Limited Edition Who will like this: Anyone who likes wearing creamy, opaque, pigmented lipstick I’ve slacked off checking out limited edition stuff this year. It’s just a turn I’m taking, preferring to go back to basics i.e. what works from each brand, which means permanent items. A lot of limited edition items just aren’t living up to standard, but with this lipstick, Guerlain has scored a winner! Did you check out Rose Grenat or Rose Glace with their limited edition pink covers? Do you have a favourite Rouge G colour? I love all the Rouge G lipsticks I have but I have to say that the bright shades and reds are among the best I’ve come across in a lipstick from any brand. A personal favourite is Garconne (25), a permanent colour and a bee-yoo-ti-ful red. If you’re ever in the market for a flattering red lipstick, check out Garconne. I hope to remember to review it at some point ? But if you prefer something more fun, get Rose Grenat. Promise you, you won’t regret it ?

This missing mojo thing quite a tricky one! But then I realised that I was being too silly and taking things too seriously. All you want to know is what is this I’m talking about and how I liked it! Now, that’s not that hard is it? ? So what is this? This is the latest upgrade to the existing Diorsnow skincare collection which I believe maybe found in Asia only – home of whitening/brightening skincare. If you do know if it being available elsewhere in the world, do let me know! Last year, Dior introduced Icelandic Glacial Water in their Diorsnow range . This has been maintained this year. What’s new this year is that silver bottle you see at forefront of the photo – Diorsnow Anti-Spot serum or the Serum Anti-Taches which tickles me to no end, because I keep seeing ‘moustaches’ everytime I look at it ? This product, as the name implies, serves to combat the appearance of dark spots with the stimulation for the skin to produce ‘filaggrin’ – a protein Dior labs found was lacking in areas affected by pigmentation. So the principle is thus – make the skin form more filaggrin and it’ll help calm the cells and reduce melanin production. Does it work though? I pondered that because to be perfectly honest, I’ve never come across any product that can actually do much for the pigmentation spots no matter what they claim. Face it, topical products cannot do the work of laser. But I did derive some benefit from using it. If you participated in the Dior x MWS product sampling exercise we had about a month ago, you will have received a deluxe sized sample of this Anti-Spot Serum in your kit. I hope you’ve tried it because here’s where you get to share your story ? I actually used the whole Diorsnow range as you see above for about 2 weeks and I’ll run it down quickly for you below. However, I had to stop after a little more than 2 weeks, because like many whitening products, I found it too drying for my skin. I almost expect it of whitening products these days which is why although I know that you derive the best benefits from using a full range of whitening products, I don’t. I usually use the whitening serums and top up with hydration in the day and hydration and anti-aging at night. My skin seems to prefer a regimen like this and performs better, primarily because of the hydration ? Diorsnow White Reveal Gentle Purifying Foam – RM140/110ml This one isn’t the “new and improved” formula but its the first time I’m trying it so I thought I’d say a few words about it ? As the name implies, its a foaming creamy face wash that lathers up very impressively. The texture is like sinking your face into a soft tub of melting ice cream. Sorry, poor analogy but the only one that came to my head ? I think guys would love to use it in lieu of their shaving foam even. It cleans skin very well and leaves it feeling soft and velvety. I do find it quite drying if you use it daily so I now use it once or twice a week. I think I’m a little obsessed with the texture ? Diorsnow D-NA Control White Reveal Day Essence – RM435/50ml This is the same product as that from last year so you can read my thoughts on it in my previous review . In a nutshell, its a serum for day use. I’ve been on it for over 2 months and have to say that on its own, it isn’t very drying to my skin. It does help my skin even out tone but it is not noticeable. It will take quite a while with regular use so I’d say this is a long term thing. I personally feel that pairing it with a hydration serum or moisturising product helps it work better but that’s my unscientific view of course. It just seemed that way to me ? Here’s the ingredient list if you’re interested. Diorsnow Anti-Spot Serum – RM350/30ml or RM450/50ml I’m going to stick my neck out and say that if there was a whitening serum that I liked for an overall result, I’m picking the Diorsnow Anti-Spot Serum. This is a new item in the collection and I use it both day and night. In the day, I use this only on cheeks, where my pigmentation is worst, together with the Day Essence. At night, I use it on its own together with a hydrating serum and an anti-aging night cream. Covering all bases y’see ? Did help lighten pigmentation? Nope, it wasn’t that noticeable even if it did improve. However, I noticed that it was working very effectively on my skin in general, to even out my skintone and even make it look brighter. What I think I liked about it was how subtle it was. I noticed it after about 2 weeks, when putting on my makeup. I found I could get away with using some very light tinted moisturiser as opposed to heavier liquid foundations. In fact, I could pretty much just walk around without base makeup without feeling too self-conscious (although I do it all the time anyway :D) My pigmentation and freckles are still there, I still do not have porcelain, unblemished skin but not having used any whitening products for almost 6 months, I find that my skin has improved in clarity in the past 2 months. Of all the products in this range, I’m only using the Anti-Spot Serum and the Day Essence. When I’m done, I’ll stop the Day Essence and just use the Anti-Spot Serum paired with whatever hydrating serum I’m using at present. I personally think it sufficient for my needs ? Here’s the Anti-Spot Serum ingredient list. Diorsnow Fresh Creme Global Transparency – RM300/50ml I liked the texture of this cream, which is a very light gel-cream texture. Like all Dior cream products, it comes in a substantial tub and a spatula. The opening is sealed with foil when it comes new, so do bear this in mind if you purchase something like this online. Dior creams come sealed with a foil cover. However, I couldn’t like this one despite its lovely texture. My skin did not find it hydrating enough so I eventually stopped using it after about 2 weeks. On the box, it says “Day” so I only used it in the day (I’m obedient like that ? ) but I’m quite sure you can use it day and night. Still, since my skin did improve with just use of the 2 serums, I am comfortable to say that you probably don’t need it. However, if your skin can handle it then it is also worth noting that if you are serious about wanting to use a whitening skincare regimen, then you should use everything from a similar range of products, simply because they will work together for better results. My skin can’t handle that, so I’m sticking to just the serums. For completeness, here’s the ingredient list for the cream. And here’s how the textures look on my hand. Left-Right: Diorsnow Anti-Spot Serum is a clear, slightly opaque serum texture with a slight yellow tint | Fresh Creme Global Transparency cream has a light gel-cream texture | D-NA Control Day Essence has a lighter texture than the Anti-Spot serum Your Turn Now that I’ve shared my thoughts on the products with you, its now your turn. If you participated in the product sampling exercise we ran about a month ago, you should by now have finished using the 2 skincare products in there – the Anti-Spot Serum and the D-NA Control White Reveal Day Essence.

If you want to share your experience or views on the products with other readers, you may do so in the comment box below ? In a nutshell The Diorsnow skincare range is the whitening/brightening skincare range from Dior Cosmetics. The range contains Icelandic Glacial Water introduced in 2012 for better hydration of skin and better results. Having used almost the whole range for about 2 weeks, I personally found them drying to my already combination-dry skin. It is not unusual however, as most whitening skincare lines do tend to be drying. I suspect its something to do with the composition or ingredients used. On their own, I find that the D-NA Control Day Essence works well, as does the Anti-Spot Serum which is new in the range. I am quite happy with the results of the Anti-Spot Serum and I do have plans to get another bottle once I’ve finished, just to have something in my skincare regimen to help my skin with its pigmentation and uneven skintone problem. However, that is likely the only item I’d repurchase because I prefer using it alongside a hydration regimen in the morning and an anti-aging one at night. It seems to work well enough for me this way. It doesn’t get rid of my dark spots, but it does make my skin look better when paired with a hydrating serum and moisturiser. I’ll live with that. Pros: Foam in the face wash is so velvety and soft like clouds (so fun!), Day Essence and Anti-Spot Serum seem to work to bring my clarity to my skin and brighten it but dark spots and freckles do remain (nothing except laser gets rid of them), I like the Anti-Spot Serum which I think can stand alone and which seems to work better when paired with something hydrating, Packaging is suitably lux Cons: Pricey, I found using the whole range of products too drying on my combination-dry skin Who will like this: Anyone who seeks a clearer skintone but who is realistic that nothing can really ever get rid of dark spots and pigmentation Have you used anything from the Diorsnow line before? Will you share your thoughts on these products with others if you tried the samples? Which was your fave? I’d love if you could share in the comments too, because that’ll be helpful to everyone since so many of you participated in the sampling programme. It’ll give others a better idea of how the products worked for more people instead of just reading what I have to say – come on, help a sister out ? Update: Dior generously picked 3 winners! Liu Wai Mun, Jennifer Goh & Farihah Liyana all won the full size 50ml Diorsnow D-NA Control White Reveal Day Essence. I’ll be in touch via email! Paris B Diorsnow products and prices are as set out above. They are available at all Dior counters and may only be available in Asia but I stand corrected']"

After all, for a brand to succeed, they do need our support, don’t they? ? But I’ll tell you about it another time. I wanted instead to very quickly share about one specific item that had me zeroing in on it as if my gaze was hooked by a tractor beam. It was the Covo nail polish in Maldives and if you have been following the nail colour trends for Summer 2013, you will understand why I singled this one out for special mention ? Covo Cosmetics is the first local brand to have a range of nail polishes that are 3 Free. What this means is that they are free from the 3 ingredients most believed to be toxic – formaldehyde, toluene and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). I was pleased to see this because the other big brand available locally that is well known to be 3 Free is Butter London (available now at Sephora stores) and they cost almost double what Covo nail polishes do! Oh yes, did I mention that Covo offers us luxe for less in that the nail polish is just RM29 (under US$10)? ? I wanted to show you Covo Maldives right off the bat because the summer 2013 trend for nails appear to be this interesting iridescent shade of peacock/aquatic blue-green. You may have seen it in Chanel (Azure) and Dior (one half of the Samba nail duo). Granted, the colours are not all 100% the same (stock photos and actual photos do differ) but they all fall in the same colour family which means you can now get on trend, even on a budget! ? I can update this post to show a comparison between Samba and Maldives in the next day or two, but I don’t have Azure so we’ll just have to imagine it ? I very quickly applied it on nails to let you have an idea what it looks like. A bit messy because I’m a klutz and proceeded to smudge them halfway. But I hope it gives you an idea of how pretty the colour is. In bottle, Covo Maldives is an iridescent green-blue and the finish on nails (no top coat) is very highly shiny and you can get it opaque in 1 coat. The iridescent shimmer finish means that mistakes are a bit more forgiving and the only other brand I have experienced that is similar in terms of ease of application for a colour like this is A-England polishes . The square bottle does look familiar doesn’t it? *coughChanelcough* but the similarity stops there. Where the Chanel cap lifts off to unveil a smaller cap within, the Covo brush is attached straight to the cap. I personally find this a little unwieldy because the cap is rather large to grip. But who am I to judge? I’m no nail polish afficionado ? The brush in mine didn’t splay and was quite well structured, which surprised me because I guess I don’t have a lot of confidence in budget price products like these, so I was very pleasantly surprised. In a nutshell Covo Cosmetics is a new player in the local cosmetics market. The nail polish in Maldives is quite a dead ringer for colours from 2 big luxury brands who launched similar shades for Summer 2013. The colour is a lovely iridescent shimmer peacock/aquatic green-blue and when applied on nails, go on smoothly with a high gloss finish. I am not good with painting nails, but I found this one quite easy to use, even if the cap is a little large and unwieldy and the brush wasn’t streaky. Covo nail polishes are 3-Free and they are the first local brand and one of the few brands available locally that have this formula. What this means is that its not formulated with formaldehyde, toluene and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) which are believed to be toxic. I’m told they last very long but I didn’t test that because I have no patience with nail polish. I just liked how this colour is so in trend right now! ? Pros: Affordable, Pretty in-trend colour, Easy to apply, Formulated to be 3-Free Cons: Limited availability at the moment, Takes a while to dry (but you can use a quick drying top coat to speed it up), Cap is a little large and can be unwieldy for small hands Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for a budget alternative to the aqua/peacock colour that is in-trend for Summer 2013 Pretty colour right?!?! ? Maldives is quite an apt name too. I have never been to the Maldives but I can imagine how this colour reflects the deep turquoise hue of the ocean surrounding the beautiful beaches in the Maldives, with the golden light of the sun reflecting off the surface. I can almost smell the sea breeze already! ? Do you like colours like these? Have you gotten in on the aqua/peacock colour trend for summer? I don’t wear polishes a lot. The longest I can bear having them on is about 2 days before I remove LOL! Impatient is my middle name. Paris ‘Impatient’ B ? Paris B Covo Cosmetics Nail Polishes come in 15 shades Price: RM29 Availability: Sunway Pyramid, One Utama, The Mines, Berjaya Times Square. Hopefully online soon at covocosmetics.com']"

If you didn’t already realize it, blue (and in particular bright blue) eyeliner is all the rage at the moment. Its a fun twist on the traditional black and brown eyeliners and if you are feeling a bit lazy and don’t want to put on too much makeup, slick on a bright eyeliner, put on mascara and you’re good to go! I’ve been very uninspired with my makeup recently and this is all I’ve been wearing. I never used to be very adventurous before. I’m a staid ol’ fuddy duddy ? But when I dabbled with blue eyeliner last , I knew I had to find one that was bright enough for my needs. When the new Laura Mercier Cream Eye Liner in Cobalt landed on my desk, I told myself this had to be it! Just look at that electric blue! ? Like all cream eyeliners, these come in a little pot and the product has a beautiful creamy texture. Very creamy. Oily lidded girls take note. It doesn’t come with a brush but Laura Mercier sells an angled eyeliner brush which they say goes well with it. I don’t have that one so I used one of the eyeliner brushes I had, which is an old one from Becca. Does the job! So, would you wear something like this and how do you think this fares? Size wise, its just a little pot, similar to what you will find from other brands. Its small but then you don’t trowel on things like eyeliner, so this is plenty ? The thing of course, is you have to be sure to close it properly so it doesn’t dry out as I’m sure will be wont to happen. Treat this product will care and it’ll love you back! In terms of pigment, I swear this is wonderful. Just look at this swatch down the back of my hand. All I did was use a brush to pick up product and apply 1 swipe on my skin. Laura Mercier Creme Eyeliner in Cobalt Pretty right? ? It does take a while to set which is something I’m not crazy about. Too often I’ve drawn on a nice line and then blinked and voila! Triple eyelids ? Then I have to rub off and start over. That part, I don’t like. It might be something to do with the creamy texture that makes it do this. So, when I use this one (because I do love the colour a lot!) I have to keep my eyes closed or half closed, until its set. Not for those in a hurry, I can tell you. On the upside, if you wanted to blend this one out, it is quite easy to do since it takes so long to set. Here’s how I usually wear the Cobalt eyeliner. I usually just apply on a thickish blue line, mascara and that’s all I do for the eyes. Due to how my eyes are, the colour isn’t very visible when I have my eyes open. Its only when I blink or when I lower my lids that the colour pops into view and that makes it fun! ? I do encounter another set back though. I do not have oily lids generally speaking but I found that the Laura Mercier Creme Eyeliner wasn’t very long lasting on my lids. It starts out looking great until about halfway through a work day, then when I look into a mirror, I find that it has creased. I don’t experience smudging, which is a consolation, but the creasing bit does upset me because I love this colour so much ? One way to prevent, or at least try to prevent the creasing, would be to layer on some powder shadow over the liner. This helps it set and stay on better. But, it also messes with the vibrancy of the colour. I see so many raves for this cream eyeliner being long lasting and not budging all day that I had to question myself if I was seeing things but I’ve tried this so many times with similar results that I’m convinced its one of those things where its not you, its me. I don’t know if our humid weather has anything to do with it, so if you have tried this and you don’t experience a problem, please please let me know ? In a nutshell The Laura Mercier Creme Eyeliner comes in a little glass pot and has a lovely creamy texture that makes it very easy to draw a nice line. The colour is strong and pigmented with just 1 swipe on the skin and it is very easy to apply. Cobalt is a beautiful electric blue that is just gorgeous worn on its own to frame the eyes. I love the colour and texture but am not crazy about the time it takes to set, and the fact that it creases on my non-oily lids. To avoid having it transfer, it is advisable to keep your eyes closed for a while, to allow it to set properly. To reduce creasing, apply some powder eyeshadow over the liner to hold it in place for longer. Ultimately though, I wish I didn’t have to do all that. I love the colour and the other colours in the range but it is just a wee bit too problematic for me. Pros: Beautifully pigmented and vibrant colour, Easy to use, Lovely creamy texture makes application smooth with no drag Cons: Takes a long time to dry and set so its apt to transfer if you blink too quickly after applying, Had a tendency to crease on my non-oily lids Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for a pigmented bright blue eyeliner I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with the creasing bit, even though it happens something like 5-6 hours after application. Part of the reason I feel this way is because I rarely experience problems with creasing so this was something I had to note. However, when you think about it, 5-6 hours of wear isn’t too bad! ? I’m eyeing the colour Canard which looks like a lovely deep green. Green liners – now that’s another thing to get obsessed about ? Have you tried any Laura Mercier Creme Eye Liner? Do you use blue eyeliner and do you have a favourite one? I haven’t used cream/gel eyeliners in ages. I actually haven’t been lining my eyes a lot daily, except for tightlining which I do all the time and which I feel enhances my eyes enough. Experimenting with blue or coloured liners has been fun though. Its eased up my eye makeup because a bright coloured liner can stand alone and that means you save loads of time and still look eye catching! ?

But I know there are many people out there trying to go organic or natural for a healthier lifestyle. So, when I was given the chance to learn a little more and to try a brand of organic makeup, I took it up. I thought it would be interesting to see how well natural and organic makeup stand up to regular department store or pharmacy/drugstore makeup ? The brand I was introduced to was Nvey Eco an organic makeup brand that hails from Australia. There aren’t many around, in case you are wondering. Nvey Eco aims to provide high quality, high performance makeup that is 100% Certified Organic. I think you’ll agree that this is rather fascinating ? Today I’ll tell you what I think of the Nvey Eco Moisture Rich Fluid Foundation in 514 Cool Natural . There are 4 shades available locally at TNS Skinlab although there are 6 shades available in all. The key ingredients in the foundation are organic chamomile, vitamin E, safflower oil along with being oil free, fragrance free, paraben free… you get the picture. But importantly, how does this measure up to say… my Holy Grail liquid foundation ? Ahh… Well, lets just say the position of my Holy Grail foundation isn’t threatened just yet ? My “problem” with this one isn’t with the texture but with the shade. 514 Cool Natural, despite the name, has significant yellow tones in the base and it is actually rather deep in shade. This belies the colour you see through the transparent plastic packaging. The colour in the bottle is actually very pale. It is quite creamy as you can see. The packaging is simple and straight forward. It reminds me somewhat of the Benefit Hello Flawless liquid foundation. However, when I pumped it out, it was clearly far too yellow and deep for my skintone. Here’s a swatch alongside other foundations I wear regularly for comparison. (1) Kanebo Lunasol Skin Modeling Foundation OC-01 (2) Nvey Eco Moisture Rich Fluid Foundation 514 Cool Natural (3) Shiseido Perfect Refining Liquid Foundation I00 Very Light Ivory (4) Diorsnow Liquid Foundation 010 Ivory (5) Revlon Colorstay Makeup liquid foundation 200 Nude Speaks for itself doesn’t it? ? Even the Revlon Colorstay I told you about last week, that I was moaning at for being a bit too deep looks pale next to the Nvey Eco. So I have to say, the shade disappointed me. I checked the foundation selector on the Nvey Eco website and found that I should be wearing Cool Ivory 510, a shade unavailable locally. Based on the foundation selector, Cool Natural would be suited for someone with light-medium skintone with yellow undertones. I think it does make sense. Still, I found out that if I apply a very thin layer on my skin, and then set it with the Nvey Eco Mattifying Compact Powder (review soon!) the yellow tones are toned down, and I could get away with wearing this one. Without the powder, it does make my skintone look a tad deep and yellow. I also realised that the best way to apply this foundation was with a flat top foundation brush or fingers or maybe a sponge. Regular paddle foundation brushes causes streaking and so does the Real Technique Expert Face brush . Took me far too long to work at it so use your fingers for best results. Texture-wise, it is light but it also took a long time to set properly. It definitely needs setting powder, something I haven’t been using in a while. Coverage is also sheer. Its buildable if the shade suits you, but since I couldn’t build it up further, I rely on concealer. I am a little nonplussed by this because the texture actually feels very creamy and when it pumps out, it does look very creamy. So you would expect something of this texture to have a medium coverage at least. It always surprises me when it doesn’t. Before and after, you may notice the slight yellow tint and light coverage. Evens out skintone but it is sheer, which shouldn’t be knocked. Some people do live for sheer coverage foundations ? However, I find that my skin looks its best wearing this foundation about 2 hours in, when its had time to settle and meld into my skin. Then, I look at myself in the mirror and think “Ok, it looks pretty impressive. Shame about the shade!” 2 hours in, it gives my skin a lovely dewy and even finish. It isn’t very longlasting though. I get about 7-8 hours wear till about 3-4pm when it starts to fade quite significantly. Since I’m not all that into using, eating or wearing organic products, I can and have found liquid foundations that fare much better for me in terms of performance. However, if you are in the market for an organic and natural makeup brand then this will be one to watch. I don’t believe there are many out there so this one does come at a premium price. In a nutshell Nvey Eco Moisture Rich liquid foundation is a liquid foundation that is certified organic and hails from Australia. Despite the creamy texture, the coverage is light-medium and does not dry out your skin. I do find that it does need setting powder and it takes a while to set on skin. Shade-wise I didn’t get one that suited my skintone so it was harder to like it. I find that my skin looks at its best with this on about 2 hours into wearing it and it wears on me (non oily skin) for about 7-8 hours before I notice significant fading. This isn’t a foundation I’d wear to impress. But if you are concerned about what goes into the makeup you wear daily, and don’t mind sheer coverage then this will be one to consider. Pros: Non oily formula, Does not settle into pores, When it has melded with skin it gives a very lovely finish, Lightweight texture on skin Cons: Foundation shade is significantly yellow and deeper in shade when pumped out as opposed to viewing it in the bottle, Fading is noticeable, Pricey Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for organic makeup, Anyone who doesn’t mind light and sheer coverage Here is the ingredient list for those interested. I do have to say that its rather pricey. Locally, it retails at RM168 and on the Nvey Eco website, they retail it at $49.95. I do find that most organic products carry a higher price tag, perhaps due to the ingredients, but it does make it hard for most people to splurge on this when they could get a department store brand foundation that is very good, at a similar or even lower price, and luxuriate in the shopping experience. The only difference would be that most department store brands aren’t organic so that will ultimately be the tipping point. Have you tried any Nvey Eco foundation? Have you used any organic makeup or do you not bother if it is organic? This is my first time trying anything from Nvey Eco. I can’t say I was wowed by the foundation, mostly because I have my faves already firmly in place. However, I do like the blush and I’ll probably tell you about it next ?

How brave are you wearing bright colours for makeup? Just look at that lipstick eh? Kinda scary I’d admit even to myself. It looks neon LOL! If you haven’t noticed, navy blue or blue eyeliner has been touted as a must have for the Spring/Summer 2013 makeup trends. I’m not one to actually pay attention to trends (I don’t have the time nor interest to keep up) but I have been playing around with the new Sleek Makeup Flick It eyeliner pen in Royal Blue and its been interesting. I even paired it with their True Colour Lipstick in Tangerine Scream which you see in the picture. Scream! What an apt name ? Here’s how they look – and you can tell me if you’d ever wear a lipstick that bright out of the house ? I did you know ? I wore Tangerine Scream out and as luck would have it, it was the day when the lift chose to stop at almost every floor to let people on. I started at the top, so there were more than a few double takes as the lift doors opened and people were confronted with a pair of bright orange lips first thing in the morning LOL! ? Here’s how I looked. I have on here, a deep navy blue eyeliner which was my other pop of colour but I am rather disappointed that it didn’t show up as blue as I expected it to. I used the new Sleek Makeup Flick It eyeliner pen in Royal Blue which you will see below. See the blue at the end of the pen? I expected to see that blue on my skin. The lipstick on the right is the True Colour lipstick which comes in a cute little oval case with rubberized grip that remind me a lot of the NARS lipstick packaging. Its got that same tactile feel which actually makes it feel more luxurious than the price indicates. The Flick It Royal Blue looks like a very deep blue and is almost black. The tip is rather like that of a permanent marker with a little bit of give so drawing a line is quite easy, and you can vary the thickness. As a colour that is supposed to make eyes pop, I wasn’t terribly impressed. It looks very promising on the back of my hand. I haven’t really worn a blue eyeliner before this so I was really keen to embrace the trend and for once in my life, be on trend for the season. Left-Right: Sleek Makeup Flick It Eyeliner pen in Royal Blue; Sleek Makeup True Colour Lipstick in Tangerine Scream However, I realised that on my eyes, the colour doesn’t show up a royal blue, or even navy blue. It shows up just as a dark eyeliner, which disappointed me. I’m going to try another one soon in a bright cobalt blue from Laura Mercier so I’ll let you know how well that fares soon ? Do you see what I mean? You can barely tell that its blue unless I go up close like this. From afar, as you can see in picture #2 above, its just dark. Quality wise, its very impressive for the price. It lasts all day long, its a nice deep shade and I think if I had this in black, it would be seriously impressive. The pen nib is a little hard and scratchy against my skin though, but it draws a line very well so I can forgive that a little. Do beware that if you have very sensitive eyes, you may find it a bit too scratchy. The True Colour Lipstick in Tangerine Scream however is totally different matter. Its a bright bright orange in the tube and swatches on skin, a similar bright bright true orange. Its not coral. Its ORANGE ! See? ? I quite like the texture of the True Colour lipsticks to be honest. They are absolutely lovely and creamy and apply opaque in one swipe. So very impressive for the price! It isn’t drying either and the colour is super bright and beautiful. I did however find that it settled a little into my lips after a while but it wasn’t drying at all, and to be honest, its hard to find a lipstick of a quality like this in the budget category. Colourwise though, although I wore this because I have it, its not a colour I’d pick up personally. I think its a bit stark against my skintone although if I were to apply some bronzer and perhaps get a tan, I do think it’d look better. In fact, I think this will look fab on ladies with a deeper skintone ? I would however love to give a colour like Vixen (red!) or Russian Roulette (another red!) a go, because if they are as opaque as this one is, I’d adore it for a glam red lip ? All isn’t lost though. I’m going to try layering on some red or pink lip glosses and see how the colour will adapt and change. So, I’m open to any tips on how I can play around with an orange lip – hit me up! ? In a nutshell The Sleek Makeup Flick It eyeliner pen is a pen style eyeliner with a flexible tip that allows you to draw thick and thin lines very easily. I was hoping to have a nice blue as the name Royal Blue implies but it applies too dark to actually notice the blue. Colour aside, I liked the staying power, the ease of use and the depth of colour. The nib is a little scratchy so those with sensitive eyes may find it a little uncomfortable but I was fine. I’d prefer to just get this in black. The True Colour lipstick lives up to its name, being at once opaque and true to colour on lips as it is in the tube. The colour Tangerine Scream is a straight bright orange which I can imagine will be flattering against deeper skintones but does not quite work against my skintone. It isn’t drying or thick or uncomfortable although I found it settled a little into lip lines. I would love to try a red in this one. I think it would blow my socks off! I like how affordable both these products are. Pros: Flick It Eyeliner – Deep and longlasting colour, Easy to use for thick or thin lines, Nib is not too soft nor too hard; True Colour Lipstick – Bright opaque colour just as it looks in the tube, Not drying, Comfortable on lips, Long lasting, Affordable Cons: Flick It Eyeliner – nib is a bit scratchy, Royal Blue didn’t show up blue enough on my eyes; True Colour Lipstick – Settled a little into lip lines Who will like this: Flick It Eyeliner – anyone who likes using eyeliner pens and who wants something long lasting with deep colour and easy to use; True Colour Lipstick – anyone who wants a true opaque colour in a non drying lipstick formula Would you wear a lip colour as bright as Tangerine Scream out in public? Have you worn blue eyeliner? I’m going to experiment with another blue eyeliner soon that looks more promising in terms of showing colour. I love wearing bright colours but I think that Tangerine Scream might be screaming just a little too loudly ? Ideas on toning it down for better public consumption? ? The previous releases from Sleek Makeup haven’t wowed me much but I’m really impressed with both of these. I just wish they were easier for me to get hold of, because I really want to try one of their red lipsticks and the black eyeliner!

Probably a good time then, for me to let you know what I think about this ? Yes, Clinique too has taken a gander at the CC Cream. Has anyone not done so? ? I have to tell you I was quite interested in it because you see, I can’t use the Clinique BB Cream. The shade is too dark for me and a sample left my skin looking dull. So, when I saw that the Clinique CC Cream comes not only in skintone shades but also in illuminating shades, and furthermore, comes under the Moisture Surge category, my interest was a bit more piqued. What Clinique was keen to impress on me, as I am to impress on you, is that the CC Cream is a Colour Correcting Cream . What this means is that isn’t a foundation, nor does it try to be one. It instead, serves to correct and neutralize your skintone to reduce sallowness and to give you a brighter, more natural glow to your skin. Think of it rather more like a colour correcting makeup base than a foundation or foundation substitute and you will be less disappointed. Because, if you don’t, you might be. Placed under the Moisture Surge category, the Clinique CC Cream serves to not only colour correct your skintone, but also to provide your skin with hydration, and there is also sunscreen protection for those who may be sunscreen averse. The packaging is quite typical of Clinique in that its slim, compact and fuss free. The product is dispensed through a nozzle and I should warn you that you don’t need very much. The first time I used it, I used a little too much over my face and I found it sticky and the shade in Fresh Peach was not very flattering on my skintone. I had a choice between Natural Fair or Fresh Peach and I had to go for Fresh Peach as Natural Fair was too dark for me. This is where I should explain that there are 3 skintone shades, which is basically rather more like a BB Cream style product, offering a bit more coverage while correcting skintone to give skin a glow. These shades are Natural Fair, Natural and Natural Beige . These are also the shades sold in Asia which can be confusing because in the Western world, the shades start from Very Light and run to Deep. So no, we do not get the same shades found in Europe or N. America and our shades are quite different. Important point to bear in mind when you plan to shop online. We also get 2 illuminating shades in Fresh Pink and Fresh Peach . These are the true colour correctors as far as I’m concerned. They are very very sheer with a significant peach or pink tone to it that does illuminate the skintone and correct sallowness, but offers zero coverage. No kidding. Here are the swatches of Fresh Peach and Fresh Pink. I managed to get a little sample tube of Fresh Pink and that’s the one that suits my skin far far better than Fresh Peach. Clinique CC Cream Swatches (1) Fresh Peach (2) Fresh Pink You maybe able to see from the swatches that Fresh Peach is a light peachy toned cream with slight illuminating qualities. This is supposed to neutralize lacklustre and sallow skin and give a brighter appearance. On me, I find that this one can make my skin look a bit off. It appears to enhance the dullness and if you have pigmentation as I do, then I find this makes it look more obvious somehow. I wasn’t too happy with it and it didn’t quite give me a good impression of the product. However, when I managed to try Fresh Pink, I revised my opinion. Fresh Pink squeezes out of the tube a pretty bright pink shade, but it does an excellent job of neutralizing yellow tones and really does make my skin look better and brighter. The problem therefore, is with coverage. As both the illuminating CC Creams do not offer any coverage whatsoever, you have to have pretty excellent skin to wear these alone. I think these work best as a makeup base. So, if I do wear these its only as a base, or if I wear it on a weekend, I apply powder foundation over it, if I want coverage, or use concealer on parts where I want concealed. As a makeup base, I’d say it performs quite admirably too. I don’t know if it hydrates my skin but my skin doesn’t feel parched, and if you are careful and don’t use too much, it doesn’t feel heavy or oily either. I must stress that as I have not used the skintone versions, I do not know how those fare in terms of coverage and performance. The shades available here are too dark for me so the odds that I’d try them is very low. Based on online reviews and swatches, it appears I may be better suited to the Very Light version available overseas, but until I check it out myself, I can’t say for certain. For now, I’m afraid I’m passing on the Clinique CC Cream. My sample of Fresh Pink does the job but I won’t purchase it because I’m just not impressed enough. In a nutshell The Clinique CC Cream is a hydrating colour correcting face base product. In Asia, it comes in 3 skintone shades in Natural Fair, Natural and Natural Beige, which serves to offer some coverage while working to colour correct sallow skintone and give a brighter more glowy visage. There are also 2 illuminating shades of Fresh Peach and Fresh Pink which offer little to no coverage but which does work well in the colour correcting department so skin does look brighter and better, if you use the correct shade. For me, Fresh Pink works best but due to the non existent coverage, I can only really wear this as a makeup base for which it does the job. However, because of the name, I was expecting more in terms of convenience and practicality for which I don’t think this delivered. I can’t wear the skintone shades available here as they are too dark for me so I can’t offer any thoughts on those. Pros: The illuminating shades do work as claimed to counteract sallow or yellow skintone and make skin look better and brighter, Pricey Cons: The Asia based skintone shades are too dark for me and the Illuminating shades offer no coverage Who will like this: Anyone who wants some colour correcting face base options to counteract sallow or yellow toned skin I have to say that if you do a quick search online, the Clinique CC Cream gets a lot of raves so don’t be put off just because I didn’t like it and couldn’t get it to work for me. Like many things, you should try it for yourself and see if it suits you and your lifestyle ? Do you get the CC Cream hype? Have you tried this one from Clinique? I still don’t know what to think of CC Creams, to be perfectly honest. The Chanel one did nothing for me and I can’t get my head around any others I’ve tried so far. I think I understand BB Creams but then I am rather perverse and treat them as tinted moisturiser so it could be why I find them easier to understand. Now CC Creams… maybe I’m just slow or something ?

Its familiar to me, but much to my surprise, I have never in all my years come across a Mary Kay representative. Rather, I’ve never had anyone approach me to sell me the products, have you? ? So its probably not surprising that I have not yet tried anything from the popular direct selling brand. However, I have in recent times had people tell me to give some of their products a go. Mascara is one of them, as is their lipgloss and lipstick. I’m also told their eyeshadows are very impressive at a wallet friendly price tag, so that’s another item I’m quite interested in. Have you tried them? But I digress, because what we’re on about today is the Mary Kay Beauty that Counts limited edition Nourishine Plus lip gloss in “Celebrate” and the Creme Lipstick in “One Woman Can” – although what I really wanted to say is “LOOK AT THE PRETTY SWIRLS!” ? I am put in mind of Raspberry Ripple ice cream. The Nourishine Plus lip gloss in Celebrate is a limited edition shade. What it is is a creamy pale pink gloss swirled through with golden shimmer, as you see in the tube. The tube is small and compact and the applicator is a doe foot sponge applicator. You maybe wondering what the colour is, and it is exactly as I decribed – a creamy pale pink with golden shimmer. Another interesting thing you may be wondering about is whether the swirls will be disturbed once you use the gloss for the first time. Well, the answer is no. I believe its actually a doublewalled construction so the pretty swirls are preserved. I tried using the applicator to stir up the inside, and also to dig against the sides of the tube, but none of the swirls were disturbed. The limited edition “One Woman Can” Creme lipstick looks like raspberry jam to me, for some obscure reason. It is a shimmer pink swirled with a creamy berry that has no shimmer. If you tilt it one way, you can apply just the shimmer pink. If you tilt it another, you can get just the berry. If you blend it, you get a pretty shimmer berry. However, I have to warn you that if you use it directly from the bullet as I did, you may find that it applies on lips in 2 shades. In my case, the outer part of my lips were lighter than the inner part of my lips. If you then press your lips together, it will blend it somewhat. Sort of an interesting ombre lip look with just 1 swipe. Mary Kay Beauty that Counts Left: Creme Lipstick in One Woman Can; Right: Nourishine Lipgloss in Celebrate You can see from the swatches on my arm that the lipstick does apply as a duo tone. The shimmer side is a pink while the non shimmer side is a berry. The lipgloss is a creamy light pink with golden shimmer. Come closer and you should be able to see it in the picture. I must say, I was quite impressed by the quality. The Creme lipstick felt comfortable on my lips and is fairly pigmented and creamy. It wasn’t drying and I liked how lightweight it was. It really belies the small pricetag and with this one, RM3 will be donated from every sale of this lipstick and lipgloss to the Pusat Kebajikan HOPE Worldwide Kuala Lumpur. This is a global initiative, in case you are wondering. In the USA, $1 is donated to a charity there and this will begin on 16 May 2013 and run till 31 December 2013. So this means that if you buy either of these products (or both) you will do a wee bit of good ? As for the Nourishine Lipgloss, I am your world’s pickiest lipgloss user so I really wanted to know if I’d like this gloss. Well, I did, to a degree. Its not too sticky, and it isn’t too goopy either. Perhaps I wasn’t too thrilled about this because I didn’t like how the colour looked on me. Here’s what the lip swatches look like. Left: Nourishine Lipgloss in Celebrate | Right: Creme Lipstick in One Woman Can If you like pale pink lip glosses that give a “nude” finish, then you may like this one. The golden shimmer is not too noticeable and the gloss gives a lovely shine to the lips. The colour however, makes me look too pale so its not something I’d go for. Perhaps, if it was a more vibrant colour, I would like it better. The lipstick is, as you can see, a berry shade on my lips. It is slightly lighter around the edges where the shimmer pink shade is, but I pressed my lips together a few times and got the colour blended. Interestingly, I can imagine that the colour will change slightly as you use up the tube, because the swirls will be different. I layered the lipgloss over the lipstick in this picture to show you how it’ll look. I dotted the Celebrate lipgloss in the middle of the lips after applying One Woman Can lipstick, and then lightly press my lips together to spread and blend the gloss. It adds a shine to the lips and lightens up the lip colour. Other items worn: Maybelline Color Tattoo Bad to the Bronze , Bobbi Brown Apricot blush Personally, I’d say I’m impressed with the lipstick and I would be keen to see how other colours fare. The lipgloss, I’d hold off judgement till I get a colour I like. Texture wise, its not bad, but colourwise, it didn’t suit me. Its not to say it won’t suit you though ? In a nutshell The Mary Kay Celebrate Nourishine Lipgloss and One Woman Can Creme Lipstick are limited edition items for the Mary Kay Beauty that Counts programme. With every purchase of these 2 items, Mary Kay will donate RM3 to raise funds to aid the Pusat Kebajikan HOPE Worldwide Kuala Lumpur to provide underprivileged patients with medical care. This is a global initiative with different charities benefiting from this programme. I like the texture and colour of the Creme Lipstick. It felt comfortable on my lips and did not dry out nor feel sticky. Colour was fairly pigmented and the swirls make for an interesting lip colour combination as you go along. The Nourishine Lipgloss feels a little thick and it is quite nice and glossy without being too sticky. However, the pale pink shade does not suit me and so I was less enamoured with it. Otherwise, I think they’re both light on the wallet, and go towards a good cause, plus you help a Mary Kay representative make a sale ? Pros: Affordable, Creme lipstick was creamy and pigmented and comfortable on lips without being drying, Nourishine Lipgloss was not too sticky or goopy and had a nice shine and gloss Cons: Unless you know a Mary Kay representative, their products aren’t easy to find Who will like this: Anyone who likes a berry-pink lip colour, Anyone who like creamy pale pink lipglosses Have you tried any Mary Kay makeup that you think is worth trying? Would you wear either of these colours? I must say I’m quite pleasantly surprised by this foray into Mary Kay makeup. I am usually quite sceptical about makeup sold through direct sales (I’ve tried a few brands over the years) but this one surprised me and made me interested to try more from the brand. I’d say that’s a good thing! Paris B Mary Kay Beauty that Counts Creme Lipstick in One Woman Can and Nourishine LipGloss in Celebrate Price: RM50 each Availability: Mary Kay Beauty Consultants.

It was supposed to have gone up last week, but what can I say? It didn’t! LOL! Nevermind, because here it is ? You can read an overview of the Estee Lauder Nutritious skincare collection in my previous introductory post so I don’t have to repeat it here. Essentially, this is a range of skincare that uses pomegranate extract which is a known antioxidant, to give your skin a detox and infuse it with radiance and a glow. The Nutritious line isn’t targeted at anti-aging or hydration or whitening. It is a sort of, I’d say, “maintenance line” where if you don’t have a particular “problem” you want taken care of, this helps you stay on the ball and to retain that glow in your skin. I’m just telling you about the Nutritious Essence Oil today because for me, this has been the star of the show. I’ll also share some thoughts from a reader who had the chance to try this a month or so ago so you have not just 1, but 2 reviews! (Talk about value for money hehe…) ? What the Nutritious Essence Oil is, is a sort of “booster oil”. Its not even an oil in a true sense, being a blend of various oils, extracts and other ingredients including fragrance and silicone; the latter 2 of which I can almost see send warning bells to those sensitive to these ingredients. The oil is a clear liquid that doesn’t have a very oily texture. It has been described as “silky”, a description with which I tend to agree. I don’t quite like the texture because it feels a bit “artificial”. Then again, I like my oils to be oils. The packaging is a red translucent plastic bottle (dislike) and a pump with pipette dispenser. What I found is that when I depress the pump while the cap is screwed on and then, I unscrew the cap, I don’t even really have to physically pump out any product. I just remove the cap, hold the pipette over my palm and allow a few drops to fall. No physical pressing necessary. The instructions say to use a few drops on skin and smooth over skin before moisturiser. Here’s how I use it, for best results (for me). I usually drop about 3-4 drops into the palm of my hand, rub my palms together to spread out the product, and then I press and pat my palms all over my face, starting from my cheeks. I find that the light, silky smooth oil absorbs very quickly into my skin this way. If you are concerned, mist on some thermal water or toner and then pat the oil onto your damp skin. It’ll absorb really quickly then. I don’t stop there. In my evening routine, I drop 2-3 more drops into my night moisturiser, to thin out the thick texture and then apply it to my skin. I found that for some reason, although my night moisturiser (the one I’m using is the Dior Capture Totale night cream ) works very well for my skin, it had a tremendous boost after I started using it together with the Nutritious oil. I don’t do this extra step in the day so my skin isn’t too oily so I reserve it only for the evening routine. It must be noted that I have skin that tends to be dry so it might be why this works so well for me. I’ve been using this for over a month now and my skin loves it. In the first 2 weeks, I noticed that my skin seemed to almost visibly look more radiant, clearer and smoothen out with twice daily use. It also feels much softer. I can’t say its helped a glow because I’m going through a stressful period and nothing really, can give a glow to the skin right now, but it isn’t looking as bad as it should be otherwise and perhaps this is helping my skin retain the status quo. Not all bad. Suffice to say therefore that I love this oil not because it really does anything but because it just makes my skin look and feel better, and additionally, gives my already effective face cream that extra boost of efficacy. I’m not sure I understand how it works, but its worked very well for me ? I must mention 2 things I’m not crazy about:- Packaging – The plastic bottle doesn’t grab me at all. For oils, I’m a glass girl. I also felt that the cap didn’t seem to screw on very tight so I didn’t dare travel with it. Wish they’d used glass for the bottle and I’d have been sold, hook line and sinker! Scent – Its not an unpleasant scent, but there is a sweet fruity sort of scent that I’m not crazy about. A bottle isn’t cheap but then you only need a few drops so it’ll last you a long long time. This is definitely one to consider and a serious contender to the popular Kiehl’s MRC ? Reader Cecilia won a bottle during the MWS 6th Anniversary Giveaway and here’s what she had to say:- I’m a strictly-by the-instruction skincare user. I know, no imagination. So when I got the bottle of Estee Lauder Radiant Vitality Essence Oil, I felt lost. Basically, all it said was apply on face after moisturizer. I scooted off to the Estee Lauder SA for more information. I used to be a loyal user until hormonal changes made me allergic to their skincare. Since it wasn’t out in the market yet, she was as lost as me. Because of my past experience, I was hesitant about using it. But I had given you my word to try it, so I had to do it. The first time I used it was before bedtime. The next morning, I woke up with two zits. One on each side of my cheeks. I guess coupled with the richer night cream, it was just too oily for me. I then decided to use it only with my day moisturizer. I stuck to my regular skincare routine, so I could really see the effect on my skin. There were no more zits after that, I’m glad to report. So, did I like it? I liked it. I liked that it barely had any fragrance. I liked that it was quickly absorbed into my skin. It felt comfortable on my skin. There was a nice little glow to my skin after application. But after one month, I don’t see any changes or improvements to my skin. For a 55 year old, I have pretty good skin (thanks to my mom). Maybe there was nothing else it could do for me? I still have 3/4 of the bottle to go, and I intend to finish it before I give my final verdict. So, to your question “Did you like it?” I did. I liked it but I didn’t love it. As you can see, Cecilia had a rather different view from mine so the moral of the story is that the same product will work differently for different people and different skin types and you will have to learn to tailor its use to suit your skin best. In a nutshell The Estee Lauder Nutritious Radiant Vitality Essence Oil is a new product in the Nutritious skincare range. It is tailored to protect the skin with antioxidants, detoxify the skin and boost skin’s radiance. I found that it worked well for me as a radiance and product efficacy booster. It seemed to boost the efficacy of my night cream, and regular use visibly smoothed out my skin texture and also made my skin look better generally that it did before. I don’t personally find it hydrating but it isn’t meant to be so I do use it with a hydrating serum or a whitening serum, depending on what my skin needs at the time. I also don’t think its an oil in a true sense because it is a blend of different oils and other ingredients including fragrance and dimethicone (silicone) which explains the texture. Its not a texture I particularly like, but as a product, I do like it, and I think its a nice product that I’ll be happy to continue using for 1 bottle at least which I estimate will take 6-8 months. I am not crazy about the packaging or the sweet scent so I do think there is still room for improvement. Pros: Seems to boost the efficacy of my night cream to work better, With regular use, my skin visibly improved in texture and feel and just looked better overall, Not oily, Skin feels significantly softer Cons: Plastic bottle packaging makes the product look less attractive, I find the scent a bit too sweet, Texture feels a bit “serum-y” Who will like this: Anyone who may be experiencing a bout of dull skin I know what many of you are thinking – how does this compare with the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate , also a face oil that I particularly like. Well for one, Kiehl’s wins for scent and packaging – glass bottle and lavender wins me over any time. I also find that the Kiehl’s oil feels more “oily” and seems to help my skin feel more hydrated and rested. By contrast, the Estee Lauder Nutritious Essence Oil feels more “silky” and my skin doesn’t get that hydrated feel. In terms of efficacy, they both seem to work well for me. I’ve blended the Kiehl’s MRC with the Dior night cream before but didn’t notice anything different except a thinner consistency. However, blending the Nutritious oil with the cream seemed to make it work better for me. So, from a booster point of view, it seems like this Nutritious Oil works better for my skin. Its a bit of a toss up at this point so I think it will ultimately come down to your personal preference of texture, scent and possibly even efficacy. There isn’t much of a difference in price between the two, so go touch them, smell them and then see which you might like better. They both work for me so its hard for me to pick one. I might lean just a little bit more in favour of Kiehl’s MRC mainly because of the calming scent and I like the oily texture, but then I’d be swayed back to EL because of the “vitamin boost” effect it gives my skin. Gah! Choices! ? Update: Reader Kel sent me this picture from a brochure to show you how to use the Nutritious Essence Oil. I thought it was very helpful!

We’re going to be seeing more of these pop up under the many different brands in the market, so let’s just say that BB Creams are here to stay. I can’t escape them either so I will be telling you about the different ones I come across from time to time. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em you know ? Today is the Kiehl’s Actively Correcting & Beautifying BB Cream which has received pretty good press so I have to confess I was quite interested in this one. The Kiehl’s BB Cream (as I’ll call it) is released as a part of their sunscreen range so if you can imagine, this is like a tinted version of the sunscreen. I believe there was a tinted moisturiser available (which was not available in Malaysia, I believe) but that’s been now discontinued. The only tinted item in the Kiehl’s arsenal will be this BB Cream. I played about with this sometime in December 2012 but have only now had a chance to trial run it properly. I have to say that I liked the Kiehl’s UV Defence sunscreen . It was a little heavy so a common complaint was that it would turn oily on most people. I never quite found it very oily but that could be because I’m quite used to oily sunscreens. I was introduced to the Kiehl’s one after using La Roche Posay Anthelios and that one is much oilier (although I do still like it) so perhaps I’m not your best person to ask. Bearing that in mind, and the fact that most BB Creams do tend to have a slightly oilier texture, I was curious to see if this one would combine to be a disaster. Happily, I’d like to report that it isn’t a disaster at all! In fact, I have to say that I do like the texture a lot. It does not oil up on me, and neither does it feel heavy or slip and slide around on my skin. The Kiehl’s BB Cream comes in 3 shades – Fair, Light and Natural – and this is something I appreciate in a bb cream. It is a fact that we do not all have the same skintone (If we did, cosmetics companies would go out of business!) so I can never understand brands that do not cater for different skintones and steadfastly insist that one tone can work for every skintone. Face it, it doesn’t. That said, from recollection, the 3 shades available under the Kiehl’s BB Cream do tend to be for the light-medium skintoned. If you have very dark skin then you will still be hardpressed to find a BB Cream in your shade. I took a look at the international site and saw that their BB Cream comes in 4 shades. I take the shade in Fair, which is a fair, slightly pink toned shade that blends well into my skintone. Here’s a swatch of the product straight from the tube. On left is the swatch applied more heavily and on right, is the product blended. Fair blends right into my skintone. The other shade up in Light, from memory, has a touch more yellow tone. In tube, it does look quite dark which belies the colour when applied on skin. Packaging wise, it has the same packaging as that of the sunscreen, which is a flat, small, wide tube. This makes it very portable, but it also means that it is quite small. Considering the asking price of RM140/30ml tube I’d say its quite high priced, the same way the sunscreen is a bit too pricey even for me. Kiehl’s says that this BB Cream will conceal imperfections with lightweight buildable coverage and correct skintone irregularities with the vitamin C ingredient in there, that helps clarify the skin. It also comes with a high SPF50 PA+++ rating for sun protection, and is paraben free, fragrance free, silicone free and mineral oil free. I think the latter is good news for those who may find that their skin is sensitive to those ingredients. I however, dispute the claims of coverage. I have used this BB Cream off and on for nearly 2 months and I can tell you that I can never get it to go past being just “sheer coverage”. I would say in fact, that it doesn’t even cover much for me, even if I try to build it up. I’ll show you what I mean. On left, with bare skin, you can see the pigmentation on my cheekbones and some redness around my nose area, and blemish marks around my chin. Blergh! ? On the right, with a layer of the Kiehl’s BB Cream, the pigmentation marks is still there but you may notice that the tone is more even. The pink tones also help make skin look a little brighter. All these aren’t noticeable from a photo I’m afraid. Skin in person reflects better nuances than a photograph can ever approximate. I usually go out with this BB Cream on, a touch of blush on cheeks and a light gloss or tinted lip balm and brows. Looks as “natural” as I get. This is what it does best, for me – even out the tone. So my skin looks even toned and a little radiant, as if I walked out the house without any makeup on, yet my pigmentation is still on show, which gives the same impression. That I didn’t bother to cover up ? So don’t get your hopes up. This Kiehl’s BB Cream isn’t as thick or as opaque as many other BB Creams out there. This is why I prefer it to many Korean brands (which I generally do not go for). I do sometimes question the transparency and the need to even wear anything on skin if it isn’t going to conceal my imperfections but I get why I need it sometimes. For me, it just gives a slightly better appearance to my skin without the obvious “makeup look”. I do however, tend to use this only on weekends or if I’m on holiday. I can dab on some concealer to conceal, and apply some powder foundation over for better coverage. It works. But not if I want proper coverage. In the market now are the CC Creams which aim to correct colour and tone without making too many claims about coverage. In some ways, I feel there is an overlap in this area so perhaps this would have been better marketed as a CC Cream (Colour Correcting Cream) than a BB Cream (Blemish Balm Cream). Monikers aside, I consider this a fairly good tinted sunscreen. The high sun protection can absolve you from wearing a separate sunscreen (although I always do so it doesn’t matter to me) and the tint is sufficient to absolve you from wearing foundation (if you have very good skin, or just want to even out your skintone without having to0 much coverage) For an idea of shade, here are some shade comparisons and a quick comparison with some other BB Creams I have. As this is a Western style BB Cream I have only compared it to other Western brands. I do not use Korean BB Creams. (1) Kiehl’s BB Cream in Fair (2) Bobbi Brown BB Cream Extra Light (3) Revlon Photoready BB Cream in Light (4) Diorsnow BB Creme in 010 Light (5) Garnier BB Cream (Asia version) [all links lead to reviews] I found it interesting how the shades vary quite widely in the different BB creams I do use. They all work interestingly enough! You may notice that the Kiehl’s BB Cream and the Bobbi Brown BB Cream are the most similar in texture and tone although the Kiehl’s one in Fair is a bit pink compared to the Bobbi Brown in Extra Light. So, you may want to consider this when deciding. The Revlon Photoready BB Cream in Light has more ochre tones as does the Diorsnow BB Creme which appears to be the “darkest”. The Dior also has the thickest texture but also the best coverage out of the 5 featured here. One of my faves, the Garnier BB Cream (Asia Version) also has a slightly thicker texture compared to the Kiehl’s, and a more neutral tone. In a nutshell The Kiehl’s BB Cream behaves rather like a tinted sunscreen and comes in 3 shades locally – Fair, Light and Natural. I take the shade Fair, which has slighty pink tones that gives the skin a bit of radiance. The texture is quite nice and it spreads easily. I also find that it does not make my skin oily through the day and the high sun protection factors is very impressive. However, to me, coverage is very very sheer. It will even out skintone, cover up a bit of redness but blemishes and pigmentation will still show on skin. If I want a more flawless look, I go for liquid foundation and a concealer. But for a grab and go weekend look, this works very well for me. The high price however will be a major factor to consider. This isn’t a bad product provided you don’t expect too much out of it, but at the asking price, it will be hard to convince people to buy this when they can buy a high quality liquid foundation for the same price, and get better coverage out of it. Pros: Skintone is evened out well without looking thick and unnatural, Skin looks a touch more radiant, Light texture, Not oily and does not turn oily on skin Cons: Pricey, Sheer coverage does not cover skin blemishes Who will like this: Anyone who has good skin and only needs a little tone correction, Anyone who does not want to layer on too many products as this has high sun protection factor and a decent tint Kiehl’s is usually very good at giving out samples and I believe there was a sampling exercise going on a few weeks ago for this BB Cream. I’d get a sample before buying just to see if you like the texture and the sheerness of the coverage. Although there is a money back guarantee now , a sample will save you the hassle of returns ?

I usually use my BB Creams only on weekends or when I’m on holiday and don’t need or want to put on full base makeup. I do use the ones with better coverage on days when I don’t want to wear liquid foundation. I personally treat BB Creams as foundation so perhaps I’m not making as much use of the multi-tasking qualities touted but I can’t compromise on my sunscreen!

Over the years, I’ve rarely been disappointed. Ok, I have been, but not so much that I’d not go back. I usually look to Revlon for foundation and lip products and they serve me well. The last 2 lip products to grab everyone by the lapels and make them buy up all the colours in store were the Lip Butters and the Just Bitten lip stain. I’m told the latter is selling out like hot cakes – even better than the Lip Butters. I thought that intriguing because I’m not a fan of the latter, but I’m quite comfortable with the former. But before interest can even wane in the Revlon lip products, along comes another in the form of the Revlon Colorstay Ultimate Suede Lipstick . These new suede textured (read: matte) lipsticks were launched locally a couple of months ago but I’ve been a little torn about what I think of them. Have you tried these? I do have a comment about the packaging. I like how the colours outside correspond to the colours in the tube – it makes it easy to identify the colour you want. But, I don’t like the packaging. I feel that the plastic is a little flimsy and when you twist up the lipstick, there’ll be 2 clicks before it twists up smoothly. Ditto when you twist back down. Revlon Colorstay Ultimate Suede lipstick in Finale and Front Row I’m not sure what I was expecting in terms of texture. The Lip Butters have a slightly soft texture which means they break off a little more than I like. I find that to be the case with the Ultimate Suede lipsticks too. I don’t know if its to do with our weather here (Its been abominably baking hot) but I do find that the lipstick breaks off at the edges when I apply it directly to my lips. I have swatches of the rest of the collection below, but the 2 colours I took home from the launch were Finale and Front Row . Front Row is appearing in store sometime in April/May so if this is a colour you’re eyeing, then do watch for it soon. In terms of texture, I find that the Ultimate Suede lipsticks apply very smoothly on lips. They do glide on, which is nice. I also find that they apply quite creamy which again, is nice. It is almost like a pigmented balm on lips. Here are the swatches of Front Row and Finale. Front Row on left is a shimmery very pale pink and Finale on right, is an opaque red. This is just 1 pass of the lipstick on the back of my hand so yes, the pigment is fairly good and you can see they apply quite creamy. The same is true on lips. It is very easy to slick on the lipstick directly from the tube although with the red, you may have to be careful about the edges. Although it says that it has a suede (matte) texture, you can see that it is not a flat colour on lips, but there is a shine to it. Front Row isn’t a colour I’d wear because pale pinks like this one on my lips really washes me out something terrible. No use telling me to play up my eyes or cheeks or whatever. With pale lips, I look sick. But I do know of people who can carry this off very prettily so try it if this is a colour you like. Finale is more like something I’d wear normally. Its a warm red that brightens up my complexion and you can apply it a little sheer, or layer it on to be a bit more opaque. The colour never ever turns a full matte as the name implies, keeping that slight glossy shine on lips, which I think is to do with the formula that contains shea butter and vitamin E. However, I personally am not smitten by the texture. I find that the lipstick applies on my lips and feels a bit sticky, and this sticky feeling stays on. I also find this one drying for my lips. It applies nicely on, but over time, although the staying power is good, my lips start feeling dry. Granted, you could alleviate this feeling by using a layer of lipbalm underneath but I don’t use lipbalm so I like my lipsticks to be moisturizing off the bat. Here are swatches of the rest of the colours available in Malaysia at this time. (1) 025 Socialite (2) 030 High Heels (3) 040 Flashing Lights (4) 060 It Girl (5) 070 Preview (6) 090 Private Viewing (7) 095 Finale (8) 096 All Access I’d personally go for Finale, Socialite or Preview which you will notice, are the stronger, redder shades available. Front Row isn’t included as its new and there may be more shades coming in as we go along. If the colours look a bit sparkly, its partly due to the spotlighting and partly due to the glossy texture of the lipsticks. There is no shimmer or sparkle in them, as you will see in the swatches before this. For the sake of completeness, here’s how Finale looks on me. Just one of my regular lip colours ? I like the colour and the initial texture. Not crazy about it as the hours wear on. In a nutshell The Revlon Colorstay Ultimate Suede lipstick is a range of moisturising suede textured lipsticks which mean they are rather more matte than usual. They aren’t fully matte though, so there is a shine and gloss to the lips which makes it more attractive than if it was just flat matte. It has a balmy-cream texture that makes it apply very easily on lips. However, I find that its a bit sticky and also drying for my lips even if it does last very well through snacking and drinking. So this isn’t a range I’d stock up on. Pros: Affordable, Easy to apply, Easy to wear as sheer or opaque lipstick Cons: Packaging isn’t very attractive, Drying and sticky on my lips Who will like this: Anyone who wants a long lasting lipstick Oh if you have dry lips, be sure to exfoliate before using this one. It does have a tendency to catch and highlight every flaky bit of your lips which isn’t very flattering. A layer of lipbalm before applying the Ultimate Suede lipstick can help if you find a colour you particularly like. Have you tested the Revlon Ultimate Suede lipsticks yet? Find a colour you like? They’ve been out for a couple of months so I’m curious if you did pick up any and if you like the formula. This isn’t one of my favourites from Revlon but then, I’m never partial to matte lipsticks generally ?

So for example, when I saw the beautifully beaded eagle in flight suspended at the base of a plunging back of what is otherwise a very simple, even plain black sheath dress, I could never tell you that it was from the fashion house of Balmain. But it is. I was terribly fascinated by this one because of the interesting back to the dress. From the front, it is a simple high necked deep navy blue sheath. Turn around, and the back pungles down to the small of your back with that interesting beaded eagle. I’d love to shimmy myself into that dress! But we’re not here to talk about dresses and Balmain designs. This is about Balmain Ivoire fragrance – a reworking of a Balmain classic scent from 1979. If you can remember that and are reading this, I would like to a) take my hat off to you and b) meet you! ? The Ivoire by Balmain fragrance comes in a simple square glass flacon, and a clear lucite cap. I know making the cap out of glass would raise the costs even more but I could feel the jarring contrast of plastic against the glass base so that gave me pause. It is otherwise an elegant bottle. The scent is described as having a fresh mandarin opening, mellowing down to a floral rose, jasmine and ylang ylang and rounding off with spicy vetiver, cedar and patchouli. To my untrained nose, from the bottle, it smells rather like a musky floral. The first impression I get is that of a fresh burst of scent, followed by flowers and musk. Sprayed on a blotting paper or even in the air, I rather like it. I am partial to musky scents so the musk in this one sits well with me. Lately, I have discovered that I have a penchant for warm, spicy woody scents so this one is a bit more floral than I’d like but still smelt quite nice as the sample blotter fragranced the inside of my bag . However, everything changed when I sprayed this on my skin. It initially smelled nice. A simple floral sort of nice. However, 1 hour later, I wanted to scrub it off my skin with carbolic soap. As perfumes do, my body chemistry changed the scent of Ivoire into that of a strong, powdery, sourish scent. It was harsh and I actually smelled like I was steeping in sweat and needed a shower. It didn’t make me feel nauseous as some perfumes have done, but it was very hard for me to get through the one day I tried this on my skin. All I wanted to do was go home and have a long hot shower! I’ve since learnt my lesson. These days, when I test perfumes, I test them on a weekend when I’m at home. This way, if the scent does not agree with me, I can immediately hop into the shower and scrub it off. When I wear a new scent to work, it is like playing the lottery. Some make me feel sick, some make me smell like a rafflesia flower (not pleasant despite the floral theme) and if I get lucky, I smell like roses all day long. So no. This scent is not for me. I have not been able to bring myself to even look at it again because I’m reminded of that one day when I so desperately needed to jump into a shower and drown myself in scented shower gel but couldn’t because I was at work. That said, my experience with Ivoire shouldn’t put you off. Perfumes react so differently on different skins that reading about it is quite fruitless. What you should be doing is going out there and testing it, not on a blotter mind, but on your skin. Its the only way you can tell if you want to run screaming for the shower, or walk around smelling like you just stepped through a floral garden. And since this was not a pleasant reminder of the fragrance for me, here is another fascinating Balmain couture design. The whole dress was heavily beaded and I was told that this was all hand-sewn on, every pearl and bead. The tapestry material was heavy and I cannot imagine just how heavy this dress would be to wear. Or how stiff. Have you come across Ivoire by Balmain yet? Have you come across a fragrance that just doesn’t work on your skin? I can’t recall off hand which scent it was that made me nauseous every time I wore it. It would be awkward in the mornings when I’d turn a little green, only to realise that it was the perfume and not that I’d eaten something funny. Naturally, I’ve never worn it again. Funny how smells can make your body react so violently ? Paris B Balmain Ivoire EdP Price: RM260/50ml; RM375/100ml Availability: Major departmental stores']"

This cream is a good example. I can’t tell if it’s called the Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Cream with A.C.E Boosting Capsule or the Hada Labo Gokujyun Hydrating Cream with A.C.E Boosting Capsule or just Hada Labo Gokujyun Cream as it says on the tub. I’m sure the name is far more elegant in Japanese – in English, it’s a mess. Sort it out Hada Labo! Confusing name aside, I’m still going to rave about this cream moisturiser, because I think it’s very nice, very effective and it’s above all, affordable! I think you’ve started to realise by now, what a big fan of Hada Labo I am LOL! ? For me, when it comes to pharmacy or drugstore skincare, I find that Hada Labo ticks most of the boxes, being importantly, effective and affordable. I can’t say the same for many other brands. The Hada Labo Hydrating Cream with A.C.E Boosting Capsule was made available some time last year. I move at the pace of a glacier, so it was only late last year that I realised what a lovely product this cream really is! What this is, is your regular cream moisturiser, but enriched with what they call “A.C.E Boosting Capsule” that are basically these beads containing Vitamin A, C and E suspended in their hydrating cream. If you look in the tub, you’ll see a white cream, with yellow beads in it, that look like beads in a facial scrub. Don’t worry, they are not micro-beads. These beads will break when you apply pressure, and blend their contents with the cream. Let me show you. See the yellow beads on left? That is how they look when I first scoop them out of the tub. On right, I’ve carefully squashed a couple so you can see what they look like. On close observation, its contents are yellow. But when I use this cream, all I do is scoop some into my palm, and then rub my hands together. There is no gritty feeling and the beads almost seem to melt into the cream. It’s all very elegant and seamless. The texture of the cream is rather creamy and thick, so it’s best suited for those with normal to dry skin. In fact, that’s what the brand recommends as well. For those with oily skin, the emulsions might suit you better. The directions recommend you massage and pat into skin. But I like to scoop a dollop out (I’m quite generous with my use), rub my palms together to warm it up and to melt and blend the beads into the cream, then apply onto my skin with a slight massage. I’m not into the whole patting thing ? I find that it keeps my skin hydrated, which is paramount, but it also keeps it feeling comfortable and makes a good final layer for my skincare. I like using it on top of a facial oil or hydration serum, just to keep everything in, and it seems to work better that way. The next morning, I can feel that my skin is softened and hydrated. I tested this while on the road, and it’s particularly welcome in hotel rooms, where the air-conditioning can dry your skin out something awful. I also like that if you’ve been out in the day in the hot sun, this helps to calm my skin down in the evenings, and replenish lost moisture. I personally prefer to use this in the evenings, due to its thicker texture. In the day time, I use a little less. In the evenings, I use a little more and I’m fairly generous. It’s affordable. I can afford to be! I don’t know however, if the Vitamins A, C and E are doing anything. Perhaps they are. It’s hard to say. But I’d treat this as a basic hydrating cream that does everything it’s supposed to do, without irritating my skin and by almost helping my skin feel and look better and more hydrated. I’ll take that! ? IN A NUTSHELL I find the Hada Labo Hydrating Cream with A.C.E Boosting Capsule, an effective and affordable basic moisturiser. Due to its slightly heavier texture, I think this might suit better someone with normal-dry skin. Or you can use it for the evening. The yellow capsules which are supposed to contain the Vitamin A, C and E will melt with a little pressure, and blend with the cream. I can’t say if they work exceptionally well, but this is a very nice basic moisturiser, that is affordable and does what it says – hydrate your skin. I’m actually very happy to use this, and I always make sure I pack it into my travel bag. It keeps my travel-stressed and parched hotel-room skin happy ? PROS: Not scented, Very comfortable without feeling oily or greasy on skin, Keeps skin feeling moisturised and hydrated especially drier skin, Absorbs easily without any residue on skin, Especially comfortable in drier weather or when travelling CONS: Contains silicone which can trouble some people WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who has drier skin, Anyone who wants a basic and affordable moisturiser PRICE: RM69.90 for 50ml (often on sale) WHERE TO BUY: Most major pharmacies, but especially look in Guardian pharmacy If you’re interested in the ingredient list, here it is. Have you tried this Hada Labo Hydrating Cream with A.C.E Boosting Capsule? Do Hada Labo products work for you generally? I have found Hada Labo’s hydrating range very effective for its price. I am however, not as much a fan of the red Hada Labo lifting and firming range of products, which my skin finds too drying, and their cleansers (too stripping) or their whitening range (I don’t use whitening products) Their sunscreens are decent, although I’ve stopped using them since they discontinued my favourite one . But for basic hydrating skincare, Hada Labo has not failed me yet! And here’s another you should be taking a look at ? Paris B']"

This is primarily because I absolutely loved the Hada Labo Premium Hydrating Lotion (which I still use! It’s very good, very hydrating, good value and easily accessible for us, which matters). Naturally therefore, everyone’s wondering if this Hada Labo Premium Hydrating Cream is as wonderful? The Hada Labo Premium Hydrating Cream is the counterpart to my favourite Premium Hydrating Lotion. Like the lotion, this contains 5 types of Hyaluronic Acid – Hyaluronic Acid for a moisture retention barrier, Super Hyaluronic Acid with 2 times the moisture retention capacity, Nano Hyaluronc Acid to penetrate deeply into the skin to provide moisture deep down, Absorbent Hyaluronic Acid that allows it to stay on skin through sweat or washing and 3D Hyaluronic Acid that binds together to form a 3D moisture net wrapping the skin to provide long lasting moisture retention. On top of all that, the Hada Labo Premium Hydrating Cream contains 3 types of ceramides to strengthen the skin moisture barrier, which helps keep skin moist and supple. It all sounds pretty amazing, if you ask me. But the more important question is this – how does it fare? It took me a little while to figure out my thoughts. I loved the lotion so much, that I told everyone I know to go and buy (and they were obedient enough to LOL! Happily, most of my friends and family love it as much as I do) But with this cream, that enthusiasm was curbed somewhat. I do like the texture. It has a very lightweight, velvety texture that feels very comfortable on the skin. There is slip and weight to the cream, which does not confuse you about what it is. This is a face cream. Yet, it applies to my skin like a lotion, gliding over to seal any goodness of serums I’ve applied, and offering a punch of hydration and moisture. The thing is, this Hada Labo Premium Hydrating Cream is supposed to provide skin with intense moisture, and to me, this falls a little bit short on its promises. At the beginning, I was quite happy with this. My skin felt moisturised, and it was comfortable. But as a few months went by, I found that it was falling short. For me personally, I find that while this says it provides skin intense moisture, and appears to be targeted at those with drier skin, I found it was not sufficient for me. I would find myself adding a few drops of facial oil, especially when used at night. In the day time, it fares a lot better, as it keeps my skin moisturised and supple, but without making it greasy. Do bear in mind that I never slap this cream on my skin on its own. There is always a serum and lotions under it, as I never depend on my cream to deliver moisture to my skin. My moisturisers serve to seal in all the goodness. Yet, I found that didn’t help my skin very much. To a large extent, I felt that the other version, the Hada Labo ACE Cream was about as good, or perhaps, just a touch better for me. It isn’t to say of course that this isn’t a good moisturiser. To be honest, you could do worse, for a basic moisturiser that is easily available. In a pinch, if I was caught out without a moisturiser on hand, I’d run out and get myself a tub. But I just feel that it was not as impressive as the lotion in the same range, and for that reason, I am a little less enthusiastic about it. IN A NUTSHELL The Hada Labo Premium Hydrating Cream is a lightweight cream moisturiser that is filled with hyaluronic acid, and includes ceramides, to protect and nourish your skin barrier. This helps your skin retain moisture better and remain supple. I do find that while it serves its job well in the day, I am less enthusiastic about it for night use. A few drops of facial oil does improve it somewhat. It is affordable and effective, just that my normal-dry skin prefers something a little more emollient. PROS: Affordable, Easily accessible, Lightweight texture absorbs well and easily into the skin, Helps skin stay moisturised for longer CONS: Not as emollient as I like but otherwise a good moisturiser WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a light textured moisturiser that makes skin feel moisturised and comfortable, Anyone who wants a good and simple moisturiser on a budget PRICE: RM78.90 for 50ml WHERE TO BUY: Guardian, Watson’s and most leading pharmacies and supermarkets nationwide. Outside of Malaysia, you may be able to find this on Amazon or Ebay or in your local Asian supermarket For those interested, here is the ingredient list for the Hada Labo Premium Hydrating Cream. I’m not that hot at reading ingredient lists, but I do seem to notice that Ceramide is a little low on the list, so I wouldn’t be putting too much emphasis on it bar its existence. What it does have is the Hyaluronic Acid, which really, is what makes this cream comfortable for drier skin. That said, I do confess to not being too hot at reading ingredient lists, so I will present this without too much further comment ? Have you used this Hada Labo Premium Hydrating Cream? I always say that if there’s one brand from the pharmacy I’m happy to run to for a basic skincare range, it’s Hada Labo. This Premium Hydrating range is a welcome addition, especially for those of us more *ahem* mature people. We need all the help with moisture we can get! ? Paris B']"

Ever since I discovered how lovely it was for my skin that’s maturing and turning drier over time, I’ve always made space in my skincare routine for a facial oil. Naturally, when an offer dropped earlier in the year to try a new facial oil, I jumped at the offer. I mean, who wouldn’t really LOL! The brand, Nourish , is one I came across about a year back and then promptly forgot about. You know how it is, don’t you? Sometimes something flits past your consciousness, and if you don’t focus, it disappears, just like a flash of lightning. Nourish is a brand of organic skincare that hails from London, and I think, is fairly new and a little niche. I received the Nourish Radiance Firming Facial Oil , which, if I’m to be honest, is a beautifully formulated facial oil. I guess that kind of sets the tone eh? ? The first time I laid my eyes on it, I admit to being a little surprised at how small the bottle was. The Nourish skincare facial oils come in 15ml bottles, which I initially thought was a little small. That’s about half the size of most facial oils in the market that clock in at about 30ml, for the most part. Yet, I can understand why a 15ml bottle works. When it comes to facial oils, you don’t need very much product, or you may find it uncomfortable. Nourish recommends applying a small drop and then massaging it into your skin. I personally am much more indulgent with my facial oils. The other reason I think this 15ml size works, is because Nourish skincare is organic (the Radiance Firming Facial Oil is labelled at 98% organic) and organic skincare (and oils, for that matter) do go off more quickly. A smaller bottle means there’s a higher chance you’d finish it up before it goes off ? Now I’m going to tell you that if you are leery about using facial oils that feel oily (I know it’s oxymoronic, but I’ve had people tell me this – they prefer the texture of a dry oil that feels less oily) then you may not enjoy this as much as I did. The Nourish Radiance Firming Facial Oil has a distinctly oily texture, with a beautiful feel when I warm it up between my palms. The directions call for one small drop, massaged into your skin. I don’t follow instructions ? So, I usually use about 3-4 drops, warmed up between my palms, and then massaged onto damp skin. I use it pretty much as I would any facial oil (suggested uses and tips for using facial oil here ), and always on damp skin, to help it absorb more easily. There’s one thing I must say I love about this oil, and that’s the scent. Oh man, I live to use it purely for the scent! As you warm up the Radiance Firming Facial Oil between your palms, you will release the most beautiful scent of fresh roses. I’m not the biggest fan of rose scented anything, but I make an exception for this, because it quite literally fills me with joy at using it! ? The thing however, is that I can’t quite measure if it firms up the skin. I think it’s a beautifully formulated oil that isn’t too oily, fairly lightweight and sinks into skin quickly, and smells beautiful. But does it firm up the skin? I don’t know. I don’t know how you can measure it, to be honest. But I like it, because the way I use it, it keeps my skin, well, nourished LOL! ? It keeps my skin moist and comfortable, especially if the air is dry. I do find that it doesn’t work as well as a mask, as some of the other thicker oils I use , but this also means that I’ve tried using one drop, massaged into skin for the day, and it works well, without making my skin oily. I can’t use it on its own as I feel it to be too light for my skin. I have to layer it under a moisturiser for best effect. If your skin isn’t as dry, or perhaps combination, then you may appreciate it a little better. One more thing I noticed, is that after about 2 months of owning this oil, I find the base oil scent getting a bit strong. It doesn’t smell rancid per se. The scent of roses is just as fresh as the day I received it, and I store all my skincare products in the same, cool dark environment. But for some reason, I detect a stronger smell of oil now. Hasn’t spoilt my enjoyment of it yet, but it has encouraged me to be more generous with use, so I finish my bottle, because it would be a waste if I didn’t. IN A NUTSHELL The Nourish Radiance Firming Facial Oil has a medium-weight oil feel – not too oily, not light like a dry oil – and has a beautiful smell of fresh roses infused. If you prefer a lighter feel on skin, use just 1-2 drops, well warmed up between your palms and then applied onto damp skin. I personally prefer using more, at least 3-4 drops. It is also because I like the texture of oil on my skin. I do find that this oil does absorb quite well into my skin, without feeling oily or heavy, and it does not break me out at all. My skin feels lovely the next morning, after a night in an air-conditioned room, which is always a good thing. I do notice a distinct, stronger smell of oil after about 2 months, but it could just be my sense of smell. PROS: Lovely oil texture that is not too heavy, Absorbs easily into skin, Keeps skin feeling moist and comfortable, Possible to use in the day if you use just a drop and massaged into skin, Beautiful scent of fresh roses CONS: Rather pricey, I detected a slightly stronger ‘oil’ scent than I liked after a few months owning this WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who enjoys using a facial oil that feels like an oil, Anyone who enjoys a rose scented oil, Anyone who wants a facial oil from a certified organic brand PRICE: RM149 | £25 for 15ml WHERE TO BUY: V Philosophy website (MY), Nourish skincare website , M+ Pharmacy at Bangsar Village, Ben’s Independent Grocers, Robinson’s The Gardens For those of you interested, here is the ingredient list for the Nourish Radiance Firming Facial Oil. One interesting thing I’ve noted, is that the one I have, and the one you will get if purchased, has the packaging shown here in my photos. On the Nourish website, the packaging looks different, although the ingredients are the same. If you look at the oils used, primarily macadamia, sunflower, jojoba, pumpkin, sesame and borage, these are fairly light oils which balance out the heaviness of rosehip oil. It explains the lighter texture of this oil, while keeping the oil texture I love. Lovely texture – can’t get over it ? Have you used any Nourish skincare before? I have to say that I am quite interested to try something else from this brand. It is an organic brand and I am a little more careful trying natural and organic products, but this one does intrigue me enough to take a look at some of their other products ? Let me know if there’s anything worth trying! Paris B']"

They may not be the most exciting makeup brand, but they make good makeup, sometimes with pretty powders, and that to me, is better than a bunch of mediocre and overhyped products being churned out every 2 weeks. While we have a ways to go yet (I think it’s expected on our shores in July or September – I can’t recall which. But we’ll see it eventually) Clarins has dropped 2 limited edition makeup products that you can check out right now. It’s being released for Mother’s Day that’s coming up very soon so if you’re thinking of getting something for Mom (or for yourself – really, who’s counting?!) you can consider these. They are the Clarins Skin Illusion Blush and the Clarins Daily Energizer Lovely Lip Balm , both of which are limited edition and available while stocks last at counters and on the website, for those of you who prefer shopping online (like me!) ? Their release in line with Mother’s Day is apt, considering the love and kisses design, and it is also quite user-friendly for those who struggle with wearing makeup. Let me run them both down for you and you’d be glad to know that they both slip in comfortably under RM100! ? Clarins Daily Energizer Lovely Lip Balm / Joli Baume Eclat du Jour – RM79 | £16 | US$20 This is a lip balm. Naturally therefore, I was less interested, because I don’t wear lip balm and am not a big advocate of it. But for the sake of experimenting, I tested it, and that’s when I got a nice surprise. While this is a lip balm that goes on clear, it also adjusts to the pH of your lips (apparently) to impart some colour! That was what surprised me. I get quite a lovely tint of natural colour on my lips. It isn’t bright nor bold, and really, it is just a hint on my lips. But it is enough to make you look a little more polished. The balm is also very comfortable, imparting a natural shine to the lips, while moisturising and keeping lips feeling very comfortable without being slick or sticky. But there is something I don’t like about it, rather unfortuntely, and that is the very strong peach scent. If you like sweetly scented or fruit-scented products, then you won’t mind this and might even like it. I however don’t. So, as much as I enjoyed the product, my experience was spoilt by the peachy scent that will not go away ? The lip balm also comes in an adorably packaged cardboard case, in keeping with the fun vibe of the product. As a product, I think it’s not only effective, it’s fun. But only if you like the scent of peaches that close to your nose ? I love eating peaches, but don’t really relish smelling of one. Clarins Skin Illusion Blush – RM85 | £16 | US$21.50 The Clarins Skin Illusion Blush comes in 3 shades – 01 Luminous Pink, 02 Luminous Coral and 03 Golden Havana . The product I have featured here is 01 Luminous Pink, which is a shade I particularly liked using. One of the first things you should pick up when the Clarins makeup line relaunches here, is their blushes. I own quite a few from waaaay back, and they are such underrated beauties. They may not be the most exciting products to look at, but they impart the most beautiful glow on the skin, and don’t demand your arm, leg and kidneys like some brands do (to be fair, I don’t know the new prices so they may now demand one kidney. I’m not sure ? ) The Skin Illusion Blush is cute. The design isn’t new, but it has quite an adorable packaging. Basically, what you get is a sponge puff applicator and the powder blush is embedded into the cover. When you screw the packaging together, the puff picks up the product from the blush, and saturates it for the next time you want to use it. It’s not new, nor unique, but it has proven to be quite handy. The sponge is rather dense, so there is a nice bounce when you pat it on your skin. It is also a good size, not being too big nor too small. What this basically is, is good for women on the go, who may want a little touch up. This is something you’d throw into your daily makeup pouch for quick touch-ups after lunch or before dinner, or perhaps after your session at the gym. The mirror in the top of the cover, although small, is quite useful in this regard. In terms of colour, I found 01 Luminous Pink to be a rather warm pink. For a moment, I thought that it was a coral, because it has a warmth running through it. It isn’t very pigmented when you swatch with your fingers, which I can tell you, is a good thing when you have to deal with packaging like this. In this swatch, I dabbed the sponge on my arm about 2-3 times to get the colour to show up. As you can see, the shade is a rather warm pink with peach undertones. The Daily Energizer Lovely Lip Balm swatches clear, but has adjusted a little to my skin, taking on a slight peach tone as well. To use the Clarins Skin Illusion Blush, you unscrew the sponge, and gently dab it on your cheeks. Because the colour isn’t very strong, it allows you to gently dab to layer and get the intensity you want. However, I will warn you that the colour seems to intensify after a little while on my skin, so don’t be overzealous. You will however, need to soften the edges, or you will get a line as you will see below. So, use a brush to gently blend out the edges of the “stamp” if you have one, or if not, do what I did and use your fingers. Just lightly blend out the edges, and it’ll be perfect. If you see the photo below, the colour looks a little harsh, before blending out, and that is what you risk when you just use the sponge puff stamp directly on your skin. But just blend out the edges and you’ll be good. You may also notice what I mean when I say the colour develops on me – it looks deeper and brighter than it did the first time I applied it. You can also use a brush to pick up colour from the pan in the cover, but really, that defeats the purpose of portability and convenience doesn’t it? Perhaps Clarins could have designed this with a brush, but then I’d probably have complained that it was scratchy LOL! The sponge puff is soft, at least. I found that I did not have to pick up additional colour for both cheeks. The blush is, as I’ve noted, not intensely pigmented, but pigmented enough to show up on my skin, and the puff picks up just the right amount of colour without fall out. If you have deeper skintone than mine, then you may find that you need more product, or perhaps a deeper colour. I did not notice any sparkles in the product which is mostly matte on me, and while I’ve seen references to this Skin Illusion Blush as a highlighter colour, I’d beg to differ, because of how the colour develops on my skin. I like using it on its own, and it is fairly long lasting over a good base. No complaints at all, except that the design and packaging isn’t something I’d normally go for. But for something to carry around with you, and if you’re not as big on cream blushes like I am, then this is pretty much perfect for its purpose. It’ll also be good for busy Moms – Just dab on cheeks, tap a little to blend the edges, and you’re good to go, with a lovely glowing visage ? IN A NUTSHELL The Clarins Skin Illusion Blush and Daily Energizing Lovely Lip Balm are both limited edition items available while stocks last. The lip balm is clear but adjusts to your skin pH to impart a tint of colour. It isn’t exactly a tinted lip balm, but there is a hint of colour. On me, it is a light peach that just keeps from washing me out. There is however, a strong peachy scent that doesn’t sit well with me, so it’ll be best for those who don’t mind fruit scented lip products. I do however, like the Skin Illusion Blush, despite the gimmicky packaging. The sponge stamp is soft with a nice bounce, and picks up colour well from the pan, and transfers it to your skin easily. You do need to blend out the edges, and I found that the colour deepens a little on my skin, so less is more. The colour Luminous Pink is more of a warm pink with slightly peachy undertones, that is flattering, and refreshing. I think it’s cute and portable and something I’d use if I were on the go or travelling, or in a gym bag. It’s perfect that way. PROS: Affordable, Cute packaging, Flattering colours that will suit most skin tones except the very deep skin tones, Lip balm is very moisturising without feeling oily or greasy or sticky, Lip balm imparts a nice shine and a tint of colour, Blush is long lasting CONS: Lip balm has a strong peach scent that I don’t like, Limited Edition products WHO WILL LIKE THESE: Anyone who likes tinted lip balm, Anyone who prefers natural tints of lip colour while needing moisture for lips, Anyone who wants a portable powder blush PRICE: Daily Energizing Lovely Lip Balm – RM79 | £16 | US$20; Skin Illusion Blush – RM85 | £16 | US$21.50 WHERE TO BUY: Clarins counters and website (MY) website (US), Sephora stores, Nordstrom , Saks Fifth Avenue C’est moi with the Clarins Skin Illusion Blush in 01 Luminous Pink on cheeks and the Daily Energizing Lovely Lip Balm on lips. I like the rather natural look (once I toned down the blush somewhat) and it was surprisingly long lasting, except the lip balm of course – it’s not meant to last. If you’re interested in what else I have on, from memory, the base is Bobbi Brown Skin Nourishing Glow foundation (AMAZING STUFF and only available in Asia Pacific, lucky us!) with Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer (onto my 3rd tube!), topped with Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder (hit pan! Ok, I’m done with the superlatives LOL). On brows I’m testing the Bobbi Brown Long Wear Brow Gel, On eyes is Make Up For Ever eyeshadow and lined with Pixi eyeliner in black (my new fave!) but you can’t really see it anyway here so there’s no point my telling you about it LOL! ? Do these Clarins makeup pieces catch your eye? Have you used Clarins makeup before? I like that they’re priced below RM100 each. For the blush, I’d say it’s good value. For the lip balm, it might be considered a little pricey especially if you’re uncertain about scent. So I’d say get the blush. It’s cute, it’s easy to use, the colour is wearable and it’s portable and handy ? Have you used any Clarins makeup? Paris B']"

I don’t actually like blogging about something when the hype is still in the air. You know that moment when everyone’s going on about that latest product/colour/style? Which does make me a bit of a PR nightmare because I don’t play by the rules a lot, unless I’m really excited about something. Maybe pay me and we’ll talk deadlines LOL! But when it comes to skincare, I have a strict rule. Don’t bug me till I’ve had a good go at the product. Just don’t. Which explains why I’ve been sitting on this for about 4 months now. I stumbled on the Melvita Pulpe de Rose Plumping Radiance Duo while browsing online and I was generously sent a bottle to try to see if I’d like it. It became available back in June or July along with a few other products that I haven’t seen but having had about 2 months to incorporate it into my routine, I figured, it’s time to tell you about this product and yes, I like it ? Melvita is, as I’m sure you’re aware, a certified organic brand of skincare from France (and you can read more about it in this intro post ) The Pulpe de Rose is a new range in the Melvita stable, and as the name implies, their key ingredients are harvested from the fruits of the Wild Rose with its rich Vitamin C content, and Wild Rose petals. Its primary function is to fight the early signs of aging and loss of radiance. There are 3 products in this range, which includes this Plumping Radiance Duo, a cream and a serum, the latter two of which I haven’t yet seen. But this one product is one that I think is worth trying, and if you are new to using a facial oil or just don’t like using facial oils but want to derive some of their benefits, then this one will knock your socks off because it’s just SO. EASY! ? What makes this product unique, is that it contains floral water and the regenerative rosehip oil in one handy bottle. When you first get the bottle, you will notice that it has a bi-phase solution. Oil at the top, water at the bottom. Familiar with bi-phase makeup remover? You’ll be familiar with this ? Part of the reason I held off so long before talking about this is because my skin reacts a little to high concentrations of rosehip oil. It seems to clog my pores if I use it neat so I wanted to see if this too, would clog my pores. Happily, it doesn’t. I don’t know if it’s because it isn’t as concentrated, or if its because it’s mixed with the floral water, but it doesn’t break me out or clog my pores and it makes me happy. The Plumping Radiance Duo comes in a glass bottle with a spray pump (I love glass bottles!) and to use it, you have to shake it up so the solution mixes. What you then get is a rather cloudy liquid (and a lot of bubbles) like so. Using the spray pump, pump 1-2 pumps into the palm of your hand where it’ll pump out a slightly milky, cloudy looking runny liquid. You will also get the unmistakeable scent of rosehip oil and a touch of fresh roses. Not unpleasant, but very natural. I actually use just 1 pump each time, spread it between the palms of my hands and press it into my skin instead of just wiping it on. I find that pressing it into skin helps it absorb more easily and if you prefer, spritz on some floral water beforehand. I find when I use 2 pumps, it feels a bit more oily and takes longer to absorb into my skin. With 1 pump, the texture is more liquid and it settles nicely into my skin, leaving it feeling noticeably hydrated, plumped and importantly, not oily. If you hate the feeling of oil on your skin, you might like this. In fact, you could just as easily mist your skin with a floral water, then pat in facial oils. It helps them absorb more quickly into your skin and feels nicer. Or you could get something like this ? I also only use this in the evenings because despite it absorbing well into my skin, I do notice that it does leave a very thin film on my skin, that doesn’t sit well in the day especially when I layer on sunscreen and makeup. So I use all my facial oils in the evening and a lighter range of skincare in the daytime. With regular use, I do notice that my skin feels nicer, plumper and more hydrated especially in the evenings and you will notice these things when you sleep in air-conditioned rooms. I use this after toner/floral water, and I treat it as a serum step, so I always follow up with a moisturiser as well to seal all the goodness in. I didn’t particularly notice any increase in radiance of my skintone, but I did notice that my skin looked more soothed. I’m actually happy keeping this in my routine. I’ve stopped using it regularly for a while (hazards of the ‘job’) but I keep it on my table and every now and again, I reach for it when it feels like I want a plumping treat (or I’m lazy and just want something quick in the evenings). I do think it’s worthwhile trying especially when you may be in the early stages of trying a facial oil ? IN A NUTSHELL The Plumping Radiance Duo is a new item in the Melvita Pulpe de Rose skincare range which is targeted at treating early signs of aging and to add radiance into skin. It has a bi-phase solution of rosehip oil and rose water in a glass bottle with a spray top. Shake up the bottle and spritz it into your palm and then press it into your skin. I find that 1 pump is quite sufficient if you use a moisturiser over. It absorbs fairly quickly into skin without leaving an oily residue and leaves my skin feeling plumped and hydrated and soothed. I think it’s a good introduction to using facial oils and is more comfortable than slathering on oil which is not something many people will enjoy. PROS: Easy to use, Absorbs easily into skin, No greasy or oily residue on skin, Skin feels plumped and hydrated with regular use, A little goes a long way CONS: Nothing in particular unless you find it pricey Who will like this: Anyone who is new to using facial oils, Anyone who wants a quick treat for plumping and hydrating skin Here is the ingredient list for the product for your references. The rose water does temper the distinctive smell of rosehip oil somewhat, so it makes for a more pleasant experience. Have you tried this Plumping Radiance Duo? Do you use facial oils? I can’t say I’ve been regularly impressed by Melvita’s products, but this one does deserve a rave. I’m no stranger to using facial oils so I don’t mind slathering on oil on my skin, but it’s also nice to be able to derive some benefit without working too hard ?

That’s the first thing to come to my mind, at any rate. I think pretty, light scents, wafting through the air. I dare bet that skincare would not cross your mind. It never crossed mine! So about a year ago (goodness, has it been that long?!) when this little jar of Jo Malone Vitamin E Gel landed on my desk, I did a double-take. Oh hello? What is this scorcery? As it turned out, from browsing the Jo Malone store, I found out that they do do a small, select collection of Vitamin E facial skincare products. Not something that really jumps out at the consumer, nor is it something that you’d really be looking at, if I’m to be honest – their strength is in their fragrance range – but it is there. And if I might be so bold as to say so, this Vitamin E Gel is quite something. The Jo Malone Vitamin E Gel comes in a small black glass jar, with the signature ivory and gold label that you associate with all Jo Malone fragrances. It is deceptively small, which made me overlook it for a while. And then, I had to get my head around how to use it, because I knew next to nothing about it! As the name indicates, this is a gel. It is almost like an oil-balm texture in the pot, having a viscosity that makes me think of a clear balm. In many ways, this reminds me a lot of the May Lindstrom Blue Cocoon, with its solid-to-liquid texture. The Jo Malone Vitamin E Gel has a similar sort of texture, where it slowly softens to an almost oil texture on your skin. This is a Vitamin E Gel, that is supposed to have multiple uses. When I started out, it was due to my skin being irritated. I was going through a bout of skin irritation on my skin, where everything I used seemed to make it angry and bumpy and dry. For a spell, I used a little bit of this thick gel, warmed up between my hands and applied on damp skin, as a one-step treatment. Much to my surprise, it went a ways towards calming my skin, taming the flaky bits, and allowing it to heal and return to normal. I usually use the Blue Cocoon for this purpose, but I found that this served a similar (but not same) function, which is good if you can’t get your hands on Blue Cocoon. However, the price point is close so it’s not necessarily a dupe – just an option. If your skin is feeling dry, I find that a dab of this gel on the dry, flaky areas helps to soften the skin and help it heal. The texture is rather thick and sticky (Vitamin E oil is similar) so I will warn you that it can feel uncomfortable, if you aren’t into these sort of textures. However, I find that the benefits outweigh the inconvenience, for it works a treat at keeping chapped lips and flaky skin at bay. You can also mix a dab into your creams or moisturisers for your face and body, just to amp up the moisture element. Vitamin E is well known to help hydrate and heal the skin by encouraging skin to renew itself more quickly, and it is a known antioxidant, which is why it’s used in many products. Here’s how a dab of it looks – a light clear, golden colour and to be honest, this little dab is a wee bit too much for the face, due to its thick, sticky texture. It will sink into skin, especially if you have dry skin, but it will take a while. I like this as an alternative to vitamin E oils, which I used to use a long time ago, but which fell out of favour with me, because of its texture. I find that when I use this overnight, like an oil-mask treatment , I wake up with soft skin the next morning almost without fail. This is something absolutely worth having in dry climates and on planes if you travel often. It reminds me of a more comfortable, less smelly version of the Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour Cream (which I incidentally really like using, mind you) ? In fact, considering that this is by Jo Malone, there is no scent. It is so strange! I opened the tub, fully expecting to be hit in the face by one of their signature scents. However, there was none. There is no scent except for the smell I’ve associated with Vitamin E oil – a slightly musty “oil” smell. While I appreciate its use and how I can use it for various things (including scratches and cuts – Vitamin E is known to help the skin heal faster and reduce scarring), I don’t know who I’d recommend this for. Perhaps, this might be for the person who understands the tacky feeling of Vitamin E oil and wants something more portable and easier to use (you’d actually hate it otherwise) or for the person who needs to calm irritated, dry skin. It is also for the person with deep pockets for this precious jar does not come cheap! But if you think you might fall into this category, then definitely check it out next time you’re at Jo Malone. Walk past the wafting scents and the perfume bar, walk past the helpful SA (politely) and head towards the middle and back of the store, where the little shelf of skincare goodies sit. Then, test this out for yourself. I find it most intriguing! IN A NUTSHELL The Jo Malone Vitamin E Gel is a tub of Vitamin E gel in a thick, balm texture. The product will melt a little on contact with the warmth of your skin, and feel almost oily. When massaged into skin, the oil will eventually absorb but you will always have a sheen of oil on the skin, which makes this best used in the evening. I use it as a one-step routine, and it helps calm my skin, boost its hydration and allows me to wake up with soft skin the next morning. It is also amazing at calming flaky skin or dry, irritated skin and chapped lips. Perfect for travel and dry climates. Less perfect for humid weather and oily skin types. I like it very much because it did a lot to soothe and heal my irritated, dry, flaky skin. I now go back to this as an inconsistent “treatment” simply because my skin loves how it feels the next day. PROS: Not scented, Portable, Nourishes and hydrates dry skin, Calms and reduces flaky skin, Keeps dry skin feeling comfortable, Works very well in dry air to keep skin feeling comfortable, Multi-use and can be used on face and body, Helpful to use on scratches and scars to promote healing (after it’s healed, not while it is still injured) CONS: Expensive, Feels tacky and oily on skin so may not sit well for everyone WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone willing to spend on a jar of Vitamin E gel PRICE: RM500+ | US$95 for 30ml WHERE TO BUY: Jo Malone boutiques, JM Online , Nordstrom Here is the ingredient list for the Jo Malone Vitamin E Gel. I’d not deny that it is actually possible to get very affordable Vitamin E oils from pharmacies. I used to be a big proponent of using it to help reduce scars (works, to a degree) and I’d buy whatever I could get from the pharmacy (some, more affordable than others). So, by all means, work within your budget ? Did you know that Jo Malone made skincare as well? Do you have a favourite Vitamin E oil or gel product? I don’t have any experience with the other Jo Malone Vitamin E skincare products to date, just this. I do however, have a very soft spot for their shower gel and bath and shower oils. I’ll tell you of my faves another day ? Paris B']"

I’m not even sure where or when I got it (because I have a mini-Sephora like that LOL!) but it’s one of those products that are raved all up and down the internet, and you know me. If it’s a highly raved skincare item, I’m all over it! This is the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 10% Toning Complex (I’ll call it the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid Toner) and what it is, is a toner. A clarifying toner, they call it. But it is also what is popularly known as an acid toner. Toners like these contain acids (duh! Usually AHA or BHA) that help to chemically exfoliate skin. Ever since I learnt how good they are for my skin, I’ve used them for a few years now. It really does help, and I don’t even really use a physical exfoliator or scrub anymore. But this. This is very popular, and I can see why. 10% Glycolic Acid baby! ? Did your face scrunch up at that? LOL! ? Well, if it didn’t it should. This is why I say so. 10% Glycolic Acid is high. If you are new to using acids on your skin, you DO NOT want to start with this one or it WILL feel like your face is falling off. If your skin is sensitive to glycolic acid, you too, do not want to use this. The Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid Toner therefore, best suits someone who’s been using acids for a while, and whose skin is used to acids, and can tolerate it. By way of example, if you find Pixi Glow Tonic stings your skin or turns your skin red, you want to stay away from this Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid Toner. Pixi Glow Tonic only contains 5% glycolic acid. But if you’ve used up a bottle or two of Glow Tonic and feel like your skin needs something more, then this would be something you can graduate to. During my initial use, I didn’t like it. I found that it stung my skin and that it was drying. So drying in fact, that my skin felt parched after use. So, I kept it away. It was about then that I got hold of Biologique Recherche Lotion P50 so I promptly forgot about this one. Well, guess who’s just run out of Lotion P50 ? Used up the very last drop last week and when I was looking around for something else to use, I stumbled back onto the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid Toner. This time, although it still does sting my skin a little (I actually don’t mind it, because it means that my skin isn’t too desensitized to acids ? ) it felt fine for the most part. This time, although I experience the stinging, I no longer experience the drying effects. Because of the high glycolic acid content, it is recommended to use this only in the evening, as AHA can cause your skin to be sensitive to the sun and UV rays. But you are also suggested to wear a good sunscreen in the day (but we already do, don’t we? ? ) I sometimes cheat and use it in the morning as well. But not often. I have to find something lighter to use in the morning, or go back to my Lotion P50. I use this very simply, by pouring out some onto a cotton pad (You don’t need very much, just a few drops will do) and then wiping it all over my face, neck and decolletage. Then, I follow up with the rest of my skincare. I do find that it keeps my skin clear and spot free, and when I was clearing up my skin recently, I was using this. It’s chock-full of AHAs – glycolic acid and lactic acid that help to chemically exfoliate the skin to reveal newer, smoother skin. If you use acid toners, then this is something you’d want to keep in mind for the future, but I will warn you that it is strong! UPDATE MAY 2017: I find this a little too harsh to use daily. I’d suggest this for 2-3 times a week use instead, as my skin was starting to feel raw after about a month of constant use. I’m sucking up and going back to Lotion P50! IN A NUTSHELL The Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid Toner is an exfoliating or clarifying toner that contains AHA to chemically exfoliate the skin. The 10% Glycolic Acid content is quite strong, so it is suggested that you only use this in the evening, with a good sunblock in the day time. I also suggest that those who are new to using acid toners stay clear of it as it is not a starter product. This is strong and if your skin is very sensitive or sensitive to glycolic acid, it can react most alarmingly. Think of this as your step up from a basic AHA lotion or toner. But I like how it keeps my skin clear and my pores clog-free and my skin smoother. Well deserving of its raves. PROS: High glycolic acid concentration for those who need it, Large bottle can last a while, Keeps skin clear and smooth, Helps unclog pores, No scent CONS: Very strong so will not work for everyone, Can feel drying if not careful – be sure to follow up with something hydrating, Pricey up front but it comes in a large bottle WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who is used to using an acid toner or AHA on their skin PRICE: RM220 | US$40 for 250ml WHERE TO BUY: Sephora stores and online , Ulta , Cult Beauty Here’s the ingredient list:- WATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCOLIC ACID, METHYL GLUCETH-20, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, ALCOHOL, LACTIC ACID, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) EXTRACT, CHAMOMILE RECUTITA FLOWER (CHAMOMILE) EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS (ALOE VERA), SODIUM BORATE, SODIUM PCA, POLYSORBATE 20, ALLANTOIN, ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, PHOSPHOLIPIDS, CITRIC ACID, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN. I know I’m going to get this question, so I’ll answer it here. How does PTR Glycolic Acid Toner compare to Pixi Glow Tonic and Biologique Recherche Lotion P50? This is much stronger than Pixi Glow Tonic (5% Glycolic acid), so I suggest that you start off with a lower concentration before upping it to this one. If Pixi works for you, there’s no need to change unless you feel that you need something stronger for your skin. I was using Lotion P50W which has about 9% glycolic acid. I felt nothing on my skin. No stinging. That said, this was probably because I was using Pixi Glow Tonic and Alpha H Liquid Gold before. Regular Lotion P50 is said to have about 12% glycolic acid concentration. I do feel a bit of a sting with that one. So, if you’re a Lotion P50 user, then your skin will likely take to the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid Toner. I think that my skin, after its exposure to 1 bottle of Lotion P50W had gotten used to the higher concentration, which is why this one worked for me better the second time around compared to the first. However, I hesitate to name this as a replacement to Lotion P50 because I find the Lotion P50 formula more elegant. Yes, it smells a little (I’m ok with that) but it feels better on my skin. More hydrating, more comfortable. By contrast, the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid Toner feels a little more chemical. There is no scent (which is good if you dislike the Lotion P50 scent) but I feel like it’s a tad more harsh. This is not in the same category as Alpha H Liquid Gold, which is more of an overnight treatment mask, so it doesn’t compare. I wouldn’t use this Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid Toner alone. Dries me up! Have you tried this glycolic acid toner? Anything else from Peter Thomas Roth worth trying? I’ve only tried one other skincare product from this brand I think – the gel mask. Not terribly wow-ed. This one however, is impressive. But strong. So tread carefully! ? Paris B']"

First, to get hold of it – it’s a staggering, jaw-dropping, wallet-emptying £85 a bottle. That’s sh*tload of money in any currency in the world, but much more so with the plummeting RM. Second, to figure out if this £85 was something my skin would take to. This, is the very popular cult product, Good Genes by Sunday Riley . Yes, it costs £85 for 30ml. It’s alright, I’ll wait while you pick your jaw off of the floor ? Back? ? Ok, I’d read a lot of wonderful things about Good Genes Treatment serum before this, but it wasn’t until I was told by my friend Geek, about how good it was for her, and read how well it works for Tine , that I finally capitulated. Nothing better than actually hearing from someone who has actually used it, and has no vested interests, you know. So one day, when I was feeling flush, I decided to bite the bullet and get a bottle. I bought mine from SpaceNK although you can also get it from Cult Beauty . Both are UK based websites that I shop at often, and have had good experiences with. So, what is this serum then? Good Genes is a bit of a multi-tasking product that is aimed at reducing signs of aging, while smoothing, refining, clarifying and brightening the skin while improving on skin thickness and elasticity. Its key ingredient is lactic acid (40%), and contains a load of actives that aren’t quite aimed at anyone with very sensitive skin. In fact, you are warned that you may even experience tingling on your skin when you use it. It is a chemical AHA-based exfoliant so I’m really not surprised. My friends tell me that this serum is one they can’t do without, and despite the prohibitive price tag, they have even bought replacements once they were done. It keeps their skin feeling and looking smooth, clear and good. In fact, I was told that the difference in NOT using it, is visible. I knew then, I HAD TO HAVE THIS! I’d live on bread and water for a few months, but I had to have this serum! First though, let me tell you about the smell. Many people had warned about how badly this serum smells. There is no artificial floral fragrance, nor would I call this a pleasure to the senses when you use this. So, I was braced for something really stinky. The thing is, I didn’t find it super stinky. If you’ve ever used Perricone Cold Plasma, you’d understand what stinky is (it smells of old, rotting fish) but this wasn’t in that league. I found that Good Genes has a strong scent that is metallic and sharp on the nasal senses, with a slightly sourish note, not dissimilar to that of vinegar. Personally, I didn’t find it unpleasant. Unusual yes, but not unpleasant. If you dislike scents like that, then do be warned. It’s strong, but it will dissipate eventually. I’ve not been bugged by it at all. That said, I’d be more prone to complaining about strong floral scents, so it’s just how my nose works. If you prefer your skincare to smell pleasant and comforting, you’ll hate this. But if I were you, I’d suck it up, because this is a pretty good product if you don’t already use a lot of acids and retinols in your routine. Because of how active it is, I only use it at night, and I only use half a pump. The pump locks in place so if you travel with it, you don’t have to fear your precious serum spurting out everywhere in your bag. The pump is also easy to control, so it’s easy to dispense product. I started out using 1 full pump, but I found that it was a bit too much for me. The directions actually specify 2-3 pumps for best results, but it was too much for me (and for my wallet!) Initially, when I first started using Good Genes, I wasn’t too thrilled with it. I suppose, I was expecting quite a lot out of it. I also started experiencing minor breakouts. That bugged me. I’m not allergic nor sensitive to lactic acid, and I don’t generally have very sensitive skin. In fact, I did not experience any tingling in my skin at all when using this serum. However, I eventually worked out that if I use it on alternate days, I’d break out less. After about a month, I reduced the amount used to half a pump each evening, and I realised I could then use it nightly without breaking out. The serum pumps out a white lotion that absorbs easily into the skin and dries quite quickly. I use it after cleansing and toning, applying it to my skin then letting it dry, before following on with facial oils and moisturiser. Personally speaking, I find that when I use it daily, I notice that my skin does feel smoother, and it looks clearer. When I stop it for a while, and then come back to it, I do notice overnight results, in that tired skin looks a little less tired, and lines are noticeably softened. This is so if I’ve had a late night. This boosts my complexion the next day. Being a chemical exfoliant, this isn’t really surprising. However, while the serum also claims to even out hyperpigmentation, I personally did not experience any improvements in that area. If anyone should notice an improvement, that would be me, but my pigmentation is still there and not shifted one bit. If I spread out its use to alternate days or 3 times a week, as I was doing when I noticed I was getting spot, I noticed that the results were less significant, and you will take much longer to notice results. In that sense, and because I do experience minor spots when I use this too often, I’d personally say that it’s hard for me to tell you to run out and buy it on the strength of testimony alone. You’d have to be fairly patient and in tune with your skin, I feel, to best appreciate this product. Not just buy into the hype because oh yes! There is a huge huge hype surrounding this and most Sunday Riley products. So, is it worth £85 (RM553 at today’s exchange rate)? Yes and No. Yes, if you have the cash and are willing to splurge on skincare. You must also be someone who is in tune with your skin and realise that you may not notice as glowing a result as the next person. I like how it gives my skin a bit of a boost the next day, especially when I’ve not used it for a few days. Then, I notice the results. Sometimes, if I haven’t used it for a few days and my skin looks exceptionally tired or stressed, I give myself a full pump, massaged in all over and topped up with just a night moisturiser. A little like a “mask”. I always look better the next morning. I’m also someone who’s quite willing to splurge on skincare so I may be the exception. No, if you have very sensitive skin that doesn’t take well to lactic acid, and if the price is too prohibitive. I realise that there’s a lot that one can do with £85/RM553 so this isn’t something you MUST buy or use. If you already take care of your skin with other products (this isn’t one you can use on its own, but is an additional product in your skincare regimen) then you can and possibly will get by without this. You won’t miss what you’ve never had. But you might, if your skin takes well to it and you find it too prohibitive a habit to keep up. Will I repurchase? Again, yes and no. I will, if I feel like I have the funds and can justify a purchase. But because I don’t notice as significant result and improvement to my skin as many others do (For the uninitiated, I already do take pretty good care of my skin generally speaking) I might divert my funds to try something else unless there’s an offer on Good Genes that I can’t resist because I like using it as a “treatment”. In that sense, you could say that I’m not as sold on this as many people are, although I do like it as a product. Confused? ? IN A NUTSHELL Sunday Riley Good Genes treatment is a serum with high content of lactic acid, that helps plump up and smoothen fine lines, boost skin elasticity, and also brighten, refine and clarify. It isn’t recommended for those who have very sensitive skin, and you are warned about a tingling feeling on your skin, although I did not experience it. I found that using a full pump daily (in the evening) can cause me to break out in the odd spot or two. So I use it on alternate days or about 3 times a week, or half a pump if used daily. That seems to work for me. While I found that it does boost skin radiance (especially overnight, if your skin is very tired) and makes my skin feel and look smoother and clearer, it does nothing for my pigmentation. I like it for the boost it gives my skin, and how my skin takes to it, but I don’t personally think this a must have, simply because of the high pricetag. Because of the price, I’d say that it’s a good product to own and use, if you don’t feel the pinch; but otherwise, you probably won’t miss it. You don’t miss what you don’t have! PROS: High content of lactic acid works well to soften lines and skin, Skin looks and feels smoother, Skin looks clearer and more radiant, Noticeably boosts a tired complexion almost overnight, Lightweight texture, Absorbs quickly with no greasy feeling, Not drying CONS: The strong, sharp, metallic, vinegary smell may not sit well with many people though I’m alright with it, Very pricey, May cause minor breakouts, Not available in Malaysia WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who can afford the high price tag, Anyone who wants a product that can produce visible results to soften fine lines and improve skin texture, Anyone who is in tune with their skin and doesn’t mind a strong smelling serum This is the ingredient list for Good Genes for anyone interested. If you look at the directions, it says you can leave it on as a mask and then rinsed off. I’ve toyed with the idea of trying that, but every time, I balk. I just can’t justify washing this off! So, I use it only as a leave on serum – half or 1 pump will do the trick for most of us I feel. 2-3 pumps is A LOT (I tried it the 1st time, following instructions, and was so horrified at how much that was and how quickly that would mean I run through a bottle, that I hastily cut back the next day) and will just be too much for most of our wallets ? Have you tried the cult Good Genes serum? Are you in love with it? I’ve been asked quite a lot about this so I figured I’d better get my thoughts out there, jumbled as they appear to be. Like a lot of skincare, it works differently for everyone. I’d love to know if you love it, and whether the scent bugs you, or better yet, tell me if there are other Sunday Riley products I should try! ?

Guerlain truly outdid themselves this year, with one of the prettiest powders I ever did see. But despite the anticipation and social media-driven hype, I stayed away. For some reason, despite my Meteorites collecting habits, I couldn’t bring myself to drop almost RM300 on a tub. Prices sure have gone up since I started my collection. Instead, I picked up the Rouge G lipstick , which I happen to love. But as providence will have it, I was gifted with a tub of what is confusingly known as the Meteorites Flocons Enchantes or Enchanted Snowflake Meteorites or by some people, called the Perles des Neiges Meteorites. The former is what’s printed on the box. I’m not sure where some sources got the latter name from. Call it what you want, isn’t this a thing of beauty? ? I do have a bit of an axe to grind with Guerlain though. They call this the Enchanted Snowflake Meteorites, and in the press release, it says that it has snowflakes amidst the regular pearls. Yet, what they put in there were…. stars. Come on guys, aren’t those stars in there? No one in their right mind would say “Ooh, snowflakes!” Instead, everyone and their aunty are going “Ooh, such pretty stars!” Note to Guerlain – work on your presentation LOL! Since this has been done to death, let me just show you some photos and some quick thoughts I have about this. As to whether you should buy it, I think you can answer that for yourself… though I’ll offer some pointers ? First off, the US$80 and RM269 pricetag is a high one. If you managed to get this in Sephora during their 20% members sale, good on ya! It’s still pretty pricey though, so it’s not for everyone. I know we’re all feeling the pinch with the economic slowdown and rising prices, so this is 100% luxury, not a need. Balance your budgets accordingly ? It does however, come in a nice 30g tub, which is what Meteorites used to be before they were reduced to the 25g versions that you get in the permanent range . It shows, in that the tub looks fuller, instead of just a few balls rattling around the tub. Unlike previous years and in view of the limited edition packaging, Guerlain has made this a sturdy plastic tub, with a nice heft. The plastic isn’t a cheap plastic, but it is plastic. It also comes with a puff to hold the pearls in place so you don’t end up with a tub of powder, and the whole tub is fashioned after a snowglobe. The screw-off cover has a gradational translucency, to allow you to view an intricate golden design embedded into the cover, if you view it from the top. Let me show you. See how it looks like you’re viewing it through a snowglobe? I actually really liked it, and I appreciated the thought and design that went into it. Viewed from the side, you don’t really see the design. It’s only visible when viewed from the top. I loved that! But you all know I’m a Meteorites collector right? I’ve championed Guerlain’s Meteorites for so many years, they really should be paying me a commission LOL! But the long and short of it, is that I love the Meteorites, and I think it does wonders for the complexion. It’s a finishing powder, not a setting powder, so I can’t really say just how it’s supposed to look on you. All I can say is that Meteorites are the one product that pulls my makeup together, giving my skin an imperceptible glow that is unmatched by any other powder I’ve ever used. I’m a huge huge fan and can talk all day about it ? But today, it’s about the Enchanted Snowflake Meteorites, and I must say that these are a wee bit more shimmery than the regular permanent ones. The powders are a mix of champagne, white and gold pearls and stars, that is a little shimmery to the touch. In fact, I was a little put off initially. However, when I apply it to the skin, it isn’t shimmery at all. The combination of powders and pearly shimmer gives skin a bit of a boost and a glow that isn’t bang in your face. If you use a dense brush, and layer it on, you might actually be able to use it as a highlighter. But I just swirled it all over my face with a fluffy brush (you can use the Real Techniques Blush Brush , as I sometimes do) and what it does is make my makeup look just that touch more ethereal. I actually really like this! Being a true blue fan of Meteorites, I must say that I enjoyed this. They are up there with my other favourite, the Meteorites Perles de Nuit which gives skin the most AMAZING glow like nothing I’ve ever used. I find that this is a touch brighter while Perles de Nuit has a more champagne tint but they’re both impressive in quality. To buy or not to buy? It’s a question only you can answer. Get it, if the price doesn’t make you blanch, and you are a fan of the Meteorites, or want a more champagne toned Meteorites (the permanent range doesn’t have a champagne toned powder). Don’t, if you won’t use it. Makeup is best appreciated when it’s used ? IN A NUTSHELL The Guerlain Meteorites Flocons Enchantes or Enchanted Snowflake Meteorites are limited edition Meteorites powders from Guerlain that come in a limited edition packaging like that of a snow globe. The pearls are a mix of regular round pearls and stars (which are supposed to be snowflakes, but who are they kidding?) The powder swatches a little shimmery, but isn’t so when you brush it on the skin. It gives a bit of a bright, champagne glow to your skin that makes it look that much more impressive. Beautiful in the evenings under candlelight or evening lighting, but use a lighter hand for the day to avoid looking too shiny. There is the signature Guerlain scent but isn’t overpowering. One for the Meteorites collectors! PROS: Prettily designed packaging, Unique design of the powders, Lovely glowy effect of powder on skin CONS: Pricey, Limited Edition WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who missed out on Perles de Nuit, Anyone who wants a more champagne toned Meteorites powder for evening use in particular, Makeup collectors I thought you might like to see this alongside some of the Meteorites from previous years. Clockwise from Top Left: Meteorites Flocons Enchantes (2015), Meteorites Perles d’Etoiles (2014), Perles de Nuit (2011), Perles du Dragon (2012) I skipped the Crazy Paris Meteorites Perles (2013) although I picked up the rest of the collection , because I hated the packaging. And yes, I use them all ? I’m not much of a makeup collector, but Meteorites are my weakness. It’s getting hard to continue though, because the prices are going up and up, and I’m starting to balk. So hopefully Guerlain slows down on the new releases of the “bebolas” or I’d just have to call a halt! ? Did you get the Enchanted Snowflake Meteorites? Do you get what the hype of Meteorites is all about? I’ve been preaching about these balls since I started blogging, so that’s a long time LOL! I never quite understood them until I picked up my first tub (in the lurid, gaudy colourful cardboard tub of the days of yore) and then, I was drawn in, hook line and sinker! These days, these balls are my precioussssss….. ?

Yes, my friends, the A’kin Revitalising Cellular Radiance Serum is in fact, a facial oil. Threw me for a loop at first! The box is super colourful, but the bottle itself is fairly plain in its packaging. I had been sent this a long time ago, but never got round to using it for a good reason. A’kin is a natural brand of skincare by Purist, and hails from Australia. I had tried one of their shampoos quite a few years ago which did not wow me. I actually hated it, which might explain my reluctance to try anything else from them, especially skincare. Also, I used to be quite against natural/organic skincare, due to some bad experiences. Recently however, I discovered this serum in my stash while doing a spot of decluttering, and decided to use it as my day serum, after I ran out of my HG Worship serum . That was when I realised that this Cellular Radiance Serum was in fact, a facial oil, and I was a little hesitant about using it on my skin in the day. I’m a keen user of facial oils, but I’ve thus far, kept it for use in the evening routine, because of the texture. Somehow, the idea of using oils in the day frightened me a little. I wasn’t sure if it would leave my skin looking and feeling too greasy. But you know, I’ve come to really enjoy using this, and I seriously think that it’s done good things for my skin! Oh and no, it’s not oily at all ? When you come across a product purporting to be a serum, what do you think the texture will be like? I usually think of something lightweight, that absorbs fairly quickly into the skin, while giving skin a potent boost of whatever it is that it is supposed to do. In this case, the A’kin Revitalising Cellular Radiance Serum is a combination of oils and ingredients that are supposed to fight the signs of aging and leave skin looking more radiant. It has even been compared to a retinol product, albeit a natural one. But you see, I didn’t know all this when I started using it. The product comes in a lightweight oil texture and is dispensed by way of a pipette. I find that 3 drops usually does it for me. I then warm it up in the palms of my hands, and apply it to my skin. For some reason, I don’t find this product oily the way most facial oils are. It absorbs fairly quickly into my skin and I usually layer my day moisturiser over. It doesn’t feel heavy nor oily nor greasy. In fact, it pretty much feels like I’m just using regular skincare, not a facial oil! The texture is fairly runny, as you can see, but it will absorb quite quickly into the skin. There is a bit of a scent that I feel may either be something you’d be comfortable with or you won’t. To me, it smells like the slightly nutty, sourish scent associated with rosehip oil. Lighter, but unmistakably there. It’s not surprising therefore that this does contain rosehip oil as one of its key ingredients. I put this to the test without really anticipating anything, if I’m to be honest. I’d finished my HG serum so my skin was feeling good. But after about a month or so, I actually started noticing that my skin looked a little better. When I experienced the breakouts associated with my skincare experiment recently, I think this was one of those things that helped rebalance my skin. I felt that my skin felt finer, and redness was less pronounced, so my skintone looked more even. I actually wear a lot less base makeup these days than I used to do before. It’s hard for me to tell you that I’ve noticed any significant improvements, because most of you will be aware that I take fairly good care of my skin and for my age, I don’t have significant lines and wrinkles (for which I am extremely thankful!). But because I pay close attention to my skin, I notice these small improvements, and knowing that I’ve only made a little change in the products I use, I know that this particular product is a good one. I do feel however, that due to the nature of what this serum is supposed to address, it is more suitable for someone who is exploring or using or feels the need to use anti-aging skincare. If your skin feels and looks dull, or perhaps a little lacklustre, this might be one to explore. Being a natural product, don’t expect immediate results. I’d suggest that you give it a month at least, before you draw your conclusions. The instructions actually call for use in the evening (I didn’t read the instructions, as usual ? ) I think it’s because it contains Vitamin A and does have some natural effects of retinol that can make skin more sensitive to the sun. However, I have been using mine only in the day, but I am sure to wear a good sunscreen over it, and thus far, I think it’s been alright. If you want to be brave like me, be sure you wear a good sunscreen! ? I found myself liking this, and because you don’t use very much, it can stretch quite a long way. The only thing is that I don’t find it to be as hydrating, so I also use a hydrating serum. I don’t know if this is for everyone, to be honest. You have to be comfortable with the concept of using facial oils and be patient, to see any results. IN A NUTSHELL The A’kin Revitalising Cellular Radiance Serum comes in an oil texture and contains various natural based products for boosting skin radiance and improving on skin texture over time. The oil is very lightweight and absorbs quite readily and easily into the skin which makes it comfortable and easy to use. I find that 3-4 drops is quite sufficient. Regular use of this oil left my skin feeling and looking finer with less redness, and more even toned skin. I however, don’t find it hydrating enough so I use a hydrating serum and a moisturiser over it. But to address skin texture, I think it does a good job. PROS: Lightweight texture absorbs easily and quickly into the skin, Does not feel oily or greasy on skin, With regular use skin feels smoother and finer and looks more even toned CONS: Scent may not appeal to everyone, Oil texture may not appeal to everyone, Not sufficiently hydrating WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who is used to using facial oils, Anyone who wants an anti-aging product that is natural/organic based For those interested, here is the ingredient list for the A’kin Revitalising Cellular Radiance Serum:- I like applying this on slightly damp skin, which helps it sink into skin more quickly. I have been asked how similar/different this is, compared to my HG Antipodes Worship serum , which seems to perform a similar antioxidant function. Well, if I have to pick between the two, I’d pick the Worship serum because it is much easier to get your head around (it has a nice serum texture), it smells better, it’s hydrating and it really does wonders for my skin. This A’kin one may throw some people for a loop because of the oil texture, and the scent isn’t as pleasant. I also don’t find it as hydrating, although I feel that this seems to do a better job at keeping my skin looking more even toned. You will find that this one stretches further because you use a lot less (3 drops vs 1 pump of product) but it will come down to personal preference. If I had to choose, I’d pick the Antipodes Worship. But by way of a back up, this is pretty decent. In fact, I wouldn’t put it past me to actually use both of them together, because I think they’re different enough! ? Have you tried this particular serum from A’kin or any other A’kin skincare products that are worth mentioning? Have you come across other serums that are in fact oils? Now that I’ve braved myself to use this product from A’kin, I’m more open to trying something else. If you have tried anything else from A’kin that you think I should try, holler! I’m up to it, this time! ?

If ye be part of me crew for long enough, ye’ll know that I’m no fan of lip glosses. Nasty, sticky, goopy things! But bless yer landlubber hearts, I’ve found one that I am happy to brandish around like my cutlass right here. Careful, don’t want to poke your eye out! The gloss in question is one that has been around a while, but one which I’ve only now grown to enjoy tremendously. So much, it’s found permanent residence in my daily bag! It’s the Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss and the shade I have is Pirate , which explains the slight descent into insanity up there! LOL! ? Now I might be late to the party, but I’m sure there are those among you who already use this and love or hate it so it’ll be interesting to hear your thoughts! The Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss is a pigmented lip gloss that wears like a lipstick because the coverage is stunning. To me, it feels pretty much just like a liquid lipstick, except that it’s got lovely lacquered gloss and shine to it. Not flat or matte. Those are the Allure Inks that I’ll tell you about another day. This is the lovely, more vibrant counterpoint that I prefer. I must say that part of my enchantment with the product lies with the packaging. The Chanel Rouge Allure Extrait de Gloss comes in a sleek long tube, as you see in the picture above. There is no discernible way to get the product out of the tube is there? At least, no conventional way! But if you’re familiar with the Rouge Allure line of lipsticks, you’d know what to expect. Depress the gold bit at the top, and the wand pops up! You then pull the wand out of the tube. Naturally, this can have its pitfalls. If you aren’t careful, you could risk popping it open while it’s inside your bag. However, the formula is fairly thick, and thus far, I haven’t experienced any mishaps *touchwood*! The shade I have is 19 Pirate , which as you guessed it, is a red. But this is a beautiful red that isn’t too bright and is one that I am quite convinced that most people of any skin tone will be able to pull off. You get a sponge-tipped applicator, which picks up quite a good amount of product, and which applies it evenly to your lips. The tip is a little tapered, so you can even out the edge of your lips. Always a bit of a tricky thing with bright lipsticks! But what I really like about this lipgloss, is really the texture. It is thick and very pigmented, yet it does not feel heavy when you wear it on lips. Although it’s a lip gloss, it wears more like a lipstick, that has a lovely shine and yet isn’t goopy. The best part is that, unlike many lipglosses that have the lifespan of a mayfly on lips, the colour just sticks and stays on and on and on! I often wear this one as my lipstick for the simple reason because it performs like one. I don’t have to worry about eating or drinking, because even if I do (and it will smear your coffee cup) the colour remains on my lips, so I don’t actually need to touch up until I wipe everything off and start again. I’m not sure if it’s to do with the shade Pirate, which is a beautiful, rich shade of red. This is just one swipe of the Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss in Pirate straight from the tube. I think you can appreciate how pigmented the colour is, and how the texture looks a little thick. Rest assured, it isn’t goopy. Goop is the reason I don’t wear many lipglosses. And here’s how it looks when I wear it. It’s an easy colour that I can wear for any occasion. The shade of red isn’t so bright to contrast too much against my skintone, as there is some depth to the colour that grounds it. This is a shade that I’m quite convinced will look as amazing on light skintones as it will on deeper skintones. The texture too isn’t so glossy that will make it look frivolous in a formal setting. It just imparts the right amount of shine to give lips dimension and attention. I feel it’s important as the texture is so pigmented as to be full coverage on your lips. Here’s the other thing I like – it’s not drying. While I wouldn’t call these Chanel Rouge Allure Glosses moisturising, they do not dry out my lips at all while I’m wearing it, and if anything, it keeps them plumped up. My only real grouse would be with the price (But it’s Chanel – it’s to be expected) but everything else gets the thumbs up for me! IN A NUTSHELL The Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss is an intense coloured, full coverage, pigmented lip gloss that applies like a lipstick. The texture is a little thick, but it spreads easily on lips and does not dry out the lips at all. The intensity of colour is stunning, as is the shine which imparts a gloss to the lips without making it look goopy or garish. This wears like a lipstick and feels very comfortable on. Oh, and the packaging can’t be beat! I love them! PROS: Sleek packaging, Very pigmented lip colour, Not goopy nor sticky for a lip gloss, Easy to apply, Gives a nice shine to lips without making it look too glossy, Long lasting, Not drying CONS: Nothing other than it being a little pricey WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes pigmented lip colours, Anyone who does not like goopy lipglosses PRICE: RM115 | US$37 WHERE TO BUY: Chanel counters and beauty boutiques, Chanel website , Bergdorf Goodman , Neiman Marcus Have you tried the Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss? Do you still wear gloss? I haven’t worn lip gloss in a while, until I came across this one I found in my drawer. I think I bought it quite a while ago. Oops! LOL! Do I want more? Hell yeah! Should I? Well, if I’m to be logical no LOL! ? But tell me what colour you have anyway ? Paris B']"

Pierre Hermé, famous for his macarons, was an unlikely collaboration, I thought. Then again, Laduree has a makeup range that has nothing to do with pastries or macarons, so who am I to judge right? LOL As it turned out, I thought the combination of scents quite fascinating. Must be to do with that chef’s palate. I mean, who’d have thought to marry the bitter-citrus note of Pamplemousse (grapefruit) with the sour note of rhubarb?! Incidentally, I LOVE rhubarb, and don’t tell anyone, but after the press event, a few sticks of rhubarb went home with me in my bag and into a delicious crumble ? shhhh….. Ahem! Now, let me quickly tell you about my thoughts on the scents. It’s just a quick overview, nothing too detailed because scents are very personal things. I was gifted with the Jasmin-Immortelle-Neroli fragrance, so I will be able to tell you about that one after some wear ? There are 3 scents in the L’Occitane x Pierre Hermé range, which are then infused into the various bath and body products. Pamplemousse-Rhubarb : From memory (because I don’t have it) it has a nice burst of citrus and sourness, with a slight bitter note to keep it from smelling too fruity. I liked the idea of the scent and the combination, but on my skin, the scent dried down to something that smelled like… sweat. It wasn’t pleasant. The hand cream was much better for me because the scent was a little smoother. There is a full range of shower gel, body lotion, fragrance, and hand cream. Fragrance: RM275/75ml, Body Lotion: RM127/250ml, Body Wash: RM88/250ml Hand Cream: RM41/30ml Jasmin-Immortelle-Neroli : This one has a slightly sweet orange citrus note provided by the Neroli, that dries down to a warmer base scent of Jasmine. While I usually shy away from jasmine scents, this one sat well with me, primarily because of the Neroli and Immortelle that lifted it and prevented it from being too sweetly floral. I found it has a fizzy zing to it, that makes it a nice scent for the day. Similarly, this has a full range of shower gel, body lotion, fragrance and hand cream. Hand Cream: RM41/30ml Miel Mandarin : This range is only represented by the hand cream, which has a significant scent of mandarin oranges. It is a smooth scent without being too strongly citrus or too orangey, so it was quite pleasant to use. Like the regular L’Occitane hand creams, this was moisturising, not sticky or greasy and comfortable. I found that the scent was not too strong, which is how I like it. Fragrance: RM275/75ml As I have noted, I found the Jasmin-Immortelle-Neroli fragrance surprisingly pleasant on my skin. This, coming from someone who run as far away from Jasmine scents as possible, and isn’t a fan of sweet, floral scents. On paper, the Pamplemousse-Rhubarb would have been my choice. But in person, it was otherwise. I find that the fragrance spritzes out a little fizzy to my nose, like that of champagne, with a noticeable orange note contributed by Neroli. However, this fizzles out quite quickly and dries down to a more mellow floral note, that is lightened by the citrus scent of Neroli, so it isn’t cloying the way I find jasmine to be. For an EdT, it was fairly longlasting although I only prefer to use this in the day. Quite interestingly, I was told that the short, squat bottle of fragrance brings to mind a macaron, as does the packaging of the fragrances, as you can see above. The boxes bring to mind a macaron, with the band of colour in the middle. I thought it quite clever and keeping to theme, without being kitchsy and cute. L’Occitane x Pierre Hermé Hand Cream: RM41/30ml Personally, while I thought this an unlikely pairing, the collection turned out more palatable than I expected. If you are already a fan of L’Occitane products, then you will be familiar with their quality. As far as scents go, I’m personally for smelling it for yourself to decide which will suit you best. I never thought I’d own a perfume with jasmine in it, but for some reason, this pairing works on my skin. It’s a nice fresh scent that isn’t cloying or heavy, which is nice for our weather. Light, when it’s hot out, but slightly warmed when it’s cold and rainy. I’m a wee bit biased against the Grapefruit-Rhubarb one because it made me smell sweaty, but it smelled good on my friend. It had a nice bitter citrus top note, like that of grapefruit peel, but tempered with the tartness of rhubarb. It actually smelled a little musky once it dries down. Personally I’d pick one of the body washes or lotion or maybe hand cream in that scent ? Have you sniffed at the L’Occitane x Pierre Hermé collection? Does the food-fragrance pairing throw you off? It threw me for a loop initially, but I can see how it works. I suppose pastry chefs need a good nose as well as tastebuds! Special shoutout to @puiyeekong on Instagram who has been instrumental in making sure I got this post out when I said I would LOL! ? I hope this helps you decide ? Paris B The L’Occitane x Pierre Hermé collection is limited edition and available at all L’Occitane stores and are sold individually or in gift sets. If you don’t have a store in your city/town, you can pick them up online as well.']"

It is now eye-wateringly expensive, and it receives mixed reviews, but I am one who is still loyal to it after all this years. Naturally therefore, when I came across rumblings of a possible more affordable Estee Lauder ANR “dupe”, I was interested. Rather unsettling for me was the fact that it was by Korean brand Missha. It is the Missha Time Revolution Night Repair Science Activator Borabit Ampoule – that is a freaking mouthful, so I’ll just call it the Missha Time Revolution Night Repair. Why unsettling? It’s because, unlike many, I’m not your biggest fan of Korean brand skincare. And especially not of Missha, which I’d sampled many years ago, and found them too basic, too harsh, and wanting. But still, I told myself, let’s have a go. What did I have to lose? First, some grouse about local availability. In Malaysia, we have an official Missha store at Sunway Pyramid. For me, that could be situated in the badlands of Mordor for all I care, as I rarely if ever, venture down there. So I looked online to see where I could buy it. Interestingly, there is a local Missha website, with a Facebook page that claims to be official, but really isn’t! The official distributor does not have a web presence. All this was so mind boggling, I refused to entertain either portal. I did see that in Malaysia, you can get it from online store Hermo, a portal I’ve shopped at before. I’d steer clear from other portals like Lazada and its ilk, as there is always a risk of authenticity. For me personally, I feel this to be a problem with Korean brands in Malaysia – there are so many portals selling the same product, whether based locally or purportedly sent directly from Korea, and individual resellers, that it is hard to know which are legitimate and which aren’t, and at crazy prices to boot. Worse yet, when the official distributors don’t have a local web presence. It’s dumb. I however, bought my Missha Time Revolution Night Repair from iHerb , thereby circumventing all doubts about authenticity from local distributors ? Missha calls this product an Ampoule, which I’ve learned is K-speak for serum, but one on steroids ? Ampoules are supposed to be supercharged serums, packing more punch than your regular run-of-the-mill serum. What the Missha Time Revolution Night Repair is therefore, is an anti-aging serum. The product comes in a pearlized purple glass bottle, with a dropper dispenser. What piqued the interest of many, was what this serum contains – antiaging ingredients (niacinamide, retinol, vitamin c extracts) and ferments (bifida ferment lysate, ophioglossum vulgatum extract ferment filtrate, leuconostoc ferment filtrate, lactobacillus/rice ferment filtrate, lactococcus ferment lysate, yeast ferment extract, lactobacillus/soybean ferment extract, saccharomyces/viscum album (mistletoe) ferment extract, lactobacillus ferment, pseudoaltermonas ferment extract, saccharomyces ferment filtrate). It apparently shares some similarities in ingredients with the famed Estee Lauder ANR serum. The colour of the serum is a pale amber and the name “night repair”, naturally causes many minds to turn to the famed Estee Lauder ANR serum. But is it a dupe? Let me tackle that further down ? I’d been using this Missha Time Revolution Night Repair for a while. At a stretch at first, and then intermittently. For me, I find that it’s… well, OK. I find it hydrating, and it absorbs quickly and easily into my skin without leaving a residue. I use half a pump in the day, and a full pump at night. It’s quite a lot of product, but it all absorbs nicely before I apply my moisturiser. What it does for me, is make my skin feel hydrated, plumped…. and not much else. It must be said that I do not have very visible lines (for which, at my age, I’m very thankful), and I do live where it is humid, which I feel helps my skin age more slowly, rather than dry it out and accentuate lines. So, I cannot attest to any line reduction or firming or lifting. All it does is make my skin feel nice. Unlike the Estee Lauder ANR, I do not notice any perking up of tired skin. I made sure to test this serum at a time when I was having trouble with sleep, and therefore waking up looking and feeling more tired than when I went to bed. With the ANR serum I can fake 8 hours of sleep. With this, I can’t. I think this is a decent, basic serum for someone younger, who maybe starting to use an anti-aging product. If you have very dry skin, or live where it is very dry, you will notice that it’ll help with hydration. If you’ve never used an anti-aging product before, then this is a fairly affordable option to try. But if you already use actives in your skincare, or have been caring for your skin over time, you may not notice much, if any results. IN A NUTSHELL The Missha Time Revolution Night Repair Science Activator Borabit Ampoule is your anti-aging serum that goes on after your toner and before your moisturiser. The ingredient list does boast some active ingredients for anti-aging and some ferments. The lightweight texture is lovely, and absorbs quickly and there is not a strong scent. It does add a boost of hydration but for me, little else. I do however, think this a decent initiation into anti-aging serums.

To be honest, no it is not. What it is, is an affordable anti-aging serum that does seriously boost skin hydration and keep your skin feeling smooth and plump. For me however, I notice when I use the ANR, that my skin will look rested and calmed. I don’t get the same sort of effect with this one. So my advice is to not treat this as a dupe, but to view it as an affordable introductory anti-aging product. That’s what it really is. Have you tried this Missha Time Revolution Night Repair serum? Do let me know what you think if you’ve tried it! There are many raves online for this one, but I do think too many people are hung up on it being a dupe, and not really appreciating it for what it truly is ? Paris B']"

In fact, their ads had me taking a second look. I even pit them in a head-to-head battle to see which was better. My loyalties and conclusion then, was that the Dior Addict lipstick reigned supreme. Truly, the formula of the Dior Addict is what had me falling in love with Dior lipsticks and makeup in general. Here’s what they used to look like , when I first started buying them. It had a translucent dark blue cover and a gold tube, a moisturising formula and a nice wash of colour – not too sheer, not too intense. Since I am such a huge fan of the Dior Addict lipsticks, and since every version they’ve come up with so far have wowed me, I wasn’t planning to be too critical about this new 2015 version fronted by Jennifer Lawrence. I mean, they’re essentially preaching to the converted, yes? However, when I started playing with these, I confess to a slight sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. My HG lipsticks seem to have taken a hit in terms of formula, and what this tells you, as far as I’m concerned, is that I feel that the quality of the new Dior Addict lipsticks are not up to par with what they used to be. There, I’ve said it. I’ve read more than a few reviews that have said that these new Dior lipsticks are as good as the previous formula. I’d humbly disagree. I feel that the new version is now far too sheer, far too sparkly and not moisturising enough. I’d like to call this the Peter Phillips disease. He helmed Chanel and released the new Chanel Rouge Coco back then. I didn’t like it – it was too drying even if I seemed to be the only one saying so. When he left, Chanel reformulated their Rouge Coco lipsticks and it’s now SO. MUCH. BETTER! When I heard he’d switched sides to join Dior, my heart sank. And now that he’s had a hand in the Dior Addict lipstick reformulation, my biggest fears are realised. Unlike many who may love the product, or the man behind it, I’m not one of them. Let’s just say Peter and I don’t see eye to eye in terms of lipstick texture ? And with this preface in mind, let me walk you quickly through the new Dior Addict lipsticks and show you some swatches of the 4 principal colours in the core collection. I have to say however, that the new packaging for the Dior Addict lipsticks are lovely. The pearly finish of the case is retained, and given a shinier appearance. The packaging is slimmed down and simplified, and the lipstick now slips into the cover and stays put with a magnet. The upgraded packaging is most certainly noteworthy. However, the name of the lipstick is only found on a little sticker at the base of the cover. So, if you have a couple of these, and you don’t take care which cover you use, you will in all possibility mis-name them if anyone asks what you’re using. As for the lipstick bullet itself, it retains the flat, round surface that makes it easy to apply. Due to the formula and the more casual vibe of the the colours and textures, this isn’t a lipstick that requires precision in application. As part of the reformulation, the centre, or core, of the lipstick sports the CD logo in a slightly contrasting colour. We had seen this in Dior’s Summer 2015 collection (that I opted out of since tie-dye isn’t my thing) and if I’m to be honest, I don’t like it. Happily, once you start using the lipstick, the surface flattens out and the CD logo is less noticeable. What this “core” is, according to Dior, is an ultra-moisturising core that gives lips a shine, rather like that of a top coat. It runs all the way through so it’s always there. The lipstick is infused with oils that help moisturise the lips. I don’t know how it is then, that I feel this new formula to be more drying than before. It didn’t make sense to me. For some reason, I felt that this new Dior Addict lipsticks don’t apply as smoothly on the lips, nor do they aid in moisturization, the way the previous formula did. It used to be that when my lips felt dry, a slick of the Dior Addict lipstick was what kept the flakies at bay, while adding colour and some shine. However, when I was using these recently, with slightly dry lips, it only accentuated the dryness and lines. I also realised that they didn’t slick on very smoothly. Dior Addict Lipstick – Tribale, Be Dior, Smile, Wonderful swatched 2 times down my arm In terms of colour, I found these quite lacking. In tube, they look fairly pigmented. On skin, they are very very sheer. Even Be Dior, which is the deepest shade here, is a mere wash of transparent colour. I felt a little cheated. Tribale 451 – This is a lovely coral in tube, with noticeable shimmer/glitter particles in the tube, but none when swatched. The colour is a very transparent, light coral. Be Dior 976 – A lovely berry red in the tube with little to no noticeable shimmer or glitter, it swatches on skin a transparent berry red. Good if you want to ease into wearing red lipstick but not so good if you were expecting a deeper tone. Smile 553 – A pale nude pink with no noticeable shimmer, that applies a light sheer pink Wonderful 561 – A pink with noticeable shimmer that swatches a pale, transparent pink with noticeable glitter On lips, as you will see below, the texture and colours weren’t as flattering as I was hoping they’d be. For the record, for Smile, Wonderful and Tribale, I applied at least 3 layers to get the colour to show up. Be Dior was applied 2 layers. A shade like Tribale would have previously gone on a slightly deeper coral. Now, it’s a bare wash of colour. My least favourite is Wonderful, which gives a frosty appearance to my lips that I absolutely dislike. It made the lipstick look cheap and this isn’t cheap, folks. It’s DIOR for goodness sake! I expect more from Dior than frosty pinkness. So it appears to me that Dior has now gone and infused glitter into their lipstick, which bugs me. Glitter has a bad way of making lipstick look frosty, and honestly, it isn’t flattering. I’d personally pick the ones that are glitter-free. For some reason, the texture of those are better as well. If you’re wondering, yes, if I mash my lips together, I feel the fine glitter particles in Wonderful, and that bugs me more than you’ll realise. Here’s how it looks in a full face shot, just for you to have an idea on the shades. Between Smile and Wonderful, I’d pick Smile because it is more flattering without that awkward frosty shine. Tribale is a colour I’d have preferred if it was deeper, a little more like how it looks in the tube. Be Dior is alright, as sheer red lipstick goes, but there’s something about the texture that doesn’t sit well with me. As I’ve noted, I feel it to be more drying than before, which is unusual. Dior says that the “ultra moisturising core” will give your lips a shine akin to that of a top coat (like that of nails) but if I’m to be honest, I don’t find these to be any more shiny or glossy than the previous version. I suspect a lot of the shine comes not from this “core” but from the glitter/shimmer and that to me isn’t true to what Dior Addict lipsticks are or were like. Dior Addict lipsticks used to be the most moisturising lipsticks I’d ever worn, which allows me to use them even like, or in place of a lip balm. But with this new formula, I’m not enamoured with it. I feel that what was a winning formula has been messed with, and I’m not happy about that ? It is also noteworthy that with this new Dior Addict range of lipstick, the old Addict and Addict Extreme have been discontinued. Some colours have been carried over to the new formula, but a friend has told me that she found the colour and texture to be dissimilar even though the product has the same name. I’m sad. I was a huge huge fan of the Dior Addict and Addict Extreme lipsticks and I sang their praises from the time I started blogging till… well, now. I’m afraid I’m not in love with this new Addict formula, nor do I think it to be similar, or even better than the previous formula. Perhaps it’s because I have been using them a while, or perhaps I have a basis for comparison. Perhaps, if I wasn’t so hung up on how wonderful they were, I’d be more forgiving. But the fact is I am. Sorry folks, gotta live with my whinging ? IN A NUTSHELL Dior reformulated and relaunched the Addict Lipstick collection with a new formula and packaging. The new packaging is sleek and attractive and modern. I like it, and it no longer clicks in place, it’s held in place by a magnet. The formula is supposed to be more moisturising, with a core that coats lips with a shiny top coat, and moisture. The CD logo goes all the way through and in some shades, come in a contrasting colour. Personally, I’m not a fan of the new version. I feel the texture to be a little dry and drying, the colours to be too sheer compared to what they were before, and they are too glittery. While the sheerness of texture means most colours are wearable, it also means that you should just forsake the light shades because they’ll all look more or less the same. I’m not a fan, sorry Dior. PROS: Sleek packaging is attractive, Sheer texture makes it easy to wear bold or deeper shades CONS: Too sheer and too glittery, Not moisturising, Dry texture tugs at my lips WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who hasn’t used the old Dior Addict ranges, Anyone who wants a sheer wash of colour and shine in a lipstick, Anyone who wants to try wearing bold shades but don’t want colours that are too intense Am I too hard on these? Yes, I think I am. But can you blame me, a long time user and fan of the Addict lipsticks? ? I think if you’re new to the Addict line, then you may not be as critical and may even like this new formula and texture. It’s just that I have a basis for comparison, and I’m going to stop apologising right here. I didn’t like these. Period ? Have you tried these new Dior Addict lipsticks? Do you like them? If you did, by all means say so. I realise that I’m probably the only person so far who isn’t truly enamoured ? So what I’ll be doing is going and buying up some of the colours I missed in the older formula. I’m sure they’ll be still available online and at least I’ll be able to get some good use out of what used to be my holy grail lipstick. Boo hoo ?

I measure every lipstick I wear against the yardstick of a Japanese brand lipstick because their textures embody everything I ever want in a lipstick – lightweight, creamy, moisturising, glowy and flattering. This was before the Western brands started coming out with the Dior Addicts and Rouge Cocos we are familiar with now. Trust me, the Japanese brands got there first, and every now and again, I feel the need to revisit my first loves. While it may seem like I have a strong focus on Western brands, the only reason I’m even wearing makeup today is because of Japanese makeup. I’m a huge fan, but it’s hard to keep up when information is very low-key and hard to come by, and quite often new releases look the same as old releases. But if there’s one thing I have to say about Japanese brands as well, is that they are given to the dramatic when naming products. The newest Japanese brand lipstick I had the pleasure of trying recently has the rather fanciful name of Dramatic Melting Rouge and is by Shiseido Maquillage . Ok, I confess to not being a big fan of Maquillage. I played about with a few products when the brand first came about, but I was never very impressed, preferring to stick to the Shiseido mother-brand; so I’ve pretty much forgotten about it over the years. These new lipsticks however, do have me wanting to take a second look at them because yes, they are pretty amazing products. To match the fancy name, these lipsticks come in a rather pretty golden cap that is eye catching. Personally, I’m not a fan of the packaging because I find it too gaudy. But Maquillage is targeted at a slightly younger makeup-wearing crowd, who I know, will be drawn to this packaging. As they say however, it’s what inside that counts. Inside, we are told that this lipstick is infused with a beauty oil that protects lips, cares for dry lips and infuses your lips with beautiful colour, shine and brilliance. I can safely tell you that the Dramatic Melting Rouge ticks the boxes on all counts. The lipstick slides on your lips like melted butter and makes your lips look almost instantly smooth. I don’t need all that crap about layering lip balm and using a lip primer under lipstick. If a lipstick doesn’t look impressive on its own, I scrap it. I don’t believe in using another product to make a product work (which is why you don’t hear me talk about using primers and lip balms under lipstick. It doesn’t work as it should? It’s tossed). But with this one, I just slick this one and bam! Smooth, tinted lips with a glossy shine. The proof as they say, are in the swatches and here they are. I swatched these on my lips just once. I don’t have very lined lips, but if you take a look at some other lipstick reviews, where I show close up of my lips, you can sometimes see how the lines may be visible. Here, they just look beautifully smooth. Man, I’d forgotten that a lipstick can make my lips look this good! ? I was sent 2 shades for consideration: RS329 Rose Rendezvous – This is a lovely everyday rose shade that naturally flatters most complexions. It isn’t as strong in colour in person as you see in the picture, but it completes your makeup without ever once looking garish and in your face. I wear rose coloured lipstick on a day to day basis because of this. RS526 Melty Red – If you love red lipstick then Japanese lipstick won’t be the one to turn to. Their reds are never the beautiful creamy reds that I get from Chanel or Dior or Guerlain. They tend to be a more sheer version of a red, often with brown tones, so they are always wearable on a daily basis without ever making you look like you’re trying too hard. If you want to ease into wearing red lipstick, start here. For completeness, this is how I’d look when I wear these shades. They are flattering shades aren’t they? With a lovely shine and gloss that isn’t in your face, while making you look alive and young and glowy. For interest, I wore all Japanese brand makeup in the FOTD too but everything from the base, eye and cheek makeup were from Lunasol . I don’t own anything else from Maquillage LOL! ? I’d peg these at a light-medium opacity. If you like strong, creamy colours you may not like these because you will find them too transparent. But if you don’t usually like wearing lipstick, I’d invite you to take a look because you might just change your mind after these ? IN A NUTSHELL The Shiseido Maquillage Dramatic Melting Rouge lipsticks are a new range of lipsticks under the Maquillage label, a Shiseido sub-brand. The texture of these lipsticks are lovely, being at once smooth, glowy, transparent and flattering. I find them sheer-medium in opacity although you can easily layer them to full opacity without it ever once feeling or looking heavy on your lips. The product too leaves your lips looking smooth and unlined and quite perfectly kissable. I have an insane desire to pick up more and I haven’t felt this desire in a long time! PROS: No scent, Smooth texture, Lightweight, Easy to build up colour without it looking heavy, Flattering shades on everyone, Glossy shine that doesn’t look overdone, Not one bit drying! CONS: I find the packaging a little gaudy but I’m in the minority, Product is a little soft so be careful about leaving it in the hot sun or it might melt WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes lightweight, glossy lipstick, Anyone who is familiar with the style and texture of Japanese brand lipstick, Anyone who likes a lip colour that isn’t too in your face Oh and if you wonder why I have a low tolerance to scent in lipstick, the primary reason is because the Japanese lipsticks I cut my teeth on (not literally) had no or very little scent. Even these days, I find that most pure Japanese brands do not infuse scent into their lip products, which makes me very happy. I will warn you that it’s a wee bit soft so don’t leave this lying around in the hot sun. I haven’t tried it, but you might just return to find a puddle of oil where your lipstick should be ? Have you tried this range of Maquillage lipstick? Do you like anything else from Maquillage you think I should try? I’ve been thinking about the new cheek colour or blush that they call Dramatic Mood Veil. It looks really pretty in pictures but I haven’t gone to play around with them. Reckon that’s worth a go? ?

I was quick to jump on the wagon and picked up Paris and Camelia . I wore them often and I enjoyed using them, maybe because they were Chanel and the only Chanel I could afford LOL! Don’t we all feel that way eh? While there were some reports that the Rouge Coco lipsticks were a little drying, I did not personally feel it to be so. They weren’t hydrating though (Chanel released Rouge Coco Shine to deal with that and I prefer Dior Addict in a straight fight comparison ), and Paris did leave my lips feeling a little dry sometimes, but nothing I would really complain about. I’ve used worse. But, over time, I felt that they weren’t as comfortable on my lips as I’d like them to be. It just struck me that my Paris and Camelia lipsticks are now over 5 years old and I still haven’t used them up! Oh boy! Fast forward to 2015, and Chanel has addressed this problem by overhauling the whole Rouge Coco line and introducing the newly reformulated Rouge Coco lipstick range , which promises better hydration. I can get on that! ? In revamping the Rouge Coco range, Chanel has also revamped the names so the new Rouge Coco lipsticks are now named after friends, relations and lovers of Mademoiselle Coco Chanel. What this means for you and I is that, you might just be able to pick up a lipstick with your name on it! ? I was generously gifted with 16 shades with a selection from each of the 5 colour groups available, from the very nude to the very flamboyant, so here’s what I think of the new formula and here’s how some of the more interesting shades look when I wear them – 16 FOTDs. You don’t get this every day! ? But first, a word about this new formula. There are 5 colour families which make it quite easy to pick a colour. Just pick a colour family and then work from there. What this means is that there is a colour to suit anyone. The other thing I noticed is that while the colours of the lipstick look quite bright and vibrant in the tube, they tended to swatch a little more sheer than I expected. The colours weren’t as vibrant once translated onto skin, and they had a rather more transparent texture to them. I’m not really complaining about this, because I’ve realised that you can’t really have a hydrating lipstick formula that is very opaque. I think something in the ingredient list has to give. In this case, it’s the colour. So, if you are looking for something opaque in 1 swipe from the bullet, then I think you may be a wee bit disappointed. But if you want a lipstick that feels hydrating on lips, and lightweight, but imparts a nice transparent veil of colour which you can easily build up, then you may want to take a look at this new Rouge Coco range. I like how the colours do not go on my lips looking too glossy, but yet imparts a nice gentle glow without looking matte (I’m not really a fan of matte lips although I’ve grown to appreciate matte makeup elsewhere) The pigment in the deeper or brighter shades are stronger than those in the lighter shades, so if you have always been on the fence about wearing a bright lipstick, then this is also a nice place to start. First, it’s a Chanel, so like duh! ? Second, the colour doesn’t go on lips very strongly, so you can easily control the brightness of the shade. If you like to wear something bright like I do, then you may find that 2-3 layers will give you the strength of colour you prefer. But the nice part is that you get a nice colour without your lips puckering up and drying out as the day wears on. I also find that different shades wear differently. The brighter shades wear longer for me while the lighter shades disappear more quickly. With some of the bright shades like Dimitri, Arthur and Gabrielle, I could take them all the way through lunch and beyond with little touch up. With some others, I’d just about get through my lunch and then reapply. Let me show you some quick swatches of the colours I have, with some brief descriptions and how they look when I wear them on my lips. The swatches on my arm should give you an idea of what I mean by the texture, while the lip swatches will give you an idea of how it looks when I wear them. After all, lipsticks are worn on lips not on arms, right? ? These swatches represent the Coral and Pink shades of the new Rouge Coco formula. Edith 424 – A rose pink, Edith is a very wearable shade that I feel will suit most. I like this one for a my lips but better shade. Better, because it makes me look more alive. Olga 422 – A pale pink, Olga is a colour I’d never pick for myself at the counter. It is a milky pink in the tube, and it took me about 4 layers of colour to get it to show on my arm! This is unfortunately a colour that washes me out. But I think it’ll look much better on someone who has a pale, lighter, more blonde complexion. Roussy 426 – In tube, Roussy made me a little apprehensive. It looked quite like a bright pink and I’m not really a pink lip wearer. But much to my surprise, it swatches a much rosier hue on my skin which instantly makes it wearable for me. It still looks markedly pink on my lips, but a wearable pink. Mademoiselle 434 – Looking like a rather dull brown in the tube, I wasn’t even sure why it was placed in the pink category. Mademoiselle is an existing shade and one that is very popular because it is supposed to be wearable by anyone. I never quite took to it. On my arm, it looks brown but on my lips, it takes on a slightly more rosy hue. It isn’t unflattering, but it isn’t a shade I’d personally pick for myself. For ease of reference, this is how these shades described above look when I wear them on my lips. Olga as you can see, is a wash out for me, and unsurprisingly, my favourite is Roussy because it’s bright, but Edith has found its place in my daily lipstick pouch ? Legende 428 – In tube, looking more rosy than Mademoiselle but with a slight browned base is Legende. I find this one more wearable than Mademoiselle. Misia 418 – The corals weren’t too flattering for me unfortunately, as I felt them to swatch more orange than I expected. Misia is one of them. It looks like a reddish coral in the tube, but swatches quite orange. I don’t wear orange very well. Catherine 410 – This is my least favourite shade out of the lot, and also the strangest I’ve ever worn. Catherine in the tube is a milky peach and the swatch took me 5-6 layers to get the colour to show. Similar to Olga, I don’t wear milky shades like these because they don’t suit me. They will suit someone who likes shades like this I know, but not me. You will see below that Catherine looks like nothing on my lips, just a sheen. Coco 416 – Coco is what I’d call a straight orange hue in tube. However, when swatched it has a bit of a reddish tint that makes it wearable for me. In fact, Coco is what I’d expected Misia to look like so naturally I find it all a little confusing LOL! ? And here are the swatches in an FOTD. I’ve intentionally kept the makeup the same throughout just so you see what the lipstick colours look like when worn on lips. You may notice how they don’t look half as bright on lips as they do in the tube, which could be a pro or con, depending on your expectations. However, you will also notice how they leave lips with a lovely sheen of colour, and that part of it I like a lot!Out of this quad, I actually found myself liking Coco. It’s bright yet not too orange but not what I’d term coral either. The next batch of shades are those that fall into the Red, Nude and Plum categories. RED! YES! ? Arthur 440 – A popular shade, Arthur is a warm red in the tube that looks almost orangey. On my skin however, it is warm but with a strong red tone, thankfully. I find that it isn’t as bright as it really looks if you just apply 1 layer of colour but you can easily build it up. Warmer skintones will appreciate Arthur better. Gabrielle 444 – This one’s a true red and the lip shade worn by Kiera Knightley in the promotional images for the Rouge Coco lipsticks. The shade is a deeper, truer red and I love it, as can be expected ? It’s gorgeously sultry, yet if you don’t layer it on, it is actually very wearable. Dimitri 442 – I find that Dimitri is a lighter and brighter version of Gabrielle. Worn on lips, it takes on a warm, bright red with a slight blue tone that I find flattering. If you have a slightly cooler skintone then Dimitri might be the one to pick over Arthur. Adrienne 402 – A browned nude that again, isn’t one I’d pick myself. But in the spirit of experimentation, I wore it to see how it’d look on me. As expected, it wasn’t something I’d wear often. Perhaps if I wear a very strong smokey eye (which is almost never!) I might pull this out. But for everyday, this isn’t for me. It also took quite a few layers to get the colour to show. I find that true for all the light shades. But apparently, this is supposed to be “the nude lipstick to own” as shared by international makeup artist Kay Montano, while I beg to differ, I can see why… if nude lips are your thing ? And here are how the first 4 shades above look when I wear them. As can be expected perhaps, the reds are what look best on me, and you may notice how more washed out I look with a nude lip. I can’t decide between Arthur, Gabrielle and Dimitri (I love this name!) so I’d have to pick all 3 – not surprising, for those who know me LOL! ? Antoinette 406 – This one’s a straight brown, which again, isn’t something I’d pick for myself. Brown shades like these, that have a slight red tone, do suit those who have a deeper skin tone who want a lipstick that is a my lips but better shade. On fairer skintones, it can be a bit aging. But if you have a deeper skintone, I’d suggest you look at Antoinette. It’ll be lovely on you! Ina 450 – Ina is a bit strange. It has a slightly metallic tint to the plum-pink shade in the tube, but that metallic tint disappears on skin! Thankfully so because I was afraid it’d look frosty. I’m not sure why Ina is grouped with the plum shades because I found it a bit more pink than plum. A very wearable shade especially if you aren’t much into bright colours. Emilienne 452 – Emilienne looks fuchsia in the tube, but when I swatched it, it looks pink. So, again I’m not sure why this is in the plum category, unless I’m missing something. I find this shade a little milky for my liking so it isn’t a shade I’d wear very much of, but the colour itself is quite cool so if you have a cool skintone, this one will look more flattering although there is a risk of it looking a bit bright. Jean 454 – Now this one is indisputably a plum. Purple almost in the tube! I was afraid it might be aging the way some purple lipsticks are, but it isn’t so it’s definitely one to consider as well, if you’d like to add a plum lip into your look. Here’s how they all look on me. Emilienne seems to clash with my skintone a little, I feel while Ina makes it looks more alive. Antoinette, while wearable does make me feel a little older than I should be so it’s not a colour I’d wear often! I personally gravitate towards bright lips and red lipstick so I’d personally pick the reds and the pinks. I actually say pink although I don’t wear a lot of pink, because I found that for the most part, the pinks were deep enough that they weren’t too frivolous or pale the way pinks can be. But what I can say is that the new texture is lovely, but the longevity and opacity varies from shade to shade. If you want something that’ll last longer, pick a brighter or deeper shade. Otherwise, pick a shade you’d wear the most often, because you will want to ? IN A NUTSHELL Chanel has revamped their Rouge Coco range and called it the Rouge Coco Ultra Hydrating Lip Colour range of lipsticks with new shades and new names. The colours are bright and vibrant although I find that they go on a little more sheer than I expected. I also find the texture a little soft. I pressed a little harder on Catherine to get the colour to show, and it broke! There is some gloss but no shimmer so there’s no danger of any shade looking frosty. A lovely glow is imparted to the lips, but some shades may need layering to bring the colour out. They do feel a lot more hydrating, and I find that the longevity is fairly good. I’d applaud the improvement because I do like them a lot better now than I did 5 years ago! PROS: More hydrating formula, Comfortable and lightweight on lips, Colours are transparent and easily layered for more opacity, Gives lips a nice glow, Longevity of the deeper and brighter shades are good CONS: Pricey, Some may find it sheerer or not as vibrant as they like, Texture is a little soft WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a hydrating lipstick with a good selection of colours and opacity These have been out for a while. It took me a while to get this review out, because I had to find a day when I had the luxury of time to swatch 16 lip colours on my lips (it’s a feat, let me tell you that!) but I’m glad I took my time. It gave me the time to play around with them more, and to work out what I liked and disliked about the different colours and how long they lasted for me. It also taught me to stay away from light, pale shades and that I can expand my lipstick wardrode with different colours. Useful lessons to bear in mind ? Do you own a Rouge Coco lipstick? Is there one with your name on it? Other than the obvious male names, I think it would be fun to own a lipstick with your name on it. Unfortunately for me, none of them are mine ? If I were to pick 1 fave, I think I’d go with Dimitri. I like that Russian vibe, and I like how the colour looks on me. But the one in my everyday pouch is Edith for when I need quick touch ups ? If you have checked these out, I’d love to hear your thoughts and your faves! ?

I wanted to wear pretty sunglasses dammit! ? Anyone who’s had to fork out lots of money for prescription sunglasses can tell you how that feels (and back in the day, they are never as pretty as those you can buy off the rack) and secretly, I’d always hankered after a pair of aviator sunglasses. I know, blame Top Gun LOL! ? But one of my side-effects of undergoing lasik is light sensitivity. For me, wearing sunglasses isn’t purely for vanity. I need to wear sunglasses when I go out in the day because my eyes are just too sensitive to the light. So, coming back to aviators. I’d always wanted a pair, preferably with polarised lenses. But every pair I’d ever tried (Ray-Ban does the popular ones) looked weird on me. The large tear-drop style of lens just didn’t sit well on my face and trust me, I have a big face. I should be able to handle aviators! But one day, I came across a newer, slightly more updated design of the Ray-Ban aviator online which they call the Cockpit Aviator RB3362 and on a bit of a whim, I picked it up. The online reviews (there aren’t many) say that it’s smaller and somehow, more suited for Asian faces. That’s me! ? You know what? The reviews were right. It is a much more flattering design, on me at least. And I believe it would be the case for anyone who has a problem with aviator style sunglasses. The lenses have a less pronounced tear-drop design so you don’t have as much of a bug-eyed look. The gold wire-frame is light and does feel a little fragile. If you are careless with your sunglasses then this one might end up getting squashed. I have a pair of sunglasses with plastic frames that I keep in the car. I find those more sturdy. The frame has the bar across the top that is present in all aviator glasses designs, but the bar is slightly curved instead of running straight across. I feel that this softens the design slightly. I believe the lenses themselves are glass, but don’t quote me. The reason I say so is because I used to wear glass specs (oh yeah, those were the bad old days) and these have a bit of heft to them, which would not be there if the lenses were plastic. For anyone interested, the lenses were a 59mm width and the total width of the sunglasses are 14cm. I must ensure I pick sunglasses with wide lenses and wide width due to my large face boo! So nothing below 56mm for me. I learned that the hard way, trying to stick too-small sunnies on this large mug ? And when done right, I think I look pretty bad-ass in these ? I bought mine from Shopbop during their last 25% off sale so I thought it to be a good enough deal, and I got it in under a week. I didn’t have to adjust the plastic nose-guard which fit out of the box, and the sunnies themselves were a comfortable fit. I do find that they don’t offer as much protection as my plastic pair, because there is less of a wraparound effect. The lenses aren’t polarised but I find them comfortable enough in blocking the glare from the sun. But you know, sometimes, you just got to wear a pair of bad-ass sunnies, pair them with hot red lipstick and go get ’em! ? Do you wear aviator style sunglasses? What’s your favourite sunglasses? Well even if you don’t, it’s good practice to wear sunglasses that have proper UV rating and proper protection. It protects your eyes from the sun, glare (reduces squinting and lines!) and UV rays can cause cataracts. Sometimes, fancy or very cheap sunnies are a little suspect for this reason. They may not be properly rated and may actually cause your eyes more harm because your pupils dilate when shaded and allows more UV rays in. So if you’re going to wear sunglasses, get a proper pair, not just the cheapest pair, and there is no need to get the most expensive pair either. Or maybe you’re like me and just want to get a bad-ass pair LOL ? p/s I’ve kind of missed not writing about just beauty products or beauty posts ?

['2015-10-19 08:30:46'],b388db437f6daf0b122d7adb9a52f02e36b29e90,c7de-44fb-8840,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2015/10/la-mer-reparative-skintint/,"['Do you have something that you wouldn’t necessarily call a favourite, yet find yourself reaching for it now and again, a little more often than you might expect? I’m sort of that way with the La Mer Reparative Skintint SPF30 , which is La Mer’s version of a tinted moisturiser-sunscreen thingy. In fact, if you read La Mer’s description of this product, they don’t really talk about the “tint” of colour, calling it instead, a “healthy wash of colour” which I’ve learned, is marketing speak for “very sheer colour”. So, when you have that in mind, you’d be less inclined to be disappointed when you find out that the product doesn’t offer a lot of coverage. So why bother wearing a tinted product, if you aren’t going to get any coverage on skin? Well, speaking personally, I do, a little more often than I realise. It will depend on what you really need the product to do. Are you concerned about reducing the appearance of redness and uneven skintone on your skin? Or would you prefer something that will cover up imperfections as well? For the former, I find that soft tints or washes of colour do a pretty decent job. For the latter, go with a proper foundation. It also comes with being comfortable with your skin and realising that there are other ways you can actually wear a makeup base, without a) looking like you’re wearing makeup and b) without having too much product on the skin. I”ll actually show you below how I do this ? But coming back to the La Mer Reparative Skintint , I’d consider this a tinted moisturiser with sunscreen. The reason I say so is because the texture of the product is fairly thick and creamy so I’d hesitate to suggest this to someone who has combination-oily skin. You might find it uncomfortable or that it turns oily. On drier skin, like mine, it does help make your skin feel a bit more comfortable as the day wears on. Now, some of you weren’t sold on my theory about makeup base being good for your skin in polluted environments (nothing against you of course! ? ) but part of the reason I realised it was because I realised that when I wear this particular product, my skin seems to feel softer at the end of the day when I remove it. Texture-wise, it is fairly thick, and if I’ve one major complaint, it’s to do with the shades. For some reason, the shades of the Reparative Skintint are abysmal and orange. I honestly have no idea where La Mer are getting the idea that people are orange, but there’s that. The shades tend to be warm and orange and honestly speaking, I don’t find them flattering. The shade I use is Very Fair , which is what you see in the picture. It is light, with a slight pinkish tone. In fact, I think this shade will be worn by most people who have fair to medium skintones, because the next step up – Light – is orange. It is, I swear! I tried it and was quite horrified at how warm it was. If you have very deep skintones, the odds are that you’d only be using Medium. A magazine editor I know does, so that’s how I know it’ll work. The leap in shade from Very Fair to Light is a huge chasm. Very Fair blends out fairly transparent, as you can see in the picture above. Light will impart a warm, transparent shade of colour. I think that if you’re the sort who wants a “healthy glow” then Light might work, but I’d still caution you about looking orange. That said, despite the sheerness of colour, I do find myself quite happy with this product because for some reason, it seems to even out redness and skintone pretty impressively and makes skin look better than it really is. I treat this as I would a makeup base, so I apply it after skincare and sunscreen. While I can use my fingers to apply this, I find that this sometimes results in my using more product than I like, so I usually use a brush. This is more so because I find that when I use fingers to apply, the product doesn’t spread out very smoothly on my skin. The texture, as I’ve warned you above, is a little thick so using fingers to spread it isn’t quite the way to go for me, personally speaking. A brush seems to even it out better, and is actually quicker. Let me show you how it looks in this little collage, and what I mean when I said right at the top, that it works for me by giving me a good base, without my having to wear more makeup than necessary. The photos are unretouched, so on left is my bare skin. In the middle, I’ve applied a thin layer of the La Mer Reparative Skintint in Very Fair. You may notice how it has evened out the redness and uneven tone somewhat, especially around the shadows of the eyes and nose. You may also notice how the pigmentation I have isn’t really concealed, because it is very sheer. Yet, the skin looks better already doesn’t it? In the picture on right, what I’ve done is dabbed some concealer ( Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer ) on my under eye area and on my cheekbones where my pigmentation clusters are. And that’s it! On another day, I might even apply a light dusting of loose powder, and what this does is give me a very light, very natural base that doesn’t look like I have any makeup on. Magical! LOL ? Will you like this? I don’t know really. I’d love to tell you to try it, but this being a premium brand, it is quite pricey. This is more so, if you can’t actually test it, because the shade selection is very poor. However, if you have drier skin and do find a shade that suits you, and aren’t too put off by the price, and don’t really want to wear a lot of makeup, yet want to just have your skin look a bit better than it already does, I think it’s worth taking a look. IN A NUTSHELL The La Mer Reparative Skintint is a fairly creamy textured moisturiser with SPF30 PA+++. I’d wear this as makeup i.e. after skincare and sunscreen and not in place of either. However, I do find that this Skintint does make my skin feel softer and hydrated at the end of the day after I remove it, which is very comfortable. The tint is very sheer and there are only 5 shades, which tend to be deeper and more orange than usual, so I’d suggest stepping down a shade, if you’re buying sight unseen. I like how it evens out skintone very nicely, and leaves skin looking better, although the tint is so sheer. It is very comfortable for me, but there is a light scent. While I won’t categorise this as a favourite, I find myself reaching for it more often than I expect. Which I suppose says something about it. PROS: Keeps skin feeling hydrated, Sheer tint of colour evens out skintone and redness while keeping skin very transparent, Expensive CONS: Poor shade selection, Thick texture may not suit those with oilier skins, Very sheer tint of colour does not cover imperfections on skin WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who has drier skin as the texture is fairly creamy and thick, Anyone who can find a shade match as the shade selection is fairly poor I managed to unearth the ingredient list for The Reparative Skintint SPF30 PA+++ so here it is: Water, Butylene Glycol, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-4, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Algae (Seaweed) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Seed Powder, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seedcake, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Meal, Eucalyptus Globulus (Eucalyltus) Leaf Oil, Sodium Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Calcium Gluconate, Magnesium Gluconate, Zinc Gluconate, Tocopheryl Succinate, Niacin, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Powder, Polyethylene, Helichrysym Arenarium (Everlasting) Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Magnolia Officinalis Bark Extract, PEG-100 Stearate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Morus Nigra (Mulberry) Root Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Lysate Extract, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint), Pelargonium Graveolens (Geranium) Flower Oil, Lamirania Saccharina Extract, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Methyldihydrojasmonate, Segisbeckia Orientalis (St. Paul’s Wort) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Sucrose, Glycerin, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Caffeine, Propylene Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Lecithin, Isohexadecane, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Whey Protein, Dimethoxytolyl, Propylresorcinol, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Peel Extract, Acetyl Glucosamine, PVP/Hexadecane Copolymer, Tourmaline, Yeast Polysaccharides, Caprylyl Glycol, Rosa Damescena (Rose) Flower Oil, Yeast Extract, Isostearic Acid, Propylene Glycol Dicaprate, Stearic Acid, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Tromethamine, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Galactoarabinan, Nylon-12, Zeolite, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Tocopheryl Linoleate/Oleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Boron Nitrade, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Silica, Aluminium Hydroxide, Alcohol Denat, Tin Oxide, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Linolool, Geraniol, Citronellol, Limonene, Phyoxyethanol [+- titanium dioxide (CI77891) Iron Oxides (CI77492) Iron Oxides (CI77491) Iron Oxides (CI77499) Mica] Have you tried this La Mer Skintint?

When I was invited to give the new Clinique Pop Lip Colour + Primer a go, I was offered a selection of colours online. I didn’t really have their names so I picked something that looked “berry-ish” a colour I knew I’d wear daily and often. As much as I love my red lipstick, I’ve not been wearing them as often as I should. When it arrived, I had a bit of an “Oh crap!” moment when I saw that contrary to what the online picture showed me, the shade was not a berry red as I thought, but a colour that verges on being “nude” or “neutral”. If there’s one thing I shy away from more than chocolate, it’s nude lipstick. (Look, I can’t be the only person out there who doesn’t like chocolate right?! ? ) The shade is 02 Bare Pop and in tube, it looked like a neutral, slightly pink-browned shade, with tiny little sparkles. My heart sank. If there’s something else I can’t handle, it’s lipstick with sparkles. But my job, as it were, is to try the formula, so I gritted my teeth, pursed my lips and slicked Bare Pop on. It’s kind of hard to explain how it happened, but much to my surprise, Bare Pop has found its way into my daily lipstick pouch! This is Clinique’s latest lipstick offering, which is a lightweight formula that is supposed to glide on with bold colour, for a pigmented lip that feels comfortable all day. I do find that the product slips on quite easily on lips in a manner almost like that of a lip balm. I also found Bare Pop to be a little sheer and not as bold and unsaturated as the brand claims. However, I am told that it’s due to the colour I picked. The brighter shades promise to have a bolder effect, which I do see from online swatches so my conclusion is that opacity may vary from colour to colour. I have also read complaints that say that Bare Pop gives lips a frosty hue, which was something I was concerned with due to the visible sparkles in the bullet. However, I don’t personally notice this frosty hue. I’ve lived through frosty lipstick. Trust me my friends, this isn’t frosty. Clinique Bare Pop swatch on arm and on lips There is however, obvious shine, which you may or may not like. Clinique also says that these apply semi-matte to which I say no. These are not matte. There is definitely a shine to it. I also find Bare Pop sheer, but then when I’m promised “bold, unsaturated colour” I expect a creamy, opaque colour. Just based on the colour in tube, I’d never have picked this one up. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised to note that when I wear it, it gives my lips a very natural colour and shine. It makes for a good “no-brainer” lipstick or a weekend lipstick or just a casual lip colour. I’d wear this with heavier eye makeup and a pop of colour on cheeks offered by the Clinique Cheek Pop blushes . As you can see, Bare Pop is a very safe lip colour. I keep it in my makeup pouch because it’s a shade I can wear irrespective of what makeup I’m using on a particular day. I have a bad habit of not carrying the lipstick I wear in the morning and not reapplying my lipstick, so it’s quite useful to have a safe shade I can pull out when I need it. The packaging deserves a mention because unlike many people who like it, I don’t. I thought I would, from online photos, but after having it for a while, I find I don’t. It’s dinky and square and I like that because it means it won’t roll around and go missing. But I don’t like the different coloured bases, which correspond to each lip colour. I suppose I’m just a little old fashioned. The colourful bases, whilst making it easy to find the colour you want in a pinch, also makes it look a little bit like a toy and unfinished. I suppose I take makeup a little more seriously hence my preference for a more streamlined look. As it stands, I have a tendency to feel like I’m working with a paint chip, which reminds me of the heady days of house renovation and cracking my head over paint chips and how I was supposed to imagine a whole wall from a tiny little chip. But I digress ? Packaging grouses aside, I’m quite happy with the colour and formula. I’m however, not in a hurry to get more colours because of the packaging. Catch-22 situation eh? ? IN A NUTSHELL The Clinique Pop Lip Colour + Primer lipstick is a new range of lipstick that promises long lasting bold lip colours that are lightweight and comfortable on lips. I do not find these drying, and I agree that they are lightweight. For me, they slick on a little like a lip balm, with quite a nice slip. Based on the shade I received, Bare Pop, I found the colour a little sheer but I’m assured that the brighter, bolder shades have a bolder swipe of colour. Bare Pop is, for me, a nice day to day neutral lip shade. It is neutral with just enough pink to prevent me from looking like the walking dead. However, I’m not a fan of the packaging which I find a little unfinished. But that’s me. I’m finicky that way. PROS: Inexpensive, Lightweight and comfortable texture, Longlasting and not drying, Bare Pop is a very safe way to wear a neutral or nude lipstick due to the pink tones, Not as metallic as I thought it would be, Smooth to apply, Not scented CONS: I’m not a fan of the packaging, Opacity of colour and shine may differ from shade to shade WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a lightweight lipstick with fairly bold pigmentation that isn’t drying Have you tried these new Pop Lip Colour + Primer lipsticks? Do you like chocolate? ? Incidentally, speaking about pops, I recently found out that Clinique has expanded their line of Cheek Pop blushes, which are the ones you see in the picture above. I haven’t seen the new shades, but if you have, please let me know what you think. I love these! They’re so good, and so pretty, and not expensive! ?

I was told these very popular Clinique Cheek Pop blushes would be available here in mid-February, but it seems like it might be delayed. I’m afraid I’m running with this however as it’s already been scheduled, so if you don’t see it at your Clinique counter or online (you do know you can shop online ?), don’t fret. It’ll appear in time, and they are permanent and they will be worth the wait I promise you! What are these Cheek Pop blushes then? One of the new hidden gems from Clinique! The Cheek Pop blushes are vibrant blushes that come in 4 very wearable shades and whilst are powder blushes, have an interesting cream-to-powder texture and finish that is fascinating. But what will really catch the eye of most people would be the design. We have not see something this pretty, yet this functional in a very long time! The Cheek Pop blushes come imprinted with a gerbera on its surface which is impressive with its attention to detail and intricacy. The best part is that the embossing does not disappear with a few uses. I’ve been using these quite regularly and the pattern is still pretty intact. In fact, these pictures were taken after a couple of uses so you will have reason to smile at these flowery blushes for a long time to come ? But pretty pattern aside, the Clinique Cheek Pop blushes pack a punch and I must say, surprised me every step of the way. These deserve all the accolades tossed at them, and then some! Each Cheek Pop blush comes housed in a transparent lucite case, with a base that corresponds to the colour in it. There are 4 shades available for now:- Plum Pop – a light cool pink Berry Pop – a deep berry pink Ginger Pop – a warm coral red Peach Pop – a warm coral pink I have yet to see Ginger Pop and Peach Pop for myself but I have been seeing many pictures and swatches online and they look absolutely beautiful so I’m quite taken with them too. They are the warmer shades so if you fare well with peach and coral blushes you will want to look at those and if you fare better with pink shades then you will probably prefer Plum Pop or Berry Pop. Clinique Cheek Pop in Berry Pop for size reference They aren’t very large, but the colours pack a punch and the price is very affordable (RM80 yo!) so I really am not complaining at all. In pan, and putting Berry Pop and Plum Pop side by side, I must confess that it is actually quite hard to tell them apart. The tonal shades are close and unless you view them in bright light, they aren’t that noticeably different. Clinique Cheek Pop Left: Plum Pop Right: Berry Pop In brighter light, you will notice that Berry Pop has a deeper colour that Plum Pop but to the naked eye there is minimal difference. Does that mean therefore that you can just get away with just one instead of both? Actually I do think you can. Whilst there are subtle tonal difference between the 2 cool shades and the 2 warm shades, I personally find them a little too similar on skin to warrant getting all 4 unless you are a collector. However, between each tone category lies also a subtle difference so it does pay to get the shade right the first time. Clinique Cheek Pop Swatches Left: Plum Pop Right: Berry Pop As you can see, while Plum Pop and Berry Pop look similar in pan, on skin they are quite different. Plum Pop, despite its name displays no plummy tones and instead is a light, cool toned pink which I personally find flattering on fair skintones. On deeper skintones you may have to layer it a bit. So for deeper skintones, I think Berry Pop will serve you better. It is a cool toned berry pink that I’d pick in a heartbeat if it was a lipstick but in a blush, it is a shade that gives me pause. I personally think this will be more flattering on someone with deeper skintone and while I get it to work, I need to be careful with it and I prefer using Plum Pop which I find more flattering. Clinique Berry Pop blush – look at the intricacy of the pattern! This is after at least 2 uses. The texture of these Cheek Pop blushes are very interesting as they actually feel a bit like a cream and even look like a cream blush but it’s a powder blush. I just use my regular blush brush to pick up product and even the soft Lunasol Cheek Brush works just fine. In fact, I like using it because it picks up just enough colour to allow me to build on as when I work with Berry Pop I find it a bit too strong for my skintone. So my advise would be to work out the shade you’d like and then go with a light hand and blend and build colour along the way because these are surprisingly pigmented. Longevity is very good as well. I apply these over foundation and they last practically all day on me – a minimum of 8 hours before I notice it’s gone. The incredible texture gives me a sheer, blush from within glow that I love especially with Plum Pop so that’s my favourite of the 2 that I have. I am considering Peach Pop as I suspect that Ginger Pop might be the counterpart to Berry Pop, both being deeper in tone, so I’ll report back when I get it ? For completeness, here’s how both the blushes look when I wear them. This is Plum Pop, the cooler light pink toned blush. This one’s Berry Pop the slightly deeper toned berry blush used with a very light hand and blended out. To be perfectly honest, on cheeks, despite the difference in lighting etc, there is little difference between Berry Pop and Plum Pop. I find Plum Pop more flattering and less likely for me to make a mistake with. With Berry Pop, I can sometimes look like I’ve put on too much blush and it then looks less flattering on my skin. Personally, I’d just pick one from each category, despite the affordable pricetag and incredible texture. It just doesn’t quite make sense to own all 4. In a nutshell Get them when they’re released! ? These new Cheek Pop powder blushes from Clinique apply like a cream and give a very lovely transparent glow on the skin that is very flattering. The colours are vibrant and will flatter most skin tones. I personally find them too similar to warrant owning all 4, but owning one cool and one warm shade does make sense as they are excellent quality products, long lasting, pretty to look at, easy to use and very affordable. You can’t ask for more in a blush! Pros: Affordable, Longlasting, Pigmented, Pretty design, Compact and easy to use, Flattering colours, Permanent, Not powdery on skin Cons: None Who will like this: Anyone who loves a pretty blush, Anyone who wants an affordable blush that performs well and does not look powdery on skin I have to admit I was taken by surprise by these Cheek Pop blushes. I own a Clinique blush or two and while they are alright, they aren’t anything I’d write home about. Some of the pretty patterned ones released in previous years are a right disappointment as they were so sheer to be invisible. These however, have received accolades and bouquets all over the world and I must say, they deserve every bit of it. After the Chubby Stick Intense , these are the next best things to have come out of the Clinique makeup stable in recent years and I’m so glad they’ve finally stepped up their game. Good job! ? Are you eyeing these blooming beauties? Which colours would you get? I plan to pick up Peach Pop, based on the swatches I’ve been seeing. It looks pretty but I do want to check it out in person first to ensure it’s not too warm. I personally would only pick one cool and one warm colour, but you know, don’t let me stop you getting all 4 if it strikes your fancy ?

I saw first-hand how Vietnamese lacquerware was made, and I was told that the best way to get the high glossy shine associated with good quality lacquerware, was to polish the products by hand. No machine could measure up to the shine and sheen that could only be brought forth by hand. Which explains why high quality lacquer ware is expensive, and due to the materials used and effort and skills, lacquerware is primarily decorative these days instead of used for practical purposes. But it is that glossy shine of a high quality lacquer product that inspired Shu Uemura’s Laque Supreme lip colours. Shu Uemura Laque Supreme RD02 Inspired by Japanese lacquerware, Shu Uemura offers a lip colour that is lightweight, glossy, shiny and pigmented. I like the black tubes it comes in, because that is very in keeping with the theme, and there is a nice window of colour so you know which ones you have. I won’t classify these as lip glosses. They are much more pigmented, so I’d place them in the category of liquid lipstick, but the liquid texture allows you to dial back on colour and pigment as you see fit. Since I love lip colours, how do you think these fared for me? I can tell you that a quick online search will yield you mostly raves; that this is the best thing since sliced bread! Well, let me just say that if you like using liquid lipsticks or lip glosses, and like products like Lancome’s Lip Lover or Dior Addict Fluid Stick then you will like these. Like what you get from Dior, these Laque Supreme lip colours from Shu Uemura are huge on colour. They are incredibly pigmented and give you a lovely glossy lip on top of the colour you get. It’s like lipglosses on steroids. The doe foot sponge tipped wand is an innovative design that fits your lip and holds colour well, so you don’t have to double dip. I do find that wiping off some of the colour as you remove the wand out of the tube allows you better control when applying it to your lips. Otherwise, it can get a little goopy. I also find that layering on thin layers of product gives you better longevity and depth of colour, as opposed to applying it in one thick swipe of product. The pigment is strong, so you can easily gauge the depth of colour you need based on your comfort level. The texture is a lightweight, water based texture that does not feel heavy nor goopy on your lips, and the colour is fairly long lasting once applied. I received 3 colours a few months ago, so here are the swatches on arm, on lips and in a quick FOTD so you have an idea of what they look like when worn. BG01 – A nude-beige toned lipstick, that has a warm, slightly orangy undertone. This goes best with stronger eye makeup, although I liked that unlike many nude lip colours, this did not leave me looking washed out and sick. Just enough colour to look human. This also has the sheerest texture PK01 – A bright pink that is fresh and refreshing, and is pretty flattering for those with fair or light skintones. RD02 – A straight red with slightly warm base that is punchy and pretty much in your face! This has the most opaque texture among the 3 featured. You may notice how in the arm swatches, the middle looks fairly sheer. I noticed that when swatching on my arm, but for some reason, when you do the same swatch on your lips, you get a much stronger tone. I think it’s to do with the wand. The curve hugs your lips just right, and deposits just the right amount of colour. All the lip swatches were done with 2 thin layers of product. You see a nice shine, but it isn’t super glossy to the extent of being greasy, like you just ate a bowl of oily laksa or dug into a box of fried chicken. It gives your lips a nice, flattering shine. I’ve got the same lip swatches in a simple FOTD to show you just how it looks in a full face of makeup. I thought it interesting that BG01 was fairly flattering for me. It would be nice to dig this out for a simple swipe of colour without having to be too careful about whether I colour in the lines, the same way I have to be for RD02. BG01 was also more sheer than RD02 with PK01 falling somewhere in the middle. It appears to be true that the deeper the shade, the more opaque it is in one swipe and vice versa. Also, if you are the type who hates how products like these can fade and leave a weird ring around your lips, fear not. I find that they have a slight stain effect, so as the colour wears off, it leaves behind a nice stain of colour on your lips that makes it easy to touch up. However, as much as I love the intensity of colour, I’m not crazy about the Laque Supremes. They aren’t as tacky as Dior Addict Fluid Sticks and yet have the same beautiful intensity of colour and shine. But there is a strange chemical scent that I can’t get over. I’ve noticed that no one mentions it so I don’t know if it’s just me and my sensitive nose or just that no one wants to mention it, but it’s there. I am bugged by strong floral scents or sweet scents in lip products, because you wear them so close to your nose, but chemical scents irk me more than a floral scent does. I mean, I realise that these are an amalgamation of chemicals anyway, yet when I get that sharp scent, my brain spasms and I go “Why does my lipstick smell like it’s radioactive?!”* So that’s the fly in my Laque Supreme ointment. I love a lot about it, but that smell. I can’t get over it ? IN A NUTSHELL The Shu Uemura Lacque Supreme liquid lip colours have a lovely lightweight texture and an incredible intensity of colour. I suggest using thin layers to build up the colour as it looks best that way, and you can build them up from sheer to opaque in just about 2 layers. The product also operates as a stain so you get good longevity as well. All in all, as a lip colour, it’s an amazing product. However, I find that there is a chemical scent to them that I’m not crazy about so as a result, I can’t say I’m a fan. PROS: Pigmented and intense colour, Easy to layer, Feels comfortable on lips without feeling tacky, Lightweight texture CONS: Chemical scent puts me off WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who enjoys using liquid lip colours, Anyone who wants a pigmented and glossy lip colour with fairly good longevity, Anyone who likes using lip gloss and wants a product with more colour Since I mentioned the Dior Fluid Stick and these Laque Supremes above within this post, you may be wondering which I prefer between the two. I’d pick the Laque Supreme for the texture and colour, despite the chemical scent. It’s because I can’t stand the texture of the Fluid Stick (I know there are a lot of fans and I apologise… actually no I don’t apologise, but it’s just a me thing ? ) I won’t even include Lancome’s Lip Lover because that one I’m not a fan of ? Have you tried these Laque Supreme lip colours? Are you a fan of liquid lipsticks? I’m on the fence about liquid lipsticks. I like how they tend to have a more transparent quality and better shine than a regular stick lipstick, but I don’t like fiddling about with lip wands. It’s the same way I rarely wear lip gloss. I like the gloss, I don’t like the application mechanism. What say you? Fan of them? ? Paris B * I don’t know what ‘radioactive’ smells like and I’m not saying these are radioactive but every time I get that sharp metallic scent of chemicals, I think “Man! That smells radioactive!” Shu Uemura Laque Supreme Lip Colours come in 15 shades Price: RM90 Availability: Shu Uemura counters and boutiques']"

Let me also preface this by saying that I haven’t felt the need to spend almost RM300 on a jar of mud so I know for a fact I didn’t actually buy it. Perhaps it’s my little pixies being generous LOL! But I know Glamglow gets loads and loads of raves so when I stumbled across it, I felt the need to give the product a go to see what it was all about. There are a few different versions, but the brand Glamglow itself hails from Hollywood California, where it is said that these mud masks are used behind the scenes as quick pick-me-ups for skin. To give it a glam glow, as it were. The one I found was the Glamglow Supermud Clearing Treatment , which you will see below, promises you the moon and the stars. This product, if it is believed, will give you smoother skin, smaller pores, clear breakouts and blemishes, deal with spots, pimples, zits (3 words that all mean the same thing, don’t be fooled!) and clear black and white heads. It has glycolic, salicylic, lactic, mandelic, pyruvic and azelaic acids; and I don’t even know what those last 2 were ? Let’s just say, it promises to do a HELL OF A LOT! So, let’s see if it does. First of all, let me show you the box. This product comes in an octoganal box that is fairly large. Can you see everything it promises to do? Remember, 3 of the words mean the same thing LOL I thought it was clever, because it looks like it does a lot, yet it’s a little silly once you look past the smoke and mirrors. Which is what I will advise you to do. Ignore the glam of Hollywood and the superlative promises. Just look at the product and see what it really does. And when I opened the box, I had the shock of my life. What the flying f….ish?! Was that a sample jar or was I entering the world of Lilliput? A hasty glance back at the front of the box told me that the jar was a mere 34g. 34g of product!! 34! It wasn’t even 50g, it was an odd 34g. Wait, how much does this retail for again? Almost RM300 locally if I’m not mistaken, and US$69 on Sephora . Please excuse me while I get over my apoplectic fit. Ok *deep breath* maybe this then is a wonder product eh? Good things are expensive, or so they tell us. Open that tiny little tub, and you are greeted with a foil cover (don’t toss it. I use it to cover back the product to keep it from drying out too quickly) Lift the foil, and you get an interesting juxtaposition of black on white. I think there’s some aesthetics going on here ? The product is a fairly thick mud paste that is a deep grey that’s almost black. I find that there are bits in it, which I have not been able to identify, but it has a fairly chunky texture, for want of a better word. If you see the swatches below, you might see the chunky bits. It feels funny because I’m not sure what they are for. They aren’t chunks of dried mud, in case you’re wondering. Anyway, you are advised to apply a thin layer to the skin (of your face, not your hands although I don’t see why not, if you feel the need) and leave it on to dry. On contact with the skin, I find that it gives a cooling tingle. I think it’s the peppermint oil, because there is a fresh minty “essential oil smell” as well. But be warned, because this means it can irritate skin too. It dries fairly slowly on skin, I find and as it dries, the minty tingle will slowly disappear, and it then looks a light grey as you see on the right. The bits are still there though, and you can see it more clearly. Once it’s all dried, you can rinse it off. Although you might have to scrub at it a little to really get it off your skin, it does wash off fairly easily. If you want to speed things up, use a face cloth, but I’ll warn you that the mud will stain. So, be patient, dampen your skin with water, rub to dissolve, and rinse as you go. Now, to be fair, I do find that this mask does leave my skin feeling very lovely and smooth immediately after using. It doesn’t make my skin feel tight (I have drier skin and drier skin doesn’t like mud masks a lot) nor do I run out of the bathroom blindly flailing for my rosewater mists or moisturiser to rehydrate my parched skin. It feels fairly comfortable. I was most curious about using this when I have blemishes, or spots or pimples or zits (as Glamglow defines them) and if I use it on the spot a few days in a row, I notice a slight drying out without drying the surrounding skin. But if you are expecting a result the first time you use it, don’t bother. There’s no result. Not even for the next few days. IT’S SO TINY OMG! What I like is that it isn’t drying for a mud mask, and I like how smooth and clean my skin feels after I use it. What I don’t like however, is the minty tingle that I feel is unnecessary and honestly, can be irritating to skin. I do leave it on quite a while, up to 40 minutes at a go and I usually follow up with a hydrating or replenishing mask ( Laneige Water Sleeping Mask or the Sulwhasoo Overnight Mask , most of the time) to replenish skin hydration. This combination works best for me when I use clarifying or mud masks. To be honest though, while I think it is a decent product, I won’t repurchase nor try any of the others in the brand because I can’t justify paying that much money for a mud mask that for me is just average. I used to use the Kiehl’s Rare Earth mask and that was affordable and pretty decent as well. While this may contain a boatload of ingredients, at the end of the day, it’s a mud mask and I don’t like that weird tingle on skin. They all more or less do the same thing and feel the same. If price is no object, then by all means, try this. But otherwise, don’t bother. Seriously. There are other options. IN A NUTSHELL The Glamglow Supermud Clearing Treatment is a mud mask that is supposed to clear and clarify skin. It goes on with a minty tingle that dissipates as the product dries on skin. Washing off the dried mud mask leaves your skin feeling smooth without drying out your skin. However, the astronomical price for the diminutive size puts me off and for that reason, I won’t recommend this for purchase at all. Unless you get it at a hefty discount. PROS: Not drying for a mud mask, Skin feels smooth and clean after washing off CONS: Very expensive for very little product, Peppermint oil leaves skin tingling on contact which can be irritating, Can be messy to wash off, Does not dry out pimples or spots effectively WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes mud masks, Anyone who wants a clarifying mask and for whom price is no object For those interested, here is the ingredient list for the Glamglow Supermud Clearing Treatment mask. I’ve been told that some of the other Glamglow masks are better and that there’s even one that’s hydrating. I know, a mud masks that hydrates skin. Intriguing. But because of the Hollywood style pricing, I’m not keen to give it a go. Perhaps if my pixies happen to spirit me one in the future, I will. But otherwise, I’ll glam and glow with something else ? Have you tried this mud mask or any other Glamglow product? Do you have one you like? I don’t know man, the price, the size. Everything just put me off. I get the hype. I get that it’s a decent product and that it isn’t drying for a mud mask. But man, it’s not RM300 or US$69 decent. I’m quite sure there are much much more affordable options out there. But if you like this please feel free to say so. I’m always open to suggestion, as you well know by now ?

I love the colours and intensity of pigment, but the texture did not sit well with me. It was about this time that I came across many mentions of a similar hybrid lipbalm-lipgloss-lip colour product coming out of Lancome’s stables. The raves for this one was astounding and some touted them to be even better than Dior’s offering. Naturally therefore, I had to see what the fuss was all about! ? The product is the Lancome Lip Lover and I was told they would be available locally in June 2014 but I couldn’t wait, so I picked mine up online about a month ago. There is quite a large range of colours to choose from and I know the expectation is for me to go for a red lip so I did, but I also chose a lighter, more neutral lip shade as well. The 2 colours I ended up with Beige Adage 332 and Belle de Rouge 356 . I can tell you off the bat that I’m not fawning over them so these are likely to be my first and last Lip Lovers, but I have also found a lip colour to love so it isn’t a total whitewash ? You may not be able to tell it from the photos, but the Lancome Lip Lovers are deceptively small. Every photo I saw them in gave me the impression they’d be longer or perhaps even larger than what they really are. But they’re small which came as a bit of a surprise. All these online close ups of products don’t help to manage expectations do they? ? Packaging wise, they are like that of the Gloss in Love , where the cover clicks close instead of screwing close. Like Gloss in Love, my comment on this would be the same. Innovative, but impractical. The release button is easily depressed and more than once, I’ve found the cover loosened while inside my makeup pouch. The contents didn’t spill, but it’s a disaster waiting to happen. Suffice to say, there’s a reason why some things are designed a certain way. The window in front shows you the colour of the lip product which brings me to the formula. The Lip Lover is said to be a “Dewy Color Lip Perfector 8H moisture” which basically means that it is moisturising on lips (not drying), has good colour pay off and gives a glossy shine. It is a lip colour, gloss and balm in one. However, I would not compare them to the Dior Addict Fluid Stick simply because the texture is markedly different. Dior Addict Fluid Stick has a water based texture, which is very light on lips and the pigmentation of the product is astounding. The longevity is good and it is fairly comfortable. It was like wearing a very light but intense lipstick. The reason I did not like it was because it takes a very long time to set (almost never) and in that interim, feels tacky on my lips. I’m fussy about things like that so I am critical. The Lancome Lip Lover on the other hand is pretty much a lip gloss. It has that thick silicone feel of a lip gloss, and has a goopy texture not unlike a lip gloss. The colour is strong but not consistent in both colours I own and the intensity markedly lower than Dior’s. It isn’t drying and longevity is a little longer than that of a regular gloss, but when I wear it, it’s pretty much just a lip gloss. Nothing terribly special. What this means therefore, is that if you are a fan of wearing lip gloss, you will probably like this one. It gives you better coverage and colour than a regular lip gloss but not the same intensity as that of a lipstick. If you shy away from lip glosses, reconsider these and go instead for the Dior Addict Fluid Sticks which are less gloss-like. The wand is also pretty much that of a regular lip gloss, except it looks a bit longer. Nothing terribly noteworthy. What is noteworthy however, is that I somehow ended up with 2 different textures of Lip Lover in the 2 colours I picked. Beige Adage 332 – is a light neutral pink that has a thicker, more opaque texture more akin to that of a liquid lipstick. There is shine but when applied, has a more opaque finish and looks less glossy. Belle de Rouge 356 – is a bright glossy red that has a more translucent finish more akin to that of a lip gloss. There is shine and transparency not found in Beige Adage. It was incredibly hard to swatch these and while the swatches on my arm do not quite represent my perception of them, they are possibly useful for you to see the texture, which is more glossy like a jelly and less intense in colour. Beige Adage, despite the name isn’t a beige at all but a neutral pink I happened to fall in love with. You might be able to see from the lip swatches what I mean by the different textures of the Lip Lovers. Beige Adage applies more smoothly with a more even, opaque colour. Belle de Rouge is more transparent and looks more glossy. I find that Belle de Rouge does not apply very evenly and it takes a few passes for me to get it right and to ensure the colour is even. With Beige Adage, I get it right from the first swipe. Because I’m not a fan of lip gloss in general with very few exceptions and because there is a scent (light but sweet which I’m not a fan of) I am not keen on more. I do love Beige Adage and it’s a colour I wear often so I’d likely look for a lipstick in this shade ? In a nutshell The Lancome Lip Lover is a lip gloss that has more intense pigment and is more moisturising. I would term this a lip gloss because that’s how it performs for me. It has a lot of shine and a thick, goopy feeling that sits on my lips. It isn’t sticky or tacky, but it has a decidedly “gloss” feeling that you either love or hate. I’m personally not a fan so I’m not mooning over these. Of the 2 shades I own, I found that the textures were different. Beige Adage was more of a liquid lipstick being more opaque and applying more evenly on lips. Belle de Rouge was more like a lipgloss being more transparent and has a more uneven application. They’re alright as far as lip glosses go, but I hesitate to say that they’re exceptional because I don’t think they are. Pros: Not drying, Not sticky nor tacky, Nice shine and gloss, Compact and portable Cons: Scented, Thick goopy feeling when applied, Different colours had different textures, Cover can be easily dislodged Who will like this: Anyone who likes the feel of wearing lip gloss but wants a bit more colour Here are how they look when I wear them. Beige Adage 332 turned out to be a wearable day to day lip colour that I found very refreshing after the bold lip colours I’m used to sporting. I didn’t expect to like this colour but I do and the formula too sits well with me as it is more liquid lipstick than lipgloss. I need to find a matching lipstick shade now! Help me if you know of a shade that looks similar ? Belle de Rouge is a more conventional red lipgloss. It does not apply as smoothly as Beige Adage and catches on dry flaky skin on lips if I’m not careful. It’s a nice colour, but not special. Have you tried the Lancome Lip Lover yet? Are you a fan of these lip products? To be honest, I don’t think these comparable nor better than Dior Addict Fluid Sticks. I’d consider them totally different products. I think Lip Lover will appeal more to those who like the feel of wearing lipgloss but who want a little more colour. Fluid Sticks will appeal more to those who want more intense colour. They’re different but I can’t say I’m a huge fan of either LOL! ?

I prefer using the actual solid bullet form. There’s something just more adult, or even sexier, applying lipstick from the bullet. That, and texture, is why I never really warmed to wearing lip gloss. Then a few years ago, we saw liquid lipstick appear on the scene. All the opacity and strength of colour of a lipstick, in a liquid form. I never took to it. Sure, there were the odd ones I liked, but they don’t turn my head the way a regular lipstick would. In my mind, they were always, almost like a beginner lipstick; or even a transition product, for those who prefer lip gloss, to ease their way into wearing lipsticks. So I was rather surprised to see that the Estee Lauder Pure Envy Color lipstick stable now sports the Liquid Lip Potion , a liquid lipstick. It has been available since August, I believe, but I’ve taken a while to decide how I feel about it, or if my prejudices against liquid lip products would rear its ugly head. The Pure Envy Color Liquid Lip Potion is a liquid lipstick. Imagine, if you will, a lipstick melted into a liquid form which you then apply with a doe foot applicator, very much like a lip gloss. You get all the pigment of a lipstick, in the form of a liquid. Now, if I’m to be honest, I don’t get why Estee Lauder needed this product. They already have an excellent range of Pure Color Envy and Pure Color Envy Shine lipsticks. Both are lightweight in texture, comfortable to wear and have good colour pay off, or shine as the case may be. I wasn’t quite sure where the Liquid Lip Potion fit; and that pretty much sums up how I feel – confused. The packaging of the Liquid Lip Potion is a little taller than the regular lipsticks, and it comes with a window in the side to show you the colour of the product. Helpful. The applicator is a sponge-tipped doe foot applicator, that pretty much reminds me of that used for lip glosses. There is a dip in the middle, so the wand picks up a lot of colour. I suggest you clean it along the side of the tube before applying to lips, because as you will see below, it is very strong. And it is also very liquid. Estee Lauder Pure Color Envy Liquid Lip Potion – Cold Fire This is just 1 swipe with the wand and you can see just how opaque and pigmented the colour is. I like that in a lip product. It isn’t goopy and the texture of the Liquid Lip Potion is light on lips. It isn’t very glossy either, and to me, has a satin finish, so it doesn’t quite look like a lip gloss either. Confused? Yes, so was I. As comfortable as it is to wear (it isn’t drying either, although I’d not recommend it for anyone with flaky lips) I find it messy. Yes, you read it right. It’s messy to apply, the liquid gets everywhere. And because it’s so pigmented, you can’t make mistakes with it. Oh and it offers a bit of a stain as well, so get it on anywhere else other than your lips, and you will sport a stain until the next time you shower. I do wonder if my prejudices might stem a little as well, from the shade I was sent. The shade you see here is Cold Fire, which is a very striking coral red. On me, it actually pulls a little orange, although you will see in the picture below, that it looks a bit more red. It’s a bit of a shade shifter, this one, but there’s no denying that it’s BRIGHT! In person, it’s almost neon. Yet you know what? It doesn’t last very long for me. I don’t know, it’s weird! It marks coffee cups something awful so it looks like I’ve bled all over them in the morning, but I find that the regular Pure Color Envy lipsticks aren’t as bad. And they last longer on me. Also, if you peer a little at my teeth in the picture above, and are tsking at me for not picking a picture where I didn’t have lipstick on my teeth, don’t. I left it in there on purpose, because there’s another strange thing about this lipstick that bugs me. For some reason, due to the “wet” texture, I found that it would mark my teeth something awful! I rarely have lip products get on my teeth, but this does. All. The. Time! You have see it in the picture above, and if you watch the video below (Episode 3 of MWStv, complete with bloopers! Woot! ? ) where I’m wearing Cold Fire (and you can see it in action), I actually had to restart filming 3 times because I kept getting lipstick on my teeth! The only way I solved the problem, was to blot with a piece of tissue paper, and then I was fine. So yeah, I know this has beautiful colour pay off and a comfortable texture, but it doesn’t appeal to me. It is to be reminded that I prefer my lipstick to come in a bullet, which I find infinitely easier to apply and reapply, sometimes even with 1 hand, than to use a liquid lipstick, which requires 2. Also, I’m no fan of lip glosses, so it will also go some ways towards explaining my prejudice. It isn’t a bad product. It just isn’t me ? IN A NUTSHELL The Estee Lauder Pure Color Envy Liquid Lip Potion is a liquid lipstick that is very pigmented, with bold shades. The texture is very lightweight and comfortable to wear, although you cannot have flaky or dry lips or it might accentuate flakes and lines. The colour is very bold and strong, and it offers a subtle stain. But all said and done, this isn’t a product that appeals to me because I prefer my lipstick to come in a bullet. But if you want a strong opaque and pigmented lip colour, then consider taking a look at this, if you are transitioning from wearing lip glosses. I would otherwise suggest that you consider the Pure Color Envy instead ? PROS: Lightweight texture is comfortable on lips, Not drying, Strong and bold shades, Opaque texture in 1 swipe CONS: Travels easily to mark teeth, Needs to be fairly precise due to the strength of colour and opacity WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes using liquid lipstick, Anyone who wants a strong and bold colour in a lipstick One more small point, which I consider to be a bit of a packaging flaw. The brand name is printed on the top of the cover, on the gold bit, like the rest of their lipstick line. However, there is nothing else on the body to indicate the brand. The regular lipstick bullets will display the Estee Lauder name on the gold tube, but with this one, the branding is I feel a little lacking. I personally feel, instead of the window, they should have just gone with a clear base. For some reason, those tend to look better for liquid products, as most other brands have demonstrated. Have you tried the Liquid Lip Potion? Do you like wearing liquid lipstick or regular bullets? I wonder if I might be more forgiving, were it a different shade. It’s hard to say. But at this point in time, I’m just not into liquid lip products and I’ve got rid of most of what I used to own because I just don’t wear them as often as I should. As a product, I think this is a good one. But because I’m so fussy, and because I have lots of basis for comparison, I am just too nitpicky ? But if you like this, let me know!

Some of you may remember I disliked them. Oh yeah. About the only one in the world who did haha! Perhaps my expectations were too built up then. But I was taken unawares when I first heard about and received the Gloss in Love lipglosses so my mind was a little more open. There are 12 shades available in highly shimmery and glittery textures (Edit: I stand corrected by Tracy! There are shades WITHOUT shimmer and glitter). The one I have here is #144 Glittermania . Oh yeah. It was! ? Those who have an aversion to glitter and shimmer in lip products will likely shy away in horror. The shimmer is not for the faint-hearted! But believe me, if you just take that one step forward and leave an open mind, it might just surprise you at how pretty it can be! I know, PB liking a lipgloss. Will wonders never cease ? The thing I found most interesting in the Lancome Gloss in Love is actually the packaging. Caps of regular lipglosses twist off. Lancome’s clicks off. See that square button in the picture? Depress is and the cap pops out. Actually, if you just pull on the cap a little harder than normal, it pops off too. So, while I do appreciate the novelty factor Lancome is going for, I wasn’t happy with the packaging. I can anticipate all sorts of handbag disasters if you aren’t careful and have this one rolling about in your bag. You might just end up putting your hand in and having it come out covered with glittery lipgloss one day. When I do carry this one about, it goes into a makeup pouch. This way, any potential problems are minimized. It NEVER gets tossed into a bag just like that. Horrors ? Another interesting thing about Gloss in Love is the applicator. It is a sponge type applicator, but see how it curves? That curve, when you flip it over as on the right, will hold a lot of product in there, a little like a reservoir. So it does make it easy to apply and the applicator is firm enough so you can shape your lips and yet the shape allows you to run it quite comfortably over the shape of your lips. For this, they get top points. So far, for packaging, its a draw – crappy cap packaging that can lead to a potential handbag disaster but saved by a good applicator. How does the colour and texture perform then? Lancome Gloss in Love #144 Glittermania Swatch 1x This might be where it all comes together. #144 Glittermania is a bright coral shot through with loads of golden shimmer as you can see from the swatch on my arm. This is just 1 layer so you can see just how opaque it can go. It sheers out quite nicely as well and despite the dense glitter, I did not find it looked too shiny on lips. The texture of the gloss is slightly thick but not too sticky. Your lips won’t be glued together, but the tackiness helps the colour stay on longer and better. I can actually wear this gloss all through a morning with it looking pretty good till lunch, which says a lot because I drink a lot of liquids. The colour is an orange shot through with pink which I find very flattering on most skintones. If you’re going to wear a gloss, eschew the regular pinks that barely show up on lips. Go instead for something fun and bold. Its just makeup – it’ll wash off ? See, its not that bold an orange right? It is a surprisingly flattering colour and while the sun is out and coral lips are in, its the perfect shade for some Summer lovin’ ? The shimmer in there could put people off, but I say, live a little and have a little fun. Sometimes, you just have to wear a little glitter and go a little manical ? In a nutshell The Lancome Gloss in Love lipglosses are highly glossy and shimmery lipglosses. The texture is a little thick and glossy but isn’t very tacky. Glittermania is a lovely orange-pink that is surprisingly opaque and pigmented for a lipgloss and the shimmer doesn’t look too overdone even when worn in the day. Its a very complexion brightening colour that is quite possibly flattering for most. I find it very long lasting for at least 4 hours or more which is very impressive for a lipgloss. Not a fan of the packaging, but the formula is a good one. Definitely worth taking a look at if you can get over the packaging. Pros: Glossy and not tacky or sticky texture, Shimmer gives a lip plumping effect, Long lasting and surprisingly opaque colour, Not drying Cons: Cap packaging is a recipe for disaster, Too much shimmer can put off some people Who will like this: Anyone who likes lipglosses with lots of shimmer in them Glittermania is a colour I’d wear alone. Its very pretty on its own and I think loses a lot of its magic once you layer it over a lipstick base. I have been wearing this one quite regularly which surprises me because I have such set ideas about the lipglosses I like and these wouldn’t have made the cut. The lack of scent most certainly helps as does the pretty colour. But I am surprised and pleasantly so! Have you checked out the Gloss in Love lipglosses? Would Glittermania be a colour you’d wear? I don’t think I’d check out the other colours in the range though. After this lovely coral, everything else seems to pale in comparison. Oh but I think I might have worked out why wearing lipgloss is now a relatively painless affair for me. My hair is far too short to get stuck to my face when the wind blows! HAHA! ?

Yes, I burn Diptyque and while I do so because I enjoy the scents , I am aware that they are incredibly expensive. I’ve had people tell me I might as well just set some bank notes alight; which is true in a sense, except that a) burning bank notes don’t give off a lovely scent and b) they don’t last as long ? But recently, surrounded as I am with my trappings of luxury, I’ve found myself reaching more and more often for an affordably priced candle, that does a lovely job of scenting my living room and doesn’t cost me an arm and a leg (nor provoke discussions of burning banknotes). The candles in question are the Mrs. Meyer’s Clean Day Soy Candles , and I can’t remember now who sicced me onto them (I think it was someone on Twitter – thank you!) but I picked up a couple from iHerb and I love them! Hey, for under RM40, what’s there not to love eh? ? The only problem I can find with these candles is that they are pretty heavy, so shipping them here can cost a pretty penny. Singapore seems to get better iHerb shipping deals so if you have friends or family there, and aren’t in a hurry to get your items, it’s worth considering sending your packages there. So I don’t ship a whole bunch of Mrs. Meyer’s candles, I just order 1 each time, and then pad other purchases around it to make up the regular airmail shipping. Unless DHL is on offer, I don’t pick DHL because it’s so much more expensive. But coming back to the candles ? The Mrs. Meyer’s Clean Day candles are soy candles that come in a jar with a screw on cap. It isn’t pretty the way many candles are, but it is practical, because the cap helps keep the scent better and after you’re done with your candle, you could use the jars for keeping other serviceable things in the kitchen, especially if you’ve rinsed it out well. What I like about these candles is how strong the throw of scent is. It very easily scents my whole living room where I place them, without any effort at all! Most of my luxury candles struggle to fill this space with scent, which often disappoints me. One jar can also last a fairly long while – a 35 hours claim. I find that the soy candles melt quite quickly so it results in an even burn without my having to burn it for too long. I haven’t had any issues with the Mrs. Meyer’s candles so far in terms of uneven burn and that again, is something to commend because one or two of my luxury candles have that problem. I have 3 scents so far:- Geranium – Strong, if you like the scent of geranium, and very soothing. It scents the whole house quite quickly and I often burn it for about an hour and then blow it out. The scent remains thereafter. Lavender – Not my favourite. The lavender scent smells artificial so it’ll be quite a chore to use this one up. Iowa Pine – A seasonal candle which was a gift from Tine . It has a lovely warm, spicy pine scent and immediately makes you think of Christmas. There are another 2 permanent scents – Basil and Lemon Verbena, which I’ll probably get the next time I do an iHerb order. However I do have one more comment. The candles don’t seem to burn all the way so there is about 1cm of wax left that I can’t get to, because the wick doesn’t go all the way down. You can see it in the Geranium jar above. There’s still quite a lot of wax down there, but I can’t get it to burn. It’s quite a waste because I love the scent so if you have ideas on how I can deal with it, please let me know! IN A NUTSHELL The Mrs. Meyer’s Clean Day Soy Candles are affordable natural soy candles that come in fairly natural smelling scents. I like how they burn evenly and give off a good scent throw so a fairly small jar scents a large room quite easily. The scents I have smell good, to me. They smell clean and refresh the air of the room. I’d pick up more of these any day, except that they come in glass jars so it is quite heavy to ship. PROS: Good scent throw, Clean and natural scents, CONS: Heavy to ship overseas, The wick doesn’t go all the way to the base of the candle so there is a lot of wax at the bottom that can’t be melted WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who enjoys burning scented candles, Anyone who wants an affordable scented candle that smells natural with a good scent throw Have you tried Mrs. Meyer’s Soy candles? I like how affordable they are, and I wish it was easier to get hold of them where I am. So if you are in the US, really, you have no excuse not to ?

But as they say, better late than never! After all, it’s a permanent item so there’s no LE rush *whew!* On a side note, I’m starting to move away from LE products. I’ll expound on my theory in a separate post but am just throwing the idea out there because I’ve been so consistently disappointed lately, I’m planning to just stick with the tried and true permanent items with few exceptions. Now that’s off my chest, let’s talk lipstick! ? Estee Lauder has a new lipstick range! After I had given it a good ol’ rave on IG, I was made to realise that Asia gets a whole different range of Pure Color Envy Sculpting lipsticks! What’s this obsession with segregating the world into Asia exclusive and non-Asia exclusives eh? ? That aside, the one we get is the Pure Color Envy SHINE Sculpting Lipstick which is supposed to have a lighter, sheerer formula with a shine, as compared to the regular range available in the rest of the world. Not having seen the other one I will reserve comment, but I will tell you that I FREAKING LOVE THESE! Ahem, yes I’ll get a grip of myself now ? Despite it being supposedly sheerer, I wouldn’t pay too much heed to that. The colour I have is Blossom Bright 250 which is a lovely bright yet soft pink-berry that is opaque in one swipe. Yep, just one swipe. Let me demonstrate. Estee Lauder Pure Color Envy Shine Sculpting Lipstick Blossom Bright 250 Left: 1 swipe Right: 3 swipes from tube Can you tell the difference? Nope, me neither. I love how the colour is pretty much opaque with just 1 swipe straight from the tube and it’s a beautiful colour to boot! There is no tugging and the lightweight formula quite literally glides over lips leaving a beautiful pigmented coat of colour with some shine (but not gaudy shimmer or glitter). It hugs your lips without once feeling drying or heavy or uncomfortable and I must say, I was impressed the moment it touched my lips. I did like the previous versions of Pure Color lipsticks which you see in the picture but I know people often find the texture heavy and there is always that signature Fig scent that can be off-putting. I don’t mind it on some days but I mind terribly on other days so I don’t get a lot of wear from them. So imagine how happy I was when I took the Pure Color Envy Shine lipstick up close to my nose, took a healthy sniff (it’s ok, I don’t share my lipsticks so my cooties are my own) and discovered NO SCENT! Not a hint of perfume or fig or berry or rose. Hallelujah! For this reason alone, combined with the gorgeous formula, I’m calling a buy on this beauty! And that’s even before I wax lyrical about the packaging. The new Pure Color Envy Shine lipsticks come in a terribly sleek and hefty navy blue case with a gold coloured tip at the cap. There is absolutely nothing on the body that says what brand it is. The only hint you get is the name embossed in the top of the cap. The cap closes with a magnet which is terribly modern, but I was just so impressed with the sleek silhouette and luxe case that is a significant shift away from the previous gaudy gold and plastic packaging. I love it. Have I said that already? ? When I mentioned the lovely texture of the lipstick and how smitten I was with it, a friend on IG noted that Estee Lauder owns Tom Ford, which is lauded for their lipsticks and that had me thinking that maybe, just maybe, some of the technology and influence had rubbed off on the mother brand. For sure, this new Pure Color Envy Shine lipstick range is stunning and I’m already plotting to get more. I haven’t been this excited about an Estee Lauder lipstick in years. Or ever ? So after all that rather incoherent raving and flapping my hands about, here’s what Blossom Bright looks like when I wear it. Blossom Bright is a very lovely skintone brightening colour that isn’t as in your face as a red lipstick yet is bright enough to draw attention. I’ve just applied 1 layer straight from the bullet and I just love how it goes on and how it looks and how well it wears. I have no problem with it fading and I wear it for hours from the morning till lunchtime when I will usually wipe everything off and start over. So that’s a good 5 hours at least. I can’t think of anything bad to say about this lipstick so if you find a colour you like, get it. I can almost promise you, you won’t regret it… and you might even want another, like I do ? In a nutshell The Estee Lauder Pure Color Envy Shine Sculpting lipstick is a new range of lipsticks that is exclusive to Asia. Outside of Asia, it is the non-shine version. The texture is lovely being at once lightweight yet creamy and not drying yet pigmented and opaque in one swipe. I do not find this one sheer at all, which is good news for me but bad news for those who prefer sheer lip colours. There is a shine which is very flattering but it isn’t over the top so it works well in conservative working environments. The colour I have, Blossom Bright 250, is a very flattering colour and one I feel will flatter many, and especially will attract those who prefer brighter lip colours. It isn’t too bright and is just right. The packaging is sleek and the cap closes with a magnet and I find it very elegant and luxurious. I’ve nothing bad to say, only good things so I’ll stop here. Get one! Pros: No scent, Pigmented, Opaque in 1 swipe, Soft shine on lips, Lightweight yet creamy texture, Not drying, Longlasting for at least 5 hours Cons: None Who will like this: Anyone who likes pigmented, opaque, creamy lip colours with some shine, Anyone who likes unscented lipsticks I might even say that these lipsticks remind me of the Rouge Dior and feels like a mash up between Rouge Dior and Dior Addict. Next to Tom Ford regular lipsticks, these aren’t as hard but feel impressively comfortable so I’d even pick this because TF lipsticks have a scent haha! At this moment, you could say that these can do no wrong so I’ll pick this as my favourite lipstick du jour because it hits all the right spots for me. My next problem is getting more. Yes, I’m obsessive that way ? Have you tried the Pure Color Envy Shine lipsticks and have a favourite colour? If you’re outside of Asia, have you tried the Pure Color Envy lipsticks and do you like them? I can’t compare the two formulas as I don’t have access to the non-shine version, but I was told those have a scent so I’m already feeling a bit iffy about them. That said, I’m not going to prejudge, so if I have access, I’ll get one to compare but for now, if you can get the Pure Color Envy Shine lipsticks, do. I love them and if you have a favourite colour, let me know – I might like it too! ?

Estee Lauder lipsticks and I go way back… back to the days of Tea Rose – because it was in every GWP I ever received! haha! If you too remember using that, please holler! But even as I was raving about Pure Color Envy Shine, our friends in the other half of the world looked at me in a little puzzlement. They didn’t get any shine lipstick, what they got was Pure Color Envy. I read that it was a beautifully creamy formula with lovely bright colours. Naturally I wanted what I couldn’t have. Don’t we all? However, early this year, Estee Lauder finally brought in the Pure Colour Envy Sculpting lipsticks and I finally understood why these come highly raved. They are fabulous lipsticks, if you like creamy, pigmented, opaque lipsticks that come in lovely packaging. I have 3 shades and I wouldn’t say that any of them have any shine or gloss to them, but they aren’t matte either. They are… adult lipsticks. I know, that sounds weird, but this isn’t a lipstick you’d buy if you were younger, I feel because you’d still be put off by the more mature vibe that Estee Lauder and the texture of these lipsticks give off. I know, I’ve been there. When I was younger, I’d go “Estee Lauder? That’s for aunties!” Now that I’m an aunty, I buy Estee Lauder – don’t judge me LOL ? But before I finished up the tube of Rebellious Rose that you see in the foreground of the picture above, I thought I’d better tell you why I like these ? Well, the main reason I like these is because of the opacity and creamy texture. I like sheer lipsticks, the way the Japanese brands do them , but when I want a punchy lip colour, I have to turn to an opaque and pigmented texture. For these, I like a lipstick that will swipe on opaque in one swipe, and not dry my lips out. A couple of personal favourite creamy lipstick textures are from Guerlain Rouge G and Tom Ford. So, when I tried these Pure Color Envy lipsticks, I had a moment. It felt like I was using a lipstick like a Rouge G or a Tom Ford, except it didn’t carry a similar wallet-busting price tag. The Pure Color Envy lipsticks are creamy with strong pigment so the colour in the tube applies pretty much as it looks on the lips. I also find that because it’s so pigmented, the colour of your lips doesn’t really affect how it looks the way it can a sheer lipstick. The packaging is similar to that of the Pure Color Envy Shine – a sleek and sturdy dark blue case with a cover that holds shut with a magnet. The Pure Color Envy Shine lipsticks have a blunt, flat top, while the Pure Color Envy ones have the traditional slanted bullet. They slick on lips like butter, spreading very easily and going on opaque with just 1 swipe. It is also comfortable to wear and not drying for me at all. I thoroughly enjoy wearing these but for one little niggling thing – scent. There is no scent. Not in a true sense. It doesn’t have that strong fig scent that has infused Estee Lauder lipsticks since time immemorial, but it has a faint, sweet scent with an underlying waxy ‘lipstick’ smell. I found that the waxy scent seemed more pronounced in 2 of the shades I own, while it was much fainter in the other. It isn’t awful but it’s there and it cements this as a bit of an ‘aunty’ lipstick ? I was sent 3 shades over time – Rebellious Rose, Envious and Dominant and it was opportune that they were from 3 different colour families so you have an idea of the sort of colours and opacity I mean. Each of the swatches were done with just 1 swipe down my arm and on lips, which I think gives you an idea of the sort of opacity and pigment in these creamy bullets. They are incredibly easy to wear and flattering. There isn’t any shine, although it isn’t a flat matte. I’d just call these a creamy texture, with the attendant shine that comes with cream, and leave it at that. Rebellious Rose – This is a lipstick I have in my daily wear pouch that I pull out whenever I need a touch up, or when I want a lip colour that is an everyday colour, which doesn’t stand out too much. It is a bit of a muted rose and a very work-friendly colour. No fear of standing out with this one! I’m also about halfway through this, because I use it so often. Envious – This one’s a straight red. Just look at it! Not one for the faint-hearted, but if you love red lipstick or are bold, check this one out. I promise you, you’ll make people envious because they’d wish they were wearing this, or dare to! Dominant – This one had the lightest scent of the 3 lipsticks I have. I was a little hesitant to wear this one, as this sort of fuchsia pink isn’t quite me. But it turned out to look a little less fuchsia and a little more red on me, which I appreciated. But you have to like bold colours to wear this one too! If sheer lipstick isn’t your thing, then you might like these. They are easy to wear, not drying, creamy and have beautiful shades available. The only thing I’d caution you about is the scent. IN A NUTSHELL The Estee Lauder Pure Color Envy Sculpting lipsticks come highly raved worldwide and rightfully so. The beautifully packaged deep blue and gold tubes hold a bullet of creamy and pigmented lipstick that is opaque in just 1 swipe. The colours are intense and bold and quite true to what you get in the tube. I find these very comfortable to wear but I must note a slight waxy ‘lipstick’ scent which can put people off. But if it doesn’t bug you, there are some beautiful colours to explore in this range of excellent quality lipsticks at about half the price of their more luxurious contemporaries. PROS: Creamy texture that does not travel, Opaque in 1 swipe, Pigmented and intense colours, Longlasting, Not drying, Elegant packaging CONS: Slight waxy scent can be off putting, Colours look a little muted and not very exciting but translates better when swatched WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes creamy, pigmented and opaque lipstick with strong colour The nice thing about these is that despite it being a creamy lipstick, I find they last a nice long time and they fade quite nicely without leaving a dreaded ring of colour. I usually can take it from morning till about lunch time with no problems or fading. After lunch, if I just blot (and don’t eat oily or messy food, or eat messily – yes it happens!) then I get a nice muted tint of colour that continues on to the afternoon. Sometimes, I just top up with a sheer, glossy lipstick. I carry a ton of lipstick with me daily so my lip colours never look the same throughout the day LOL! ? Have you tried these Pure Color Envy lipsticks and have a colour you like? Do you like creamy lipsticks? Not many people like creamy lipsticks, from my experience. A lot of people associate creamy lipsticks with heavy, waxy 80’s style textures, but rest assured, technology has caught up and things have improved a lot in the lipstick department! I like creamy colours for days when I want to look more polished and more “adult”. Otherwise, I go sheer and glossy for a younger feel ?

I’d picked it as one of my Top 8 Liquid Foundations , which is no mean feat, considering I have quite a few in rotation. I’ll remedy this soon (I hope!) I keep saying it but I really should just buckle down and get to it instead of just saying it eh? ? When I first heard that Urban Decay was coming up with a concealer in the same formula, I have to say I was interested. While I have my holy grail concealer that I’d already repurchased , I’m quite a sucker for concealer. I use a very light foundation base most of the time, so concealer is what I use and need, to help hide flaws that my foundation can’t deal with. I usually use them around my under-eye area (bad nights – what can I say?!) and along my cheekbones where my pigmentation/freckles are at their worst. So far, I’ve eschewed all concealer for my HG product. But then one day, the Urban Decay Naked Skin Weightless Complete Coverage Concealer landed on my desk, and I got curious. What if I liked this as much as I like their Naked Skin Foundation? What if this was my new Holy Grail? (Women, we’re fickle!) Well, there was only one way to find out! ? The first thing I noticed about the Naked Skin Concealer is that it’s very lightweight, but creamy in texture. It actually feels creamier than the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, and is more liquid. The wand is a flat, flexible sponge tip, that actually picks up far too much product each time. I highly suggest wiping it down the edge of the tube after you pull it out, or you will end up using too much product. And that’s the primary problem I have with the Urban Decay Naked Skin Concealer. Because it’s so creamy and because the wand can deposit too much product on your skin, it is very easy to overdo the concealer. Have you ever seen what an overdone concealer is like? It’s like a reverse panda you know, where the area around your eyes look lighter than the rest of your face. It’s about as awkward looking as having dark eye circles. The trick for me therefore, is to wipe down the wand on the edge of the tube, dab 2 dots of product (One on the inner part of the under-eye area, one on the outer part) and then use my fingers or a brush to blend it out. When done right, this Naked Skin Concealer is perfect. It conceals the redness and darkness under my eyes, it gives me a brighter countenance, and makes me look less tired almost immediately. However, for me, I find that it’s what its best for – an under-eye concealer. It does not offer full coverage as the name of the product implies. It is rubbish on blemishes and only average to cover pigmentation/freckles. The shade I have is Fair (Neutral) which is the lightest shade available. Lily at Chloeash has a swatch of Light (Warm) which is the next shade up. I’m not going to show you other concealers, because I don’t wear any others. Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer is my HG remember? I threw out all others ? Fair (Neutral) is a pretty light tone. On my skin at first instance, it looked a bit too light. In fact, a few bloggers I’ve come across mention that they pick this shade to use as a highlight shade (useful for anyone who’s into the sculpted, contoured look) For me however, Fair (Neutral) once blended out, fits my skintone quite perfectly. Next to Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer in Vanilla, which is also my shade, you will note that Vanilla has a slightly more pink tone as compared to the yellow tone of the UD Naked Fair (Neutral). You may also notice the difference in texture. The Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer has a slightly thicker texture, while the UD one is noticeably more liquid. Both adhere well to my skin without sinking into fine lines around the eye area, but I find that Nars gives me an edge. I find that it makes my skin look more radiant and natural, than the UD one which dries semi-matte and which I feel, makes my skin look a little flat. (I wanted to show you how it looks when I wear it, but I botched up my photos so one day I’ll update it) Both are pretty weightless on the skin, and for the under eye area, both do a fairly good job. But if you want to use a concealer for everything that needs concealing (like I do – I don’t like messing about with more than 1 product in its category, if necessary) then I’d pick the Nars one. It does a better job at blurring and obscuring blemishes, and it does this wonderful illusion trick with my freckles that hide them from view when my foundation isn’t up to doing the job on its own. With the UD, I find it wanting in both these departments. IN A NUTSHELL The Urban Decay Naked Skin Concealer is a lightweight, creamy concealer that claims to offer complete coverage. While I agree that it is weightless and does a good job at concealing around the under-eye area, I do find it wanting when I have to conceal blemishes or pigmentation/freckles. The texture is creamy and lightweight, and the wand included picks up a lot of product, so do be warned. Thin layers or just 2 tiny dots on the under-eye area is more than sufficient to conceal any redness or discolouration. I use a brush or my fingers, depending on how I feel. Both work fine. Fair (Neutral) is a good match for my skintone when blended, but I do find that it doesn’t offer a lot of radiance, and in fact, can look a little flat. It’s a pretty decent concealer and a little goes a long way, but it doesn’t do enough to unseat my Holy Grail Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer ? PROS: Lightweight on skin, Dries to a semi-matte natural finish, Conceals redness and discoloration well especially around the under-eye area, Creamy texture means that a very little goes a very long way CONS: Pricey, Does not work well to conceal blemishes, Wand picks up too much product each time WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who is looking for an under-eye concealer, Anyone who prefers a lightweight formula with decent coverage If you are looking at the prices, then there’s little to separate the 2 as they are very close in price. Well, almost anyway. Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer is RM100/US$29 for 6.5ml and the Urban Decay Naked Skin Concealer is RM105/US$28 for 5ml (based on last known prices) Ok, quick math tells me that at those prices, the Nars works out cheaper locally so, yep, my HG remains quite firmly seated at the top of its pedestal ? Have you tried this Urban Decay Naked Skin Concealer? Do you have a HG Concealer? I do like this for the under eye area, especially on days when I’m really really lazy to put foundation on, and think I’m ready to face the world anyway, except that I look like a panda. So, I dab some of this on, blend it out, look human and run out the door. Good for weekends ? But for everything else, NARS is my pick ?

Despite how it might look, I don’t buy a lot of stuff from Sephora. For some reason, I get terribly disoriented and confused when I enter a Sephora store, and I usually walk out without a bag. But I ended up by the Caudalie shelf and my eye fell on a range of masks. I think they’re new? At least I’ve seen them being touted around. There are 4 different masks for 4 different concerns, and I decided to pick one up. RM115 a tube. It was a little pricey but not terribly so. The one I picked was the Caudalie Glycolic Peel Mask which promises radiance in 10 minutes. Ah, instant claims! The sceptic in me just had to see if it was true ? What Caudalie tells us this will do is to renew skin texture, tighten pores, lighten dark spots, reduce oil, provide an immediate burst of radiance to the skin… without irritating the skin! Is there anything this mask can’t do?! But the main reason I got it was because it said it was a Glycolic Peel Mask and I like the whole glycolic acid thing. The mask is a cream mask that comes in a tube and squeezes out a white cream. Can I just pause for a moment to say that I happened to also like the wood-effect cap against the mint green tube? For some reason that slightly rustic aesthetic appeals to me ? Glycolic acid has been used for ages as a chemical peel and as a chemical exfoliant for skin and I’m a loyal user of Alpha H Liquid Gold so I knew all about its benefits. The thing of course, is that I don’t know what sort of percentage of glycolic acid is in this mask. I don’t think it’s very high if I’m to be honest, because I do feel it to be fairly mild. But Caudalie were right about this not being irritating, because it isn’t. That said, I am less sensitive than a lot of people when it comes to things involving acid so perhaps I’m not your best gauge. If you have very sensitive skin, do a patch test first. Don’t be like me and slap on a thick layer of mask and hope for the best – this is best left to the professional guinea pigs ? How to use the mask is simple. Put on a thickish layer of product all over and lie down and relax. I felt nothing, but those with sensitive skin might feel a bit of a tingle. The instructions say 10 minutes, but I usually have it on for longer. Sometimes, I watch a whole episode of a TV series which is about 40 minutes and then head off to wash it off. My face hasn’t fallen off yet ? Incidentally, the 10 minute claim does work. I tried leaving it on for just 10 minutes (Yes, I timed myself) and it does leave my skin feeling just as clean and soft and smooth and refreshed as when I leave it on for longer. Does my skin also look more radiant in 10 minutes? To a degree, yes. It looks calmer and brighter so it’s nice to use this just immediately before a big event, like a fancy dinner or party. You can then crash after that LOL! ? The nice thing is that this cream mask is easy to wash off. I hate using masks that don’t wash off properly. But this one rinses off with water, turning into a light texture like a face wash, and leaves skin feeling lovely, smooth, soft and clean. I experience no irritation but I didn’t quite like the sweet smell which is supposed to be the grape seed extract that’s infused in all Caudalie products. I find it a bit too sweet for my tastes, but then scent is a personal thing. After use, I do experience softer, clearer, smoother skin which is very nice. But does it last? It’s debatable. If you use this mask regularly (2-3 times a week) then you might notice a difference to your skin. It feels smoother, any acne or pimple spots fade more quickly and skin looks and feels less congested. If you use it once a week, you may notice a difference almost immediately, but it doesn’t last past a day or two. Naturally, this also depends on the condition of your skin. If you’ve never used a peeling product before then you may notice more pronounced effects and if you’re used to using these sort of products then you may find it too mild or that there is no effect. However, if you are also using other peeling products or glycolic acid products, be careful and don’t use this one too regularly or together with other peeling products. You don’t want to over-exfoliate your skin which can irritate it. While this one doesn’t feel drying on skin, I do also recommend that you follow up with a hydrating skincare routine thereafter just to calm things down and prevent any dryness you may feel. I think this pretty decent and if you get it during the Sephora 20% off sales, then it’s a good buy. Don’t expect a miracle, because I do think it a bit mild since it is a home-use product after all. But then it also means you are less likely to burn your skin and have your face fall off. A good thing, I can assure you ? IN A NUTSHELL The Caudalie Glycolic Peel Mask is a mild, non-irritating cream mask that you apply and leave on skin before rinsing off with water. It rinses off very easily without leaving residue on skin. I experience no irritation using this product and I can attest to smoother, clearer, softer skin almost immediately. The effects last a day or two depending on the condition of your skin. I’m quite happy with it except for the sweet scent which I’m a little put off by. But as a gentle chemical peel mask, I think it’s a decent product for the price. PROS: Easy to use and rinse off with water, Leaves skin feeling smoother, softer and more radiant almost immediately after use, Not irritating and non drying CONS: Sweet scent, Not very high concentration of glycolic acid so anyone used to using peeling or acid products may not notice much results WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a gentle at-home peel mask for softer, smoother and more radiant skin Here is the ingredient list for the Glycolic Peel Mask for your reference. Apologies for the blurry pic. Curved surfaces don’t photograph well apparently. TIP: I sometimes follow up this mask with a hydrating or rejuvenating sleeping mask or a face oil mask. I don’t know if Caudalie does one, but I like thinking that since my skin is all peeled, I can have all the benefits of my other masks seep in. Have you used this mask or any of the other Caudalie masks? Is there another I should try from this range? I was thinking about the Moisturising Mask but I’m not sure. If you’ve tried it or the Instant Detox mask, I’d love to hear your thoughts on them.

I do still like it a lot, but I think I might have found another to dethrone it from HG status. My, my. aren’t we fickle? ? Ladies and gents, I give you the RMK Gel Creamy Foundation (not as stated in the picture which amounts to the same thing but different ? ) I have owned this one for a while now when I bought it as a value set together with the foundation brush that you see in the picture. But it was only recently that I fully appreciated just what a great foundation this is, especially if you have slightly drier skin. I can’t tell you how this will fare if you have oily skin so it’s something you’ll have to find out for yourself, I’m afraid, although you may prefer the regular liquid foundation . But if you have normal to drier skin, you’ll love this! I do! ? RMK does excellent foundation bases. Before I really got into wearing foundations, I had come across lots of raves for the RMK Cream foundation but I soon realised that it was a bit heavy for me back then, and also in our tropical weather. But if you have dry skin then that would be the one you want to use. I used the regular RMK Liquid Foundation for a while and you know, it’s a good one, despite the lack of a pump and everything. It’s light and comfortable and evens out skintone very nicely. But then, I got wind of a foundation that came in a pump bottle and that was this Gel Creamy Foundation. It comes in plastic bottle with a handy pump and the texture is as the name implies, a creamy gel texture – halfway between a gel and a cream. It is very light and spreads easily yet feels like a cream to offer more coverage than the regular RMK liquid foundation. I wouldn’t peg this for a full coverage foundation though. It isn’t. I put it as light to medium coverage only so it does a wonderful job evening out your complexion and blurring any imperfections you may have but you will still need concealer to hide things like dark under eye circles or blemishes or pigmentation spots. But if you are comfortable with some imperfections showing through then you can easily apply this and go. I find that the texture lends itself to easy application with your fingers or with a brush. In fact, when RMK launched their Gel Creamy Foundation, they also introduced their foundation brush which is made of goat hair. RMK make up artists tout this brush as the best for applying liquid foundation because it applies liquid foundation well without streaking and offers a smooth, even finish. I like it but I do tend to use any brush I have on hand or even fingers because it’s just so easy to blend it into skin, like applying a moisturiser. Here’s how this foundation fares on me. I take it in shade No. 201 which is the lightest pink toned shade, 101 being too yellow for my liking. You may notice, as I have said, that the coverage isn’t full, but it evens out the skintone and tones down redness, and I’m comfortable with that. I usually dab on a touch of concealer or highlighter and I tend to finish off with the RMK Pressed Powder N or Guerlain Meteorites which usually gives me a better, smoother finish. But I also sometimes wear just the foundation and here’s the great thing – it lasts. The RMK Gel Creamy Foundation isn’t drying – quite the opposite. It makes my skin feel so much more comfortable as the day wears on which could be attributed to the hyaluronic acid it contains. It doesn’t turn oily at all and feels like I have nothing on. It’s well worth every pretty penny I paid ? Here are some swatch comparisons with other liquid foundations. (1) Kanebo Lunasol Skin Modelling Liquid Foundation OC-01 (2) RMK Gel Creamy Foundation No. 201 (3) RMK Liquid Foundation No. 201 (4) Shiseido Perfect Refining Foundation I00 Very Light Ivory (5) Diorskin Nude liquid foundation 010 Ivory In terms of texture, you may notice that the RMK Gel Creamy Foundation is thicker and more creamy than its predecessor, the RMK Liquid Foundation and also the Lunasol Skin Modelling Liquid Foundation. It is about as creamy as the Diorskin Nude foundation but less thick. Shade-wise, No. 201 in the Gel Creamy Foundation is a bit more pink and more brightening on the skin than the Liquid Foundation. It is less pink toned than the Diorskin Nude and next to the Lunasol Skin Modelling in OC-01 the difference in tone is significant. I do however wear all these shades quite comfortably. It only shows up differently when put next to each other. Everytime I wear a liquid foundation by a Japanese company, I wonder why I even bother trying other brands. Japanese base makeup never fails me and is, I dare say, the best that can be found out there. I won’t dethrone the Lunasol Skin Modelling Liquid Foundation from its HG status, but I will place the RMK Gel Creamy Foundation up there with it. It deserves full accolades and if I sound like I’m raving about it, yes I am. Quite justifiably so ? In a nutshell The RMK Gel Creamy Foundation comes in a pump bottle and has a very lovely light gel-cream texture that feels like you have nothing on your skin. The coverage is light-medium and it does an amazing job evening out skintone, covering redness and just giving you your skin, just better. It doesn’t turn oily, stays on all day comfortably, makes skin feel so comfortable especially if you have drier skin and is very easy to apply, even with fingers. Truly, this is among the best liquid foundations I’ve ever used and it has found its way to holy grail status for me. Pros: Packaging is portable and user-friendly, Longlasting, Does not dry skin, Easy to apply even with fingers, Evens out skintone and looks very natural on, Lightweight texture feels like nothing on, Does not turn oily at all Cons: Deeper skintones will have difficulty finding a colour match, Pricey Who will like this: Anyone with drier skintype, Anyone who wants a good lightweight liquid foundation I always say the Japanese do base makeup best. I’ve hardly ever been wrong about them so far and RMK is definitely among the best out there for base makeup even if I find their colour makeup a bit lacking. Absolutely worth taking a look. Have you tried this RMK Gel Creamy Foundation? Have you used other RMK foundations? This one has been out a while so I’m sure some of you have already used it. I’ve been told the Gel Emulsion compact which is a cream compact foundation is very good too. Might give that a go next time. What can I say? I’m a foundation junkie too! ?

Hmm… far be it for me to always be the Debbie Downer, the gel foundation did not make its way to my “most used foundation” list and now that I’ve given the Style Eye-Con No. 7 Plush Eyeshadow palette its chance over several uses, neither does it get a thumbs up from me. Sorry folks! Let’s cut to the chase. I am not wow-ed. Sure, we could wax lyrical about the packaging. The long slim palette is certainly different from other palettes we get out there. It is sleek, but sleekly impractical if you want to take it on your travels. Well, unless you have a large makeup bag which I don’t. I like to keep things compact when I travel. It comes sheathed in a pouch with a button to keep it closed. Again, something different from the velvet pouches we’re used to seeing from other luxury brands. But you know what? Velvet gives the impression of luxury. Polyester doesn’t. But I digress. Some people like it, I don’t because I don’t see the point. My final gripe with packaging comes hot on the heels of the sponge tip applicator that seems to have been tossed into the pouch almost as if it was an afterthought. It was like someone said “Oh we forgot to provide an applicator. Let’s just buy one of those cheap sponge things and toss it in. No one will notice” Seriously, Marc Jacobs, you would have been better off not including an applicator at all. The included one is a cheap and horrible item that you’d immediately bin and I did. Bah. Ok that said, the quality of the shadows aren’t too bad and that would be their redeeming point. I don’t have the very popular neutral Lolita palette but mine’s the rather more exciting looking The Vamp 208 palette. There are 7 good sized eyeshadows laid out in a row. If you use the burgundy shade as a mid-point, you may notice how the shades on the left are cool toned while the shades on the right have a warmer tone. The Vamp palette is therefore one of the more interesting palettes available in the collection as it will suit a variety of eyeshadow looks. I notice some fall out with the deep shades – the dark blue and black in particular tend to not stay put. The other shades seem to be of better quality. They are fairly smooth to the touch and soft, so colour is quite easily picked up. I did these swatches on my arm using my finger and just 1 swipe of colour (except for the dark blue-grey that took 2 swipes) so it is pretty well pigmented. Dark Blue-Grey : Satin texture with some silver glitter. It took 2 swipes to get it to this intensity and I experience fall out when using a brush. Shimmer medium-grey : A medium grey with shimmer and a warm base that was quite interesting. It can be used as a lid colour or as a highlight and is pretty wearable. Satin warm white : The colour with the poorest colour pay off. A brush kicks up a lot of powder and dust, but it does not translate into much on skin. Best use as a brow bone colour or to blend. Shimmer burgundy : The most interesting colour in the palette. Satin smooth, pigmented, intense and all with 1 swipe of the finger. I struggle using this colour but then I’m not very adventurous. Shimmer Emerald green : A colour I eyed up immediately as it’s been a long time since I wore emerald green on eyes. Like the burgundy, it is satin smooth, pigmented and intense. Shimmer Khaki Brown : A warm brown with shimmer that is like the burgundy and emerald green, smooth, intense and pigmented but prone to muddy on lids. Matte black with silver glitter : A normal black with silver glitter and has a tendency to generate fall out. The thing is this. While I get lovely swatches using my finger to swipe the product, I found that it did not quite translate to the same sort of loveliness and intensity when I used a brush. I use the MAC 239 to pick up colour and usually with this brush, I have little trouble packing the colour on. However, I found that while it picked up the colour well enough, I never got the same metallic intensity that I see in the pan and in my swatches. I also found that the colours, when blended together, had a tendency to look muddy, which was frustrating. However, I attribute that more to my skills as I’m not that great at doing my eye makeup. I keep things very simple and I found that I got the best results when using 2 colours max. 3 colours and I end up with a muddy looking eye. In this very simple eye, I applied the emerald green all over, using the khaki to blend and shade and on the lower lash line, with the silver as a touch of highlight over the green. It turns out a little less exciting than it looks in the swatch right? One more note – wear a primer with these shadows. I don’t wear primer on a daily basis but I usually have little to no trouble with most eyeshadows. There are exceptions of course, and this happens to be the exception. On my non-oily lids, these Marc Jacob eyeshadows fade after a few hours. The only other brand I’ve experienced this is with MAC shadows which means I’m a little less enamoured with this than most people. With a primer, you get slightly better intensity of colour and longer wear time. All said and done folks, I’m glad I had the chance to experience the Marc Jacobs Style Eye-Con eyeshadow palette, but I have no desire to get another, or to use this very much. It doesn’t live up to my expectations, and for the asking price of RM207 I’d top up a little more money and get myself a Guerlain Ecrin 6 couleurs eyeshadow palette . 6 shadows of beautiful, amazing quality that stays put and looks good all day. I wasn’t crazy about it initially, but I’ve since fallen in love with it. It’s not as exciting as the Marc Jacobs one, but it performs beautifully and that is ultimately what I want. Or I’d get a palette from Inglot for a smaller price tag or even MAC. I find them to be similar in quality anyway. In a nutshell The Marc Jacobs Style Eye-Con eyeshadow palette is a sleek, long eyeshadow palette that houses 7 shades. It comes in a pouch and a useless sponge tip applicator that should be binned. Based on the Vamp palette, I found the quality of the shadows average at best. They swatched well with fingers, but were less impressive when I use a brush. I also found that when blending, the colours tend to muddy but that could be attributed to my lack of skills. You could quite easily wear this palette in an adventurous manner, thanks to the burgundy and emerald shades, but you could just as easily wear it in a neutral manner as there are sufficient neutral shades in there. On my non-oily lids, I found that they faded after a few hours, a problem I don’t have with many brands. Using a primer helps with intensity and longevity. But I ultimately do not think this worth the asking price as I find it far too average in quality to merit the raves. Pros: Compact and sleek palette, Pigmented colours Cons: Dark colours were prone to fall out, Useless applicator included, Colours appear less intense on lid applied with a brush, Quality is average Who will like this: Fans of sleek and unique packaging, Anyone who regularly uses an eyelid primer Here’s one more thing. I found the quality of the shadows quite similar to that of Sleek Makeup palettes . I hate to say it but it does remind me of them. A lot. Sorry, fans ? Do you like the Marc Jacobs Style Eye-Con palettes? Has anything from MJB wowed you? I’m afraid I haven’t yet had my socks knocked off by anything from the brand. Perhaps it’s because I hold them to a very high standards, since they are setting very high prices. Perhaps I’m a little jaded. Perhaps it’s a little of both. I shall plod on with the brand, in search of something to like. Maybe you could tell me what you like? ? p/s To mark a personal milestone, this rather grinchy post marks Post #3000 here on MWS!

Guess what? It’s just only launched haha! ‘Tis also the season for newness ? If you have normal, combination or oily skin, good news! You can stop reading now because this isn’t targeted at you ? This is seriously targeted at those with dry or very dry skin. See, it says so in bold red “For drier skin types” and I can also tell you that it will be tempting to actually test this even if you don’t have dry skin, because the texture is so lovely and light! Such a departure from the heavy creams targeted at dry skin that we are used to. Remember when I shared my thoughts on dry skin and how I’d work to combat it? Some of you responded in the comments that you too had a dry skin problem and those of you who did, would have received a special email from me because Kiehl’s was going to send you a sample of this product for you to try out for yourself ? Commenting here at MWS pays dividends, I tell you ? But from a dry skinned gal, how did I find this cream? Well are you familiar with the popular Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream? It was taken up to Everest my mountain climbers and down to Antartica by polar explorers and people wax lyrical about how good it is for protecting the skin from intense cold and dry climates. I’ve tried it in a cold winter and I attest to its efficacy. It works well to protect the skin and keep it from drying out in cold harsh winter climes. But back here in tropical Malaysia, breakout city! It’s just too heavy, I couldn’t use it. In the local tropical climate, I much prefer the Ultra Facial Oil-Free Gel Cream which is lovely and light, hydrates my skin and doesn’t break me out. But it is now a tad too light for my drier skin. The Ultra Facial Cream Intense Hydration seems to be a bit of a hybrid of the two in terms of texture. I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that the cream isn’t as thick and as heavy as the original Ultra Facial Cream. It has a light texture and absorbs easily into the skin very quickly like the Ultra Facial Oil Free gel cream. In fact, because it’s so light, there is a temptation to use more of it, but don’t. A thin layer of this cream is quite sufficient to keep skin feeling comfortable and hydrated. I found it worked nicely especially if you have drier skin and are exposed to a lot of air-conditioning which dries out skin. It made skin feel very comfortable and I will attest to comfortably hydrated skin. However, I experienced some clogged pores after about a week of using this so I had to stop. If you do have dry or very dry skin or know someone who has, I do think this is quite a good one to try because of the light texture. I do find it a bit heavy for the day in our weather but for evenings and especially if you sleep in an air-conditioned room, it helps your skin feel so much more comfortable when you wake up. Do sample it however. Kiehl’s is usually very good with samples and this cream is new in stores so they should be able to let you have some so you can decide if it works for you or if it doesn’t. But remember, despite how tempting it is to give this a go because it feels so nice and light, it is targeted at dry and very dry skinned folks only. In a nutshell The new Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream Intense Hydration is targeted at people with dry to very dry skin types. The texture is surprisingly light for such an intense product and it absorbs quickly and easily into the skin without leaving much of a residue. Only very little is needed to keep skin feeling comfortable. I think this works best in colder, drier air or for those who have dry to very dry skin. I did experience some clogged pores while using this so I had to stop, but in main, my skin felt comfortable. Pros: Makes dry skin feel more comfortable, Light texture absorbs quickly into skin, Dry or flaky skin feels more hydrated and comfortable Cons: Clogged my pores a little, Nice texture but not suitable for anyone who doesn’t have quite chronically dry skin Who will like this: Anyone who has dry or very dry skin types, Anyone exposed to very dry and cold climates that dries out skin I’m afraid I don’t have the ingredient list but once I do, I’ll update! I can tell you that it contains glycerin, apricot kernal oil and hyaluronic acid as its key ingredients but the full list will have to come when I get it. Do you have dry or very dry skin and is this something that might interest you to try? If you were lucky enough to receive a sample of this product from Kiehl’s and I please do share your thoughts in the comments after you’ve had a chance to try it. You should be receiving it very soon. I’d love to know how it went for you ? If you didn’t receive a sample, try the Kiehl’s stores. They should be able to set you up with some ?

After that 3000-th post yesterday, I reckon you may be tired of just me rambling on and on eh? ? So today, I’d like to feature a guest review today of an iconic product from an iconic brand…. that I cannot use! For some unknown reason, every single version of the Shu Uemura cleansing oils break me out. I’ve tried them all, I promise. I break out every single time and I’ve chalked it up to being one of “those things”. I work well with many other brands of cleansing oils though so it’s not the oil nor the technique. It’s the product. So, when I was requested to give the Shu Uemura Porefinist Anti-Shine Fresh Cleansing Oil a go, I demurred. I no longer use cleansing oils but I was pressed into it so I decided to pass it on to a long time user for her evaluation. Porefinist is touted to be a very light textured blend of oils targeted at those with combination-oily skin, which not only cleans skin of makeup and oil but also minimizes the appearance of pores and reduces shine. I recall a similar pink version of the cleansing oil from previous years, called Fresh Cleansing Oil, if I’m not mistaken. So, I now hand you over to my buddy LeGeeque, who not only is a long time fan and user of the Shu Uemura cleansing oils, she is a long time use of the pink coloured Fresh cleansing oil, and will tell you about this and how it compares to the old version. ####### Let’s get some facts straight before we delve into the product. I’ve got dry and and sensitive skin. My major concerns are fine lines, ageing, premature ageing and sun damage. The final simply stems from my irrational fears that I’m not topping up my sunscreen as religiously as I should during the harsh Australian summer months. (According to the sun-worshipper locals I call mates, I am too sun-conscious but heck, what do these sun-worshippers know!) According to the Shu Uemura website, this particular product – Porefinist Anti-Shine Fresh Cleansing Oil – is marketed for oily and combination skin. Here’s the shocker. I’ve been using this exact product for the past 7 years! Yes, you would think that for one with sensitive and dry skin, I would be using one that’s more suitable for my skin. Pssst… Let me let you in on a very shallow secret of mine. I chose this because it was… PINK! New full bottle of Porefinist Anti-Shine Fresh cleansing oil and old empty bottle of Fresh Cleansing Oil I use the product as advised – a couple of pumps onto my dry palms. Massage my palms and apply that onto my dry skin. I gently massage my entire face in small circular motions. This effectively dislodges makeup and even waterproof sunscreen. I then wet my palms and repeat the small circular motions on my face. This emulsifies the oil and turns it milky white. I repeat that another time before I jump into the shower and wash everything off. (Pssst… Let me let you in on a naughty secret. I even massage this onto my eyes to remove my eye makeup. Just be extra gentle and make sure you have removed your contact lenses prior if you wear them) According to the instructions, this oil can be used with wet or dry hands, which is helpful if you forget and wet your hands before using it. But I use it with dry hands as advised before. It’s hard to break a habit of 7 years. Once the milky lotion has been rinsed off, my face feels extremely clean and soft. Every trace of makeup and skincare used from the day would have been successfully and gently removed. There is no tight nor taut sensation to my skin at all. Abiding by the double cleansing methodology religiously, I usually reach for my trusted cleanser to complete the cleansing routine. For a product that’s marketed for the oily and combination skin, it is not particularly drying nor harsh on my skin. I can attest to this from the numerous re-purchases I have made over the years. I have used this over harsh and dry winters where my skin is parched from heating vents and I have used this over hot and humid summers where humidity seems to be a gajillion percent. (Hair would be so Simba-like I’m certain he would be envious) The results are the same: clean and comfortable. So, when I was given the opportunity to try the new cleansing oil called Porefinist, in the familiar pink bottle, I was a little hesitant. I’m not a fan of skincare companies tweaking their formulas. When it comes to skincare, you don’t fix what’s not broken. However, after about a month of trialling this product, I’m relieved to report that all is well. If they have tweaked the formula, my skin has not reacted to it nor did I notice any additional benefits or improvements. I get the same results as I always have. I have thus come to the conclusion that Shu might have just updated the packaging and the name. So if you are already using the pink oil, just continue with it. It’s practically the same thing with a different name. At this point, I will not advise you to run out to get the biggest bottle you can land your hands on, if you’ve never used it, so I’d advise you to bribe a friend/co-worker/family who will be travelling soon to get you a sampler pack. It’s a set of 5 to 6 bottles of the different cleansers there are in the range. It’s not as painful on the hip pocket and you get to pick the best version of the cleanser for your skin. I will continue to be a loyal oil cleanser user as long as it keeps my skin happy. For now, it’s happy, calm and comfortable so I’m happy to fork out a rather large amount of money for this. Just bear in mind that it will last you for a long time so it does work out to be rather economical in the long run. In a nutshell The Shu Uemura Porefinist Anti-Shine Fresh Cleansing Oil is basically a renamed version of the existing pink cleansing oil. It has the same light feel, the same pink colour and works well to clean skin without drying it out. You can use it as a one step makeup remover and first cleanser, and then follow up with a second cleanse. It is important to emulsify the product properly as failure to do so can result in clogged pores. The formula says it works with wet or dry hands but I prefer using dry hands as I had been taught years ago. It may not work for everyone but it works for me. Pros: Clean, soft and comfortable skin. No angry flare ups nor dry, taut skin Cons: Quite a large initial outlay Who will like this: Anyone already using the pink version of the Shu Uemura cleansing oil, Anyone who wants to use a lighter version of the iconic cleansing oil Here is the ingredient list for Porefinist. Thanks for being my guinea pig, LeGeeque, and I’m glad it all worked out fine in the end! Are you a fan of the Shu Uemura cleansing oils? Have you tried this pink version? I was recommended the pink version years ago when I complained of breakouts but it too broke me out! Clearly there was something in the oil that my skin hated. It was interesting for me to know therefore that LeGeeque, who has more sensitive skin than I do, loves this oil! It goes to tell you not to judge a product by one review – always do your research and if you’re brave enough, sample it for yourself! ? Are you a fan of these cleansing oils?

I snuck you a peek at the Micro Essence lotion about a month back and I promised I’d tell you how or if I like it. Well, now is the time ? The Estee Lauder Micro Essence Skin Activating Treatment Lotion is now on shelves and you can have a go at it to see what the fuss is about. I received an sms from the Estee Lauder counter that you can get some free samples so go! Sample! ? But before you run out the door here’s what I think about this new, and apparently, revolutionary product. The Micro Essence is only available in Asia for now so friends in the Western world will have to wait to see if you get it or if it never arrives. The reason I think it’s made for the Asian market is because of what it is – a treatment lotion that is something many of us who are familiar with Asian type skincare are familiar with. This isn’t a toner in the traditional sense. What this is is an essence in lotion that hydrates, calms and repairs the skin barrier amongst others. Those of us who are already familiar with Asian skincare will be familiar with how this works and I think the nod given by Estee Lauder, a quintessentially American brand, to the growing Asian skincare market is to be applauded. And yet, where have we seen this before right here on this blog? ? If you guessed SK-II Facial Treatment Essence and La Mer Treatment Lotion , give yourself top points. But before I tell you how similar (or different) they are, I’d like to tell you how I feel about this Micro Essence after about a month’s use. For starters, the product comes in a lovely frosted translucent glass bottle with a gold cap. Very classy, very luxurious. The lotion is quite liquid. A little more viscous than water, but not by very much. There are 2 ways you can use this:- Saturate a cotton pad and apply all over your face, patting it on; or Pour a few drops into your palm and pat it on your skin I prefer using the latter method because I feel there’s less wastage this way. After about a month, I can attest to nicely hydrated skin. If you have dry skin you will appreciate how well this boosts hydration levels of your skin. If you have oily or combination skin, you too will appreciate how comfortable it feels because as we know, oily and combination skin can be dehydrated too. As we know, when your skin is hydrated, a lot of your skin woes will be solved and skincare will absorb better and work better. However, although this product promises you will see a nice healthy glow to the skin, supple skin, clearer skin and more even toned complexion because it “activates” your skin so it performs and behaves better, I didn’t experience it. This might be due to a couple of factors. I went on to try this after I was using the La Mer The Treatment Lotion and that truly did transform my skin. Perhaps then, my skin was already at its optimum and therefore couldn’t get any better. Perhaps I might have seen a better result had I used this first. Perhaps it just wasn’t as effective for me. I can’t say for sure, but I can attest to it maintaining my skin’s hydration. Estee Lauder says that this Micro Essence when paired with their new Advanced Night Repair Synchronised Recovery 2 will make the ANR work even better than on its own. Again, I didn’t notice much of a difference to my skin. ANR2 makes my skin look very rested and that is something I have to thank it for, when I quite literally feel like crap. Adding the Micro Essence helped it absorb just a wee bit better but I didn’t quite notice a marked improvement. Again, it could well be that my skin is already at its optimum so what the Micro Essence is doing, is preserving that optimum level my skin has achieved. Therefore I think that if you are going into this as a treatment lotion virgin then you may notice a marked improvement to your skin whether in terms of hydration or a healthier skin and glow. But if you have been using similar products and are quite happy with how your skin is doing right now, then you may notice the hydration improvement but not much else, like I did. It will depend a lot therefore on your skincare routine and lifestyle and just your skin in general ? In a nutshell The Estee Lauder Micro Essence Skin Activating Treatment Lotion is a new lotion tailored for the Asian market. What this is, is a light watery lotion that you apply on skin after cleansing and before your serums and moisturiser. It helps to increase the hydration levels of your skin as well as strengthens the skin barrier so skin is healthier and healthy skin glows. I personally experienced the hydration bit but not the glowy bit primarily because I think I’d started using this after already using a similar lotion. So my skin probably was already treated by the time I started Micro Essence so if you haven’t used a similar product then you may noticed a result but if you already use a similar product then you may not. It will depend. Pros: Addresses skin dehydration problems quite quickly and effectively, Easy to use, Packaging is luxurious, Spreads and absorbs quickly into skin Cons: Pricey, Packaging isn’t portable and travel friendly, Danger of pouring out too much product Who will like this: Anyone who has a problem with dehydrated skin, Anyone who already uses a treatment lotion product and want to try something similar EL Micro Essence vs SK-II FTE vs La Mer Treatment Lotion I know what some of you are thinking (I read minds don’t ya know? ? ). How is this similar or different to the SK2 FTE or the La Mer Treatment Lotion that I raved on about? Well SK-II breaks me out so on that front, it’s a non-starter for me. This EL Micro Essence didn’t break me out so going head to head, I’d pick the EL Micro Essence. Pitting the EL Micro Essence to the La Mer Treatment Lotion , despite the scent, I’m picking the La Mer Treatment Lotion on the grounds simply I prefer the slightly more viscous texture and also because it doesn’t leave a residue on my skin which I do get a wee bit with this EL Micro Essence. There is a bit of a scent in the EL Micro Essence but it isn’t unpleasant nor strong. I personally also feel that the La Mer Treatment Lotion is more hydrating for me so I’ll pick that one. So for me: La Mer > Estee Lauder > SK-II You can be sure more will be added to this equation. 2014 will be the “Year of Treatment Lotions” Mark my words ? Does this Micro Essence intrigue you? Do you use a similar treatment lotion as part of your skincare routine? You can sample this at Estee Lauder counters and see if you like it before investing in it. I think it’s a good product but manage your expectations so you don’t get disappointed ?

Things have been quite hectic around here on many different fronts and I just haven’t been able to settle down to do much blog related stuff, nor if I’m to be honest, am I in the right frame of mind to. But, having stolen a few minutes to myself, I thought I’d do a quick, simple update. It’ll be mostly that, or silence from now on for a while, I’m afraid ? While it seems awkward coming after my rant about limited edition makeup and the effect it has on us , I’m afraid I’m going to show you something limited edition today. Bad me. I know ? The item in question is something I have a very soft spot for – Guerlain Meteorites Light Reflecting Pearls of Powder. I confess to a weakness for these colourful balls and am almost on a mission to catch them all, like they were Pokemon ? One which seems to have sidled in almost unnoticed among the Spring/Summer collections is the Aquarella Meteorites . I only spotted them online fleetingly and there doesn’t seem to be a lot of hype or information about it, which surprises me. But when I spotted them on sale during the Sephora sale a while ago, I picked up a tub. At 20% off to boot! Yay! ? This limited edition tub of light reflecting powder pearls comes in a pale pink tub, as opposed to the regular silver tubs, and the pale pink box comes in a mint green interior. This would be the newest formula of Meteorites which means it comes in a 25g tub and the pearls have a softer texture than previous versions. This also means that it is easier now for most brushes to pick up product as opposed to previously. I managed to identify 6 different shades of balls in the tub – a pearly white, a pearly champagne, a gold, a mint green, a light pink and a shimmery purple-grey. The last is the most interesting of all because I’ve never seen that shade in any of the tubs I own. While each colour is supposed to perform a different function to illuminate and infuse skin with radiance, it is quite futile even picking up colour individually, because it all blends seamlessly on the skin to a translucent glow. So, the easiest way to use this is to use a brush, swirl it over the pearls and apply to the skin. I find that Aquarella Meteorites gives skin a very lovely radiant glow that is very noticeable, without too much paleness as I’d experienced with Perles du Dragon . However, I also find it to be among the more shimmery/glittery Meteorites out there. There is noticeable glitter and shimmer on my skin especially in sunlight, and if I touch my hands to my face, it does come away with shimmer bits on it. So, while it does give a lovely glow, it isn’t as subtle as it’s permanent cousin, Clair. Guerlain Meteorites Pearls Left: 02 Clair Right: Aquarella If you compare the permanent shade 02 Clair (formerly Teint Rose) with Aquarella, you may notice how Aquarella appears to be the softer, more pastel, more shimmery version of Clair. (Please ignore what looks like red balls in both tubs, they’re all pink, it’s shadow that’s turning the colour weird) So, if you want that radiant Guerlain Meteorites glow sans shimmer, then go for Clair. If you aren’t averse to having some shimmer and highlight on your skin, then Aquarella may suit you. It after all performs the same function, and on skin, looks the same as Clair, except more “glowy”. Whether you’ll like Aquarella depends on whether you like shimmer. In a nutshell The Guerlain Aquarella Meteorites Pearls are a limited edition tub of Meteorites that, like all Meteorites powders, infuse skin with a very subtle glow and luminance that I personally find very flattering. It is similar in effect to Clair, which is permanent, but I find it to be more shimmery on skin. When you compare both Clair and Aquarella, you will notice that Aquarella contains markedly more shimmery balls, while Clair is a mixture of matte and shimmer balls of powder. I don’t find it super shimmery, but it is quite noticeable especially in the sunlight. So I prefer to wear Aquarella for the evenings, when the light is softer and you don’t looks like a character from Twilight. Pros: Adds a soft luminous glow to skin, Gives skin a flattering smoothened effect with a touch of highlight Cons: Limited Edition, Pricey, Shimmery Who will like this: Anyone who is a fan of Meteorites powders I did notice that the Aquarella Meteorites is less “dusty” than Clair so I am wondering if they may have improved on the formula a touch. Here’s the catch though – I don’t know if this is still available but when I was last at Sephora, there was a substantial number of boxes with very little interest. So if you’re interested, check this out at Sephora or at Guerlain counters. Did you grab the Aquarella Meteorites? Have you succumbed to the lure of the Guerlain Meteorites pearls yet? If there’s one item I’m a little more than bonkers over, it’s these coloured powder balls. Heaven knows why, but there’re some things we can’t explain yes? Now, have YOU succumbed? ? NOTE: I may slip into radio silence again but you can always check out what I’m up to on Instagram or Twitter where I’m most active, or just get in touch with me there. I’ll reply, just that it’ll take a while when I manage to grab a moment of peace ?

You now that feeling don’t you? Ick! So I later turned to using body oil and never looked back. But recently I was introduced to this hand and body lotion from Ecoya that had me a little intrigued. I knew Ecoya was an Australian brand of candles, but I didn’t know they had body care products too! The Ecoya Hand and Body Lotion comes in a few gentle scents and the one I have is Sweet Pea and Jasmine. These are the same scents available in Ecoya’s candle range so yes, you can smell like your favourite candle scent hehe! Now, I was a little concerned when I first saw the name because jasmine isn’t my favourite scent, but I was willing to give it a go for the greater good, as it were. I’m so happy I did! The Ecoya Hand and Body Lotion is, as the name implies, a Moisturising lotion for hands and body. I used it mostly for my body, primarily my arms before I go to bed. Can be treating the face every evening and neglecting the scaly arms now, can we? ? The bottle is an elegant, tall bottle with a pump that dispenses just about the right amount of product. I like the opaque creamy bottle with the delicate lace print on it, and the light coloured label which shows you the name of the scent. It fits nicely in an elegant and contemporary setting. Very nicely done! The lotion itself is quite impressive. It isn’t too runny and light, yet it isn’t sticky or oily on skin at all. For someone who dislikes using body lotion, I did find myself reaching for this one on some nights, by passing the body oils in its way. Sweet Pea and Jasmine is labelled as a floral scent, which had me a little worried. I’m not exactly your biggest fan of floral scents. Thankfully, the sweet scent is quite light and not cloying at all. It is a delicate, gentle scent of flowers, lightly anchored with the heavier scent of jasmine. If you dislike the smell of jasmine like I do, then fear not. This doesn’t make me gag at all so that’s another point in its favour. My skin does feel softer on my arms with regular use but I am not so sure if it was just used for hands. It feels very light and absorbs very quickly into my skin and just doesn’t quite hit the spot for my hands. I also prefer my hand creams not to have too strong a scent, and especially not a floral scent so this isn’t something I’d use as a hand cream, but then I’m not into hand cream so don’t listen to me ? If you do use it just for hands, I can imagine it’ll last you quite a while! The downside of course, is that it’s a little pricey, but with Christmas just around the corner, I can tell you that this will make a very lovely gift ? In a nutshell The Ecoya Hand and Body lotion is a skin moisturising lotion that leaves skin feeling lovely and soft and moisturized with regular use. It isn’t oily nor sticky at all, and leaves skin feeling almost velvety. I like it for use on my arms but I’m not sure if it’ll be good for very dry hands if you intend to use it as a hand cream. The scent is light, thankfully, and despite the floral nature, not cloying nor too strong. For someone who shies away from body lotion like it was a skin stripping acid, I have been reaching for this often for the past 2 months and that tells you something eh? Pros : Light lotion absorbs easily, Not oily, Not sticky, Light scent is quite comforting Cons: Not sure if it’ll serve well as a hand cream for dry hands, pricey Who will like this: Anyone who hates regular body lotion, anyone who likes the lovely light floral scent Here is the ingredient list for anyone interested. I just picked up an Ecoya candle in French Pear and Lemongrass and Ginger and you know what? I think I want to get the body lotions too! Me? A confirmed body lotion hater? Yeah you heard it here first ? Have you tried Ecoya body lotions? Do you like their candles? I picked up 2 candles recently at The Brand Story’s booth and dammit, I want even more! The Lemongrass and Ginger makes my house smell like a spa and immediately makes it feel absolutely wonderful. The sense of smell is a wonderful thing. Try it if you don’t agree! ?

Gosh, I’ve let the dust build up in here haven’t I? I’m a bad housekeeper, I am ? But come, let me dust off the inch thick dust on the blog and jump right in to tell you about a product that came highly recommended to me. By now, most of us will be familiar with the brand Sulwhasoo, which made its appearance on our shores some time last year . A few people had asked me what I thought of it, and I was almost embarrassed to say that I hadn’t tried anything from the brand. So I decided to remedy that, and asked around for recommendations. Almost overwhelmingly, I was told to try the First Care Activating Serum , a Sulwhasoo bestselling product. What the First Care Activating Serum is, is a pre-serum. I know some people start rolling their eyes at this point. A serum is a serum! I almost hear you cry, what in the flying blazes is a pre-serum?! Well, this is a concept not uncommon in many Asian ranges of skincare and is basically a product that you apply BEFORE you apply the rest of your skincare, so that it boosts the efficacy of your skincare. So, you can use it together with your other brands of skincare but you have to use it first. There are different brands with similar products out there naturally, but Sulwhasoo promises that their First Care Activating Serum will give your skin a boost of moisture, refine your skin and balance and replenish nutrients, with their signature use of Jaeumdan and Jaeumboweedan, combinations of Korean Medicinal herbs blended into a prepared in a time-tested Poje method. Everyone who told me to try this serum has nothing but raves for it, and how it helped refine their skin and make it look better. So, I took the plunge. Slightly half a bottle and a couple of months down the road, how did I find this? Well, hmm… I’m not sure how to say this, but I didn’t notice anything in particular. I’m no stranger to layering different serums and potions on my skin so when I slotted this into my skincare routine, I slotted it in after cleansing and an exfoliating toner (I’m finishing up the one from REN if you’re curious). I figured that it would be the best place to slot it, since my skin would be nice and clean and exfoliated, and it would give the serum a chance to penetrate better into my skin. I then follow up with the rest of my routine. The product comes in a very lovely ergonomic ceramic bottle that always brings to my mind a smooth earthen jar. Don’t ask me why, I just think of it that way. It has a lovely heft and I like the cool weight in my hands. The product is dispensed through a pump, and I use 2 pumps in the morning and alternate evenings (I use Alpha H Liquid Gold on alternate evenings which is why this is so. Otherwise, I’d use it every evening as well) Since Sulwhasoo prides itself on using traditional herbs and a traditional method of preparation, the product reflects it. The serum pumps out a translucent brown that brings to mind a herbal concoction, and the scent is reminiscent of a Chinese medicine shop ? It isn’t unpleasant, at least not to my nose. If you are comfortable with strong herbal, medicinal scents of Chinese/Asian herbs like ginseng, then you will be fine with it. If you aren’t then you may find that it takes some getting used to because it isn’t softly fragranced like most skincare. It is strong, but I like the scent! I find it relaxing ? But then, I also like the smell (and taste) of herbs and I don’t mind smelling (or drinking) herbal soups and drinks ? I pump out about 2 pumps, and smooth it over my skin. The serum absorbs into the skin very quickly without any sticky feeling. In fact, it makes skin feel almost immediately smoothened. I could be imagining things, but it does appear to deliver a dose of hydration to the skin, and I like that especially in the evenings, and I’ve been out the whole day. As lovely as the product is on its own, I have to say I didn’t notice any additional “boosting” benefits. I didn’t experience significantly better skin than what I’d been having, nor did I experience any significant evening out of my skintone, clearing up of spots or better hydation as what many people have experienced. I must say however, that I do have my skin at a level that I believe is at its optimum, so it will take something significantly strong, to deliver noticeable results. So, what I’d say is not to take what I say to heart. I have my skin relatively well hydrated thanks to my skincare routine, and it is about as even toned as it’ll get taking everything into consideration. Perhaps what this serum does then for me is to maintain that balance. Perhaps someone who has something to improve might notice a more significant result. I didn’t, but then neither will I with many other skincare, so this isn’t a slur on the product which I do like, but rather a reflection of the state of my skin. I maintain that in many cases, significant results when using skincare is usually only noticeable when there is something that needs improving, and is improved. But when the skin is at a certain level, there is only so much you can do to improve, and then, you will be all about maintenance. So anyone who tells you that that new cream/serum/potion/lotion they just tried is so wonderful and has changed their skin, I’d ask you to pause for a moment and wonder why their skin is perpetually in a state of flux and if this then, is good advice for you to follow ? So for me, this serum is something for maintenance. I hesitate to say that I’d repurchase once I’ve finished with this bottle, because my skin seems to have done well even before using this. But I do like the scent and I do like the cooling, hydrating texture so if I feel like treating my skin, I might indulge in the future, just not in the short term. In a nutshell The Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum is Sulwhasoo’s bestselling product and is a pre-serum i.e. a serum you’d apply to the skin after cleansing, before you apply your other skincare. It boosts the efficacy of skincare while delivering moisture and refining skin. I like the herbal scent which some may find strong, and how quickly it absorbs into the skin. It seems to deliver a boost of moisture, but for me, I did not notice a significant improvement to my skin after using this as opposed to before. I believe that someone who has a skin problem they’d like to address e.g. oily skin, breakouts, poor hydration etc may find themselves benefiting from this more than I did. It isn’t a slur on the product, but a reflection of the condition of my skin i.e. it’s at a level where improvements are almost insignificant. I do like it, and will finish this, and I may repurchase in the future, but not in the short term. Pros: Nice luxurious packaging, Product absorbs quickly into skin without a sticky after-feel, Skin feels immediately hydrated Cons: Pricey, Strong herbal scent may not sit well with everyone, I did not notice a significant improvement to my skin Who will like this: Anyone who is comfortable with herbal scents, Anyone who wants a quick boost of hydration to the skin and are comfortable using pre-serum or booster serums Here is the ingredient list for anyone keen to know what’s in there. Have you tried this First Care Activating Serum? Are there other Sulwhasoo products you like? I can’t say this has been a washout, because I do sort of like it, even if I didn’t have the raving results others had. So I’d be keen to give other Sulwhasoo products a go. Hit me up with your faves! ? The next product I want to get is the Overnight Revitalizing Mask, which I’ve read so much good things about! If you had good results with this serum, please share because you could help others who are wondering if it will work for them ?

Cle de Peau is one of those brands that I look at from afar but never try because the prices stagger me. Trust me, it takes some doing, but it happens. But I knew about this brand because when I first started getting interested in using makeup, one of the things that kept cropping up over and over, was the Cle de Peau concealer. I still haven’t tried it. But today, I’d like to share with you some pictures and swatches of the Cle de Peau Beaute Extra Rich Lipstick . That’s the case that you see there. Unique and certainly, quite unusual. I do find Cle de Peau’s fascination with geometrical designs and angles quite interesting because angles are hard and makeup isn’t. The angular designs are also reflected in the lipsticks, which you’ll see below. Incidentally, the lipsticks and case are sold separately. Now brace yourself. These are luxury items ? The new Extra Rich Lipstick are, as the name implies, infused with more colour, better texture and more skincare benefits. The colours are inspired by the rose so expect many shades of rose tinted colours available. Incidentally, I’ve found that rose tinted lipsticks suit more people than straight pink or red. This is my first time trying the Cle de Peau Beaute lipsticks. Remember when I mentioned that the lipsticks too sported the angular, geometrical shapes found in many Cle de Peau makeup designs? I think it quite unique. The lipsticks are sold separately from the case so you technically have the option to not purchase the case if you prefer. However, the lipsticks come with a rather flimsy plastic cover that doesn’t stay put all that well unless you keep your lipsticks in their own pouch, so that’s something to think about. If I’m to be honest, I don’t quite get why the case should be sold separately. We’re told that it’s because it allows you to carry just the colour you need or to swap it out if you like. It also reduces wastage because when you’re finished with your lipstick, you can just snap it out of the case and refill it with a new colour. Problem is, I’m not sure how many beauty junkies will actually finish a lipstick hehe.. Here’s how it looks when I snap one into the case. It’s sturdy although the case is plastic so from a personal point of view, if you can handle not having a case (hard I know because the lipsticks are so expensive in themselves!) then you can easily skip it. Cle de Peau Beaute Extra Rich Lipstick Left-Right: #109, #310, #304 Each colour was swatched just once except for #304 which had to be layered. You will notice how richly pigmented #109 and #310 are. Based on my observation, here are the description of the colours #304 – A pink in the tube, but on skin a lovely wearable rosy hue with shades of pink #310 – An orangey muted red in the tube, but on skin an intense bright red #109 – A rosy red in tube and a colour I thought I’d love but on skin it swatched a sheer rosy shade I have to admit I was a little surprised at #109 and how sheer it was. It took 2 layers for the colour to show up in the photo which didn’t quite bring to mind the description of “Extra Rich”. On lips, they do apply beautifully. The sharp angular shape and the straight design at the tip actually facilitates the application of lipstick and a sharp line without using a brush. This is especially helpful with bright colours like #310. Cle de Peau Beaute Extra Rich Lipstick swatches : (1) #109 (2) #310 (3) #304 and how the lipsticks look in the tube You may notice that #109 looks a little more glossy than the other two, which are more intense and creamy although they aren’t matte. Longevity was surprisingly good. I liked how #310 did not travel at all outside of the lip line nor did it feather or bleed through the day. I could easily wear these all day because they do feel very light and comfortable on lips. The drawback however, is the price which I can say will not sit well with many. Still, it’s one of those things. Luxury goods are luxury goods. They aren’t for everyone but it’s there for someone ? Here’s how the colours look on me just for reference. You may click on the images below to enlarge. Cle de Peau Beaute Extra Rich Lipstick #109 Cle de Peau Beaute Extra Rich Lipstick #304 Cle de Peau Beaute Extra Rich Lipstick #310 In a nutshell Cle de Peau Beaute recently reformulated their Extra Rich Lipstick to make it even richer, and with better skincare benefits for lips. I have to say that the texture of the lipsticks are very lovely. They are creamy without being too creamy and pigmented. They are also very comfortable to wear and non drying on lips. The angular design does take some getting used to but it does help to create a smooth straight lip line when applying straight from the bullet. So I have nothing to fault when it comes to the texture and longevity and general product. However, I am not enamoured with the idea of having to buy the case separately. I prefer to have my lipsticks come in their own cases especially when I’m already paying so much for the product. Still, if I can overlook that, these are excellent. Pros: Lightweight texture, Rich creamy colour, Longlasting, Non drying, No scent Cons: Case is sold separately, Pricey Who will like this: Anyone who loves wearing pigmented creamy lipstick The case is surprisingly large too, as you can see. I don’t think it necessary to actually buy the case to be honest. I do wish it came in one though. That said, I suppose it does reduce the amount of packaging needed and you can use it indefinitely with your lipstick refills instead of tossing it out wholesale when you’re done. Have you tried Cle de Peau Beaute lipsticks or any other makeup? Have any recs? This is my first time trying their lipstick. I tried their eyeshadow singles many years ago. The texture was silky and out of this world, but I’m allergic to them so I had to give them away. If you have other faves, let me know!

I did like using the very popular and iconic Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturiser which I take in Porcelain , which is comfortable on skin and offered just enough tint to even out skintone. I’d never tried their full on foundations however, so the Silk Creme was the first. I had been curious for a while. The Silk Creme foundation is what I’d consider a full coverage foundation because it does offer a lot of coverage. So much in fact, that it took me a while to work out that only a very very little bit is sufficient for a thin veil over the skin. Very little. That was the first thing I had to get used to. The product comes in a small 35ml tube that really belies just how much product you need. I usually only squeeze out a little dot, and then use my brush because this foundation doesn’t take very kindly to fingers. The texture is very creamy so this is one that is more suited to those with a drier skintone i.e. me! For those with oily skins, there are other foundations in the range but you may find this one a bit heavy. Because this is such a high coverage foundation, I find I have to be quite careful with it because I ran into the second snag – colour selection. This one is quite tricky! The first time I was at the counter, I had been colour matched to Peach Ivory . It actually looked quite good on me, and because the application was so flawless, I really was very impressed. This foundation really leaves you with a very flawless appearance. It was complimentary and I took it home but struggled with it for quite a while. Eventually, I worked out that I couldn’t wear Peach Ivory. It was, for want of a better word, too peachy. Perhaps it was the yellow lighting in the mall that played tricks on the colour matching, but I could not get it to work in everyday life. This was because I ran into snag #3 – it oxidises. I did notice that this foundation does oxidise on skin after a while and when that happened, Peach Ivory was too dark on me. So, I chucked this to the back of my drawer and forgot about it. A little while later, I happened to pass by the Laura Mercier store again and decided to check if there was another lighter shade and lo! and behold! There was – Soft Ivory . Now, I must warn you, that Soft Ivory is almost white when squeezed out of the tube LOL! It stunned me. I’m not white! But I spoke to the SA and we tested it on my skin and she agreed that it might be a better match. She gave me a generous sample to try at home which I did, and I went back to buy the full tube later because strange as it looks, Soft Ivory is my shade. Here’s a comparison of the 2 shades – Peach Ivory and Soft Ivory so you have an idea of what I mean. Laura Mercier Silk Creme Foundation Swatch (1) Peach Ivory (2) Soft Ivory (3) Soft Ivory blended with a bit of Peach Ivory You might be able to tell from these swatches just how creamy the Silk Creme foundation is. These were spread out from just a tiny little dot on my skin so a very little goes a very long way. In fact, the recommended application method is by using a sponge, and I can understand why, because it will just be easier to spread. When I use a brush, it can appear a little streaky because it is so spreadable, like butter ? Also, if you aren’t careful it can even look cakey on skin. But I don’t have a sponge, so I persevere with a foundation brush and it usually works. I use the 5 line method with just a tiny little bit of foundation and it covers all of my skin once I blend it in a little. You can also see just how peachy Peach Ivory is in comparison to Soft Ivory. For interest, these are among the 2 lighter shades in the range which is quite puzzling, but I think on those with a fair-medium skintone with some yellow base, the Peach Ivory shade can be brightening on skin. Here are the swatches in comparison to other foundations I wear in my shade. The shades do differ a little but the rest work on me. (1) Revlon Colorstay #200 Nude (2) Laura Mercier Silk Creme Foundation – Peach Ivory (3) Laura Mercier Silk Creme Foundation – Soft Ivory (4) Blended – Soft Ivory + Peach Ivory (5) Urban Decay Naked Skin Foundation 1.0 (6) Shiseido Perfect Refining Foundation I00 Very Light Ivory (7) Diorskin Nude 010 Ivory In terms of coverage, the Laura Mercier Silk Creme foundation offers the most coverage, followed by the Revlon then Shiseido then Diorskin Nude and then Urban Decay Naked Skin. But you know what? Lest you think that I am all negative about this foundation, I actually am not. I like it. It is like real life photoshop for my skin LOL! No, I’m serious! One very thin layer of Silk Creme foundation over my face and it’s like all faults are erased or blurred. Once the Silk Creme foundation has set, it has a slightly matte but luminous finish. Not shiny, not oily, not wholly matte either. It is in the words of Goldilocks, “Just right” It feels very lightweight on my skin and I never feel like I’m wearing any foundation at all which is great when you live where I do and have to battle heat and humidity all the time. It stays put for hours, does not dry out my skin one bit and starts to look better once it has settled in. I usually give it about an hour and then look into the mirror and am amazed at how flawless my skin looks by then. Soft Ivory oxidises just a little bit, so it looks far more natural about an hour in than after I immediately apply it to my skin. Here is an idea of what I mean by photoshop to my skin. Please forgive the different angles. For some reason, I refused to cooperate with myself when taking these shots and I couldn’t be arsed to re-do them ? Untouched up Left: Bare skin in all its glory, shine and all! Right: A thin layer of Soft Ivory and who needs concealer? I don’t use concealer at all when I use the Silk Creme foundation because what is there to conceal when the foundation has already done its job? ? I do sometimes top up with a dusting of Meteorites in Teint Beige just to even things out further and what with the real life photoshop and the blur tool, I get away with everything ? If I want something seriously flawless, as in Dresden dolly, so flawless it looks fake, then a light dusting of pressed or loose powder does the trick. But I don’t practise that often. Not a fan of that look ? So, if you have a combination-dry skintype and want a full coverage foundation that is practically Photoshop for your skin then definitely do check this one out. This one is in regular rotation with my other liquid foundations so that says a lot! ? In a nutshell The Laura Mercier Silk Creme Foundation is a creamy foundation with very high coverage that I feel suits those with slightly dry skin better than someone with oily skin. That said, if you live in a colder climate then you may be able to use it but here where it’s hot and humid, I’d say it’s a no-no for oily skintypes. The texture is very smooth and the coverage is phenomenal! One little small pea dot gets you more than sufficient coverage for the whole face. It feels light on skin and on me, lasts a full day without oiling up or fading. I am impressed with this one and it is in regular rotation but it is not without its faults, notably – poor shade selection, oxidises, and takes some getting used to. I use a brush but I think a sponge or even that famed Beautyblender sponge could come in useful for this one. Pros: Hygienic packaging that is easy to control, Photoshop in a tube!, Only very little is needed so it will last a long while Cons: Poor shade selection, Oxidises, Make take a while to get the hang of it or you may end up using too much, Pricey initially, Can look cakey if too much is used Who will like this: Anyone with a slightly dry skintype who is in the market for a full coverage foundation If you’d like to test this, I recommend looking for Jia Jia at the Laura Mercier counter at Bangsar Village 2. She is very pleasant and friendly and if you ask her nicely she might even let you take home a sample so you can decide if it is suitable for you. Whenever I want something from LM, I go to her because some of the others can be a bit snobby, but this one, she’s lovely ? Have you tried the Silk Creme foundation? Do you like any other Laura Mercier base makeup? So far, I like the Undercover Concealer Pot and the Tinted Moisturiser . I wasn’t too thrilled about the Secret Concealer compact or the Tinted Moisturiser Creme Compact but I’ve since been told I’ve been using the Secret Concealer wrongly so I’m going to try that one again. There may be a new foundation out too that comes in a glass bottle but I haven’t gotten round to that.

Ah such is evolution, I say ? So in the early days, I used to not be much of a fan of using toners because to my inexpert eye, they were an extra step that had me seeing no results. I got back into using toners a couple of years back but I was using mostly hydrating toners that I patted on and then I rediscovered the use of cotton pads . See my evolution? Last year, I got into using 2 toners. I know! Here I am, moving from not using any toner at all to 7 years later, using 2 haha! I’ll talk about it another time, but essentially, I use an exfoliating toner and then I follow up with a hydrating toner. It’s not an original thought on my part. Full credit goes to Ms. Caroline Hirons for this one ? As does my purchase of the REN Clarifying Toning Lotion which I’ve learned is now called Clarimatte Clarifying Toner . Gosh, I do wish brands would stick to one name and not change it at will. What’s Clarimatte anyway? Grr… But anyway, this product is essentially an exfoliating toner. You use it with a cotton pad and wipe it over your face and what it does is clarify your skin, help remove dead skin cells to encourage skin cell turnover and give you clearer, more even toned skin. It is basically, all we ever imagined a toner to do and it’s alcohol free to boot! I purchased this one after my first experience with an exfoliating toner left me feeling quite comfortable with the concept. The Bio Extracts seem to remain the same in the newly named product, and what these basically do is quite gently exfoliate skin cells. It is targeted to those with combination to oily skin so you might imagine that I’d be moaning about it being drying for someone like me with dry skin. But surprisingly, it isn’t. I use this twice a day (every morning and every evening unless I’m using Liquid Gold ) and I don’t find it drying at all which makes me happy. I usually drop a few drops on a cotton pad and then wipe it all over my face after cleansing. It freshens up my skin and makes it feel very nice and clean, but not squeaky clean if you know my meaning. It just feels comfortable. I then move on to the rest of my skincare routine. “But what results I am supposed to see?” I can almost hear you cry. Well, for myself, what I did notice was that my skin became a bit finer, clearer and smoother. I’m not sure if the eveness of tone is attributed to this or Liquid Gold or just my whole damned routine but I am quite happy with the state of my skin right now (touch wood) I don’t mean right now, when I do have some errant spots, but as a whole, my skin has been behaving itself quite well. I do see a clarity of skin more quickly with this product than I did with the Hada Labo one so I have a sneaky feeling that this product is more effective at what it does. However, it does weigh in at a higher price point as well so these things have to be factored in. I personally prefer this toner or lotion, but I will happily finish up the Hada Labo one because I already have it. While I don’t consider this too pricey in the big scheme of things, I do find that it goes a fairly long way. I’m more than 2 months into using this and I’m only about halfway through. If you were to use this just once a day (in which case, I’d suggest you use it at night) then it will last you even longer. Ultimately, I’m happy with this product. I don’t profess to know the science behind it nor the chemical makeup and whether it is good for the skin. I think lactic acid is good, as is glycolic acid to help exfoliate the skin cells and this is mild enough not to sting my skin (although they do caution that you may experience a tingling of skin) nor leave my skin feeling dry and parched, while working effectively. Quite happy to stick to this one ? In a nutshell The REN Clarifying Toning Lotion (renamed to Clarimatte Clarifying Toner) is a toning lotion that you use after cleansing and before the rest of your skincare. It helps to exfoliate your skin more quickly so your skin looks clearer and brighter and pores look finer. I can attest to most of that. I feel that my skin feels cleaner and looks better after using this one so I’m quite happy to go on using it. I do suggest following up with a hydrating lotion if you have drier skin like I do, or even if you don’t, but that’s your choice. I do and I think it helps my skin a lot. Pros: Alcohol free, Feels gentle on my skin, Not drying, Skin feels clean after use, Skin looks clearer and feels smoother with regular use, A little goes a long way Cons: None unless you count that it can sometimes be hard to find Who will like this: Anyone who is in the market for an exfoliating toner that feels gentle on skin and not drying Here’s the ingredient list for anyone interested. If you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend that you do a patch test to determine if you are sensitive to the product. Another point to note is that REN says this is alcohol free but it does contain Alcohol Denat. that I know some people are sensitive to so I’m not sure what’s going on there. Personally I’m not fussed but if you are sensitive again, do take note. Have you tried this REN clarifying toner? Have you tried other exfoliating toners and have one you like? I think my earliest experience with a clarifying toner was Clinique’s and my skin hated it which is why I was quite wary when dipping my toes back into the pool of exfoliating/clarifying toners. But I’m quite happy to have found this one from REN and also the Hada Labo (for those on a budget) so I’m quite happy to try others now ?

It says “Buy Me!” I’d heard so much about the Caudalie Beauty Elixir way before I’d even tried anything else from the brand. It is also supposed to be one of their top bestsellers and highly raved by celebrities and beauty bloggers alike. But it was only not too long ago that I eventually picked up a bottle to see what the hype was about. The Caudalie Beauty Elixir is a face mist that contains a cocktail of other ingredients, that you mist on your face at any time you like, whether to mist your face before moisturiser or to freshen up. Based on the many many reviews I’ve read, misted over makeup, it’s supposed to give a glow to the skin. Used on it’s own, it’s supposed to smell wonderful, refresh and give skin an amazing glow. Hmm… I therefore had to pinch myself when I didn’t get the stellar results promised. Are you a fan of this product? I’m thankful I got the small 30ml bottle and it was during a sale online somewhere (I can’t remember which website anymore. Might have been Zuneta before they shut down) but I wasn’t sure I was ready to commit to a large bottle and I was right. I could never have. So, what’s about it that I don’t like? Hmm… there’s quite a long list. Let me see if I can list it all down It feels sticky on skin The peppermint/mentholatum scent makes my eyes water if I get it in my eyes The peppermint essential oil makes my lips tingle The smell is too strong I don’t see any benefits to my skin It doesn’t help my makeup stay on longer It isn’t soothing to my skin I went around the web to see if I was doing it wrong, but there’s no science or technique to this. Just shake it up (so you mix up the essential oils in there) and spritz on your face. To its credit, the mist is very fine and it doesn’t leave your face dripping wet so misting your skin after putting on makeup isn’t going to mess it up. The frosted glass bottle is absolutely lovely to hold and feels lovely and luxe. But that was about it for me. I wasn’t a fan of the scent nor how it felt on my skin. Maybe I’m doing this all wrong. I’m not sure. If you’re a fan, please let me know! In a nutshell The Caudalie Beauty Elixir is a cult beauty product that I can’t seem to love. I find it a little too irritating to my skin especially because of the peppermint/mentholatum in there. The smell reminds me of Vick’s and it feels sticky on my skin and I haven’t seen any particular improvement to my skin or longevity of my makeup using this. I will agree that it is very refreshing especially on a hot day but that’s about it. A bit too pricey for a refreshing face mist. I think regular rose floral water will do the trick just fine as well. Pros: Mist is very fine and does not leave face wet Cons: List as above Who will like this: Anyone who likes the minty, herbal scent and the tingle against the skin Here are the ingredients, which I’ve read are actually quite irritating to sensitive skin but as with everything, take it with a pinch of salt because we never know how our skins will react to any ingredient. Are you a fan of the Beauty Elixir? Have you tried any other Caudalie products? I’m afraid to say I cannot join Victoria Beckham in this one because it just doesn’t agree with me. It is primarily the scent and the texture that gets to me. I don’t mind using rose water (I do use a floral water mist daily ) but this just doesn’t do it for me the way other Caudalie products have.

I go through these like water and every time I toss up an “empties” post or photo, it appears somewhere in there after a couple of months. I think most people are sick of it already – don’t you have other faves?! I get that wail. Erm… if I did, then it won’t be a fave right? ? But recently, a friend told me to give the Impress IC Brightening Sun Protector SPF50+ PA+++ a try. According to said friend, this was their fave, and knowing my predilection for sunscreen, I had to try it. So when I ran low on the Shiseido one, I sprung for this Impress version. Impress IC is a brand under the Kanebo Cosmetics umbrella so you can find it at major Kanebo Cosmetics counters, and as I have indicated in the image above, yes this Brightening Sun Protector is quite impressive! Like most Japanese style sunscreens, this has a lightweight liquid texture and you have to shake up the bottle to ensure all the ingredients mix up. For those who dislike the feeling of heavy, thick sunscreen textures, then these sort of light liquid might sit better with you. While not as affordable as the other sunscreen alternative I shared with you before, this has joined the ranks of Shiseido and Hada Labo as one of my favourite sunscreens ? The box is all in Japanese, but there’s information in English contained within the box that tells you a little more about the product. As they have indicated, the texture is very light and non-sticky and blocks both UVA and UVB rays with SPF50+ and PA+++ ratings which are really high. I have noticed that these Japanese are good at perfecting the sort of lightweight, comfortable sunscreen textures while offering very high protection, that we don’t see in Western brands. I do however have to point out that like most Japanese brands, there is alcohol in there as well as silicone but I don’t notice a significant slip to the texture. Also, I don’t notice this to be drying on my skin which naturally sits well with me as I have drier skin, and my gripe with many Japanese type sunscreens is their nature of being drying. Does this make a good makeup base like the Shiseido one? Yes it does. That’s part of the reason I don’t bother using primers, because my sunscreens already give me the base I need for my makeup to sit on which negates the requirement for an additional layer of product on my skin. Left: Impress IC Brightening Sun Protector Right: Shiseido Perfect UV Protector Here are product swatches of the Impress IC and the Shiseido sunscreens. The Impress IC one has a lighter more liquid texture while the Shiseido one is a wee bit more creamy. In terms of colour, the Impress IC one squeezes out white while the Shiseido one squeezes out with a tint of pink. Once applied on skin, it’s transparent and there is no visible colour cast for me for both. Does it turn oily? Nope. In fact, here’s what I did. For almost a week, I applied the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector on half my face and this Impress IC Brightening Sun Protector on the other half, just to see how they fare next to each other. I pit everything against my holy grail sunscreen unfortunately, which means I’m rarely very fair to other brands LOL! ? What I noticed was…. nothing! The Impress IC performed just as well as the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector so I was very happy. However… yes there is always a however, if I was forced to choose, I am still picking the Shiseido one simply because there’s something about it that I like better, but I would be also more than happy to use this Impress IC version if I can’t get hold of the Shiseido. In terms of value, the Impress IC version offers slightly better value at RM142/60ml as opposed to the Shiseido version at RM130/50ml. So how do you choose? Hmm… good question. I don’t know ? Good luck ? In a nutshell I picked up this Impress IC Brightening Sun Protector at the recommendation of a friend who has been using this for a while. It has a lightweight liquid milky texture that sits very comfortably on my skin without drying it out nor turning oily. There is no noticeable white cast and it makes a great makeup primer so you save a step. It has high SPF of 50+ and high UVA protection with a PA+++ rating. Comparing this side by side to my favourite Shiseido Perfect UV Protector sunscreen, I find them almost indistinguishable. While I’d pick the Shiseido just based on personal preference, I’m quite happy to use this too. Pros: Lightweight texture is comfortable on skin, Does not dry out my skin, Does not irritate my skin nor break me out, Does not leave a white cast, Does not turn oily, Makes a good makeup base Cons: Pricey Who will like this: Anyone who likes lightweight liquid texture type sunscreens, Anyone looking for a sunscreen with high UVA and UVB protection without feeling heavy on skin Here is the ingredient list from the box which is in Japanese. I can’t read it, naturally but I included it in case someone can. I have however extracted the English ingredient list from here : Cyclomethicone, Water, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Methocycinnamate, Dimethicone, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sorbitan Isestearate, Diphenylsiloxy phenyl trimethicone, Methyl Trimethicone, Dimethicone /Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Trifluoropropyl Dimethiconol, Mevanolactone, Methylserine, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Murraya Koenigii Extract, BHT, Fragrance I note that there is zinc oxide in this product which is also present in the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector. However, although my skin is very sensitive to high zinc oxide levels (it clogs my pores and breaks me out) my skin handles both these products well with no breakouts nor clogged pores. It puzzles me but hey, I’m not looking a gift horse in the mouth! ? Have you tried this Impress IC sunscreen? Do you like using Japanese sunscreen or do you prefer creamier Western versions? Thus far, I’ve had a lot of luck with Japanese sunscreens except the popular ones from Biore or Sunplay that break me out. Currently my sunscreen picks would be Shiseido Perfect UV Protector first and if not, then this Impres IC Brightening Sun Protector and not very far behind, Hada Labo Whitening UV Protector. I do still like the Hada Labo one but this just pips it to the post for me ?

When I first heard about it, I thought it might be a liquid blush with bubbles in it, akin to a fizzy drink. Happily, I was mistaken. Could you imagine a blush like that? Actually, it might be fun won’t it ? But no, this is what you get. a domed shaped cream blush which brings to mind that of a roll-on deodorant except this doesn’t roll. It’s static. There are 2 shades available in this limited edition item – 01 Pink and 02 Cherry. The one pictured here is 02 Cherry – in pot, a bright raspberry pink. Right off, I’m going to tell you that I have mixed feelings about this product. In terms of product performance, I give it 5 stars. It’s a great cream blush and it lasts and it just looks beautiful on. In terms of packaging, it doesn’t deserve the luxury name nor price. I’ll tell you why I think so ? First, the product. The blush is a cream blush in a dome shape and contained within a squat tub. The idea isn’t new, as I learned after I put this up on Instagram a while ago. Apparently brands like Shu Uemura have already done this as well as a couple of other Asian brands I believe. The idea is that you can use the product straight from the tub. Just dab the dome blush on your cheeks and blend it out for a very lovely, soft, diffused colour. Ideally, that is. I tried it this way and it works. But I didn’t like it. I found that it deposited too much colour and when you blend, away goes your foundation, unless you are blending directly on bare skin. It might work for the lighter 01 Pink, but not for 02 Cherry. The best way to use this I eventually discovered, was using a brush and applying it as I have shown in an earlier cream blush tutorial . I use the Sigma F84 kabuki brush or the Real Techniques Stippling Brush, brush the top of the blush to pick up product and take it to my skin. This way, I get a lovely diffused blush, blending is very easy and my fingers stay clean. Guerlain Meteorites Bubble Blush 02 Cherry Swatch Here is a swatch of the product, swatched rather heavily by running the dome of the blush down my arm. Colour-wise, Cherry is a cool toned raspberry pink shade that is almost fuchsia. This is the type of colour I usually don’t go for because like the YSL Blush Radiance No. 6 the deep tones tend to accentuate pigmentation. It’s funny but it does. So when I tried using it as recommended by swiping the blush down my cheek and blending, I didn’t like the effect. However, when I used it with a brush as I mentioned above, the colour went on more subtly and more diffused and it gave me that lovely blushing from within look that was very natural. Here’s how it looks on me applied using a brush. The cream isn’t too creamy nor is it too dry the way some are. To the touch, there is some slip but it is for the most part, dry touch. Blending is a breeze whether with fingers or a brush and it settles beautifully on the skin and lasts an incredibly long time. All day for me (but I do not have oily skin) on top of foundation. It is a very lovely product. BUT! But Guerlain, what the heck were you thinking putting this incredible product into such horrible tacky packaging?! This very lovely formula comes housed in a white plastic tub that feels pretty flimsy but the icing on the cake as it were, is the clear plastic screw on cover that feels and looks like it would crack under the slightest pressure. If not for the name on the side and the logo on the cap, place this product on any pharmacy/drugstore shelf and it would fit right in. Place it among Guerlain’s luxurious offerings and it stands out like an angry red zit on an otherwise flawless face. This Bubble Blush is the pustule in the otherwise flawless Guerlain collections I’ve been seeing come out of Maison Guerlain. Do I sound disappointed? You think?! It is quite small as well coming in at 7g which isn’t something I’d mention usually, if this was better housed. I guess I’ve come to expect great things from Guerlain. They have rarely let me down in terms of product performance and packaging and I’m a huge fan of the brand but this Bubble Blush looks like an afterthought. Almost as if someone came across this and said “Oh, our Meteorites Blossom Sping collection is looking a bit bare, let’s just toss this in. Nevermind about the packaging. People will buy anyway” And they will, because some people won’t mind. They’ll say it’s a great product (and it is!) and they’ll forgive the RM140/US$42 pricetag and the crappy plastic case. It’s ok. But it’s not. So as much as I really liked the Meteorites Bubble Blush and as much as I thoroughly enjoyed using it, I’m going to put my neck out there and say that it isn’t worth the money. Save your money for something better because there are many other selections of good cream blushes in the market. If you really want a no-fail option, get a Canmake cream blush . Sure, it comes in flimsy plastic packaging as well, but it costs something like RM40 or thereabouts and goes on sale. You can’t beat it for value. Tsk! I expected better from Guerlain. In a nutshell The Meteorites Bubble Blush is an excellent product but let down by utterly unforgiveable flimsy plastic packaging. If you get over the packaging or are prepared to ignore it then the cream blush is absolutely lovely. It isn’t too creamy to be oily, it stays on skin well for most of the day, it blends very easily and looks lovely and natural and gives you a very natural glow from within. Despite the 5 star performance, I don’t think it value for money simply because it comes in crappy packaging that looks like an afterthought. I think this product not worthy of the Guerlain label and the asking price. But don’t let it stop you if you love this enough. Pros: Not too creamy or oily, Easy to use even without a brush, Easy to blend, Longlasting, Looks natural and gives skin a lovely healthy glow Cons: Horrible flimsy plastic packaging , Pricey Who will like this: Anyone who wants a very easy to use cream blush, Anyone who doesn’t mind the cheap and tacky packaging Have you checked out the Meteorites Bubble Blush? Have you seen something similar in other brands? I haven’t been paying a lot of attention coz these sort of products don’t usually get my attention. I like blush, but less so cream blush and especially not gimmicky looking packaging. I don’t deny the formula is awesome so I do hope that Guerlain repackages this some time into a proper compact or something that looks better. It’d be a winner!

In a way, I was right. It is a perfume scent, just in lower concentrations. With these lower concentrations of perfume comes a lighter scent that is more suited for use in the day or when it is warm. When temperatures rise, you don’t really want to have anything on you that smells heavy and musky or strong. Earlier this year, Annick Goutal released a range of colognes in 3 classic Annick Goutal scents – Eau d’Hadrien, Neroli and Vétiver. They are meant to be light interpretations of the classic scents. Something that might sit better here where it’s warm and humid. I stopped by the Annick Goutal store in Bangsar Shopping Centre a few months ago to take a sniff of them. Other than the very lovely Petite Cherie, I have found most Annick Goutal scents to be a bit heavy even for me. So, I was curious to see if a cologne might be better. In a way it was, and in a way it wasn’t. Before I tell you about the Annick Goutal Les Colognes collection, I wanted to just tell you to please take my post or anyone else’s post on fragrance with a very generous pinch of salt. Grab a whole handful of salt, if you may, because fragrances are so individual that it is practically impossible to “review”. Also, remember that what smells wonderful to me could smell like pee on you. I say this by way of a preface because I recently fell for the descriptions of Diptyque Eau Duelle online and picked up a bottle only to find it was not what I was expecting. For now, in the Les Colognes collection are 3 scents. The descriptions are mine and based on my perceptions as I smell them. Neroli – The first spritz brought forth the fresh scent of orange blossom initially but as it dried down, I found it getting more flowery. I actually thought the scent was quite strong and lasted quite a while on my skin. It didn’t smell good on me however, so I was not too pleased with the fact that it lasted on my skin for a while. Eau d’Hadrien – This opens up with a zesty citrus top note which very quickly settled to a powdery and then floral scent on my skin. Eau d’Hadrien is described as a fresh citrus fragrance and I was expecting to like this, but it turned out that I did not. It’s funny how different a description of a scent can turn out on skin, but this just smelled wrong on me. Didn’t last very long, as is de rigueur with most citrus based perfumes. I therefore settled for Vétiver for the simple reason, this was the spiciest scent of the 3 and I like my scents spicy. When I spray the Vétiver cologne on me, I find the first hit on the nose quite sharp. If you like something with flowers or something sweet and gourmand, you may not like this one. The scent of Vétiver is sharp and spicy and then settles down to a warmer note, still retaining the spiciness but rounding out a little on my skin. Of the 3, I found Vétiver has the strongest scent, followed by Neroli and then Eau d’Hadrien. Unlike the other perfumes I have which have Vétiver as their notes, this one smells very clear and clean. It smells like I’ve stepped out from a shower after using a man’s spicy body wash LOL It has that hint of masculine spiciness, with a tiny hint of flowers underlying it as it goes along. It smells… fresh! But with a decided masculine slant ? The only drawback therefore is the longevity. This is a cologne as the name implies which makes this the lightest formulation available. The next up is Eau de Toilette and we already know that many EdT don’t quite pass the full day of wear test. So, Vétiver lasts on me quite comfortably for a little over half a day in the office. A little longer if it’s cool and the air-conditioning is particularly powerful and it’s a rainy day. If it’s a day when I’m outside in the heat and humidity, it goes off after a couple of hours. Quite something to be expected of a cologne, but a little disappointing if you like smelling fresh all day. So, this is one where having a travel atomizer on you will be quite appreciated. I plan to pick one up so I can carry Vétiver around with me for the day. The bottle comes with a gold cap but a spray pump is included and once you attach it, you can’t use the cap anymore. I thought it was a pity. I’d have liked for the cap to be made such that it could fit over the spray. Also, notice how the packaging has changed from the classic ribbed design of Annick Goutal fragrances to a very simple, clean design. I don’t know if this is going to reflect a change across the board. Whilst I like the sharp, clean, minimalistic lines of the new bottle, I find they look more generic. I’ve come to associate the ribbed bottles and gold caps with Annick Goutal fragrances so if there is going to be a change, it’ll take some getting used to. Oh and the Les Colognes come in a very generous 200ml bottle, hence the hefty size you see above, which makes sense because you will likely end up using more due to its lack of longevity. At RM800 however, it is still an ouch to the wallet, as with all niche scents. Do you have a favourite cologne or do you prefer wearing a EdT or EdP? Have you a favourite Annick Goutal scent I might like? My experiences with cologne has been a little limited, and in fact only really those by Jo Malone . I do find some stay on longer, and some not as long so much again will depend on the formula and scent, weather and our body chemistry! So complex ?

Damn these limited edition business! ? The reason I’m so anxious that you not miss this one is because I love it. Yes I do! Apologies for the rather well-worn photo of the powder but that’s just how well used it’s been ever since I started using it. The RMK Kaleidoscope Nuance Color Powder was released with the Spring 2014 Play on Pink collection. It comes in 2 shades – 01 Translucent Beige Pink and 02 Translucent Coral Pink. You can see images of both powders in their pristine glory in my previous post here but the one I’m enamoured with is this one 01 Translucent Beige Pink which RMK says is a finishing powder that highlights. To me however, this is just a great finishing/pressed powder that even serves double duty as a skin-evening powder that I wear on its own, which is why I like it so much! ? For comparison purposes, here is a picture of how the powder looks when it’s new. There are these golden shimmer lines on the powder and the powder has a subtle shimmer overspray on the surface. It is for the reason of this shimmer that I wasn’t terribly keen on the powder when I first used it. I found the first few uses made my skin look a bit shiny and I thought that was it. I was ready to write it off and I did. It wasn’t until I had brushed off all the top layer that I realised that the powder itself is mostly matte. It is a combination of a light blue, light pink, beige and brown, that in an ideal world operates both as highlighter and contouring powder. According to the RMK makeup artists, you would use the lower halve, brushing your brush over the blue, beige and pink to highlight and then brushing over the brown, pink and beige to contour. To be perfectly honest, ain’t nobody got time for that ? This isn’t a very large pan of powder and it’s just too fussy to operate it this way. What I do is simply take a brush and swirl it around the whole pan, over all the colours. What you then get is a slightly glowy beige powder with a slight warm-neutral tone. If you squint, like REALLY SQUINT, you might see what I mean in this swatch of the Kaleidoscope Nuance powder below. I even helped you by drawing an arrow to show you where it is ? The powder is mostly matte with just a hint of a glow. On my skin what this translates to is simply an evened out complexion that I like for lazy days. I like wearing this almost like a foundation, by using a slightly dense powder brush or kabuki brush to buff it into my skin. When I use this as a finishing powder, I use a fluffier powder brush to lightly dust it all over liquid/cream foundation to set it. But I realised I much prefer it on its own over a light layer of CC Cream or primer, or BB Cream. Sometimes, the CC Cream and BB Creams don’t give much coverage so I then buff this powder in with a kabuki/dense powder brush and it just pulls my whole look together. I end up with a very light, yet polished base and that’s great for casual days or weekends when I don’t want a lot of product on my skin. Is this similar to other finishing powders I use like Guerlain Meteorites or the NARS Light Reflecting Powder ? Yes and No. Yes, it finishes and sets my liquid foundations when I wear it and no, because I find this imparts a little more colour so I can wear this on its own. It isn’t shimmery and doesn’t give too much of a glow, but it sets well and I find, has fair oil control too. It is in a way, quite similar to the RMK Pressed Powder N which I love , but I do find it has a more beige tone with a bit more glow to it. If this one’s no longer available, the Pressed Powder N might do the trick, but it isn’t a dupe – just possibly a substitute. In a nutshell The RMK Kaleidoscope Nuance powder is a pressed powder comprising of different shades of powder in a pan. While it can be used separately to contour and highlight, I like it best as an all over powder. When I use liquid foundation, I use this with a fluffy brush to set the powder. It doesn’t add colour, but it does set and hold foundation well, so it doesn’t slip and slide. I do not have oily skin, I must say. I however like this powder used on its own like a foundation over a very light BB or CC Cream or primer. I buff it in with a dense/kabuki brush and it evens out my skintone and looks very natural and translucent. Perfect for days when you don’t want to have much on yet want to look polished. Very high quality powder and absolutely worth it. I’m thinking of a back up ? Pros: Fine milled powder, Versatile as it can be used as a finishing powder or as a light foundation, Not shimmery nor shiny, Evens out skintone and leaves skin feeling matte, Not drying Cons: A little pricey, Limited Edition, Initial shimmer overlay is a bit off putting Who will like this: Anyone who likes a good finishing powder, Anyone who likes translucent face powders I’ve been using this a lot recently. I suppose it’s mostly because I’m quite happy with the condition of my skin right now (touch wood!) and I only want a light coverage base just to even out the skintone and add a bit of glow to the skin. For areas that need coverage, I just use a dab of my fave concealer and I’m good to go! Did you take a look at the RMK Play on Pink collection? Did you try this Kaleidoscope Nuance powder? I think this powder is absolutely lovely and it has most certainly grown on me. I’m contemplating picking up a back up and that almost never happens ? The other shade is a coral-pink which would be better used as a blush. I didn’t try it but I always have a soft spot for RMK powders which keep to a very high standard, so this is one I would recommend you take a look at if you have the chance ?

What it is, is a specially packaged YSL Bush Radiance No. 6 in a golden compact decorated with Chinese plum blossoms which brings us to the name – Beauty Blossom Collector Blush Palette . The Chinese character reads ‘chun’ – Spring (It’s one of the very few characters I recognise ? ) This beautiful compact is also released in time for the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations which fall on 31 January this year and I don’t think it could have been any more apt in design and execution. The Chinese New Year is a celebration of red and gold and the YSL Beauty Blossom Collector palette sits well amongst all this gaudiness. Lest you wonder if YSL Beaute has quietly sneaked back into the country, the answer is no. As of now, YSL Beaute isn’t available in Malaysia yet although it might quite possibly change in the near future. Who knows. I got this through Mag of Makeupstash who very quickly helped me snag one of the only 100 pieces available in Singapore and even gifted me a Gloss Volupte Extreme Shine in #207 which is a festive season worthy red. Yes, I have swatched the palette and yes you will get the swatches and low down on it ? I have noticed that this is also available in the UK (Selfridges and Harrod’s £32) and also in Canada (Hudson’s Bay C$55) but not in the USA so it isn’t an Asia exclusive product but neither is it widely available either. The compact is very lovely with a glossy resin protecting the design on the cover of the compact. The Blush Radiance No. 6 is however a permanent shade so if the case doesn’t appeal to you but the content does, then take heart. You will still be able to get the blush. Blush Radiance No. 6 is a quartet of different colours and textures in a shade I’d describe as mauve-rose. Each quarter will give you a different shade but it’s very small so the best way to use this is to swirl your brush and apply to cheeks where you will derive a rosy flush on cheeks. This is actually not a shade I wear often nor will pick for myself if it wasn’t in this palette. As much as I love rosy shade of blush, I find that a deeper rose shade like this one, with it’s slight plummy undertones tend to accentuate the brown tones on my skin which makes pigmentation look more obvious. This is partly the reason I tend to a lighter pink shade because it brightens my skin tone. Swatches: Left – YSL Blush Radiance No. 6 Right – YSL Gloss Volupte #207 The swatch was done by mixing up the shades in the pan and it is of course applied more heavily to show you how the colour looks. On my skin it takes on a slight plummy undertone so while I do think this is a shade that can be used by most skintones (which is possibly why it was chosen) you may want to stay away if you too, like me, have a problem with pigmentation spots on cheeks. Longevity was good and I have used YSL blushes before this with a lot of success so it is one to look into if you have the funds and opportunity. Like I said, Blush Radiance No. 6 isn’t one I’d pick for myself if I had a choice, but I couldn’t pass it up in this beautiful compact. Sue me ? I dug around a bit to see if I had other blushes that might have a similar shade, so if you miss out on this, but like the colour and want a more affordable (or easier to source) option then you have it. Maybelline Angelfit blush in Strawberry – similar shade but more pink Sleek Makeup Flamingo Blush – closest in shade to YSL Blush Radiance No. 6 but more shimmery YSL Blush Radiance no. 6 Chanel Joues Contraste Tumulte – More sheer and more pink and suits my skin better as it brightens my skin more than the YSL one does Tarte Amazonian Clay Blush in Natural Beauty – similar shade but more red toned Here’s how it looks when I wear it. I put on a little more than usual so it’d show up better. On deeper skintones, it will show up better as a rosy flush but on fair skintones you may have to be a little careful and use a lighter hand when applying. I’m also wearing the Gloss Volupte No. 207 Rouge Velours in this face shot just so you have an idea how it looks. It’s a new gloss formula from YSL and it is very pigmented as the swatch above will show. It is in fact, almost like a liquid lipstick, and Mag very kindly picked a colour I’m known to wear – a bright red! But she also cleverly picked one with slightly cooler tones which I feel flatters my complexion better. Talented woman, that one! ? I’ll just briefly run this one down with some initial thoughts. I actually love how YSL used gold with silver in their gloss packaging. It’s different and an interesting attention to detail. The cap closes with a click so you know for sure it’s closed properly and it looks good, doesn’t it? The wand has a rather unique design that allows it to pick up and apply product better on your lips and while I do find that it picks up a little more product than I like, it does make it easier to apply without double dipping. No. 207 Rouge Velours is a pigmented bright red with a slightly cooler undertone. It will flatter most complexions and brightens up the face almost instantly. I like how the texture is opaque yet not sticky or goopy or heavy. It is very nice to wear and is fairly longwearing. The only thing I’m less keen on is the scent which is the same one present in YSL’s other lip glosses. It’s a fair bit too sweet for my tastes. But if you can get over that, it’s a beautiful texture with good strong colour and lovely glossy shine. In a nutshell YSL Beauty has released a special Beauty Blossom Collector Blush Palette in selected countries, which is the permanent Blush Radiance No. 6 in a special limited edition compact with a chinoiserie design in time for the Chinese Lunar New Year. The compact is very lovely and well made and will appeal to collectors of beautiful compacts especially since this one is quite limited in availability. The colour of Blush Radiance No. 6 is a rather medium-deep rosy mauve that will be able to be used by most women, but I feel it to be a little less flattering on my skin as the plum tones accentuates brown spots on my skin. If you have clearer skin than I do, then this shade is very lovely and versatile. But ultimately I’m in this for the packaging ? Gloss Volupte is a lovely pigmented lipgloss that is almost like a liquid lipstick. The unique applicator allows you to pick up sufficient product and apply it more easily to lips to coat it more evenly. I love the colour and texture and shine but I’m not crazy about the sweet scent which is present in most YSL lip products. The colour was a perfect fit for me though! Pros: Blush – Pretty compact, Blush shade will suit light to deep skintones, Finely milled powders make it easy to pick up colour and blend on skin, Not too shimmery nor too matte; Gloss – Strong pigmented colours, Not sticky or tacky, No shimmer, High shine, Lovely packaging Cons: Blush – Colour may accentuate brown spots on skin, Limited availability of this compact worldwide; Gloss – Strong sweet scent doesn’t appeal to me Who will like this: Anyone who loves pretty compacts, Anyone who loves shiny pigmented non sticky lipgloss and doesn’t mind the scent I actually found it very fascinating that YSL released this in conjunction and in celebration of the coming Lunar New Year. It’s a nice nod to the festival and although I’m not all that into Chinoiserie I couldn’t help falling for this one simply because ? Were you lucky enough to pick one of these palettes up for yourself? Did it grab your attention too? I have to say I was very lucky indeed that I could get someone to help me pick this up. We get a lot of Christmas themed makeup but rarely any Chinese New Year themed ones so it’s just really nice that YSL did one, and that I got my grubby mitts on it, of course. Excuse me, any excuse for a blush fiend to pick up another blush hehe… ?

There are 6 Pure Color Vivid Shine lipsticks in this range of which I have one to show you – Pure Color Vivid Shine in Mirrored Orchid . Truth be told, when I hear “metallic” and “lipstick” in the same sentence, I hold back a little. The reminder of the metallic, almost frosty lips from the recent 80s still lingers. Yet, I found Mirrored Orchid not quite as metallic as all that, which is a good thing! The packaging is the same as that for all the Pure Color lipsticks with their shiny golden cover and the clear lucite base that reflects the colour of the lipstick within. Saved me many an extra step in the mornings, when looking for a lipstick to go with my look. For those wondering, yes the signature EL fig scent is still present in the lipstick. Not unpleasant and seems a little lighter than I remembered, but it’s there. But what’s this Vivid Shine and how does it translate into Mirrored Orchid? What is a Mirrored Orchid? Well from what I can understand, this colour is to represent that of an orchid, which is interpreted as a deep plummy-red. The lipstick is infused with loads of shimmer but it doesn’t really go on sparkly nor frosty. Estee Lauder says it gives lips a chromatic finish with lip colours that suit every skintone thanks to the high impact pigments and pearls. Chromatic finish. Gosh, we’ve only heard that in nail polish haven’t we? ? What I find is that the lipstick swatches quite differently on hands and on lips. On hands, it is smooth and feels quite buttery. No grittiness despite the shimmer in there, and the shimmer in the swatch is quite noticeable. Swatches Left: Estee Lauder Pure Color Vivid Shine Mirrored Orchid Right: Guerlain Rouge G Madame Batifole On my wrist, Mirrored Orchid has a decidedly metallic note and appears infused with shimmer. The colour is a red with a plum base which deepens the colour and makes it Fall-appropriate. In our warmer, sunnier climes, it is a little less flattering in the day, but lovely for the evening when you want to channel a deeper, sexier look. On my more pigmented lips, I find the colour is a bit deeper and whilst it is shiny, the metallic note doesn’t turn frosty. What I do realise however is that the formula did not apply as smoothly on my lips as I had earlier thought. Being a deep coloured lipstick, you do have to be careful with the outlines, and if you have flakes on your lips, it’s definitely worth exfoliating or putting down a balm beforehand to get a smooth colour. Pigmentation is superb. It’s all just 1 layer of colour that you see in the 2 swatches above, and for that, it’s impressive. It also isn’t drying. You just have to be a bit careful with application. The shimmer is really only visible up close and there is no frost so all in all, I’d say that this is a nice plum-red lipstick for someone wanting a deeper lip shade with a bit of shine. In a nutshell The Estee Lauder Pure Color Vivid Shine lipsticks are limited edition colours for Fall 2013 with a decidedly shinier texture. Mirrored Orchid is a deep plum-red lipstick with very pigmented colour and saturated shine, that fortunately doesn’t look frosty. Nothing worse than a frosty plum lip! I find the formula, whilst creamy, can catch on flakes on lips and can also accentuate lines if not careful. It also looks more shiny when swatched on the arm, as opposed to wearing it on the lips where the shine becomes a little more natural, and less shimmery. They are beautiful, but I can’t say I’m quite sold on this colour even if it does look rather lovely when worn. Pros: Deep colours and lovely saturated shine, Not drying, Lightweight texture, Very pigmented, Not frosty nor overly metallic when worn on lips Cons: Saturated shine and shimmer may not suit everyone, Formula can catch on dry or flaky skin on lips Who will like this: Anyone who doesn’t mind lipstick with high shimmer shine, Mirrored Orchid would suit someone looking for a plum-red lipstick for the Fall season You will have noticed that I swatched Mirrored Orchid alongside Madame Batifole Rouge G above. In my mind, they had a similar shade and I thought Mirrored Orchid would make a more affordable option for someone looking for this sort of shade. But swatching them side by side showed me they were quite different. Mirrored Orchid is deeper, and more suited to a Fall sort of look. Madame Batifole, whilst gorgeous, is a little brighter. So, they are both different, which justifies you getting both, or if you prefer, getting the more affordable EL one ? Do you transition your lipstick colours for Fall? Do you wear deep colours here in sunny Malaysia? I don’t transition lip colours but pretty much wear light and dark colours all year round. Having bright sunny skies most of the time does make it a bit harder to wear a deeper lip without looking a bit too vampy but when I do pull out a deep lip colour, I keep my makeup simple and let the lip draw attention ?

Sparklies in a shampoo? Why?! See? The very fine shimmer is suspended in the transparent shampoo and translucent conditioner. It so intrigued me I had to use it and see if it left me with a head of sparkly golden hair – wouldn’t that be a treat? ? This silicone and paraben free pair of hair care products are new additions to the popular Mythic Oil range. I have never tried the original Mythic Oil nor it’s complementary products but reviews have been very good. Kept meaning to try, but you know, when you have hair as short as mine, you tend to care a little less about how it looks. At least I do. With my short hair, I just use any old shampoo and conditioner and I haven’t even been using any hair treatments. Saves me a lot of money ? But you know, I was quite impressed by the Mythic Oil Souffle d’or shampoo and conditioner. The Argan and Safflower Oil infused shampoo and conditioner left me with floppy hair (floppy hair for me, is a good thing!). Suddenly I realised that my hair didn’t have to feel stiff as wire all the time! Oh and the shimmer bits? Do I end up with a glittering head? Sadly no you don’t. The golden shimmer washes out of your hair. Boo! ? What fun it would have been otherwise! The Sparkling Conditioner is translucent, which is something quite different. L’Oreal Professional say they are the first in the world to introduce a clear conditioner which might be true. Most conditioners have an opaque creamy texture, while this one is translucent. I don’t agree with the word “clear” because it isn’t clear the way the shampoo is clear. Semantics ? Here’s a close up of the products. The top blob is the Sparkling Shampoo, which is clear and infused with LOADS of golden shimmer. The bottom blob is the Sparkling Conditioner which has less golden shimmer infused in it. What I found is that you don’t need very much product for the Sparkling Shampoo because it lathers up very nicely with very little. I have short hair, so I use just a dollop, not even half a pump. If you have longer hair, use half to a full pump. It washes out clean, without making my hair feel squeaky clean, nor dry or tangled. Very nice. The Sparkling Conditioner doesn’t have the regular slippery feel of conditioners, but then it’s because it contains no silicone. It feels just like a thicker version of the shampoo and I leave it on for a few minutes, then rinse out. What I realised after using this for about a week (I wash my hair daily) is that my hair lost its wire-feel. I have hair with lots of volume and which is prone to dryness. At one time, before I broke this set out, my Mom actually asked me why my hair looked so dull and felt so hard. I never really noticed it, because I don’t do very much with my hair, but it did make me sit up and notice. Also, I was using that Redken Diamond Oil shampoo and conditioner which left my hair feeling like wire and I hated that! My hair was actually starting to kink and stick out, and that only happens when my hair is very dry. This Mythic Oil Sparkling Shampoo and Sparkling Conditioner gave me floppy hair, the way it was meant to be and I love it. I still don’t see the point of the golden shimmer in the product. I think it would have performed as well without the shimmer, which is just superfluous. Pretty, but superfluous. In a nutshell The L’Oreal Professional Mythic Oil Souffle D’or Sparkling Shampoo and Sparkling Conditioner are new products in the Mythic Oil range. The clear shampoo and clear conditioner are infused with minute golden shimmer which I find superfluous as they don’t add to its functionality, and washes out. Otherwise, I really like both these products. My hair has benefited from using it and is now softer, not dry, and feels better. Both products are paraben and silicone free which should please many. Pros: Softens my hard and dry hair, Makes my hair more manageable without losing volume, Does not weigh down hair, Silicone and paraben free Cons: Pricey, Golden shimmer doesn’t serve any purpose except to look pretty Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for paraben free and silicone free shampoo and conditioner, Anyone who has dull, hard and dry hair that needs softening Here are the ingredient lists for both the Sparkling Shampoo and Sparkling Conditioner It says on the bottle that this shampoo and conditioner will suit all hair types. I’m not sure about those with oily or limp hair, but if you have dry, coarse, kinky hair (not THAT sort of kinky, please! ? ) then give this a try. I love it! Do you get what the golden shimmer is for? Have you used the L’Oreal Professional Mythic Oil or any other Mythic Oil products before? I still don’t get the purpose of the shimmer. It looks pretty, but serves no purpose. Rather like.. ok I’d rather not say LOL! I haven’t used other Mythic Oil products but I’ve heard the oil is an excellent dupe for the Kerastase Elixir Ultime and I love that one!

When I come across a scent like this, I want the full size bottle, dammit! ? The one that has me feeling this way is the new Diptyque l’Eau du Trente-Quatre or the new Water 34 fragrance. This is a new scent that is a fresh interpretation of the mainstay, 34 Boulevard Saint Germain. I usually gravitate towards heavier, spicier, woody scents but I can’t quite explain why I am so taken with the freshness of this one. The L’Eau du Trente-Quatre is a 2013 version of the 34 scent and is supposed to be a lighter version, almost made for warmer temperatures, if you ask me. In our hot, tropical weather Water 34 is almost perfect. It spritzes out very lovely fresh citrus notes described as lemon, verbena, bitter orange and grapefruit. It is so refreshing, as if your senses just took a cool shower. I love the fresh notes that don’t smell too citrusy if you know my meaning. I love the smell of lemons and oranges but I don’t particularly want to walk around smelling like I doused myself in lemonade. I risk smelling like I fell into a vat of dishwashing liquid. Yet, behind the fresh citrus notes hides a hint of mellow spice represented by lavender and cinnamon, that I think is what attracts me. Remember I said I love spicy scents? Well L’Eau du Trente-Quatre on me settles down to a slightly warmer scent with that hint of spice in the air and a touch of green offered by the birch tree leaf. It smells almost as if I have just taken a fresh shower! It doesn’t smell soapy, if that’s what you’re wondering, but it does make me feel refreshed, as if I have just walked out of a shower (Have you been counting how many times I’ve used the word “shower”? ? ). It smells… for want of a better word, clean. Yet, there is a lingering powdery, spicy almost musky note that takes me well into the day, developed from the floral geranium and tuberose and resting on a base of cedarwood, patchouli and some incense, enveloping me in its scent. Despite it being an eau de toilette, it lasts me well into a full day. That’s just over 8 hours usually, and I still get the little hint here and there by the time I get home. Its so complex and I. LOVE. IT! ? I just want to keep sniffing myself over and over every time I spritz it on. That didn’t come out right, did it? ? I think this is a great scent for when the weather is warming up (or when its hot as it is here) because it gives that wonderful fresh feeling without ever being cloying. I’ve worked out that most sweet, floral or gourmand scents aren’t my thing except some exceptions, and so I have also realised that many women’s scents don’t quite hit that spot for me. Diptyque on the other hand, seems to fit the niche that my body chemistry and nose gravitates towards. Their scents are for both men and women without segregating them so a man could quite easily wear the same scent I do but yet, could smell quite different due to our different body chemistries. I do find that L’Eau du Trente-Quatre seems a little feminine, but my judgment may be clouded by the fact that I am the one wearing it. Absolutely nothing to stop a man who loves this scent from picking it up as well, and the rather masculine full size packaging does make it a little easier too. I also personally think that L’Eau du Trente-Quatre is a scent that is potentially a little easier for most people to wear. Not every scent in Diptyque hits the spot because I do find them a little more unique and more niche than most, but this one has a little more mass appeal, I think. I don’t plan to finish up this sample vial I have. I plan to save it to tote around when I travel, for a comforting, familiar scent. i tried, but the vial is not refillable so icant use it as a travel atomizer. But to fulfil my love for Water 34, I will be picking up the full size bottle. When you fall in love this hard, its worth it ? Here’s something else that I wanted to share with you that I’m truly taken with – the Hourglass Home Diffuser. None of those reed things that collect dust and easily topple over when I’m not careful (yes, I speak from experience). This comes in a few different popular home scents but what I was really taken with, was that it came in 34 Boulevard Saint Germain! EEEKKKSSS! Now I can get my home to smell of this. So naturally, this has gone on my wishlist. Birthday maybe? I better start dropping hints LOL ? Fragrances are such personal things that I hesitate to tell you to try this one but if you do have a Diptyque counter near you, do take a sniff and have a little spray on your skin. Then, tell me if it captivates you as much as it has me ? Have you smelled this new Diptyque L’eau du Trente-Quatre? Do you have a scent that you’ve fallen in love from just a sample? As I’ve said above, I’ve found that Diptyque scents suit me, my skin and my personality better than other more feminine brands/scents so I’m planning to learn a little more about the perfumes they have and see what else I like. If you can’t pronounce it, just ask for Water 34 so the people at Diptyque know you want this version and not the original 34 Boulevard Saint Germain ?

My hair salon at the time only used and stocked Redken hair products and I was sucked into various products from the brand. My favourite was All Soft with the lovely almond scent and and I loved how lovely and soft my hair felt every time I used it. It also made my shower floor terribly slippery! I haven’t used anything by Redken since I moved away so coming back to the new Redken Diamond Oil hair care range had me with high hopes. The silicone-free Redken Diamond Oil range is targeted at those with dull, damaged hair and claims to be formulated to offer your hair unparalleled shine and really, who doesn’t want shiny hair right? ? This shine is accomplished by adding into the products a combination of natural oils including camelina oil, coriander oil, apricot oil, olive oil, jojoba oil and coconut oil, with the intention that they would condition and repair your hair from inside out and strengthen hair. The “problem” is, that hair is pretty much dead. So I had my doubts about the whole conditioning from inside out deal because it’d be like flogging a dead horse you know. But that’s the claim and I’m here to see if it lives up to it! What do you reckon? The only thing is this. Seeing as how I have very short hair, any “diamond shine” wouldn’t be very noticeable. I also have slightly dry and frizzy hair and my shampoo of choice has been the very affordable L’Oreal Everstrong LOL! Lasts me ages and does the job! But I took the Diamond Oil range for a spin and here’s what I think of them, briefly. Redken Diamond Oil Shampoo – RM63/300ml Hmm, prices haven’t gone up very much since the days when I used to be forking over lots of moolah for these! Sad to say however, I dislike the Diamond Oil Shampoo. After just 3 days of use, my hair felt like straw. I did use the matching Conditioner, mind. So yeah, disliked it, don’t recommend it at all. Redken Diamond Oil Conditioner – RM65/250ml I didn’t think a lot about the Diamond Oil Conditioner either. It didn’t soften my hair after I shampooed it and although the texture was thick and luxurious, it did not leave my hair feeling more manageable. It was telling that after 3 days, my hair had turned into a rat’s nest so I’m giving the Diamond Oil Shampoo and Conditioner just one star. Maybe half a star. Meh. Redken Diamond Oil Deep Facets Hair Mask – Price unknown You’d think that if the shampoo and conditioner sucked, that I’d be all Debbie Downer about the Deep Facets hair mask too right? Well, surprise! I’m not ? The hair mask is a weekly treat for your hair and has a thicker texture. So, apply a generous amount to your hair and leave it in. If you have an oily scalp, you may want to avoid putting it directly on the roots or on your scalp. I am very irreverent so I plonk everything straight on my head ? I don’t have an oily scalp so perhaps that’s why I don’t really care. But when I wash off the mask after a few minutes languishing in the shower (I really should get a tub so I can luxuriate in there for hours and give my hair some pampering. Somehow, it’s not the same in the shower. I get tired ? ) my hair feels lovely! It doesn’t feel super soft, but it felt light and breezy. I can’t tell if it was any shinier, but it FELT nicer. Gets the thumbs up! Redken Diamond Oil Shatterproof Shine Oil – RM108/100ml Ah, I think I’d appreciate this one if I had longer hair because it does live up to its claims. There are 2 versions – Shatterproof Shine which comes in the golden bottle and Shatterproof Intense which comes in a black bottle for more intense repair to hair. This is your regular hair oil which we have seen popularized in the past couple of years. There are a couple of ways you can use it:- Before shampoo – Massage some oil into your hair before you head into the shower. For people with fine hair, this gives you the treatment of the oil without weighing down your hair with product after. I found it made no difference to my coarse, thick hair. Before Blow-drying – I blowdry my hair on most evenings to get it dry before bed, and what I do is run a pump of product through my hair before I blow dry. Unlike the MoroccanOil product , it doesn’t help speed up the drying process, but it did stop my hair from being too frizzy post-blowdry. On dry hair – I also sometimes use it post blow-dry, straight on dry hair. Since I go to bed right after, it is almost an overnight treat for my hair. It doesn’t feel oily, does not weigh my hair down and doesn’t leave oil marks on my pillow. It does however, give my hair a nice shine even if it doesn’t make it feel any softer. I use a full pump i.e. I pump once and pump out all the contents from the dropper into my palm, then massage into my hair. That is what is recommended on the box. 1 pump for shorter hair and 2 pumps for longer hair. I’ve seen people recommend using a few drops. Unless you have very little hair, or are very oil-adverse a few drops aren’t enough. It absorbs very quickly and you will need to ensure it is properly distributed throughout your head. So yes, I do like the Shatterproof Shine oil. I did notice that after using it for a week straight, my hair did look a bit better. A little shinier, a little less frizzy, but this was provided I did not use the Shampoo and Conditioner. When I did, my hair became frizzy and kinky and dry and not even the oil could save it. Yucks! So, Shatterproof Shine Oil, yay; Rest, meh ? Are you a Redken hair products fan? Do you like using oil on your hair? Yes I do realise that you can just as easily use oils straight e.g. Argan Oil so this will come down to personal preference. If pressed, I’d say I prefer the Kerastase Elixir Ultime over this Diamond Oil Shatterproof Shine Oil. I just like the former better and so does my hair. The latter works, but just not as well for me. The shampoo and conditioner, don’t work at all. Maybe my dry, frizzy hair might have appreciated the Intense version better ?

I tried a few brands and products in the early days but if I’m to be honest, few of them really did anything for me. Some even made my skin worse and there were others that gave me contact dermatitis. It is therefore understandable that I’m very wary about using organic or natural skincare. I am living proof that just because something is labelled natural or organic, it isn’t necessarily safe nor effective. Yet, it’s always useful to share of the ones available out there, and one of the new ones in the market is Bio2You that hails from Latvia. The key ingredient in the Bio2You brand is the sea buckthorn. I’ve seen this being used in many natural and organic brands and it is supposed to be quite a wonder plant as it contains high vitamins and antioxidants. I have here the Bio2You Organic Cleanser and Organic Skin Toner to share my thoughts on, so if you are into an organic or natural lifestyle, here’s one more option you have. Bio2You Organic Facial Cleanser – RM88/100ml I like my glass bottles, but tall glass bottles for something that belongs in the bathroom or shower stall? Bad idea. Next packaging bad idea is the dispenser which is a pump, but with a very small nozzle. The Organic Cleanser doesn’t foam up at all, so one pump gives you enough product if this was a moisturiser or a serum, but not for a cleanser. I have to pump it 5-6 more like 10 times before I have enough to clean my skin. The texture is a cream in a erm… creamy colour. It claims to clean off all impurities from skin including makeup. Unfortuantely I will disagree. This isn’t a good makeup remover. It just doesn’t work. As a face cleanser, treat it as you will a cleansing cream or cleansing milk. It isn’t easily removed with just rinsing with water so I need to use a face cloth . This means I use it only in the evening but because I can’t put it in my bathroom, I tend to forget. Quite a conundrum yes? As a face cleanser, if you wipe everything off with a face cloth, then yes, skin feels lovely and clean. It is quite gentle, and feels almost like you’re use moisturiser or a lotion on your face. If you try to rinse it off with water, it’s frustrating. So, I can’t say I love this one. It works, but is just far too much hassle and the packaging just needs so much more work. If you’re interested however, here is the ingredient list. Bio2You Organic Skin Toner – RM88/100ml The Bio2You Organic Skin Toner is quite interesting. It too comes in a tall heavy glass bottle but because this remains on my dresser, I don’t have complaints. Just be sure to put it inside, so you don’t knock it over. My packaging complaint therefore, is the dispenser, which mists out the product in a fine mist. All wonderful really, until you read the instructions that say you are to wipe it over your skin with a dampened cotton pad. How does that work again? So, I spray a piece of cotton pad until it is damp, then wipe it over my skin. I also use it as a face mist as it is supposed to soothe and refresh and it works. Maybe that’s the beauty of a 2 in 1 packaging. The colour of the toner in the bottle is rather unpleasant to look at, being a dark yellow and I will also tell you that it doesn’t smell nice. At. All. I don’t have that sensitive a nose. I mean, I used to use apple cider vinegar as a skin toner and didn’t even flinch. But this one is quite something else. It smells of fermenting plants. Not pleasant. But, I like what it’s done for my skin. It isn’t drying, it hydrates, my skin is left feeling soft and it even seems to clear out my pores. Used with a cotton pad, it functions a little like an exfoliating toner and used as a face mist, it refreshes my skin. It’s great so the only big drawback is the smell. Not pleasant ? Here is the ingredient list for the toner. In a nutshell This is my first time hearing about this brand which originates from Latvia. The 2 products I’ve tried so far are hit and miss. I like the Organic Skin Toner despite its unpleasant scent, because my skin seems to be better after using it. I was using another skin toner before this that I’m not crazy about so switching to this one has been pleasant. The cleanser however is a different kettle of fish altogether. The glass packaging isn’t bathroom friendly and the pump dispenses too little product each time. It doesn’t remove makeup properly and is best used with a face cloth for removal. All in all, too much work for too little benefit. Pros: Cleanser feels pleasant on skin and when cleaned off skin feels soft and comfortable, Toner leaves skin feeling refreshed and hydrated and with regular use, appears to improve skin condition Cons: Tall glass bottle packaging especially for cleanser isn’t user friendly, Pump dispenser in cleanser dispenses too little product each time, Mist dispenser in toner makes it awkward when the instructions call to wipe it on skin with a cotton pad, Skin Toner doesn’t smell pleasant, Not easily available Who will like this: Anyone who wants to expand their organic skincare horizons The “problem” with these is that it is available only at the new Muse by Watson’s store at Sunway Pyramid. It is so far from me that I’ve never even been there yet. Muse specialises in niche brands so I’m assured it’s worth a visit. One day maybe, when I’m willing to make the trek halfway across state ? Have you come across Bio2You before? Do you use organic skincare products? It’s my first time coming across this brand, and I’m feeling a little ambivalent about it. I suppose you could say that I’m not that into organic skincare in that I can take it or leave it. I have had good experiences with some brands and poor experiences with others so I’d say I’m just on the fence ?

Whatever you want to call it. Use it! I have tried so many different brands of sunscreen in my time (and I do have my favourite that I’ve repurchased ) but there is also one you don’t hear a lot of but which I also quite like. I recently found out that the Clinique Derma White City Block is now known as Even Better City Block Anti-Pollution SPF40 PA+++ Sunscreen. Its been a while since I’ve used this one. Last I did was back in 2011 (you can read my review of it here ) and I was later gifted a tube which I used about halfway through before my wandering eye hit hehe… Clinique calls this the City Block Anti-Pollution sunscreen because it doesn’t only protect our skin from the harmful (and terribly aging) UV rays, it also protects our skin against harmful city pollution. During the recent thick haze that shrouded our country and neighbouring Singapore, we were warned to wear face masks that could filter out hazardous particulates from the air when we breathe. These miniscule particulates measure up to 2.5PM and can travel through our respiratory tract and lodge in our lungs, causing us health problems. You can read a little more about this from the New York Department of Health site . Well, according to Clinique, their Even Better City Block not only protects skin against general pollution, it will also block and prevent the PM2.5 particulates from potentially entering our skin through open pores and broken skin and which may potentially cause damage to our skin. Never a better reason to wear your sunblock ladies! Its still pretty hazy out there! I’ve already blogged about this so this serves as a refresher ? As you can see, what used to be known as Derma White City Block is now Even Better City Block. As part of the Clinique Even Better range, what this product also does is even out skin tone while protecting skin against pollution and UV rays. There is a tint to this sunscreen which I find infinitely more flattering than the BB Cream or the CC Cream. As you can see, the tint is a little light (see a better swatch in my earlier City Block review ) but what’s great about this is that it is non greasy, non oily and does not turn orange! Also, I have layered it (I usually put a little more sunscreen on my cheeks) and it doesn’t look unnatural at all. My older, slightly dry skin does like the slightly creamy gel-emulsion texture. If you are the sort who wants something quick and practical for weekends or light makeup days, I think you could just ditch your BB and CC Creams (sorry Clinique CC Cream !) and go instead for this tinted sunscreen or any tinted sunscreen. A tinted sunscreen will offer your skin far more protection than any BB or CC Cream for the simple reason that it is formulated to be first and foremost, a sunscreen and second, makeup. All the alphabet creams I’ve tried thus far are makeup first, skincare second. For this reason, I never take them seriously. Sorry, fans ? The tint is very light of course, so if you have very good skin, this will be all you need. If you don’t have very good skin, this makes a good primer or makeup base. When I use this tinted sunscreen on weekdays, I don’t layer on heavy foundation, but usually only a light tinted moisturiser or a sheer foundation or a powder foundation. Layering thin layers of product actually gives you a much more natural appearance – try it if you don’t believe me ? On weekends, this is all I use. My opinion from 2011 hasn’t changed ( read here ) so I’m not going into specifics here. Although I do have my favourite sunscreen, I am quite happy using this one as well for the slight tint it offers me if I were going out and don’t want to be bare-faced. I would much prefer it to be SPF50 instead of just SPF40 but I suppose that’s better than SPF30 or even… gasp! SPF15! ? Have you tried the Clinique City Block sunscreen? Do you wear tinted sunscreen? I can’t wear the Clinique BB Cream nor the tinted CC Creams because the shades available here are too dark for me. I have heard that the CC Cream (tinted versions, not the primer versions) are quite impressive but as I have said, I’m not sold on the concept. I’d much rather wear a tinted sunscreen because then I’d be more confident that my skin is protected, instead of just looking good ?

If you are anything like me, you’d be a bear in the mornings before your coffee. I walk into the office, and the first thing I do is pick up my mug and head to the coffee machine. Do not even attempt to talk to me before my first coffee because all you’d get is a snarl and a baring of teeth. I’m a bear. Once I’ve had that first sip of caffeinated goodness, black no sugar please, hackles are lowered, teeth are kept away and I’m human again. So when I learned that it is this kickstart to the skin that Origins GinZing Energy-boosting Moisturizer offers our skin, I was most intrigued. This little orange tub holds a number of surprises, to me at least. It contains caffeine extract from coffee beans (yay!) and Panax Ginseng to give your skin a boost of energy. Most of us would be familiar with the effects of caffeine on the body. Most of us won’t be able to function without LOL! As for ginseng, it has been used as a herbal tonic through the ages to heal, rejuvenate, boost energy in various herbal infusions. So here comes the other surprise. With a name like GinZing, and knowing full well there is ginseng extract in there, I was fully expecting to be hit by a strong, musky herbal smell of the ginseng root. Anyone who has ever walked into a Chinese herb shop will know what I mean. Boom! Floors you with the heady smell of ginseng (which I happen to like, mind you!) But it doesn’t smell anything like ginseng! Doesn’t smell like coffee either! What this moisturiser smells of is…. oranges. Oranges? Talk about a boost to the senses, first thing in the morning! So, other than giving our tired skin that kick it needs to wake up in the morning, the Origins GinZing moisturiser wakes up our senses with that fresh zesty smell of freshly peeled oranges. Very refreshing. Although I think they could dial it down a little. I’m not your biggest fan of anything that smells of oranges so I shouldn’t judge. The cream itself is a gel-cream texture which is very lightweight on skin and very comfortable. I was told that this is one of those moisturisers that suit people with oily skin who are leery of putting too much product on because they fear it making them even oilier. If you are one of those, then I will suggest you take a look at this one. For those with combination-dry skin like me, I was told that we may not find this sufficient. There is truth in that statement. I find it insufficient if I were to use it in the evening, but in the day, I was pleasantly surprised that it was alright for me. I sometimes layer it over a hydrating serum in the day and my skin feels comfortable. However, I have also found that I can’t wear this for too long at a stretch because then, the lack of moisture is a little more telling. So, I personally prefer using the Make A Difference Plus+ cream myself. I feel that the Make A Difference Plus+ makes my skin feel better and it looks better too. This GinZing cream is comfortable but only for a week or so at a stretch. The smell of oranges does set me back a little because as I said, I’m not the biggest fan of orange scented anything so this is to be borne in mind if you are in the market for a lightweight gel-cream moisturiser. The other thing many might like is the pricetag – it’s not small but it isn’t too heavy either. The GinZing moisturiser comes in at RM100/50ml which puts it on par with other similar brands and products in the market. I didn’t notice any wonderful glow to my skin or if it looked any more perky after using this. All it did was hydrate my skin and leave it feeling comfortable and that is pretty much what I look for in a day moisturiser. My personal preference still lies with Make A Difference Plus+ but I won’t diss this one either ? In a nutshell The Origins GinZing Energy-Boosting Moisturiser is a lightweight gel-cream moisturiser that may be more suitable for those with oily skin looking for a simply no-frills hydrating moisturiser, or someone who is in the market for a lightweight day moisturiser. It is comfortable and absorbs into skin well without leaving any tacky feeling on skin. My skin does feel hydrated although I can’t use this one for too long at a stretch as it isn’t quite sufficient for my combination-dry skin. So, I use it when I have a hydrating serum on underneath or when it is hot and I want something light on skin. The strong smell of fresh oranges doesn’t quite sit well on my nose but if it does for you then you will like this. I don’t know if my skin enjoyed that shot of espresso delivered to it, but it was comfortable. Pros: Lightweight gel texture, Absorbs quickly and comfortably into skin, Skin feels hydrated, Not sticky or tacky, A little goes a long way Cons: Orange scent is a bit strong for me but dissipates Who will like this: Anyone with oily skin who needs a lightweight moisturiser, Anyone who is in the market for a light moisturiser for use in the day Here is the ingredient list for anyone interested. There is silicone in there, but no parabens, mineral oil, petroleum, synthetic fragrance and colour etc so I suppose it sort of balances each other out LOL! I will caution that there is citrus oil in this so if you are sensitive to citrus oils in products, please take note because some people can’t handle that. I have been asked how this compares to Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Oil Free gel cream and Clinique Moisture Surge Gel Cream and my answer is that I put them in the same category. They serve the market of people who are looking for lightweight moisturisers that deliver moisture to the skin and keep it hydrated and comfortable. Origins GinZing has the added benefits of “waking up tired skin” in addition to hydration but texture-wise I find them all similar and they are also roughly similarly priced. Go for whichever one you feel most comfortable using ? Have you tried this one? Do you like orange scented products? I believe there’s been a GinZing eye cream out in the market for a while already but I haven’t tried that, if you are waiting to ask LOL! I like citrus scents and I enjoy eating oranges but I find orange scented products a bit too strong and sweet somehow. Nice to smell but not quite me. This might also be why I prefer the Make A Difference Plus+ which I’m on my way to using up. It better not all run out on me at the same time! ? I know I’m a billion years late with this one after everyone in the local blog scene has gone through it but, no apologies ? Consider this one a refresher – as fresh as the scent of GinZing haha! <- cheesy ? Paris B Origins GinZing Energy-Boosting Moisturizer Price: RM100/50ml Availability: Origins stores and counters']"

A few weekends of jetsetting (hur hur) and full work weeks in between have taken its toll on my poor ol’ body and I was starting to have trouble sleeping. Its like your body knows its tired and that it needs rest but it just can’t, if you know what I mean. Amani Salon & Wellness Centre is a new spa/salon that just opened in February 2013 and is located in The Scotts Garden, Old Klang Road. Parking is relatively ample and so far, quite affordable which is a good thing because their signature package, which I think you should try if only for the experiece, is a 4 hour long journey. Oh yeah… ? I’ll tell you a little more about it and if you are good and indulge me till the very end, you’ll see that I’ve wrangled a nice little discount for MWS readers who’d like to try this. So, indulge me k? ? The location of the spa is a little awkward. You have to go right to the top floor of the building which is a little quiet and the signages are a little confusing. But if you call them, they will be able to direct you to the place quite easily. At Amani Salon & Wellness Centre, I was pleased to know that they use Bioessentials spa products and Sundari skincare products for facials. Bioessentials is a brand of quality spa products from Australia and I have come across them before a few years back. I still own a pillow mist that I sometimes use to try to lull me to sleep. Sundari is a spa/salon brand of skincare that I’d come across many many years ago but because its not a brand you can buy off the shelves, I never paid attention to it. Both are quality brands and I was encouraged that they use them at Amani. I do have a little more faith in a place that uses proper quality products as opposed to no-brand no-name stuff because I am quite particular about what goes on my skin. I took a friend along for a 2 hour body massage for an independent opinion (we paid full price). I like doing that because its always useful to have a separate opinion of the services. The Amani Signature Ritual (RM335) which spans 3.5-4 hours (yes, do allocate half a day for this!) starts off with you filling up a form to indicate if you have any sensitivities or allergies. Then, you are allowed to store your belongings in a bank of lockers and you get to keep the locker key with you at all times. I ran into a bit of problem at this point. The lockers are standalone. Its not in a changing room so all you do is store your belongings. I would much rather they be placed in a changing room and that we be allowed to change into a robe and keep our clothes in the locker, much like how it is in Energy Day Spa . As it stands, it all got a little awkward as you will see. I was then led to a wet area for the first leg of my treatment – a body scrub, body wrap and jacuzzi bath. At Amani, the wet and dry treatment areas are kept separate. The “problem” I mention happens right here in the wet room. There was no place for me to hang my clothes after changing out of them. You are given disposable undies that barely cover anything but that’s pretty much expected so I don’t bother about that. If you go for a spa experience, always be prepared to have your body on view ? I would therefore strongly suggest to the management that a hook or hanger be placed in the room, behind the door or on the wall for us to hang our clothes, or that a changing room be used. The body scrub was a scrub with oil and salt that did feel quite rough against my skin. You are essentially also getting a bit of a massage because they do rub it in. You can tell the therapist to ease up which I did. After you are scrubbed all over, a herbal body mask is applied and you are then zipped into a heated blanket type thing for you to ‘marinade’ for about 20 minutes. Again, if its too hot, do let them know and I did. Once you are done, you head off to the shower where I noticed the use of Bliss shower gel in shower which is again a nice touch. A recognisable brand goes towards me having a wee bit more confidence in the place. I must note that the wet treatment rooms are raised so when you exit, you have to step downwards and a little care should be exercised so you don’t trip and fall. Maybe a warning strip or non-slip mat would be helpful. Once you’ve rinsed off the mask, you will notice just how lovely and soft and smooth your skin feels. It really does feel amazing. Like a month’s worth of tiredness and dirt have been peeled off! Head back to the room for a rose scented milk jacuzzi bath where you are left for about 20 minutes to relax, and you’re done. This all takes about an hour. The massage treatment rooms are located in a separate section so you do have to pad about a little in your robe. It is all quite private but I do think it would be nice to have them either all in one place, or at least close by. The massage room is nicely dim with a comfortable massage bed. In here, there is a place to hang your clothes, but you may remember my clothes were left behind in the wet room. Uh oh ? My friend was a little perturbed by the fact that although there was space to hang clothes, the locker outside was still used. That may not be necessary, I feel if someone were just coming for a massage treatment. The body massage was rather invigorating. If you prefer someone with a lighter touch, do let them know ahead of time. The masseuse I got had a very firm touch which I used to enjoy a few years ago but these days, I prefer having a more medium-gentle touch for a more relaxing experience. The knots in my muscles were worked out quite well, but it did feel a little sore during execution although I didn’t feel sore after the treatment. My body did feel lighter and I went home for an excellent night’s sleep, but during the treatment itself, it can get a little painful. So do bear this in mind and ask for someone with a lighter touch. One thing I did particularly like was the use of warm oil during the massage. The feeling of warm oil against the skin is much more relaxing and also better for you. My friend who had the 2 hour massage found it a little more relaxing than I did although the touch was firm but then that was the preference so it suited their style. I would personally prefer something more gentle and relaxing that would put me to sleep. The treatment ends with a brief facial using Sundari skincare products. Personally, I wouldn’t visit for a facial because I’ve found that if a trained body masseuse does a facial, they are never quite as gentle as a trained facial therapist. So it felt more like a facial massage than a relaxing facial. Once it was over, I had to wait for a bit while the masseuse went and brought my clothes back from the wet area. If I do have another comment, it would be that the little window in the sliding door which I noticed after my treatment was over, shouldn’t really be there. It disrupts your privacy during the treatment and after, when you are changing. So that’s something I’m not comfortable with and I hope its covered up. In a nutshell Amani Salon & Wellness Centre is a new city spa located in the Old Klang Road area and also has a skills training institute next door. The masseuse were all local so language and communication isn’t much of a problem. The Centre specializes in “Spa Journeys” which have a combination of treatments usually involving a wet and dry treatment – body scrub/bath and a massage and range from 2 to 4 hours. I like that they use quality spa products for face and body and it all smells natural and comforting. I do feel that a little more attention could be paid to the little things like having a place to hang clothes in the wet area as well as perhaps having a common changing room with the lockers for comfort. Also, do be sure to let them know if you want a soft touch for your massage. I had the feeling most of them are trained for deep tissue massage which is generally firmer and can be painful. After the treatment, you do feel lighter, but it isn’t a treatment you can fall asleep to. I wouldn’t go there for a facial either as I felt the facial massage was too strongly executed but that said, it isn’t a focus at Amani. Overall, the Amani Signature Ritual is a nice way to get back in tune with yourself because for that 4 hours, its just you and your therapist. What I liked: The oils used during the massage were warm which is comfortable and relaxing, The products used are of high spa quality, Local masseuse makes communication a breeze, Body scrab and wrap treatment left my skin feeling very soft, Nice dim lighting in the massage room and a comforting cool pillow over your eyes when you are lying face up What can be improved: Somewhere to hang your clothes in the wet room, A proper changing room so you don’t have to wonder where to place your clothes as you can put it straight into the locker, To cover up the little window in the sliding door to the massage room, To have some form of warning that there is a step down when exiting the wet treatment room You can find the Amani service menu on their website here . Prices for a massage start from RM38/6o minutes (Academy i.e. trainee) to RM180/90 minutes. Or try the Amani Signature Ritual which I experienced, at RM335/3.5 hours. And herein lies the promotion I managed to wrangle out of the lovely folks at Amani! ? Promotion! If you want to give Amani Salon & Wellness Centre a try, tell them you were referred from “MyWomenStuff.com” when you make your reservation and you get 25% off any treatment of your choice , except for any on-going promotions. Reservations are recommended as they are rather busy. Promotion valid until 31 August 2013. Have you been for a spa or massage session recently? Have you been to Amani Salon & Wellness Centre? I try to go for one at least once a month or if not, at least once in 2 months. Its a little luxury I allow myself and it does help me and my well-being. I think Amani might appeal to those who live in and around the area but its a little far off the beaten track if you live in the heart of KL city as I do.
