In fact, their ads had me taking a second look. I even pit them in a head-to-head battle to see which was better. My loyalties and conclusion then, was that the Dior Addict lipstick reigned supreme. Truly, the formula of the Dior Addict is what had me falling in love with Dior lipsticks and makeup in general. Here’s what they used to look like , when I first started buying them. It had a translucent dark blue cover and a gold tube, a moisturising formula and a nice wash of colour – not too sheer, not too intense. Since I am such a huge fan of the Dior Addict lipsticks, and since every version they’ve come up with so far have wowed me, I wasn’t planning to be too critical about this new 2015 version fronted by Jennifer Lawrence. I mean, they’re essentially preaching to the converted, yes? However, when I started playing with these, I confess to a slight sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. My HG lipsticks seem to have taken a hit in terms of formula, and what this tells you, as far as I’m concerned, is that I feel that the quality of the new Dior Addict lipsticks are not up to par with what they used to be. There, I’ve said it. I’ve read more than a few reviews that have said that these new Dior lipsticks are as good as the previous formula. I’d humbly disagree. I feel that the new version is now far too sheer, far too sparkly and not moisturising enough. I’d like to call this the Peter Phillips disease. He helmed Chanel and released the new Chanel Rouge Coco back then. I didn’t like it – it was too drying even if I seemed to be the only one saying so. When he left, Chanel reformulated their Rouge Coco lipsticks and it’s now SO. MUCH. BETTER! When I heard he’d switched sides to join Dior, my heart sank. And now that he’s had a hand in the Dior Addict lipstick reformulation, my biggest fears are realised. Unlike many who may love the product, or the man behind it, I’m not one of them. Let’s just say Peter and I don’t see eye to eye in terms of lipstick texture ? And with this preface in mind, let me walk you quickly through the new Dior Addict lipsticks and show you some swatches of the 4 principal colours in the core collection. I have to say however, that the new packaging for the Dior Addict lipsticks are lovely. The pearly finish of the case is retained, and given a shinier appearance. The packaging is slimmed down and simplified, and the lipstick now slips into the cover and stays put with a magnet. The upgraded packaging is most certainly noteworthy. However, the name of the lipstick is only found on a little sticker at the base of the cover. So, if you have a couple of these, and you don’t take care which cover you use, you will in all possibility mis-name them if anyone asks what you’re using. As for the lipstick bullet itself, it retains the flat, round surface that makes it easy to apply. Due to the formula and the more casual vibe of the the colours and textures, this isn’t a lipstick that requires precision in application. As part of the reformulation, the centre, or core, of the lipstick sports the CD logo in a slightly contrasting colour. We had seen this in Dior’s Summer 2015 collection (that I opted out of since tie-dye isn’t my thing) and if I’m to be honest, I don’t like it. Happily, once you start using the lipstick, the surface flattens out and the CD logo is less noticeable. What this “core” is, according to Dior, is an ultra-moisturising core that gives lips a shine, rather like that of a top coat. It runs all the way through so it’s always there. The lipstick is infused with oils that help moisturise the lips. I don’t know how it is then, that I feel this new formula to be more drying than before. It didn’t make sense to me. For some reason, I felt that this new Dior Addict lipsticks don’t apply as smoothly on the lips, nor do they aid in moisturization, the way the previous formula did. It used to be that when my lips felt dry, a slick of the Dior Addict lipstick was what kept the flakies at bay, while adding colour and some shine. However, when I was using these recently, with slightly dry lips, it only accentuated the dryness and lines. I also realised that they didn’t slick on very smoothly. Dior Addict Lipstick – Tribale, Be Dior, Smile, Wonderful swatched 2 times down my arm In terms of colour, I found these quite lacking. In tube, they look fairly pigmented. On skin, they are very very sheer. Even Be Dior, which is the deepest shade here, is a mere wash of transparent colour. I felt a little cheated. Tribale 451 – This is a lovely coral in tube, with noticeable shimmer/glitter particles in the tube, but none when swatched. The colour is a very transparent, light coral. Be Dior 976 – A lovely berry red in the tube with little to no noticeable shimmer or glitter, it swatches on skin a transparent berry red. Good if you want to ease into wearing red lipstick but not so good if you were expecting a deeper tone. Smile 553 – A pale nude pink with no noticeable shimmer, that applies a light sheer pink Wonderful 561 – A pink with noticeable shimmer that swatches a pale, transparent pink with noticeable glitter On lips, as you will see below, the texture and colours weren’t as flattering as I was hoping they’d be. For the record, for Smile, Wonderful and Tribale, I applied at least 3 layers to get the colour to show up. Be Dior was applied 2 layers. A shade like Tribale would have previously gone on a slightly deeper coral. Now, it’s a bare wash of colour. My least favourite is Wonderful, which gives a frosty appearance to my lips that I absolutely dislike. It made the lipstick look cheap and this isn’t cheap, folks. It’s DIOR for goodness sake! I expect more from Dior than frosty pinkness. So it appears to me that Dior has now gone and infused glitter into their lipstick, which bugs me. Glitter has a bad way of making lipstick look frosty, and honestly, it isn’t flattering. I’d personally pick the ones that are glitter-free. For some reason, the texture of those are better as well. If you’re wondering, yes, if I mash my lips together, I feel the fine glitter particles in Wonderful, and that bugs me more than you’ll realise. Here’s how it looks in a full face shot, just for you to have an idea on the shades. Between Smile and Wonderful, I’d pick Smile because it is more flattering without that awkward frosty shine. Tribale is a colour I’d have preferred if it was deeper, a little more like how it looks in the tube. Be Dior is alright, as sheer red lipstick goes, but there’s something about the texture that doesn’t sit well with me. As I’ve noted, I feel it to be more drying than before, which is unusual. Dior says that the “ultra moisturising core” will give your lips a shine akin to that of a top coat (like that of nails) but if I’m to be honest, I don’t find these to be any more shiny or glossy than the previous version. I suspect a lot of the shine comes not from this “core” but from the glitter/shimmer and that to me isn’t true to what Dior Addict lipsticks are or were like. Dior Addict lipsticks used to be the most moisturising lipsticks I’d ever worn, which allows me to use them even like, or in place of a lip balm. But with this new formula, I’m not enamoured with it. I feel that what was a winning formula has been messed with, and I’m not happy about that ? It is also noteworthy that with this new Dior Addict range of lipstick, the old Addict and Addict Extreme have been discontinued. Some colours have been carried over to the new formula, but a friend has told me that she found the colour and texture to be dissimilar even though the product has the same name. I’m sad. I was a huge huge fan of the Dior Addict and Addict Extreme lipsticks and I sang their praises from the time I started blogging till… well, now. I’m afraid I’m not in love with this new Addict formula, nor do I think it to be similar, or even better than the previous formula. Perhaps it’s because I have been using them a while, or perhaps I have a basis for comparison. Perhaps, if I wasn’t so hung up on how wonderful they were, I’d be more forgiving. But the fact is I am. Sorry folks, gotta live with my whinging ? IN A NUTSHELL Dior reformulated and relaunched the Addict Lipstick collection with a new formula and packaging. The new packaging is sleek and attractive and modern. I like it, and it no longer clicks in place, it’s held in place by a magnet. The formula is supposed to be more moisturising, with a core that coats lips with a shiny top coat, and moisture. The CD logo goes all the way through and in some shades, come in a contrasting colour. Personally, I’m not a fan of the new version. I feel the texture to be a little dry and drying, the colours to be too sheer compared to what they were before, and they are too glittery. While the sheerness of texture means most colours are wearable, it also means that you should just forsake the light shades because they’ll all look more or less the same. I’m not a fan, sorry Dior. PROS: Sleek packaging is attractive, Sheer texture makes it easy to wear bold or deeper shades CONS: Too sheer and too glittery, Not moisturising, Dry texture tugs at my lips WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who hasn’t used the old Dior Addict ranges, Anyone who wants a sheer wash of colour and shine in a lipstick, Anyone who wants to try wearing bold shades but don’t want colours that are too intense Am I too hard on these? Yes, I think I am. But can you blame me, a long time user and fan of the Addict lipsticks? ? I think if you’re new to the Addict line, then you may not be as critical and may even like this new formula and texture. It’s just that I have a basis for comparison, and I’m going to stop apologising right here. I didn’t like these. Period ? Have you tried these new Dior Addict lipsticks? Do you like them? If you did, by all means say so. I realise that I’m probably the only person so far who isn’t truly enamoured ? So what I’ll be doing is going and buying up some of the colours I missed in the older formula. I’m sure they’ll be still available online and at least I’ll be able to get some good use out of what used to be my holy grail lipstick. Boo hoo ?

Almost there! Anyone still with me? This week, the cushions are a mixed bag, featuring a Japanese brand, a couple of Western brands, and featuring some Korean brands too. The categories will be kept as per previous posts, so you can refer back to them all and it’ll look fairly familiar. The difference will be in the products featured. Also, I will do a round up at the end of the week, just to give closure to this week. To see all the cushion foundations I’ve featured, you can go here . Some time last year, Korean brand Mamonde released 2 new cushion foundations. I decided to cover them at the same time, because they are from the same brand, although on hindsight, I think it would have been better to separate them. They are the Mamonde Brightening Cover Watery Cushion and the Mamonde Brightening Cover Powder Cushion . Some of you may remember that I featured the Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion in the K-Beauty edition of the Cushion Foundation Week. It was one of the more affordable options I’d tried, with very high coverage. This one is no exception. Cushion Foundation: Mamonde Brightening Cover Watery Cushion and Brightening Cover Powder Cushion The two new additions to Mamonde’s cushion foundation are both “Brightening” which in cosmetics speak means that they make skin look more radiant and brighter. But they come in 2 versions, ostensibly for 2 different types of skin type. The Mamonde Brightening Cover Watery Cushion (blue cover) is tailored for those with drier skin, offering a more hydrated, dewy finish. I find the coverage in this version very high, and the shade half a shade lighter than I expected. In person, it is less obvious but in photos, it looks significantly lighter and a little unnatural. I can fix it with a bronzing powder to warm up the complexion, but it does still look rather unnatural. I also find it to be a little more tacky than I prefer, and it felt heavy. Do note that I have dry skin and would be the prime candidate for this cushion. The Mamonde Brightening Cover Powder Cushion (white cover) is tailored for those with oily skin, offering a more semi-matte finish. I also find the coverage in this one very high, but a little less than the Watery Cushion. The shade too is more natural, as it is bright, but not as bright as the Watery Cushion is, in the same shade. It is also less heavy on my skin, and I did not find it to be particularly drying, although that seems to be a common lament. I personally prefer this version, but it still had a very opaque look on skin that seemed less natural than I expected. It did settle into fine lines, and as the day wears on, weighed on my skin. I had to be very careful to be lighthanded with patting the product on my skin, as it is otherwise too high in coverage. I wear Shade #21 in most Korean cushion foundations. But I find that Shade #21N (Neutral) in this case is just too “white”. I’m not sure how people who have a deeper skintone than I do are pulling this off in this same shade, unless they are merely swatching for their blog or the camera, and not wearing it out of the house. Honestly, it will not be flattering. Personally if I was looking for coverage, I’d opt for either one of the Shiseido cushions or even for the Clarins . Those feel much more comfortable on my skin. This won’t be on my list. Sunscreen protection : SPF50+ PA+++ Not much talked about, but this has SPF50 PA+++ rating which is good enough. While with most cushion foundations, you can tote them around to top up your sunscreen through the day, I’d not recommend you do that with this one, as the coverage is just far too high and you’d end up with very cakey looking skin. The Packaging & Refills I believe that this one comes with just the case and refill without an additional refill. I could be wrong, but that seems to be the information I have, and that surprises me because most Korean brands will include an additional refill. However, the price is significantly lowered, which makes up for it, I suppose. It is otherwise very well constructed. The case is like a donut with a cover, so you clip the refill into place and it fits nicely without any rattling. The covers clips and stays shut, and it just feels well constructed and not cheap at all. It actually reminds me a lot of Laneige packaging! The Cushion The cushions in the Mamonde Brightening Cover Watery Cushion and the Brightening Cover Powder Cushion are a little different. While they are both fairly traditional, being the flat porous sponge that we have seen from the start, I find that the cushion is a little soft, so you will find yourself depressing your sponge puff further into the product than you expect. Due to the texture of the product, this also means you pick up a lot more product than you really need. When new, touching the sponge to the surface of the cushion is quite enough. As you go along, you will have to adjust your pressure accordingly. However, if you look at the sponge cushion, you might notice that the Brightening Cover Powder Cushion (peach border) has a rather more saturated, denser appearance, as opposed to the lighter appearance of the Brightening Cover Watery Cushion. I found the latter to be a little more “wet” so I ended up picking up more product on the sponge than I expected. The formula for the Powder Cushion is a little drier. The Sponge Puff The Mamonde sponge puff now takes on a beige colour, that reminds me of the puff used in Sulwhasoo cushions . Previously, it looked similar to that from Laneige. Do note that as they are all from the same mother company, this isn’t very surprising. True to feel, the sponge is very good, with the right density for patting product onto your skin and helping it adhere better. TO USE: Slip your fingers through the loop (it only accommodates 3 fingers for me so I find it a little small), dab the sponge on the surface of the cushion and then dab it on your skin, in a press and roll motion. Press on skin, and roll it off. It helps the foundation adhere better to your skin. As the texture of the cushions are quite high coverage, I do find that used in conjunction with the puff, I only need 1-2 pats of product to cover my whole face. Not a lot of dabbing on the cushion required. Texture, Coverage & Finish If you are looking for a cushion with coverage, and other brands are out of budget, then it is Mamonde to the rescue! The coverage of these cushions are crazy! As I said above, the texture of both cushions are slightly different, but both boast very high coverage with a brightening effect. What I find this does is also make the base look a little lighter than is flattering. In person, it is less noticeable. But in pictures, you can clearly see the white cast. I also found the formula heavy. For some reason, I think the earlier version of the Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion was better. In these before-after pictures, I’m wearing the Mamonde Brightening Cover Watery Cushion in Shade #21N . The coverage is high, and it all but covers any blemishes or imperfections on my skin. But it also makes it look a little more flat. You may see some dewiness coming through. This is the Watery Cushion, and it is supposed to look more “glowy”. In person, it looks “wet”. I’d powder it down, because it really does look like I’m just sweating through my base. In the following picture, I’m using the Mamonde Brightening Cover Watery Cushion in the same Shade #21N . The shade looks more natural in this one, I think you’d agree. It also has a more matte finish, without that dewy shine. I do find that after a while, both versions had a tendency to settle into lines. This might be because it is so thick, that you will notice it. The trick of course, is to use very little, and spread it out so you only get a thin layer on your skin. That way, the settling will be less obvious. If you layer the product you will find that it quickly looks unnatural. It also seems to cover up any natural glow you have in your skin, and doesn’t have that transparency and natural appearance that I find in brands like Hera , Sulwhasoo or Shiseido . Those brands offer coverage too, but it looks far more natural and therefore more flattering. After quite a number of hours, I found that it felt heavy on my skin. I know there’s foundation on it, and I just want to wash it off. That sort of feeling. Shade selection Shade selection is fairly poor at this point in time, since they are primarily based in Korea for now, with only a new foray out into the global market now. There are 3 shades available #17, 21 and 23 for very light, light and light medium skintones. They did expand it a little by offering 21N, 23N and 23N, 21C for yellow and pink skin tones respectively. But to me, there isn’t very much difference, as the range of colour is still limited. Anything deeper, I’m afraid you’d have to go to elsewhere for your cushions. Scent I found that there was a strong scent of alcohol in this that I dislike. Perhaps it isn’t, but it was that strong chemical scent that you associate with alcohol. Not floral at all, which surprised me as the previous one smelled floral. Do I like this? Not really. I find it too heavy in terms of texture, and too unnatural looking on the skin. The coverage is very good, which is something in its favour. But otherwise, I find the shade a little off, too brightening to be unnatural. It just doesn’t feel as refined as many other cushions I’ve tried (and I’ve tried quite a few!) and that is rather unfortunate, for this is affordable. IN A NUTSHELL The Mamonde Brightening Cover Watery Cushion and Brightening Cover Powder Cushion has SPF50+ PA+++ and is good if you want a higher coverage cushion foundation in an affordable, well made compact. The shade selection is very small, tending to the lighter end of the skintone spectrum, but the coverage is nothing short of amazing to the extent of being a little too high. I do find it settles into fine lines if you pile it on, but if you wear a very thin layer, it’s not a bad product. However, the trick would be to find the right shade, for I find the shades in these Brightening Cover ranges a little too bright and light. The Watery Cushion I find too glowy for my liking. If I were to choose, I’d pick the Brightening Cover Powder Cushion because the shade is less stark against the skin, and its semi-matte finish looks better too. PROS: Evens out skintone very well, Mid to high coverage depending on how much you use, Easy to use, Not drying nor oily, High sunscreen protection, Portable packaging CONS: Chemical scent, Can look heavy and cakey on skin if you layer too much, Shades are half a shade too bright on skin, Texture feels heavy on skin, Watery Cushion is too “dewy” on skin WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a higher coverage cushion foundation, Anyone who wants a well packaged cushion with good coverage at an affordable price PRICE: RM90 | US$36 for a box containing 1 case & 1 refill. Prices will vary depending on where you buy from as it is available on many different websites as well WHERE TO BUY: Mamonde counters, various websites or Korean sites if you know where to look, Ulta (shade names are different) If you’re interested, here is the ingredient list for the Brightening Cover Watery Cushion:- Water / Aqua / Eau, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/ Dicaprate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polymethyl Methacrylate, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77492), Alcohol, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Acrylates/Ethylhexyl Acrylate/Dimethicone Methacrylate Copolymer, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Sodium Chloride, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Iron Oxides (CI 77491), Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Menthyl Lactate, Fragrance / Parfum, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Caprylyl Glycol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Dimethicone/Polyglycerin-3 Crosspolymer, Iron Oxides (CI 77499), Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium Edta, Butylene Glycol, Narcissus Tazetta Bulb Extract, BHT, Dipropylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Sodium Citrate, Polyphosphorylcholine Glycol Acrylate. I don’t have the ingredient list for the Brightening Cover Powder Cushion. Have you tried these Mamonde cushions or the previous Mamonde cushion? I can’t deny that I like the price tag. It’s so affordable for something that you can just try to see if you like it. While these aren’t for me, I’d like to know if you tried and liked them. Maybe I’m using them wrong LOL! ?

It’s a popular skincare product in Asian, particularly Korean skincare ranges and can be found in all ranges, from the wallet-friendly budget priced ones to the higher end pricey ones. I find it interesting that few Western brands have hopped on this trend, because I think sleeping masks are the best thing ever! The reason I often get lazy to use a mask (yes, I get lazy too!) is because I get lazy to clean my face twice (or 3 times) in one routine. Often, a hydrating or treatment mask comes in a cream form that you apply, leave on then rinse off before going on with the rest of your skincare routine. With a sleeping mask, you apply it, leave it on and go to sleep. HOW EASY IS THAT? Why aren’t more brands making sleeping masks? Who knows! But I’m glad the Koreans are. And I’m especially glad to have picked this one up from department store (and slightly more luxurious) brand, Sulwhasoo. I remember a few readers telling me in the comments last year, just how lovely this mask is, and one day when I was passing by the counter, I decided to splurge. I can’t remember the price anymore. It’s been too long but it could be something close to RM200. But man, do I love this! Previously I used to use the very popular Laneige Sleeping Pack , which is pretty good if you ask me, but this aging skin needs MORE! More attention! More treatment! More revitalizing goodness! And this Sulwhasoo Overnight Revitalizing Mask gives me all that ? Unlike other sleeping packs I’ve used, the Overnight Revitalizing Mask comes in a tube. The texture too is unlike most other similar products I’ve ever used. It’s a cream. A fairly thickish cream that spreads very easily on the skin. I have read of people saying that this feels heavy or oily on their skin and if so, I’m going to venture a suggestion that it might be because they aren’t suited to this mask. The Overnight Revitalizing Mask is meant to nourish, hydrate, treat and revitalize skin that is tired and dry or dehydrated. This then, isn’t just a hydration treatment and I might venture to say, isn’t meant for those who have combination-oily skin. But if you have drier, dehydrated or slightly more ‘mature’ (ahem!) skin, then I think you might enjoy using this as much as I do. I don’t apply too much of the mask, because it’s quite pricey, and because I don’t think more is necessarily better sometimes. With a gel-based sleeping mask, I do find that I need more because it dries out quickly but with this cream based one, I just apply a thickish layer but not so much that I see a white layer on my skin. That’s too much. I find that it absorbs into my skin quite easily, particularly when my skin is feeling tired or stressed, and does not feel sticky, goopy, heavy or uncomfortable. What I like even better is that it doesn’t leave a lot of residue on my skin, so I don’t mark my sheets or pillow case! When I was using other types of sleeping masks, that sometimes happens because I read in bed and it bothered me. With this one, it just feels like I applied a slightly thicker layer of moisturiser on my skin. But what’s so nice about this mask then? Well, how about the way I wake up to calmed, supple, hydrated skin? I should be using this a little more often, but I particularly like using it when my skin is stressed. When I’ve had a late night, or if I’m feeling particularly stressed, or when I’d like to put a fresher face forward the next day, or just whenever I feel like the ol’ facial skin needs a bit of perking up, I use this mask and it always delivers. My skin looks better the next morning, my makeup goes on more easily and I use less foundation. Win, all around! ? I do have to mention the scent. Like most Sulwhasoo products I’ve tried, it has a herbal-ginseng scent that you will either love or hate. This one has a ginger-ginseng scent and I enjoy it. I find it calming. But then, I like Chinese/Asian herbs. If you aren’t familiar with scents like this then you may not enjoy it as much so do take note. Otherwise, I have nothing but raves for this mask. I’ve actually had this for quite a while and it does last a fairly long time, if you don’t use it very often, or if you use it once a week. I use this after cleansing and after a spritz of rosewater. Apply this mask on, read a book and go to sleep. Sometimes, when I’m feeling a bit adventurous or I feel like my skin needs something more, I apply a thin layer of facial oil on my skin, work it in and then apply a layer of this mask. I think I’ve found my Holy Grail sleeping mask so no more gel masks for me! ? IN A NUTSHELL The Sulwhasoo Overnight Revitalizing Mask is a cream based sleeping mask that you apply on your skin and then go to sleep. As the texture is a cream base, it can feel heavy if you apply too much or if you don’t have dry or dehydrated or mature skin, which I think suits this mask better. Apply a layer of product (it isn’t necessary to use too much) and go to sleep. My skin looks brighter, calmer, and more supple the next morning. I find it especially good when my skin or I am feeling stressed. There is a rather strong herbal-ginseng-ginger scent that may not appeal to everyone but I find it calming.

No sender details, just like my mystery package from Bite last year. It was truly a mystery. But when I opened it, I let it a squeal of delight – and you know I don’t squeal. Inside, was every single one of the (then) brand new Marc Jacobs Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon pencils! I was stoked and stumped all at once. The Marc Jacobs Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon is the matte version of their bestselling Highliner Gel Eye Crayon, which contains shimmer. While I had been very impressed by the Marc Jacobs liquid eyeliner , I had yet to try their pencil liners. This came at an opportune time, for I’ve been using colourful eyeliners in place of eyeshadow for a while – call it laziness or just a bit of apathy. Oh and this is going to sound really trite, but these liners are AMAZING! I swear, they don’t transfer at all, not one bit! That is what impressed me the most. Let me show you how they hold up to water in my little experiment. The Marc Jacobs Highliner Matte eyeliners come in silver bodied pencils, but are retractable. I like that, and it’s easy to twist up and twist back down. If you prefer a sharper tip, a sharpener is included, at the back of each pencil. You just have to pull it out, and it sharpens the liner. This isn’t terribly innovative, as we’ve seen this before in many brands now. But it’s clever as it means you won’t lose it, and you can take it everywhere you go. However, I will warn you that you won’t get a nice sharp tip as you will when it arrives. If you see that cobalt blue pencil at the bottom left, it has been manually sharpened by me, and the tip is a little off, as compared to the others which are brand new from the box. The other thing I will note is that the texture of the pencil is quite soft. In our tropical heat, it is liable to break, especially if you put too sharp a tip on it. I was quite careful while doing the swatches, but even then, as you will see below, I managed to break one of the tips. These are presently all the colours available in the Marc Jacobs Highliner Matte eyeliner series, and I can’t deny that it bugged me that there was no basic matte black included. The deepest shade is (Iron)y, which is a deep grey-brown that is dark, but not exactly black. In the regular line, there is a shade Blacquer, which is a nice black, but has some shine in it. It would be nice if MJ Beauty came up with a matte black, because, these eyeliners are the bomb! If you live in fear of your eyeliner transferring (as I do), then have no more fear, for these Marc Jacobs Highliner Matte eyeliners do not transfer. Not. One. Bit. I was surprised, as often, even with the most tenacious of liners, I will find a shadow on my under eye area. Not this time. Gone are the days when I have to surreptitiously wipe away at my under-eye area, hoping against hope that I’m not presenting a panda face to the person I’m talking to LOL! ? They are also incredibly waterproof once they set, and transfer proof. In the top photo, I ran water down my swatches, after I’d scrubbed at them first, with a piece of tissue paper – no transfer at all. I was already impressed. On the photo below, is after I’d patted my arm dry, and while there is some fading of colour, the eyeliner is still pretty much intact. “Ok, so this is on your arm, how about on lids – I don’t wear eyeliner on my arms!” You are absolutely right. I don’t have photos to show you what it looks like on my lids, but I have worn some of the brighter colours as an eyeliner on the top lid, and some of the deeper shades to tightline. As I noted above, either way, there was no transfer onto my lower lid. It made me more comfortable and more confident to wear these bright colours (I’ve been lazy!) However, and there is always a fly in the ointment, there are 2 things that do not endear these liners to me. These liners do smudge and fade – They are tenacious and stick onto your lid without transferring, but they do smudge and fade after a few hours. I don’t have oily lids and I don’t have a general problem with eye colours fading on me or creasing, but these do. After a few hours, the colour is still there, but it has creased and faded. Not unsightly, as it doesn’t transfer, but it does look less polished. This is true even when I use for tightlining. There is no transfer to my lower lid, but the colour fades. These liners can’t get a precise line – I can’t get a very precise line with these eyeliners, which is a common problem when using pencil liners instead of liquid liners. So, these liners are good for use as definition, but not if you are a fan of the cat-eye flick or winged eyeliner. The colours are however, very intense and pigmented, and a very interesting array of shades. Here are all the swatches of the Marc Jacobs Highliner Matte eyeliners for your viewing pleasure ? Each swatch was done by drawing just 1 line down my arm so the colour is pretty much what you see is what you get. As I noted above, the texture is a little soft, and you can see how the nib for (Pop)ular (red) has broken (and caused an unholy mess!) Of all the shades, my favourites that I would recommend you check out are (Earth)quake (dark brown) , (Brown)ie (Medium brown) , (Iron)y (Dark Grey-brown) and (Over)night (Dark blue). These are the most versatile shades that you can use on their own, or to define your eyes. If you want a pop of colour in place of regular eyeshadow, then one of the more pop colours will work. I’m still wondering how to work in (Fine)wine (burgundy) and (Pop)ular (red), so if you have ideas I am all ears! ? I did also find that the texture of the 2 purple shades – (Grape)Vine (Dark Purple) and Mist Me? (Light purple), less satisfactory. The colour was not as pigmented as I expected it to be, after the others I’d swatched, and I had to go over to get the intensity of colour I wanted. I do however note that this is a common issue I face in most purple eyeliners, not only from Marc Jacobs, but from most brands. Out of the Blue (cobalt blue) and Whirl(Pool) (turquoise green) are very bright pops of colour that I wear alone, and they do look quite interesting. I had a friend I met for coffee ask me what I was wearing, when I wore Whirl(Pool) because it’s quite an unusual turquoise green that you don’t get elsewhere. This is a shade you often see in eyeshadow palettes, but you rarely get the intensity of colour that you do in an eyeliner like this one. As for Deja Blue (pastel blue) and Pink of Me (pastel pink), two strange pastel shades, I use them to line my under eye waterline to brighten the eye area. Useful when your eyes look red and irritated, or if you’ve had lack of sleep. All in all, I love these purely for the reason they do not transfer to my lower lid and under-eye area, and although they will smudge, crease and fade, they do not travel. But for the price, I have to say, I did expect them to stay put a little better. IN A NUTSHELL The Marc Jacobs Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon eyeliners are retractable pencil eyeliners that come with an in-built sharpener. The gel crayon is very intense, and the colours are pigmented, strong and matte. I love these because they stay put and do not transfer at all. Not one tiny bit! However, I do find that on me, they will fade, crease and smudge (albeit not travel) which can bug me. If I use them on their own, it is less impressive. If I use it with a powder eyeshadow, or as an eyeshadow base, or just to lightly define the eyes, or tightline, then it is impressive. They don’t transfer! I haven’t come across an eyeliner so resistant in a very long time! You will need an oil based eye makeup remover to remove, or a cleansing oil. PROS: Water resistant, Does not transfer (not even onto tissue paper!), Very pigmented and intense colours, In-built sharpener is practical if you carry the pencil around, Pencil is easy to retract and extend CONS: Will smudge and crease even on non-oily lids, Hard to get a defined flick for winged eyeliner, Crayon is a little soft and liable to break especially if it is hot, No matte black colour WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants an eyeliner that does not transfer and stays put PRICE: RM100 | US$25 each WHERE TO BUY: Sephora stores and online , Marc Jacobs Beauty online , Net-A-Porter Have you tried the Marc Jacobs Highliner eyeliners? What’s your favourite colour? I know quite a few people have tried these before, as I’ve had them recommended to me. Do you too experience the smudging and creasing? I’m rather curious as I don’t see it mentioned much, as the lasting power and non-transfer properties impresses most people. I’d love to know your experience with these, and suggestions on how to use red or burgundy eyeliner! ? Paris B']"

I measure every lipstick I wear against the yardstick of a Japanese brand lipstick because their textures embody everything I ever want in a lipstick – lightweight, creamy, moisturising, glowy and flattering. This was before the Western brands started coming out with the Dior Addicts and Rouge Cocos we are familiar with now. Trust me, the Japanese brands got there first, and every now and again, I feel the need to revisit my first loves. While it may seem like I have a strong focus on Western brands, the only reason I’m even wearing makeup today is because of Japanese makeup. I’m a huge fan, but it’s hard to keep up when information is very low-key and hard to come by, and quite often new releases look the same as old releases. But if there’s one thing I have to say about Japanese brands as well, is that they are given to the dramatic when naming products. The newest Japanese brand lipstick I had the pleasure of trying recently has the rather fanciful name of Dramatic Melting Rouge and is by Shiseido Maquillage . Ok, I confess to not being a big fan of Maquillage. I played about with a few products when the brand first came about, but I was never very impressed, preferring to stick to the Shiseido mother-brand; so I’ve pretty much forgotten about it over the years. These new lipsticks however, do have me wanting to take a second look at them because yes, they are pretty amazing products. To match the fancy name, these lipsticks come in a rather pretty golden cap that is eye catching. Personally, I’m not a fan of the packaging because I find it too gaudy. But Maquillage is targeted at a slightly younger makeup-wearing crowd, who I know, will be drawn to this packaging. As they say however, it’s what inside that counts. Inside, we are told that this lipstick is infused with a beauty oil that protects lips, cares for dry lips and infuses your lips with beautiful colour, shine and brilliance. I can safely tell you that the Dramatic Melting Rouge ticks the boxes on all counts. The lipstick slides on your lips like melted butter and makes your lips look almost instantly smooth. I don’t need all that crap about layering lip balm and using a lip primer under lipstick. If a lipstick doesn’t look impressive on its own, I scrap it. I don’t believe in using another product to make a product work (which is why you don’t hear me talk about using primers and lip balms under lipstick. It doesn’t work as it should? It’s tossed). But with this one, I just slick this one and bam! Smooth, tinted lips with a glossy shine. The proof as they say, are in the swatches and here they are. I swatched these on my lips just once. I don’t have very lined lips, but if you take a look at some other lipstick reviews, where I show close up of my lips, you can sometimes see how the lines may be visible. Here, they just look beautifully smooth. Man, I’d forgotten that a lipstick can make my lips look this good! ? I was sent 2 shades for consideration: RS329 Rose Rendezvous – This is a lovely everyday rose shade that naturally flatters most complexions. It isn’t as strong in colour in person as you see in the picture, but it completes your makeup without ever once looking garish and in your face. I wear rose coloured lipstick on a day to day basis because of this. RS526 Melty Red – If you love red lipstick then Japanese lipstick won’t be the one to turn to. Their reds are never the beautiful creamy reds that I get from Chanel or Dior or Guerlain. They tend to be a more sheer version of a red, often with brown tones, so they are always wearable on a daily basis without ever making you look like you’re trying too hard. If you want to ease into wearing red lipstick, start here. For completeness, this is how I’d look when I wear these shades. They are flattering shades aren’t they? With a lovely shine and gloss that isn’t in your face, while making you look alive and young and glowy. For interest, I wore all Japanese brand makeup in the FOTD too but everything from the base, eye and cheek makeup were from Lunasol . I don’t own anything else from Maquillage LOL! ? I’d peg these at a light-medium opacity. If you like strong, creamy colours you may not like these because you will find them too transparent. But if you don’t usually like wearing lipstick, I’d invite you to take a look because you might just change your mind after these ? IN A NUTSHELL The Shiseido Maquillage Dramatic Melting Rouge lipsticks are a new range of lipsticks under the Maquillage label, a Shiseido sub-brand. The texture of these lipsticks are lovely, being at once smooth, glowy, transparent and flattering. I find them sheer-medium in opacity although you can easily layer them to full opacity without it ever once feeling or looking heavy on your lips. The product too leaves your lips looking smooth and unlined and quite perfectly kissable. I have an insane desire to pick up more and I haven’t felt this desire in a long time! PROS: No scent, Smooth texture, Lightweight, Easy to build up colour without it looking heavy, Flattering shades on everyone, Glossy shine that doesn’t look overdone, Not one bit drying! CONS: I find the packaging a little gaudy but I’m in the minority, Product is a little soft so be careful about leaving it in the hot sun or it might melt WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes lightweight, glossy lipstick, Anyone who is familiar with the style and texture of Japanese brand lipstick, Anyone who likes a lip colour that isn’t too in your face Oh and if you wonder why I have a low tolerance to scent in lipstick, the primary reason is because the Japanese lipsticks I cut my teeth on (not literally) had no or very little scent. Even these days, I find that most pure Japanese brands do not infuse scent into their lip products, which makes me very happy. I will warn you that it’s a wee bit soft so don’t leave this lying around in the hot sun. I haven’t tried it, but you might just return to find a puddle of oil where your lipstick should be ? Have you tried this range of Maquillage lipstick? Do you like anything else from Maquillage you think I should try? I’ve been thinking about the new cheek colour or blush that they call Dramatic Mood Veil. It looks really pretty in pictures but I haven’t gone to play around with them. Reckon that’s worth a go? ?

They aren’t terribly exciting if I’m to be honest, but they work when they have to and that, for me, is most important. I’ve tried some of their foundations over the years and they generally work for me BUT I’d never tried the iconic Revlon Colorstay Makeup foundation. I know its popular, but I’d try it at the counter and the thick texture doesn’t endear itself to me. Its like everything that I NEVER wanted in a liquid foundation ? Recently, I received a bottle and I thought “Oh hey, here we go. My chance to try this iconic product” What I didn’t realise was that Revlon has now come up with 2 different Colorstay Makeup Foundations. The existing one is now meant for those with normal-dry skin and this new one is for combination-oily skin. What this new Combination-Oily texture means is that it feels lighter in texture and also on skin. I initially didn’t like it. I tried it for a few days and found it drying initially despite the really long lasting coverage. So I set it aside. 2 months later, I picked it up again and for some weird reason, it now works for me. Have I normalised my skin that much from dry to combination? I don’t know but now, it doesn’t feel drying on my skin anymore! I think I just didn’t use as much. Before I show you why I like it, let me show you one thing I absolutely dislike. There is no pump. Gah! Revlon, please do something about this! Pretty much like the original Colorstay Makeup foundation, there is no pump to this glass bottle, just a big gaping hole. I think this is a pretty decent product and would be much improved with the inclusion of a pump. I’m surprised Revlon hasn’t worked it out over the years. They do have other liquid foundations with a pump e.g. Age-defying DNA foundation so this regression boggles my mind. I however, learned a nifty trick from RMK foundations that have a similar mind-boggling packaging. Cover your palm over the bottle mouth, up end the bottle and use just whatever is on your hand. I use the 5 line foundation application technique and its enough. If you try to pour it out, you will end up pouring out too much and wasting product. Ok, griping aside, I like this foundation now. Perhaps it was my technique before or maybe I was using too much but the 5 line technique really works wonders. Also, I was sent the foundation in 200 Nude which is actually a tiny tiny bit deep for me. Just a tiny bit. I believe I’m usually more suited to Buff which is a shade we never see here ? Also, I believe there’s a shade down in 180 Sand Beige but that’s a bit yellow toned as opposed to Nude which has a more pinky tone (more suited to my skin) So dissection aside, I find that the 5 line application technique allows me to wear Nude quite comfortably without it looking too deep on my skin. I find that the texture is a little thick but on skin once you blend it out, it doesn’t feel heavy which is something I appreciate. It stays on impressively well all day, leaving my skin looking like my skin but better all day long. I’ve stopped experiencing dryness, maybe because I now use a lot less product than before. Here’s how it looks on my skin, before and after. It just looks better doesn’t it? Covers up redness and most blemishes and even evens the pigmentation spots on my cheekbones. Doesn’t cover them of course, I still use concealer for that, but I like how much more even my skin looks when wearing this foundation. Its only a very thin layer as anyone using that 5-line method will testify so I’d say coverage is very good ? Here’s how 200 Nude compares with other foundations that suit my skintone. Left-Right: (1) Revlon Colorstay Whipped Mousse foundation 220 Nude (2) Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation 200 Nude (3) Revlon Age Defying DNA 10 (4) Shiseido Perfect Refining Foundation I00 Very light Ivory (5) Diorsnow Liquid Foundation 010 Ivory Other than the Diorsnow Ivory which looks a tad lighter, the rest are very close! I intentionally benchmarked it against other Revlon foundations I have and use and you can see that the Colorstay Liquid Foundation in 200 Nude is a bit lighter than the Whipped Mousse foundation in 220 Nude and also a little lighter than Age Defying DNA 10 Buff. I do wish Revlon would standardize their naming conventions ? This way I don’t have to keep playing Russian Roulette ? Oh there’s SPF6 but its so low, I didn’t even think it worth mentioning ? UPDATE: SPF will be upgraded to SPF15 very soon! Watch out for the new packaging! So I really like the longevity, the non-oily, lightweight texture and how my skin looks when I have it on. I may prefer if the shade was a touch lighter, but Revlon has to work on packaging. Buck up! ? In a nutshell Revlon has come up with a new lightweight formula for their iconic Revlon Colorstay Makeup Liquid Foundation for Combination-Oily skin. The texture feels lighter than the original version which is now for Normal-Dry skin. I initially found it a little drying on my slightly dry skin but when I recently tried it again, I found that my skin felt more comfortable. I think it may have been the amount I used. I only use very little now because the coverage is very good so it will take you very far. I dislike the non-pump packaging however, which I can imagine will put many people off. Put in a pump and this will definitely fly off the shelves. Pros: Lightweight texture, Good coverage, Very long lasting without fading or sliding off, Non oily texture Cons: No pump, Messy packaging, Can be a little drying for normal/combination skin if too much is used Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for a long lasting lightweight liquid foundation with good coverage Here is the ingredient list for anyone interested. Are you a fan of the Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation? Have you used the original version? I know many people have listed it as one of their favourite full coverage liquid foundations but, as I said, I never tried it because the heavy texture was off putting. I’m glad they came up with a lighter texture. Its much more comfortable for me now, and I like it! I think I get the raves now ?

Have you managed to catch your breath? Naturally, I will not have ALL the brands in the market for this head to head comparisons – Korean brands aren’t all that generous at providing samples, unlike the Western brands I worked with before this – but I have enough to take you through 7 (yes, count that) SEVEN days of Cushion Foundations. This time, we will have a whole WEEK of cushions and then on Day 8 (if I have not yet collapsed from exhaustion), I’ll give you a round up, and on Day 9 (Yes, I’ve thought this through) I’ll do you a quick comparison of Korean vs Western brand cushions based on what I’ve tested so far. Whew! There’s a lot to get through so, fasten your seatbelts, here we go! Day 3 of Cushion Foundation Week 2 the K-Beauty edition) features my favouritest (that IS a word ? ) ever cushion – Hera UV Mist Cushion . I guess I could have saved this for last, but heck, why should I when it stunned me from the get-go! I love this one, and I’m going to tell you why! Cushion Foundation: Hera UV Mist Cushion SPF50+ PA+++ I bought this one on a whim online one day. I was aware of Hera, which is a higher end brand of Korean cosmetics that are sold in department stores. As we don’t have much accessibility to the brand locally, and because I wasn’t much into Korean cosmetics, it hovered on the edge of my consciousness, but never really registered. So, I picked it up, literally on a whim because I was curious about trying a cushion foundation and for some reason, I liked the name. I would. I’m a huge fan of Greek mythology and anyone familiar with Greek myths know of Hera, Zeus’ long suffering and jealous wife and Goddess of women. She was a crafty one, that Hera! I later found out that the Hera cushion foundations are very popular, because they are supposed to be very good. Talk about picking a winner blindfolded! The cushions come in 2 types – C for Cover (more coverage) and N for Natural (sheerer) I didn’t know a thing about this. I picked mine in shade C21 because I wear C21 in Iope and I assumed therefore it must be the same! LOL! ? Sunscreen protection : SPF50+ PA+++ I’m not sure why I kept this section in, because all Korean Cushion foundations come with high SPF rating. That said, if you’re using a cushion foundation in place of sunscreen , come, let me smack you ? However, what is good about cushion foundations, is their portability and lightweight texture, like this one, so you can use it as a touch up for your sunscreen through the day, or to touch up your makeup in the afternoons after it’s faded off a little. The lightweight texture feels comfortable, and the light-medium coverage means you can boost your base makeup, if you have to, for the evenings. As I’ve noted, many Korean brand cushion foundations use zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in their ingredients which are physical UV blockers. These are my preferred choice of UV protection and I’m happy to see them in this one as well. The Packaging & Refills The Hera UV Mist Cushion comes in a box with a sealed refill and sponge. Quite normal for a mid-high end Korean brand cushion. The compact is a little thick with a nice heft, and a pretty pearlescent sheen to the white parts, and a subtle lilac tone to the metallic parts. The case is like a donut with a cover, so you clip the refill into place and it fits nicely without any rattling. I find that the cover clips and stays shut and it is otherwise just a well-constructed compact. I will note also that Hera is a brand under the large Amore Pacific brand umbrella, and their refills fit nicely into the cases for Sulwhasoo and Iope. In that sense, they are all interchangeable, and I notice this flexibility in the higher-end Korean cushions, not in the lower end ones, as we have seen with Innisfree and Laneige . The Cushion The cushion for the Hera UV Mist Cushion is fairly traditional, being the flat porous sponge that we have seen from the start. The cushion is dense and firm, and seems to hold the product well. I do find that I have to press the sponge into the cushion a little to pick up product, but due to the texture of the product, you don’t need that much each time, so it isn’t a problem for me. I’ve been using this one quite a while and quite often, and it hasn’t shown signs of drying out yet. The Sponge Puff Again, this was a category I kept in from the previous Cushion Foundation Week series, and I’m not sure why, because the Koreans know their sponge puff applicators! This Hera one is no exception. I will tell you right here right now, that for best effect, ALWAYS USE THE SPONGE PUFF! The Hera UV Mist Cushion puff has a purple base and mine is quite well used as you can see. It is a little soft, but with a surface density that has a nice bounce on the skin. TO USE: Slip your fingers through the loop (it only accommodates 3 fingers for me so I find it a little small), dab the sponge on the surface of the cushion (you can see this is just 1 dab) and then dab it on your skin, in a press and roll motion. Press on skin, and roll it off. It helps the foundation adhere better to your skin. Like the Laneige BB Cushion , I find that the density of the puff surface is such that it doesn’t absorb the product too quickly, and the texture of the product is such that I can cover about 1/3 to 1/2 of my face with just 1 dab of cushion foundation. I then go over the areas where I want better coverage. This actually makes application faster and more even than with multiple dabs of product. Texture, Coverage & Finish This is where the Hera UV Mist Cushion really shines for me, and made me fall in love with this. Before trying this, I was quite enamoured with the Sulwhasoo cushion. I still like it, but I’d pick Hera in a heartbeat! The texture of the Hera UV Mist Cushion is lightweight and feels like nothing on the skin. I do find that it offers medium coverage straight from the sponge, but it is also because I’m using the Cover version, in #C21. I am assuming the Natural (N) version would be a little sheerer, but without testing, I cannot say for sure. All I can say is that I LOVE the coverage, because that was always a bit of a bone of contention with me and BB Cushion Foundations. The name UV Mist implies that this one is more moisturising, and it feels very comfortable on my skin. However, I do not find it particularly dewy or glowy, which is what I like. I am not a big fan of the shiny faced look, no matter how in-trend it may be. Shiny skin doesn’t quite translate into healthy skin for me, especially with our heat and humidity here. I can understand how it is appealing in a cooler, colder, drier climate like in Korea. This one sets very comfortably on skin to a semi matte texture, and importantly for me, stays put for most of the day without fading or slipping off. If anything, it looks better as the day wears on. WHAT IS THIS SORCERY?! ? In these before-after pictures, I’m wearing the Hera UV Mist Cushion in Shade #C21 . This is just the Hera UV Mist Cushion – nothing else. I love the coverage, which is medium-full, yet transparent, if there’s such a thing. It isn’t thick or cakey on skin, and it covers up redness and evens out my skin tone, but also allows my natural skin to come through. Pigmentation or blemish marks aren’t covered 100%, but enough that I’m comfortable with them. If I layer on product, it just looks better. Not heavy, not unnatural, not fake. Seriously guys, this is one of the best bases I’ve come across today, whether cushion foundation or liquid foundation! I get crazy compliments every time I use it – smooth glowing skin being the most popular – and I usually get that when I wear my Cle de Peau foundation (another star product). The difference is that this is a fraction of the price of the CdP! ? If I want a more flawless visage, I use this trifecta that I swear, is a game-changer. Use this trick that I teach you here , using these 3 products – Nars Creamy Concealer dabbed where you need it, Hera UV Mist Cushion all over, and then a light dusting of the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder in Diffused just to set. It is all very thin layers, but the effect is stunning, flawless, natural looking skin that looks better as the day wears on. Not cakey, and it doesn’t even look like you’re wearing makeup! Now you know my little secret! ? If I had to give up all my cushions, I’d fight you to keep this one. I never ever thought I’d ever say this of a BB Cushion foundation! Shade selection Shade selection is fairly poor, which I believe is because this is primarily a Korean based brand. So, there are only 2 shades available #21 and #23 for light and medium in 2 types of coverage – C for more coverage that I use, and N for a sheerer coverage. With this limited shade selection, I’d peg this as one for those with light to light-medium skintone only. Nothing much deeper or you risk looking ashy. Scent Yes, there is a slight floral scent that reminds me of the scent in Laneige, except it’s lighter so it doesn’t bug me. If you’re sensitive to fragrance in skin products then be wary. Do I like this? Didn’t I say I’d fight you to keep this one? So yes, I bloody love this cushion. It makes me look so good each time I use it, and I honestly cannot get over it. This isn’t easy to find, so I will have a second best option for you in the coming days, that is easier to obtain locally and comes in slightly deeper shades too ? I don’t know if my opinion of using BB Cushion Foundations have changed due to the improved condition of my skin, but hey, I’m never too old to say I’m happy to change my mind! ? IN A NUTSHELL The Hera UV Mist Cushion SPF50+ PA+++ is very good. If you can find a shade match, get it because you will love it too. The packaging is sturdy and elegant, the texture is lightweight on skin and does not slip off nor fade, the coverage is out of this world for a cushion foundation, and so natural besides. I don’t think I’ve anything bad to say about this one! PROS: Lightweight texture feels featherlight on skin, Evens out skintone very naturally, Low to high coverage depending on how much you use, Easy to use, Has a semi-matte finish on skin that is not too shiny, Not drying nor oily, High sunscreen protection, Portable packaging, Comes with a refill which makes it value for money CONS: Scented, Some people may not like the sponge for application or hygiene purposes, I don’t mind, Sponge feels a little small, Hard to get but nothing against the product! WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes using cushion foundations, Anyone who is new to using cushion foundations, Anyone who wants a higher coverage cushion foundation that gives a beautiful smooth and flawless finish on skin PRICE: US$40-50 for a box containing 1 case & 2 refills. Prices will vary depending on where you buy from as it is available on many different websites WHERE TO BUY: I bought mine on Strawberrynet , but I’ve since seen it on iHerb for less (on offer! Code MPW213 gives you an additional 10% off) so I’ll buy mine there next, Peach & Lily , Amazon and various other websites or Korean sites if you know where to look If you’re interested in what’s in there, here’s the ingredient list Sea silt extract, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, cyclopentasiloxane, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, PEG-10 dimethicone, butylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, phenyl trimethicone, cyclohexasiloxane, butylene glycol, arbutin, lauryl PEG-9 polydimethylsiloxyethyl dimethicone, dimethicone, myrciaria dubia fruit extract, chenopodium quinoa seed extract, euterpe oleracea fruit extract, ilex paraguariensis leaf extract, prunus mume fruit extract, acrylates/ethylhexyl acrylate/dimethicone methacrylate copolymer, acrylates/stearyl acrylate/dimethicone methacrylate copolymer, dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, polyhydroxystearic acid, aluminum hydroxide, trisiloxane, stearic acid, triethoxycaprylylsilane, silica HDI/trimethylol hexyllactone crosspolymer, ethylhexyl palmitate, lecithin, isostearic acid, isopropyl palmitate, polysorbate 80, polymethyl methacrylate, disteardimonium hectorite, polyglyceryl-3 polyricinoleate, hydrogenated lecithin, ethylhexylglycerin, trimethylsiloxysilicate, silica, sodium chloride, sorbic acid, phenoxyethanol, disodium EDTA, CI77492, CI77491, CI77499, fragrance Have you tried this Hera UV Mist Cushion? Any other Hera products I should try? It’s hard for me to get Hera products outside of Korea, but I hear that Hera actually makes quite many varieties of their cushion foundation, and UV Mist is just one of them. Incidentally also, they have just revamped this one in 2016, and naturally I haven’t tried it. But I hope they’ve kept the awesomeness, because I want to continue using this one, which I’ll buy wherever I can get it from! ? Paris B More cushion foundations can be found in this category .']"

It isn’t very expensive (relatively) and most people who have used it reported positive results with it. Naturally, I was intrigued! Incidentally, this is part of 3 different booster serums in the Sephora brand, and as you can expect, is only sold at Sephora stores or online. I have never used anything from the Sephora collection, so this is really the first time for me. I picked this up during one of the 20% sales – I’ve lost that privilege now I’m no longer a Black Card member! LOL Didn’t donate enough money to the Temple of Sephora ? The Sephora Luminizing Booster comes in a small bottle of just 20ml, and with slightly confusing directions of use. It claims to help improve dull skin, which is where the Vitamin C really comes it. It also claims to contain a high percentage of Vitamin C although it doesn’t quite say how much is “high”. But how did it fare for me, and is it something I’d use for the long term? The answer isn’t as straight-forward as you might expect ? I actually picked this up and tried it without too much expectations. I had been using the Zelens Power C Treatment Drops for months before this (review to come) and that one had impressed me greatly. The price however, will have most of you giving me the side-eye ? So, it is to be borne in mind, that my skin was already well treated before I started using this serum. And despite the rather confusing name and directions of use, this is a serum. Use it after toner and before your moisturiser, and the lightweight texture is very comfortable. It comes in a very slim dropper-style bottle, and the serum is clear. I have had it a while, and do not notice any oxidization despite regular use. Oxidization is common in serums containing Vitamin C as it is inherently unstable unless stablized in the formula. The directions say that you are to use it in 14 day cycles, to brighten the skin. Does it mean that this will only last 14 days, or that you should only use it for 14 days? It is hard to say. It does however last longer than 14 days. Even with twice a day use, it’s lasted me comfortably over a month, but I am almost finished with this bottle. 20ml doesn’t really go that far. What results can you expect from the Sephora Luminizing Booster? For me, bearing in mind that I was already using an effective Vitamin C serum prior to switching to this, I noticed a slight diminishing of results. My skin did not look as clear nor as radiant as it did before. However, if you have never used a Vitamin C serum, then I am quite confident that you will notice results after about 14 days or more. I did notice that it is taking a very long time to fade my pimple marks, while I achieve a quicker result from the Zelens Power C or Dr Brandt Power Dose. It is however to be borne in mine that both those serums cost significantly more. They also boast a 20% Vitamin C concentration, while I cannot tell the percentage of Vitamin C in this Sephora Luminizing Booster. The texture is lightweight, with a slight oily feel. It does however absorb very easily and quickly without any oily nor sticky residue on the skin. It isn’t drying, and layers well under moisturisers. I do prefer applying it to damp skin so it absorbs more quickly. I will note that there is a scent and fragrance is included in the list of ingredients. It has that awful citrus scent that brands somehow feel should be put in anything that says Vitamin C on the bottle. I hate it. It is light, but it is there, and I dislike it. However, most people will like it, so mileage varies. I can’t really complain much about this, because it is decent, insofar as I can tell. It keeps my skin even toned, although it isn’t doing much at fading pigmentation. So I think you get what you pay for. A decent serum that contains Vitamin C, that is easy to get hold of, fairly affordable, and has a measure of efficacy. I will finish this, and I think it is a decent size and price to try, but this is not something I’d use for the long term. I’d go for something better and more effective. I do find it odd that I cannot find any information about its availability in the USA, but it seems to be available anywhere else that has a Sephora. In this regard, if Zelens and Dr. Brandt makes you blanch, I’d recommend the Hylamide C25 Booster. It is harder to get hold of but it is more effective and a better product overall. I don’t recommend The Ordinary, but that is because I had a poor experience with the product . They have since expanded their range of Vitamin C serums, so maybe one day I’ll have another go, but not in the short term ? IN A NUTSHELL The Sephora Luminizing Booster contains Vitamin C and from my experience, is a decent Vitamin C serum for someone new to the ingredient, and who may want to try something that is reasonably affordable and easier to get hold of. It is a lightweight texture, use about 3 drops each time, and absorbs easily and quickly. I dislike the inclusion of a citrus scent as fragrance, and citrus oils which can lead to skin sensitivity in the long term (make sure you use a good sunscreen everyday!). It is decent, but not something I’d repurchase nor use for the long term as there are better products out there. PROS: Reasonably affordable, Slim portable packaging, Lightweight and absorbs easily into the skin, Helps even out and brighten dull skin tone but takes a longer time to fade marks on skin CONS: Added fragrance and citrus oils, Only sold in Sephora WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants to try a fairly affordable, fairly mild Vitamin C serum PRICE: RM68 | AU$22 for 20ml WHERE TO BUY: Sephora stores or online (Not USA) For those interested, here is the ingredient list for the Sephora Luminizing Booster serum . One note here. If your skin is sensitive to Ascorbic Acid or L-Ascorbic Acid, which is commonly found in Vitamin C serums, you could consider trying this one. The Vitamin C derivative used appears to be Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate. Have you tried this Sephora Luminzing Booster? Has it crossed your mind to? I must confess that while I will eat store-brand foods, I am less likely to use a store-brand skincare product. Just me, coz I’m a snob ? But this one was quite decent, all things considered! ?

I wanted to wear pretty sunglasses dammit! ? Anyone who’s had to fork out lots of money for prescription sunglasses can tell you how that feels (and back in the day, they are never as pretty as those you can buy off the rack) and secretly, I’d always hankered after a pair of aviator sunglasses. I know, blame Top Gun LOL! ? But one of my side-effects of undergoing lasik is light sensitivity. For me, wearing sunglasses isn’t purely for vanity. I need to wear sunglasses when I go out in the day because my eyes are just too sensitive to the light. So, coming back to aviators. I’d always wanted a pair, preferably with polarised lenses. But every pair I’d ever tried (Ray-Ban does the popular ones) looked weird on me. The large tear-drop style of lens just didn’t sit well on my face and trust me, I have a big face. I should be able to handle aviators! But one day, I came across a newer, slightly more updated design of the Ray-Ban aviator online which they call the Cockpit Aviator RB3362 and on a bit of a whim, I picked it up. The online reviews (there aren’t many) say that it’s smaller and somehow, more suited for Asian faces. That’s me! ? You know what? The reviews were right. It is a much more flattering design, on me at least. And I believe it would be the case for anyone who has a problem with aviator style sunglasses. The lenses have a less pronounced tear-drop design so you don’t have as much of a bug-eyed look. The gold wire-frame is light and does feel a little fragile. If you are careless with your sunglasses then this one might end up getting squashed. I have a pair of sunglasses with plastic frames that I keep in the car. I find those more sturdy. The frame has the bar across the top that is present in all aviator glasses designs, but the bar is slightly curved instead of running straight across. I feel that this softens the design slightly. I believe the lenses themselves are glass, but don’t quote me. The reason I say so is because I used to wear glass specs (oh yeah, those were the bad old days) and these have a bit of heft to them, which would not be there if the lenses were plastic. For anyone interested, the lenses were a 59mm width and the total width of the sunglasses are 14cm. I must ensure I pick sunglasses with wide lenses and wide width due to my large face boo! So nothing below 56mm for me. I learned that the hard way, trying to stick too-small sunnies on this large mug ? And when done right, I think I look pretty bad-ass in these ? I bought mine from Shopbop during their last 25% off sale so I thought it to be a good enough deal, and I got it in under a week. I didn’t have to adjust the plastic nose-guard which fit out of the box, and the sunnies themselves were a comfortable fit. I do find that they don’t offer as much protection as my plastic pair, because there is less of a wraparound effect. The lenses aren’t polarised but I find them comfortable enough in blocking the glare from the sun. But you know, sometimes, you just got to wear a pair of bad-ass sunnies, pair them with hot red lipstick and go get ’em! ? Do you wear aviator style sunglasses? What’s your favourite sunglasses? Well even if you don’t, it’s good practice to wear sunglasses that have proper UV rating and proper protection. It protects your eyes from the sun, glare (reduces squinting and lines!) and UV rays can cause cataracts. Sometimes, fancy or very cheap sunnies are a little suspect for this reason. They may not be properly rated and may actually cause your eyes more harm because your pupils dilate when shaded and allows more UV rays in. So if you’re going to wear sunglasses, get a proper pair, not just the cheapest pair, and there is no need to get the most expensive pair either. Or maybe you’re like me and just want to get a bad-ass pair LOL ? p/s I’ve kind of missed not writing about just beauty products or beauty posts ?

For the uninitiated, you can view the brands featured in the first round-up of this nature here , where all cushion foundations are housed. This round however, by popular demand, Cushion Foundation Week will focus only on Korean brand BB cushions. Naturally, I will not have ALL the brands in the market – Korean brands aren’t all that generous at providing samples, unlike the Western brands I worked with before this – but I have enough to take you through 7 (yes, count that) SEVEN days of Cushion Foundations. This time, we will have a whole WEEK of cushions and then on Day 8 (if I have not yet collapsed from exhaustion), I’ll give you a round up, and on Day 9 (Yes, I’ve thought this through) I’ll do you a quick comparison of Korean vs Western brand cushions. Whew! There’s a lot to get through so, fasten your seatbelts, here we go! Day 2 of the Cushion Foundation Week 2 (the K-Beauty edition) is a more affordable one from Innisfree. It is the Innisfree Water Glow Cushion that I bought in store a little earlier this year. However, I cannot find it on the website, which frustrates me, as there is now one on there called the Water Fit Cushion which I assume is the same thing i.e. more moisturising, but likely the “improved version”. I have no information as I as yet do not work with the brand locally, so suffice to say, this is a review of the Water Glow Cushion that might be discontinued, so it pisses me off because I got it with the intention to talk about it on CFW2. Grr… Now, onwards! Cushion Foundation: Innisfree Water Glow Cushion SPF50+ PA+++ I wandered into the Innisfree store one day, to check out their cushion foundations, because Innisfree is affordable, and I wanted to try something affordable. Also, there was a promotion to get a LINE character case. So, Brown made me do it ? Of the 2 types available (Longwear cushion is the other) I chose the Water Glow (now called Water Fit) Cushion because I have normal-dry skin and I wanted something more moisturising. Longwearing anything from experience, is usually more drying. Sunscreen protection : SPF50+ PA+++ I’m not sure why I kept this section in, because all Korean Cushion foundations come with high SPF rating. That said, if you’re using a cushion foundation in place of sunscreen , come, let me smack you ? It is worth repeating. What is good about cushion foundations, is their portability and lightweight texture, like this one, so you can use it as a touch up for your sunscreen through the day, or to touch up your makeup in the afternoons after it’s faded off a little. The lightweight texture feels comfortable, although I do feel this to be a little more dewy than I like, so I do recommend setting with a powder or it will sit on your skin feeling tacky for a long time. What I like and have noticed is that many of these Korean BB Cushions use zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in their ingredient lists. These are physical UV blockers that I have personally found more effective for me than chemical ones and so I quite like this. The Packaging & Refills This is where I was surprised to note that Innisfree cushion foundations DO NOT come with a refill. It was my impression that all Korean cushion foundations did. Clearly, I was mistaken. Instead, you can buy the refills separately, but then it doesn’t work out to be as affordable as I thought it was! I also find that the case has a solid base, so the cushion refill sits inside a sealed case, instead of in a ring, as with other brands like Laneige or Sulwhasoo. It is worth noting that these are all Amore Pacific brands, so it surprised me how they were different. The cover of the cushion, which is what helps keep it from drying out, is attached to the capsule so every refill comes with its own cover and own sponge for hygiene reasons. Innisfree does sell spare sponges, I believe. What Innisfree has done further, is to come up with covers of different designs. So, as in my case, I ended up with a free cover from an Innisfree x LINE promotion. It’s cute, but not me as many people noted when I first shared this on Instagram LOL! ? You people know me too well! I actually prefer plain covers, so fashion covers like these do not attract me. But if you like them, then Innisfree has a ton for you to choose from in store. The other thing I have to note is the rather flimsy construction of the compact that the cushion comes in. I found the original compact didn’t shut properly, so it would always pop open. If I were the sort to carry it around, the sponge could pop out and get dirty. As I don’t, it didn’t bother me, but I did note that the yellow free case shut better. I guess you get what you pay for. The Cushion The cushion is a traditional sponge-based cushion that is soaked with the product. I do find the sponge a little soft. Definitely softer than the Laneige BB Cushion I showed you yesterday. I do find it easy to pick up product from the surface of the sponge without having to press down too hard. The sponge is a little soft, so there is a lot of give, which means that if you press down, you might pick up too much product. It will naturally dry out as time goes by, but I can’t tell as yet how quickly that will be. The Sponge Puff Again, this was a category I kept in from the previous Cushion Foundation Week series, and I’m not sure why, because the Koreans know their sponge puff applicators! This Innisfree one is no exception. I will tell you right here right now, that for best effect, ALWAYS USE THE SPONGE PUFF! Reminiscent of the Laneige BB Cushion sponge, the Innisfree sponge has a blue base as well. The size of the sponge is similar as well, fitting just 3 fingers into the band, and it is rather small. While visually similar, I do find that the sponge is a little softer and a little less dense than the one from Laneige. I believe Innisfree sells the spare sponges, or they often give them free with purchase during promotional periods, for those who feel they need an extra. However, what a softer sponge eventually translates into, is that the sponge does absorb product a little more readily, and as the Water Glow Cushion is a little light in texture, I do find myself having to pick up more product, more often. TO USE: Like all BB Cushions, Slip your fingers through the loop (it only accommodates 3 fingers for me so I find it a little small), dab the sponge on the surface of the cushion (you can see this is just 1 dab) and then dab it on your skin, in a press and roll motion. Press on skin, and roll it off. It helps the foundation adhere better to your skin. Texture, Coverage & Finish Being a “water glow” cushion, it was to be expected that the texture would be a little more moisturising and dewy (shiny) on skin. This lived up to expectations. I did find that the cushion would not set on my skin, and feels tacky to the touch even after a few minutes. For this reason, I always have to set it with some powder to make it feel more comfortable. Coverage is on the low side, offering some evening out of skintone and redness, but otherwise not offering very much coverage. This would therefore be more suitable for those who have good skin, or those who prefer a barely there base, although if you use this trick , you can get more out of the product. I wear this in Shade #21 Beige in the pictures below, which are my usual unretouched before after photos. While the tint evens my skintone and offers some brightening, the coverage is barely there. You can see it in the shadow of the pigmentation on my cheeks and blemish marks. Layering it on doesn’t do very much for me, so I usually just use a concealer and powder to create a more opaque effect using this trick . Longevity is average as well for me, and I have normal bordering on dry skin. So I did expect this cushion to offer me a little more. Unfortunately, I have to say that this is one of the least impressive ones I own. I use it on off-days like weekends or when I want a quick cover-up. But it isn’t one I’d write home to anyone about. Just not impressive enough, but not crap enough to pan LOL! ? Shade selection There are 5 shades available – C13 (C usually means Cover but it only comes in the lightest shade that I couldn’t wear – and I always take the lightest shade in base makeup!) The others are N shades, which are Natural i.e. sheer. The shades are N21, 23, 27 and 31. I wear this in #21, which is the shade I wear in all Korean base shades. I’m intrigued that there are a few deeper shades available, which I hope will mean that more people will be able to try and wear these cushion foundations. If you have a medium skintone (I don’t think it goes very deep) you could stop by and take a look! Scent Yes, there is a slight scent so if you’re sensitive to fragrance in skin products then be wary. It is fairly light so it isn’t too bothersome. Do I like this? Mmm… not really. As I have it, I will use it up eventually (or dry in the process) but it’s not something I’d repurchase because I didn’t like how tacky it stayed on my skin. I do prefer a little more coverage, and as you will see, there are other brands (under the same mothership) who do beautiful textures and offer nice, transparent coverage. What Innisfree has going for it is affordability. It has a fairly low entry point, and the gimmicky choice of cases will draw many in. Do note that the cases do not fit refills from other brands, so really, they aren’t much use unless you only ever use Innisfree cushion foundations! IN A NUTSHELL The Innisfree Water Glow Cushion seems to have been renamed Water Fit Cushion (after I bought it). The cushion does not come with a refill, although Innisfree often offers decorative compact covers that I know entices many people. The entry price is low, but I think it adds up to the same in the end once you factor in having to buy refills. In mine, the original compact was quite flimsy and would pop open easily. The cushion itself was a typical cushion, in that it was sheer, offering just the evening of skintone, which might be what some people will want. If so, this is one to look for. Otherwise, I personally feel there are other better ones out there. Less pretty to look at, but performs better.

It’s also received rave reviews online from many big names in the industry. The key reason is the price because products in The Ordinary range are very very affordably priced, for what is supposed to be very potent and effective ingredients. So affordably priced, it makes you wonder if there’s a catch. Because they are the brainchild of the people behind Deciem, the other popular brand for effective products that don’t break the bank, I was more comfortable picking up a few pieces, sight unseen. I bought directly from the Deciem website although you can get The Ordinary in a few other places online (not retailed in Malaysia at time of publishing – please don’t ask. The info about product availability is always detailed in all my posts wherever I can, especially local availability where possible. However, I’m not a fan of product resellers or pre-orders or bulk buyers so I never recommend any. I’m all about buying directly from trusted sources, never from Instagram or Facebook and I suggest that you do the same /climbs off soapbox). The first product I was most excited to try was The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% (I’ll call it The Ordinary Vitamin C serum for short) as I’d just run out of mine and was raring to try more Vitamin C products as I find them very effective. The Ordinary Vitamin C serum slides in at under US$10 (£5) and I was curious as a cat with its 9 lives intact. There were so many raves for the brand online – might this be my wallet’s saviour? If you’re on Instagram, you’d know the answer to my rhetorical question. No. I actually pretty much hated the damn thing. To be honest, it was purely from a sensorial point – the texture really sucks. But I eventually got it to work, and I’m going to share with you the secret! ? But first, I got The Ordinary Vitamin C serum in its new tube packaging. Apparently, the first generation came in a dropper bottle, that people hated. So it was eventually repackaged in a tube. I’m not sure either if it’s perfect, as the product is actually quite runny. So, when you squeeze out the product, you have to be pretty careful to control how much you actually dispense, because you only need (and honestly, you should only be using) very little product, because of the formula. You probably can’t tell, but this is the swatch of the product and it is fairly liquid. You only need about 1/3 of this dollop on your skin, because as I will tell you below, you will otherwise be a grease-ball. The formula claims to be water-free and silicone-free and be in a stable suspension. The 23% refers to Pure L-Ascorbic Acid, and because Vitamin C can be drying, they added 2% Hyaluronic Acid Spheres. On paper, this sounds like quite a dream. The Gritty Texture and greasiness In practice, the texture is horrible to me. I’m not alone. Just look up any honest reviews online, and you’ll find everyone complaining about the texture. While it looks like a smooth lotion when squeezed out of the tube, the moment you apply this to your skin, you will feel a gritty, sandy texture under your fingers. It almost feels like you’re rubbing fine sandpaper all over your face. If you exert pressure, it can feel a little painful. It never goes away, and it sits on your skin all day. Added to that, I found that the formula really makes my skin greasy through the day. I use this in the morning, as the first serum on my skin after cleanser and toner. I like my Vitamin C directly on my skin and I found that no matter how little I used, it would still make my skin greasy, yet dry. It’s complicated. It looks greasy, with a shine like a beacon in the dark, yet it feels dry. I don’t know, it’s just weird. It’s become so bad that I won’t use this serum if I have to put a good face forward, because I can’t stand how oily my face looks, even though I’m not actually oily. Alternatively, I’ll use one of my more drying foundations to try to balance it off. It’s always a challenge. It Stings Added to the gritty texture and greasiness is the sting. Now, I use acid toners and I happily slap on glycolic acid on my face with wild abandon. Lotion P50 does not sting my skin and neither does Pixi Glow Tonic or Alpha H Liquid Gold . I’d been warned every time, but it’s always been smooth sailing. Not with The Ordinary Vitamin C serum. They warn you on the box that you can expect a stinging sensation. And yes, I do experience it. If you have blemishes on your skin it will sting more at those areas. For me, I feel the stinging on my cheeks and around my nose and my skin actually turns a little red. It goes away, but the redness does remain. It bugged me every single time I use it, but I persevered in the name of science – ok, for the sake of trying it. The things I do! ? The smell The other thing I intensely dislike is the scent. To me, there is a strong metallic scent that remains on my hands after I use this, and that bugs me to no end. I always have to wash my hands after using, and I tend to use this only in the day time, because I like to use my Vitamin C serums in the day – it’s supposed to be an antioxidant and it aids sunscreen efficacy. Look it up – lots of research in this area. How to avoid the gritty texture and sting However, just 2 weeks ago, I unconsciously stumbled upon a cure for the terribly gritty texture and the sting on my skin – lots of moisture! Thank goodness for facial mists! ? To combat the gritty sandpaper texture and sting of The Ordinary Vitamin C Serum, here’s how I use it:- After cleansing and exfoliating toner, I liberally mist my face with a facial water mist – any one will do, but get your face WET. Then, squeeze out a little dollop of The Ordinary Vitamin C serum, and quickly apply and massage onto your wet skin. You will find that the grittiness seems to melt into the water, and I don’t experience any stinging on my skin. The product also absorbs better and more quickly. I believe the gritty texture is due to the L-Ascorbic Acid powder they say is used in the formula, suspended in the emulsion, but applying it to wet skin really really helps, and it’s the only way I can use this without wanting to throw the tube at the wall in frustration. I believe the water helps, because L-Ascorbic Acid is water soluble, and since it’s suspended in a water-free formula the water helps it dissolve. The bits of chemistry from school days did not go to waste! ? I’m no chemist, but I hardly think that vitamin c POWDER will do very much for your skin by just sitting on it. Please feel free to tell me otherwise, but I’m sticking to my method – at least I don’t have to contend with sandpaper on my skin ? I’d read of people patting it into their skin instead of rubbing (so it doesn’t hurt so much) or people who experience pilling but I don’t. Using it on a wet face really helps it perform more like a normal serum and I can layer products without problems after that. However, the greasiness does remain. No cure there. What does it do? From my limited experience with Vitamin C serums, I’ve experienced clearer skin, more even skintone and a reduction in the darkness of my existing pigmentation, and any new redness clears up more quickly. I find that with The Ordinary Vitamin C serum, I don’t notice significant changes in my skin. However, this might be due to the fact that my first serum had already worked so well. So, this was doing a maintenance job. I did not notice any further brightening of my skin, and in fact, due to the greasiness, my skin sometimes looks dull, but my skintone seemed to remain even, after the redness goes away. Once I used the wet skin method, I experienced far less redness and it felt a little more comfortable. Only just. I have this red spot on my chin due to picking at a recalcitrant spot, and daily use of this serum hasn’t helped fade the marks. I don’t know. I guess I just really dislike this, and I’m only trying to use up as much of it as I can before I bin it ? By way of an alternative, I particularly liked the Hylamide Booster C25 (same owners – Deciem) which isn’t too expensive, and feels far more elegant a formulation than this POS ? IN A NUTSHELL I don’t like this ? Ok, that’s not helpful. The Ordinary Vitamin C serum is a very affordable vitamin c serum that is water free and silicone free. The texture is quite runny, and you only need very little each time. It spreads easily, but the L-Ascorbic Powder suspended in the formula gives it a gritty texture that feels like sandpaper on skin and irritates my skin. I also experience stinging and some redness. My way of working around it is to apply it directly on wet skin. You don’t experience the gritty texture and I find that it stings less. I don’t find this particularly helpful for my skin, and it leaves my skin looking greasy all day. It is very affordable and I can see why it’s popular. But I feel the formula is inelegant and it just takes too much trouble to get it to work, with not very noticeable results. I’m not a fan. PROS: Very affordable CONS: Gritty texture feels like sandpaper on skin, Tube packaging tends to dispense too much product, Heavy greasy feeling and oily cast on skin all day, Strong metallic scent lingers on skin, Stings the skin so you will experience a smarting feeling especially if you have any blemishes WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone on a tight budget and wants to try a Vitamin C serum PRICE: US$9.70 | £5 for 30ml WHERE TO BUY: International shipping available at The Ordinary website (or Deciem ), Asos , Victoria Health (I have never used this site and I can’t seem to access it when I try, but I’ve heard of people buying from there – I prefer to buy directly from Deciem or Asos) If you’re interested as to what’s in The Ordinary Vitamin C serum, here’s the ingredient list. As always, this is MY perception of this product. I am a fan of a bargain as much as the next person, but texture and sensorial pleasure is also very important to me. If I can’t bear to use a product because I pretty much hate it, it doesn’t matter how much or little it costs, I’d still hate it. I did persevere long enough to find a way to get this serum to work, which I’m thankful about, because this means my US$10 doesn’t go to waste. But I now only use it on weekends or on days when I don’t need to put an immaculate face forward, because this leaves my dry skin looking like I need some serious blotting – and that isn’t flattering at all. I know this suits many peoples’ budgets, so go ahead and try it. Maybe it’ll work for you and if you hate it, go for Hylamide Boost C25 instead if you aren’t up to springing for the Dr. Brandt Power Dose ? Have you tried this Vitamin C Serum from The Ordinary? Did you experience the same things I did? I’d love to know how you like this, because I know many people have tried it thanks to the very affordable price tag. I’m trying a couple of other items I bought from the brand, but those will come in due course. I’d admit that as this was my first experience with the brand, I was very put off and hesitant to try the other things in my order. But I’m getting over my prejudice. Almost ? Paris B']"

I’ll tell you that I rather liked it. But I couldn’t tell you about it earlier, because my last experience with something I enjoyed from Kiehl’s didn’t have a happy ending . I told myself then, that I’d give all new releases from Kiehl’s 6 months, just in case they change their mind. Well, more than 6 months have passed and the Calendula & Aloe Soothing Hydrating Mask is still around, so I guess it’s safe to talk about it now LOL! This joins Kiehl’s’ mask wardrobe, offering a hydration boost to skin. I enjoyed using the other versions of the Kiehl’s masks, and I was wondering if I might like this one too. When Kiehl’s launched it, they tried to sell me the idea of multi-masking, by applying different masks on different parts of the face. It isn’t a new concept, as people have been doing it for a while. For some reason, it amuses people to have different coloured masks on different parts of the face. However, I never bought into that technique. I multi-mask. But I do so, one after another. A clay mask, or a peel type mask, followed by a soothing and hydrating mask. I feel that I derive the most benefit this way, rather than only treating one part of my face at any one time. But that’s me! Onto this mask ? This feels a lot like any regular gel mask, and it is. The clear yellow gel is infused with strands of calendula flower petals. Calendula extracts are known to soothe skin. Aloe Vera on the other hand, is well known to hydrate and sooth. On paper therefore, this looks like quite a winning combination. For me, the Kiehl’s Calendula & Aloe Soothing Hydrating Mask is pretty much a hydrating mask. If you think of your gel moisturiser and how you can use it as a sleeping mask or as a quick mask, this feels similar. I will have to point out here, that during the media launch, I did ask if I could use this as a sleeping mask. The answerwas that it wasn’t recommended. Have I tried it? No, I actually haven’t because I now eschew sleeping masks of this texture, preferring something heavier ? If you have tried it, let me know if it works, or if your face will fall off LOL! ? I usually use this after a more intensive mask, but I do find that it isn’t as soothing as say the Antipodes Aura Manuka Honey Mask . This one feels a lot more like just a hydration mask. I do find that I don’t need to use too thick a layer on my skin. It has a nice cooling gel feel on my skin. It will not dry fully, and will feel tacky. Perhaps that’s why it won’t make such a good sleeping mask, unless you fancy washing your pillow case the next morning. I also find that it can be hard to wash off, because it feels like dried jelly on your skin. If you use warm water and rub slowly, it will eventually wash off. But I have no patience. So I always use a sponge to clean it off. It’s just quicker. Once I wash it off, I find that my skin feels noticeably smoother, with a bit of boing to it. Does it last? Well, about as long as the effects of most masks. It’s … nice. Is it something I’d recommend? Well, yes if you are in the market for a hydration mask that is pretty effective. Is it something exceptional? Well, not particularly. I’m sure there are similar gel-type hydration masks out there. IN A NUTSHELL The Kiehl’s Calendula & Aloe Soothing Hydrating Mask is a gel-type mask that comes in a tub. It’s quite a large tub that can last a while. The gel has a slightly goopy texture, and contains bits of calendula petals in it. It feels a bit cool going on the skin, and does not truly dry out. It washes off after a spell, but I use a sponge to remove just so it’s quicker. The effect of the mask for me is to boost skin hydration. I use it if my skin is feeling dry, but mostly after I use a clay or peel type mask, to rehydrate and soothe skin. It’s a nice mask but not entirely exceptional. PROS: Easy to use, Boosts skin hydration, Calms skin CONS: Pricey, Can be hard to remove with just water WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a hydration mask PRICE: RM198 | US$45 for 100ml WHERE TO BUY: Kiehl’s stores, Sephora If you’re interested, here is the list of ingredients for the Kiehl’s Calendula & Aloe Soothing Hydrating Mask: Water, Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Butylene Glycol, Ppg-26-Buteth-26, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Carbomer, Calendula Officinalis Flower, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Limon Peel Oil / Lemon Peel Oil, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Citral, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol The primary ingredients are designed to hydrate and sooth skin. The citrus oils in there do add a hint of citrus scent to the gel, and personally I think they could do without it. Have you tried this Kiehl’s Calendula mask? Do you have a similar mask to recommend? If you have a recommendation for a similar type of mask do share! I have something for masks, and have been using them very often ? Paris B']"

When I was invited to give the new Clinique Pop Lip Colour + Primer a go, I was offered a selection of colours online. I didn’t really have their names so I picked something that looked “berry-ish” a colour I knew I’d wear daily and often. As much as I love my red lipstick, I’ve not been wearing them as often as I should. When it arrived, I had a bit of an “Oh crap!” moment when I saw that contrary to what the online picture showed me, the shade was not a berry red as I thought, but a colour that verges on being “nude” or “neutral”. If there’s one thing I shy away from more than chocolate, it’s nude lipstick. (Look, I can’t be the only person out there who doesn’t like chocolate right?! ? ) The shade is 02 Bare Pop and in tube, it looked like a neutral, slightly pink-browned shade, with tiny little sparkles. My heart sank. If there’s something else I can’t handle, it’s lipstick with sparkles. But my job, as it were, is to try the formula, so I gritted my teeth, pursed my lips and slicked Bare Pop on. It’s kind of hard to explain how it happened, but much to my surprise, Bare Pop has found its way into my daily lipstick pouch! This is Clinique’s latest lipstick offering, which is a lightweight formula that is supposed to glide on with bold colour, for a pigmented lip that feels comfortable all day. I do find that the product slips on quite easily on lips in a manner almost like that of a lip balm. I also found Bare Pop to be a little sheer and not as bold and unsaturated as the brand claims. However, I am told that it’s due to the colour I picked. The brighter shades promise to have a bolder effect, which I do see from online swatches so my conclusion is that opacity may vary from colour to colour. I have also read complaints that say that Bare Pop gives lips a frosty hue, which was something I was concerned with due to the visible sparkles in the bullet. However, I don’t personally notice this frosty hue. I’ve lived through frosty lipstick. Trust me my friends, this isn’t frosty. Clinique Bare Pop swatch on arm and on lips There is however, obvious shine, which you may or may not like. Clinique also says that these apply semi-matte to which I say no. These are not matte. There is definitely a shine to it. I also find Bare Pop sheer, but then when I’m promised “bold, unsaturated colour” I expect a creamy, opaque colour. Just based on the colour in tube, I’d never have picked this one up. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised to note that when I wear it, it gives my lips a very natural colour and shine. It makes for a good “no-brainer” lipstick or a weekend lipstick or just a casual lip colour. I’d wear this with heavier eye makeup and a pop of colour on cheeks offered by the Clinique Cheek Pop blushes . As you can see, Bare Pop is a very safe lip colour. I keep it in my makeup pouch because it’s a shade I can wear irrespective of what makeup I’m using on a particular day. I have a bad habit of not carrying the lipstick I wear in the morning and not reapplying my lipstick, so it’s quite useful to have a safe shade I can pull out when I need it. The packaging deserves a mention because unlike many people who like it, I don’t. I thought I would, from online photos, but after having it for a while, I find I don’t. It’s dinky and square and I like that because it means it won’t roll around and go missing. But I don’t like the different coloured bases, which correspond to each lip colour. I suppose I’m just a little old fashioned. The colourful bases, whilst making it easy to find the colour you want in a pinch, also makes it look a little bit like a toy and unfinished. I suppose I take makeup a little more seriously hence my preference for a more streamlined look. As it stands, I have a tendency to feel like I’m working with a paint chip, which reminds me of the heady days of house renovation and cracking my head over paint chips and how I was supposed to imagine a whole wall from a tiny little chip. But I digress ? Packaging grouses aside, I’m quite happy with the colour and formula. I’m however, not in a hurry to get more colours because of the packaging. Catch-22 situation eh? ? IN A NUTSHELL The Clinique Pop Lip Colour + Primer lipstick is a new range of lipstick that promises long lasting bold lip colours that are lightweight and comfortable on lips. I do not find these drying, and I agree that they are lightweight. For me, they slick on a little like a lip balm, with quite a nice slip. Based on the shade I received, Bare Pop, I found the colour a little sheer but I’m assured that the brighter, bolder shades have a bolder swipe of colour. Bare Pop is, for me, a nice day to day neutral lip shade. It is neutral with just enough pink to prevent me from looking like the walking dead. However, I’m not a fan of the packaging which I find a little unfinished. But that’s me. I’m finicky that way. PROS: Inexpensive, Lightweight and comfortable texture, Longlasting and not drying, Bare Pop is a very safe way to wear a neutral or nude lipstick due to the pink tones, Not as metallic as I thought it would be, Smooth to apply, Not scented CONS: I’m not a fan of the packaging, Opacity of colour and shine may differ from shade to shade WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a lightweight lipstick with fairly bold pigmentation that isn’t drying Have you tried these new Pop Lip Colour + Primer lipsticks? Do you like chocolate? ? Incidentally, speaking about pops, I recently found out that Clinique has expanded their line of Cheek Pop blushes, which are the ones you see in the picture above. I haven’t seen the new shades, but if you have, please let me know what you think. I love these! They’re so good, and so pretty, and not expensive! ?

To me anyway. Almost every single item I’ve tried from the brand so far has wowed me. So far, it’s a 99% success rate (I’m not sold on Apostle and Joyous serums though I’m a bit more pro about the latter). I mean, what are the odds?! Most mainstream brands boast a far lower success rate than that. Uh so, suffice to say, this will be YET another rave review of this product that I picked up a while ago, and never got round to talking about it. But I want to, because it’s very nice, and it’s very good, and it smells delicious – like slathering warm manuka honey all over your face. Mmmm…. There is one thing I don’t quite like about it, but I’ll tell you more, once I’ve stopped oohing and ahing and generally raving about this. Bear with me ? The Antipodes Aura Manuka Honey Mask is, as the name implies, a face mask. It is a cream based, wash off product, that squeezes out from a metal tube, rather like toothpaste. I find that rather surreal so if you’re wont to make mistakes as you stumble, bleary-eyed into the bathroom in the mornings and grope about your sink, I’d suggest that you keep this away from your dental supplies. The product is a fairly lotion-like cream (if that even made sense) that spreads very easily on skin. I tend to be very generous, for a good reason I’ll explain below, so I squeeze out far more than I usually need, pampering my skin with a thick layer of creamy goodness. And there’s that smell. Do you like manuka honey? I do. I absolutely love it, because it’s not sweet like regular honey, but has a faintly sourish smell and taste. Manuka honey is also well known for its anti-bacterial properties and this facial mask is infused with this. The scent is fairly strong, but it smells very natural, so I don’t mind it. Despite it being creamy, it also washes off very easily with just water, leaving your skin feeling so soft and plumped and smooth! I love it! I’ve even left a thin layer on as an overnight mask, and it’s lovely as well, except that it doesn’t quite hydrate my skin as well. But as an intensive layer, it’s good stuff. But what really wows me, is how it works on blemishes. Minor blemishes, I might add. When I have a spot or pimple, I find that after I use this mask, it will go away more quickly. So when I’m feeling extra-spotty, or if my skin is acting up, I slap this mask on. Sometimes, I leave it on the spot overnight and it helps to defuse the situation. I also like using this mask after a clay mask or glycolic peel mask. The former tends to leave my skin feeling a little dry and I like using this cream mask to “replenish” the moisture in my skin. It feels lovely and luxurious anyway, so why not! But what is it that I don’t like? The size. The tube is a good-sized 75ml tube, but because it’s an organic product, I find that it will degrade more quickly than most. There is a 6 month expiry date from opening, as stated on the tube, and if you’re the sort who tries to do a face mask every week but don’t always succeed, you may not finish it in time. I know I haven’t. I’m past the 6 month expiry, and perhaps it’s not working as well now. Who’s to really know. I can’t measure it. The fact it comes in a tube is a good thing – less exposure to the air. But organic products do degenerate more quickly so I try to stick to their use-by date. So, this is why I’d recommend that you be generous when you use this mask. Slap on a thick layer – your skin will love it, and you’ll use it up before it expires. Personally, I’d prefer if this lovely mask came in a smaller size, with a correspondingly smaller pricetag. That way, it’s a win-win for everyone. IN A NUTSHELL The Antipodes Aura Manuka Honey Mask is a cream mask that helps boost skin hydration and also to help work on blemishes and pimples, without drying it out. It has a sweet-sourish creamy smell of manuka honey, and is very easy to apply. It doesn’t really dry out, and I feel like it “absorbs” into my skin once I leave it on. It’s also very easy to wash off with just water, without any greasy or sticky feeling after. I use this very regularly, and I think it does well to protect my skin and also to heal my skin when I have the odd blemish or two. Good stuff – check it out! PROS: Lovely smell and texture, Skin feels hydrated and calm after use, Easy to wash off, Works well to defuse pimples CONS: Packaging is too big to use up within the recommended use-by period WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a facial mask for hydration or antioxidants, Anyone who wants an effective organic skincare range Here is the ingredient list for anyone interested. Have you tried this Antipodes mask? Do you like manuka honey? I know of people who don’t, because it doesn’t taste like regular sweet honey that we’re used to. I love it though. Whenever I feel a bug coming on, I dose myself with a spoonful every hour and it usually keeps it at bay. So having it in my skincare is a bonus for me LOL! ?

I bought this on a whim a few months ago, when I was doing yet another SpaceNK haul (Yes I shop a lot there!) and for some reason, I got it in my head to try this liquid highlighter. I don’t talk a lot about using highlighters, here on the blog, because I don’t use them a lot. I never got the hang of it, and it wasn’t something I was terribly interested in, as in hot weather, it has a tendency to make you look sweaty and oily as opposed to glowy and healthy. This one however, changed my mind and had me reaching for it often. A true sign of a keeper! The Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector is a cult product that has its place in many a makeup artist’s kit. I’d come across it during my makeup research for years and years, but because Becca was no longer sold in Malaysia, I never had a chance to try it out for myself. I’ve read that Becca will be, or is available in Sephora stores soon but I cannot confirm anything, so don’t quote me. It’s also available on the Sephora.my website, but I won’t shop there , so I’m sticking to my overseas sources which are infinitely more reliable ? But what is it about this Becca highlighter that had me changing my mind about using a highlighter? Well, I think it’s to do with its texture. Despite the name, the Shimmering Skin Perfector is not very shimmery at all! When I think of highlighters, I tend to think of products with glitter or shimmer or something highly reflective. The Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector is a soft liquid, with very fine shimmer that seems to meld with the skin, and reflects only a hint of shine, but gives skin a soft glow. As the “Skin Perfector” tag implies, it does seem to make skin look even better than it already is! The shine imparted by this product is very subtle, which is basically how I like it. I don’t need to shine like a torch in the night. I just like to have luminous looking skin and this works perfectly. The only problem is that this comes in different shades, that will reflect light a little differently, so it was a little tricky for me to decide which to get. I eventually settled for Moonstone , a pale gold that promises a golden glow. Luckily for me, this was great for my needs! The Becca Moonstone Shimmering Skin Perfector is a pale gold with very subtle shimmer to it. The texture is very lightweight and does not feel sticky on skin at all. I do find that the pump does pump out quite a lot of product in one dollop, so I always have to be extra careful, as I only use very little of it each time. When blended thickly, the golden shine is quite noticeable, as you can see in the picture above. But once thinned out and blended out even further, all there is on the skin is a very subtle sheen of golden glow, that is very flattering. I’ve learned that there are a few ways you can use this, which I’ve tried to see which I like best:- Use the Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector under foundation – if you use a slightly sheerer foundation, you can apply some of the product onto the skin before you apply the foundation, like a base. This gives a lovely glow, especially if you use a sheer foundation or BB Cream over it. Use the Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector as a highlighter – Use this on top of foundation where you want to highlight, tapping a little bit of product onto where you want it to go and blending it out gently with your fingers. The effect is much more subtle and flattering than many powder highlighters that seem to shine in the dark. Blend the Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector with foundation for an all over glow – This is my favourite way to use this product, and which gives a little magical boost to your complexion. I usually drop just 1 little drop into 1 pump of foundation (I don’t do a 1:1 mix as that’s too shimmery for my liking, so I only use a tiny drop for just a bit of radiance), blend it on the back of my hand and then apply to my skin. This works especially well with medium-full coverage foundation or foundation that has a satin or matte finish. A foundation with a glow finish might end up being too glowy. I like how Moonstone gives my liquid foundations a little boost in the radiance department, so foundations don’t look too flat. Skin looks luminous and I’ve gotten numerous compliments, especially if you’re headed somewhere with soft lighting. Sure winner every time! ? IN A NUTSHELL The Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector is a popular liquid highlighter with a very lightweight texture, and very fine shimmer that gives skin a subtle, luminous glow. The texture is not sticky, nor does it turn oily on skin, and the shimmer is very finely milled, so you do not detect chunks of glitter, only very subtle glow. There are numerous ways to use it, but I like it best blended with my liquid foundations to give them a little boost of radiance, especially for foundations with a more satin texture. It makes skin look beautifully glowy without looking shiny or oily, just perfect. There are a few shades to choose from, and I picked Moonstone, a pale gold that is very flattering especially for warmer toned or Asian skin. PROS: Very lightweight texture, Not sticky on skin, Not shiny or glittery, Very fine pearly shimmer gives skin a nice luminous glow, Moonstone gives skin a bit of a warm glow that is flattering under yellow lighting, Blends easily with foundation for a flattering radiance on skin CONS: A little pricey, Pump dispenses quite a lot of product each time so control is essential WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who does not like highlighters that are very obviously shiny, Anyone who wants a multi-purpose highlighter product that gives skin a glow instead of shine PRICE: US$41 | £34 for 50ml Comes in 5 shades: Pearl, Moonstone, Opal, Topaz, Rose Gold. Opal and Moonstone are available in travel sizes on Sephora AVAILABILITY: Sephora , SpaceNK , Cult Beauty If you’re interested about what’s in the ingredient list, here it is. Now that I own one, I totally get the hype it deserves and it absolutely lives up to its cult status! If you’re afraid of using highlighters like I am, then I think you too will thoroughly enjoy this. The tricky bit is to figure out which shade to get. Opal, Topaz and Rose Gold are a little deep so will add more colour to the skin. Pearl is a pale shimmer while Moonstone is, I believe the most universally flattering. But as always, it will depend on what you want ? Have you tried the iconic Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector? Do you use highlighters a lot? These come in a pressed powder version as well as a cream version, both of which, I’ve read have more shimmer payoff. For me, this liquid version is perfect, because I like how subtle it is. I’m more about glow vs shine so I think I’m good in terms of texture and colour ? If you’ve tried this, which shade did you pick? Paris B']"

This was about a year ago (that’s how far back I’m backlogged LOL!) when I was messing around with different cleansing waters, and I went “Hey? Biore has a cleansing water too?” So, since it wasn’t terribly expensive, I picked up a bottle and stuck it in my “To-try” cupboard. Yes, I have a cupboard. Skincare, it’s a disease ? I have an interesting observation though. The one I have here is called Biore Makeup Remover Perfect Cleansing Water . However, I have seen reviews online for a similar product labelled Biore Makeup Remover Micellar Cleansing Water. Are they the same thing? Can anyone verify if they are?! Either way though, I have to point out that this Biore cleansing water is a little more specific than the French cleansing waters, like Bioderma or Caudalie that tell you that it operates as a waterless face cleanser. This one is being marketed as a makeup remover, albeit a mild and gentle on skin one, and rightly so, to my mind. I broke out this bottle when I had used up the last drop of my Dr. Brandt cleansing water (I’m actually finishing up a lot of products these days before moving on), and much to my surprise, I found that I quite liked this. That’s very healthy for my wallet too, so I’m not complaining! The Biore Perfect Cleansing Water comes in a fairly large bottle with a convenient pump. To use, I usually saturate a piece of cotton pad and then wipe it over the parts of my face that need makeup removal i.e. all over. If you are, at this point, wondering why I use a makeup remover or cleansing water when I’m such a strong advocate of cleansing balms or cleansing oils , the reason is simple. I don’t like, nor believe in 1 product doing everything even if it’s a balm or oil, and I don’t like using these products around my eye area. If you are concerned about wrinkles and crow’s feet , you wouldn’t too! So, since I’m already using a separate eye makeup remover, it only made sense for me to extend it to the rest of my face. So for me, a cleansing water operates not as a first cleanse, but as a makeup remover. I honestly do not care a lot about how well it removes ALL my makeup, so long as it gets rid of MOST of my makeup, because I always follow on with a cleansing balm and then a second cleanse. Yeah, I lead a complicated life ? I do find that the Biore cleansing water removes my makeup fairly well. I don’t use thick eyeliner, but when I do use a liquid liner, I just have to hold the cotton pad against my lid for a while before wiping off and it’s clean. I don’t wear mascara so I can’t tell you how this works to remove waterproof mascara. However, it cleans off lipstick, eyeshadow, foundation and brow pencil quite well and easily without my having to rub at it. The sticker on my bottle claims that this “instantly removes makeup” Well, don’t believe everything you read, kids. It doesn’t do it instantly, but it does remove makeup quite quickly. For my eyes, I hold it there for a bit before wiping off. Sometimes, my brows take a few more wipes but for my face, I usually get it gone in 1-2 wipes. So, not instant, but you don’t have to rub either. There’s no scent and it doesn’t dry out my skin. I do follow up with my cleansing balm or just go straight to using a cleanser on lazy days so as I’ve mentioned above, I’m not particular about this getting off every scrap of my makeup. As this touts itself as a makeup remover and not a facial cleanser, I will advise that you follow up with a rinse with water if you’re really really lazy (and why are you, pray? ? ) or better still, follow up with a cleanser. Treat this as your first cleanse if you want or be like me and just treat this as a makeup remover. But you know what, I treat ALL cleansing water as a makeup remover. I know, people often ask me why I bother with an extra step when a cleansing oil or balm does the job in just one go. Well I have my reasons as I’ve set out above. But the other reason is because I don’t believe in micellar waters being a water-free facial cleanser. For me, whichever micellar cleansing water I use, I always rinse off and follow up with a proper cleanser. I don’t believe in waterless anything if you really want to be clean. You don’t use a micellar cleansing water for your body do you? You take a shower. So, what would you do it for your face?! ? But I’ll preach about it another day. For today, know that I’m happy with this very affordable cleansing water/makeup remover and that I’m happy to keep this in my rotation till I use up the last drop. You may see another in the future, heck I’m fickle. But if I don’t buy another, or be sent one I’ll go back to this one ? IN A NUTSHELL The Biore Makeup Remover Perfect Cleansing Water is a water based makeup remover that I find effective at removing most of my makeup. I am not fussed about residue because I always follow up with a cleansing balm or cleansing oil for a thorough cleanse, which is what I’d recommend. I do not recommend that you cleanse with this and nothing else. It isn’t drying, and has no scent. It’s also very affordable so I’m not fussed about picking up another bottle when I’m done with this one. PROS: Affordable, Gentle texture, Removes most of my makeup effectively, No scent, Not drying CONS: Pump often sprays product out at an odd angle if not careful WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants an oil-free makeup remover, Anyone who uses cleansing waters for their makeup removal For anyone interested, here’s the ingredient list for the Perfect Cleansing Water. Have you tried this Perfect Cleansing Water? Do you use cleansing waters as makeup removers or do you use it as a first cleanse/facial cleanser? This goes on sale pretty often, based on what I see in the local pharmacies, so that’s when I’d picked up my bottle. It may also come in smaller sizes but I’m not sure about that. I’m quite happy with this as a makeup remover but if you know of an affordable one just as good, SHARE! ?

I was told these very popular Clinique Cheek Pop blushes would be available here in mid-February, but it seems like it might be delayed. I’m afraid I’m running with this however as it’s already been scheduled, so if you don’t see it at your Clinique counter or online (you do know you can shop online ?), don’t fret. It’ll appear in time, and they are permanent and they will be worth the wait I promise you! What are these Cheek Pop blushes then? One of the new hidden gems from Clinique! The Cheek Pop blushes are vibrant blushes that come in 4 very wearable shades and whilst are powder blushes, have an interesting cream-to-powder texture and finish that is fascinating. But what will really catch the eye of most people would be the design. We have not see something this pretty, yet this functional in a very long time! The Cheek Pop blushes come imprinted with a gerbera on its surface which is impressive with its attention to detail and intricacy. The best part is that the embossing does not disappear with a few uses. I’ve been using these quite regularly and the pattern is still pretty intact. In fact, these pictures were taken after a couple of uses so you will have reason to smile at these flowery blushes for a long time to come ? But pretty pattern aside, the Clinique Cheek Pop blushes pack a punch and I must say, surprised me every step of the way. These deserve all the accolades tossed at them, and then some! Each Cheek Pop blush comes housed in a transparent lucite case, with a base that corresponds to the colour in it. There are 4 shades available for now:- Plum Pop – a light cool pink Berry Pop – a deep berry pink Ginger Pop – a warm coral red Peach Pop – a warm coral pink I have yet to see Ginger Pop and Peach Pop for myself but I have been seeing many pictures and swatches online and they look absolutely beautiful so I’m quite taken with them too. They are the warmer shades so if you fare well with peach and coral blushes you will want to look at those and if you fare better with pink shades then you will probably prefer Plum Pop or Berry Pop. Clinique Cheek Pop in Berry Pop for size reference They aren’t very large, but the colours pack a punch and the price is very affordable (RM80 yo!) so I really am not complaining at all. In pan, and putting Berry Pop and Plum Pop side by side, I must confess that it is actually quite hard to tell them apart. The tonal shades are close and unless you view them in bright light, they aren’t that noticeably different. Clinique Cheek Pop Left: Plum Pop Right: Berry Pop In brighter light, you will notice that Berry Pop has a deeper colour that Plum Pop but to the naked eye there is minimal difference. Does that mean therefore that you can just get away with just one instead of both? Actually I do think you can. Whilst there are subtle tonal difference between the 2 cool shades and the 2 warm shades, I personally find them a little too similar on skin to warrant getting all 4 unless you are a collector. However, between each tone category lies also a subtle difference so it does pay to get the shade right the first time. Clinique Cheek Pop Swatches Left: Plum Pop Right: Berry Pop As you can see, while Plum Pop and Berry Pop look similar in pan, on skin they are quite different. Plum Pop, despite its name displays no plummy tones and instead is a light, cool toned pink which I personally find flattering on fair skintones. On deeper skintones you may have to layer it a bit. So for deeper skintones, I think Berry Pop will serve you better. It is a cool toned berry pink that I’d pick in a heartbeat if it was a lipstick but in a blush, it is a shade that gives me pause. I personally think this will be more flattering on someone with deeper skintone and while I get it to work, I need to be careful with it and I prefer using Plum Pop which I find more flattering. Clinique Berry Pop blush – look at the intricacy of the pattern! This is after at least 2 uses. The texture of these Cheek Pop blushes are very interesting as they actually feel a bit like a cream and even look like a cream blush but it’s a powder blush. I just use my regular blush brush to pick up product and even the soft Lunasol Cheek Brush works just fine. In fact, I like using it because it picks up just enough colour to allow me to build on as when I work with Berry Pop I find it a bit too strong for my skintone. So my advise would be to work out the shade you’d like and then go with a light hand and blend and build colour along the way because these are surprisingly pigmented. Longevity is very good as well. I apply these over foundation and they last practically all day on me – a minimum of 8 hours before I notice it’s gone. The incredible texture gives me a sheer, blush from within glow that I love especially with Plum Pop so that’s my favourite of the 2 that I have. I am considering Peach Pop as I suspect that Ginger Pop might be the counterpart to Berry Pop, both being deeper in tone, so I’ll report back when I get it ? For completeness, here’s how both the blushes look when I wear them. This is Plum Pop, the cooler light pink toned blush. This one’s Berry Pop the slightly deeper toned berry blush used with a very light hand and blended out. To be perfectly honest, on cheeks, despite the difference in lighting etc, there is little difference between Berry Pop and Plum Pop. I find Plum Pop more flattering and less likely for me to make a mistake with. With Berry Pop, I can sometimes look like I’ve put on too much blush and it then looks less flattering on my skin. Personally, I’d just pick one from each category, despite the affordable pricetag and incredible texture. It just doesn’t quite make sense to own all 4. In a nutshell Get them when they’re released! ? These new Cheek Pop powder blushes from Clinique apply like a cream and give a very lovely transparent glow on the skin that is very flattering. The colours are vibrant and will flatter most skin tones. I personally find them too similar to warrant owning all 4, but owning one cool and one warm shade does make sense as they are excellent quality products, long lasting, pretty to look at, easy to use and very affordable. You can’t ask for more in a blush! Pros: Affordable, Longlasting, Pigmented, Pretty design, Compact and easy to use, Flattering colours, Permanent, Not powdery on skin Cons: None Who will like this: Anyone who loves a pretty blush, Anyone who wants an affordable blush that performs well and does not look powdery on skin I have to admit I was taken by surprise by these Cheek Pop blushes. I own a Clinique blush or two and while they are alright, they aren’t anything I’d write home about. Some of the pretty patterned ones released in previous years are a right disappointment as they were so sheer to be invisible. These however, have received accolades and bouquets all over the world and I must say, they deserve every bit of it. After the Chubby Stick Intense , these are the next best things to have come out of the Clinique makeup stable in recent years and I’m so glad they’ve finally stepped up their game. Good job! ? Are you eyeing these blooming beauties? Which colours would you get? I plan to pick up Peach Pop, based on the swatches I’ve been seeing. It looks pretty but I do want to check it out in person first to ensure it’s not too warm. I personally would only pick one cool and one warm colour, but you know, don’t let me stop you getting all 4 if it strikes your fancy ?

It is a fairly new brand in the market and new to me, but thus far, most of the products I’ve used have been a positive experience. However, they aren’t moved to churn out new products so often, so a brand new product in their range made me take notice. It was the Antipodes Manuka Honey Skin-Brightening Light Day Cream , which is quite a mouthful, so I’ll just refer to it as the Manuka Honey Light Day Cream. What interested me, aside from the Manuka Honey (their Aura manuka honey mask is a gem!) is the inclusion of bee venom alongside their signature ingredient of Vinanza grape and kiwi fruit. The last is fitting, since it hails from New Zealand. But bee venom! I knew bee venom, as a skincare ingredient, was a thing for a while, after snail slime. But I’d never tried anything with bee venom. Not because I’m squeamish about it, but simply because I just never got around to it. Apparently, bee venom is supposed to give skin a mild stimulating effect, to give a tightening and firming feeling to the skin. Personally, I can’t say I’m sold on the ingredient, although the cream itself is quite nice. I received a tester product, as you can see from the pictures, and the first thing I’d note is the scent. Antipodes says the fragrance is from the manuka flower and manuka honey, but truth be told, I found it too strong and sweet. If you favour gourmand scents, you may like it. I personally am not into the scent, which does linger a little on skin. It isn’t unpleasant nor artificial in any way. It just smells sweet, like a honey cake covered with frosted cream and I’m just not into that – whether to eat or to smell ? The cream itself however, is very nice. The texture is quite runny, just a little thicker than honey. So, it will drip, and you can’t really scoop up product very easily. It actually feels rather more like a lotion than a cream, so it is a bit of a misnomer. However, the texture is very nice, without the heaviness of silicone, and it spreads very easily on skin, like spreading honey on toast. I usually just scoop out a little with my finger, warm it up between my palms and then apply to skin. It sinks in nicely without leaving a residue, and does not feel heavy or greasy at all. While this is sold as a day cream, the texture is a little heavier than most day creams, so if you have oily-combination skin, you may find it a little uncomfortable for day, if you live here in Malaysia. You may want to then use this in the evening. If you live where it’s cold and dry, it may be able to work there. If you have drier skin like I do, then this is nice in the day. It seems to just coat your skin with an enveloping veil of moisture that is very comfortable and although it is heavier than most day creams, does not make skin turn oily, nor does it mess with your makeup. I like how it keeps my skin feeling comfortable all day, although I do use hydrating serums underneath. However, despite the name, I did not notice any skin lightening benefits. It was a concern of mine when I took this cream for a spin, because I’m not into skin whitening products. While Antipodes says that their Vinanza grape extract and kiwi provide antioxidants to make skin look brighter, I did not personally notice much of a difference. My skin was comfortable, without sensitivity or redness, but nothing much else that was noticeable. What I did appreciate was the comfort as a day cream for drier skin. The other thing was the bee venom, which would have offered some skin firming properties, I’m guessing. I didn’t notice anything particularly drastic either. Perhaps it helped, perhaps it didn’t. I can’t tell, because I can’t and will not depend on a cream alone to do that job. That’s what serums are for ? A point to note is that this is supposed to contain Manuka Honey with a Active 20+ rating, that helps not only sooth skin, but also reduce or sooth away any blemishes you may have. I must say that during this time that I’ve been using this Manuka Honey Day Cream, I haven’t been experiencing much, if any, breakouts, and even when I do get the odd one, it disappears quite quickly. I didn’t quite make the connection till now LOL! ? But it could well be to do with this cream. After all, I used to use the Aura mask whenever my skin felt off or if I had a spot. Gets rid of it in no time at all! You don’t need very much, and even if you were to use this twice a day, I’m confident that a jar will last at least 3 months. I’ve been at this for about 2 months at least, and I’m about halfway through, using it just once a day in the day. While I think it to be a very nice cream, especially if you have drier skin, and it’s a very nicely formulated product overall (scent aside, but that’s personal) it is rather pricey. The Vanilla Pod Day Cream is also nice and a wee bit more affordable. I think this will appeal if you love the brand, like I do, or if organic skincare is your thing. IN A NUTSHELL The Antipodes Manuka Honey Light Day Cream is a new product from the brand in the Manuka Honey range. It contains Manuka Honey (Active 20+) to soothe skin and help heal blemishes, bee venom for firming and Vinanza grape and kiwi extracts for antioxidant properties and skin brightening. The texture is a little runny, which does take some getting used to, and it can move around in the jar. The cream however, is easy to spread on skin and sinks in beautifully and comfortably, enveloping the skin with a veil of moisture. In hot, humid climates, it might be more suited for those with drier skin, unless you use less and feel it’s comfortable. The only bee in my bonnet is the scent, which I find too sweet and strong. While it isn’t artificial, it does smell too gourmand for my tastes. But it is otherwise a cream I enjoy using. PROS: Absorbs easily into skin, Skin feels comfortable and moisturised all day, May help heal and prevent blemishes, Very comfortable to use CONS: Scent is too strong and sweet, A little pricey, Runny texture can move around in the jar so it may not be travel friendly, I didn’t notice brightening of my skin WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who feels like their skin could do with some added moisture, Anyone who favours organic skincare and who has blemish-prone skin PRICE: RM259 | NZD76 | £39.99 for 60ml WHERE TO BUY: TNS Skinlabs stores and online (MY), Antipodes website , Priceline (Australia) For those interested as to what’s in the Antipodes Manuka Honey Day Cream, here’s the ingredient list. It is worth noting that if you are allergic to bee stings, you may want to avoid this cream due to the bee venom ingredient. I’m not sure if it’s that potent, but it always pays to be careful! Have you tried this new day cream from Antipodes? Do you use Manuka Honey at home? I’ve tried a few skincare products thus far that contain honey or its extracts, as an ingredient and I must say that it usually works quite well on blemishes. In fact, if you have manuka honey on hand (the sort you eat), you can apply some to a spot or blemish or even a wound on skin, and it’ll help it heal. Honey is quite magical, and it’s delicious too! I always have a jar of manuka honey at home – helps stave away cough and scratchy throats ? Paris B']"

But here’s one I particularly enjoy using that I think many will too. I bought Wayne Goss brushes when they were sold from a website in the UK, some time last year. He’s since consolidated his supplier to just Beautylish.com which I cannot vouch for, as I’ve never bought from them, but I know many have. First off, let’s get this out of the way – Wayne Goss brushes are pricey. They are premium Japanese brush pricey, which means that yes, you may have to break your piggy bank to buy one. But to be fair, they are natural hair brushes (I love natural hair!) and they are very well made. I picked up a few of his brushes a while ago, and I’ve shared my thoughts on Brush 1 and Brush 8 before this. Brush 2 took some getting used to for me, but once I got used to the size, I fell head over heels! You know how they say that with makeup, sometimes, it’s not about the product. Sometimes, it’s about how you apply it. A good makeup tool can truly make a big difference in how a product looks on your skin. Brush 2 is a soft brush, with a fairly small, tapered head. The hairs are soft and not scratchy and have a bit of flex to them. I have placed it next to a Clinique Cheek Pop blush , because they have a standard size globally and you may have a better idea of size this way. This brush was designed to be used for applying blush or bronzer, and it does make your job a lot easier. You may appreciate that the brush head is quite small. I’d been used to larger brush heads before this, so this came as a bit of a surprise, and I wasn’t sure how to use it. However, what makes this brush unique and very very useful, is not only the size, but the density of the brush. It looks fluffy, but isn’t floppy. It is fairly dense, yet with some give. But what makes it so practical, is that it applies blush perfectly. The smallish head places colour precisely where you need it to go, on the apples of your cheeks for a fresh pop of colour; or if you use a bronzer, in the hollows of your cheekbones, to create dimension. The hairs also pick up colour very easily, which I found surprising, and they are so soft that blending out colour gives your skin a lovely glowy, diffused colour. I find that because of the shape and size of the brush head, I get my blush right every single time. No guesswork needed, and no “Oh darn, my blush is too low/high!” moments. This is especially important when working with pigmented blushes, because if you make a mistake, it’s very noticeable. I tend to use the side of the brush, brushing it in an up and down motion along my cheekbones (or where I think my cheekbones should be LOL!) I don’t use the tip/top, as I would a regular blush brush. However, if the blush is a lighter/harder textured product, then I do find that this brush can take a little more work. In those situations, I usually go for something a little more dense, that picks colour up more easily. This will work too, but I just have to work it a little more over the surface of the product. But for blush placement, this brush really makes this idiot-proof which is why I love it so! Now, how does it compare to my other favourite blush brush – Lunasol Cheek Brush N ? Well, they’re kind of different. I still use the Lunasol, when this Wayne Goss Brush 2 is in the wash. You could say that I rotate these brushes and I like them both. The Lunasol one is fluffier and gives a more diffused effect, like how the Japanese like their blushes you know? That blush from within effect. With the Wayne Goss Brush 2, I get a more precise effect. So, I can see colour better on my skin. If I want something a little more precise, I use this one. If I want a “I don’t really want to think about it, I just want a flush of colour” effect, then I use the Lunasol. But both have their place and I’d be pretty devastated if I misplaced either of them! IN A NUTSHELL The Wayne Goss Brush 2 is primarily used for applying blush and bronzer. The small, tapered brush head allows you to place colour quite precisely on your cheeks and the soft hairs blend out the colour for a soft glow. The brush head is soft yet not floppy and not too dense, so it is easy to work with, and the handle is about the right length, with a good weight. It is a well-made brush and the price reflects it! PROS: Soft natural brush hair is not scratchy, Not floppy, Easy to use and wash, Good quality product with good weight and make CONS: Not easily available, Pricey WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who appreciates a good quality makeup blush brush, Anyone who likes using natural hair brushes I like how he made the body and ferrule black. It makes the brush look more sleek, and for some reason, less like a paint-brush, unlike e.g. Hakuhodo. I have a couple more I like, so I’ll tell you more about them as I go…. as I remember to ? A note on pricing: At current exchange rates, this brush works out to about RM152. Not terribly expensive, if you ask me, for a high quality natural hair brush. Equivalent or maybe cheaper than anything you can find locally at MAC or Shu Uemura (Pony 20 is RM228) (where else do people buy brushes locally?! Online fakes and scams don’t count!) and a million miles better in terms of quality and softness. The only problem will be the shipping and waiting time, but hey, it’s worth it! ? Do you own the Wayne Goss Brush 2? Do you have other favourite Wayne Goss brushes? I have a couple more that I like and use quite a lot. Brush 1 is one, but I have similar ones from Hakuhodo and Shiseido so to me, it’s sort of OK. Brush 2 is quite a winner as is Brush 8. Currently, I’m using Brush 18 a lot, which is the eye brush in the bottom. Remind me to tell you about that next! ?

This troubles me and my wallet, because sunscreen is something I don’t skimp on in terms of use, and something I run through quite quickly. Often, when I make this lament, I’m requested to try something cheaper. Often, one brand that pops up quite frequently, is Senka. Incidentally, Senka is one of the drugstore brands under the Shiseido umbrella. One day, when I was at a Watson’s store, I noticed that Senka products were on sale. They had a few different types of sunscreen on offer, but I noticed one called the Senka Mineral UV Essence SPF50+ PA++++ . I included the packaging in this shot so you know what it looks like. I find that pharmacy brands tend to have different packaging or more simplistic packaging, and that can sometimes make it harder to identify a product. This is more so when the tube itself is very plain, with everything on it written in Japanese. Without the backing card, I’d have no idea what it says! The real reason I picked up the Senka Mineral UV Essence sunscreen is because it boasts high UVA and UVB protection, while promising a light texture and more importantly, only set me back a mere RM20 (US$5). I. KID. YOU. NOT! OK, it was on sale. But it regularly retails for RM39.90 (under US$10) for 50g. Hey, it was worth an experiment! ? After using it for a while, and before I sat down to pen my thoughts, I did a quick search online. Much to my surprise, this Senka Mineral UV Essence sunscreen is very highly raved. Leaving aside those who got comped, there was still a sizeable part of the Asian Beauty skincare community who loved this sunscreen. Ok, here’s the rub. I don’t. It isn’t the texture. I quite like the texture, which is heavier and more creamy. My drier skin likes it because it sits on my skin very comfortably. In a dry or cold environment, you may like it as well, as it will feel more comfortable. If you live in the tropics and have oily skin, don’t pick this one. You will use too little, and it will not do its job properly. You see, as I repeat ad nauseum , you need to wear enough sunscreen. Enough means a liberal amount to cover every bit of exposed skin on your face (and body). In my case, I apply one finger’s length (I use my 3rd finger which is the longest) to each part of my face. I am liberal with my use. I believe it’s the only thing keeping my sunspots at bay. If you have oily skin and pick this one, you will wear very little, because it will feel uncomfortable. You then aren’t using enough, and may as well not bother. Texture-wise therefore, I am happy with this. It has a lotion-cream texture and feels comfortable (on drier skin). My makeup sits well over, and there is no white cast (the composition is why as you’ll see below). Why I don’t quite like this Senka Mineral UV Essence sunscreen however, is because it didn’t seem to protect my skin as well as I was hoping it would. I was a little misled by its name on the pack. You see, it says on the pack “Mineral UV Essence” or “UV Mineral Essence” however you read it. “Mineral” here, I thought to mean, meant it contained mineral UV blockers. I did a quick scan of the ingredient list in store, but I was in a hurry (and it was just RM20 – which brings me to my post yesterday ) and couldn’t tell off hand if there were any. So I thought I’d go home and do my research there. This is the ingredient list for the Senka Mineral UV Essence sunscreen. I was correct in my initial view. There are no mineral UV blockers, usually Titanium Dioxide or Zinc Oxide. It is these that tend to give the white cast associated with sunscreen, which is why this one does not have a cast. Instead, what this is, is a sunscreen with chemical UV filters and UV absorbers (Avobenzone – Butyl Ethoxydibenzoylmethane, Octinoxate – Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, Polysilicone-15, Octocrylene, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate). This makes this a chemical based sunscreen. Not that I have anything against that, I was just curious why the use of the word “mineral” if there were no mineral UV blockers in there. I later found out on a search online, that “mineral” here referred to “mineral WATER from Mount Fuji”. You know what? I don’t give a flying fish where the damn water came from! I just wish it said “Mineral WATER” on the pack! I felt it to be rather misleading in this regard. Perhaps the Japanese words say so? I don’t know, since I can’t read Japanese and only have the English words on the pack to go by. And when I realised that this was a chemical sunscreen, I understood why I did not like it. You see, my skin does not play well with purely chemical based sunscreen. I have learned over the years, that to be effective on my skin (which seems to react quite quickly to UV and sun exposure by developing pigment spots and heating up) sunscreens I use must also contain zinc oxide, titanium dioxide or a combination of both. These are what are popularly known as “physical blockers” because they are literally ground up minerals that sit on the surface of your skin to block UV rays from reaching your skin. They are also known as “mineral sunscreens” if they have a high concentration of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide or both. For me, a purely chemical based sunscreen does not protect my skin sufficiently from the damaging UV rays. I did notice new sun spots appear, which distressed me greatly, because I already face an uphill challenge dealing with what I already have. So, I’ve stopped using this sunscreen. I’ll use it on my body. But it’s not going anywhere near my face ever again. I’m not saying here that this is a bad product. From a formulation point of view, I think it is decent. There is a good selection of UV filters in there to filter both UVA and UVB rays and if your skin can tolerate chemicals then it’s fine. The formula is comfortable on skin and it does not leave a white cast. But I have a nagging feeling that it does not protect your skin as well as the significantly more expensive Shiseido Perfect UV Protector (which contains both Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide aside some chemical filters) does and will. For this reason, this is no substitute for me. IN A NUTSHELL The Senka Mineral UV Essence SPF50+ PA++++ Sunscreen is a very affordable sunscreen. However, despite the misleading name, it contains no physical mineral UV blockers and is a purely chemical sunscreen. The word “mineral” refers to “mineral water”. The formula is a lotion-cream that can feel heavy on oily skin so will suit drier skin or those living in a cold and drier climate better. For me, this does not work well enough to protect my skin. I developed new sun spots and I feel that the chemical filters are insufficient. However I am no expert, so you’ll have to judge for yourself. PROS: Very affordable, Feels comfortable on drier skin CONS: Did not protect my skin well enough from UV rays, My skin heats up even though I wear a significant amount of product, and I developed new sun spots, Can feel heavy on oily skins WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who is comfortable using a chemical filter sunscreen, Anyone who is comfortable with a heavier textured cream PRICE: RM39.90 for 50g (often goes on sale) WHERE TO BUY: Watson’s stores I also noticed after leaving a dollop on my skin for a while, that it breaks down a little, similar to this one by The Body Shop . Incidentally, I also hated that one ? Have you tried this Senka Mineral UV Essence sunscreen? I hate to say this, but barring a major reformulation, I doubt I’d ever stray from the Shiseido Perfect UV Protector sunscreen. What’s important for me is that it’s easy for me to replenish. There’s no use my buying something that might be good, but which is unavailable locally. It doesn’t stop me shopping around, but I’m staying away from purely chemical filter sunscreens from now on. Now tell me. Are you a fan of this one? It’s really cheap! ? Paris B']"

First, to get hold of it – it’s a staggering, jaw-dropping, wallet-emptying £85 a bottle. That’s sh*tload of money in any currency in the world, but much more so with the plummeting RM. Second, to figure out if this £85 was something my skin would take to. This, is the very popular cult product, Good Genes by Sunday Riley . Yes, it costs £85 for 30ml. It’s alright, I’ll wait while you pick your jaw off of the floor ? Back? ? Ok, I’d read a lot of wonderful things about Good Genes Treatment serum before this, but it wasn’t until I was told by my friend Geek, about how good it was for her, and read how well it works for Tine , that I finally capitulated. Nothing better than actually hearing from someone who has actually used it, and has no vested interests, you know. So one day, when I was feeling flush, I decided to bite the bullet and get a bottle. I bought mine from SpaceNK although you can also get it from Cult Beauty . Both are UK based websites that I shop at often, and have had good experiences with. So, what is this serum then? Good Genes is a bit of a multi-tasking product that is aimed at reducing signs of aging, while smoothing, refining, clarifying and brightening the skin while improving on skin thickness and elasticity. Its key ingredient is lactic acid (40%), and contains a load of actives that aren’t quite aimed at anyone with very sensitive skin. In fact, you are warned that you may even experience tingling on your skin when you use it. It is a chemical AHA-based exfoliant so I’m really not surprised. My friends tell me that this serum is one they can’t do without, and despite the prohibitive price tag, they have even bought replacements once they were done. It keeps their skin feeling and looking smooth, clear and good. In fact, I was told that the difference in NOT using it, is visible. I knew then, I HAD TO HAVE THIS! I’d live on bread and water for a few months, but I had to have this serum! First though, let me tell you about the smell. Many people had warned about how badly this serum smells. There is no artificial floral fragrance, nor would I call this a pleasure to the senses when you use this. So, I was braced for something really stinky. The thing is, I didn’t find it super stinky. If you’ve ever used Perricone Cold Plasma, you’d understand what stinky is (it smells of old, rotting fish) but this wasn’t in that league. I found that Good Genes has a strong scent that is metallic and sharp on the nasal senses, with a slightly sourish note, not dissimilar to that of vinegar. Personally, I didn’t find it unpleasant. Unusual yes, but not unpleasant. If you dislike scents like that, then do be warned. It’s strong, but it will dissipate eventually. I’ve not been bugged by it at all. That said, I’d be more prone to complaining about strong floral scents, so it’s just how my nose works. If you prefer your skincare to smell pleasant and comforting, you’ll hate this. But if I were you, I’d suck it up, because this is a pretty good product if you don’t already use a lot of acids and retinols in your routine. Because of how active it is, I only use it at night, and I only use half a pump. The pump locks in place so if you travel with it, you don’t have to fear your precious serum spurting out everywhere in your bag. The pump is also easy to control, so it’s easy to dispense product. I started out using 1 full pump, but I found that it was a bit too much for me. The directions actually specify 2-3 pumps for best results, but it was too much for me (and for my wallet!) Initially, when I first started using Good Genes, I wasn’t too thrilled with it. I suppose, I was expecting quite a lot out of it. I also started experiencing minor breakouts. That bugged me. I’m not allergic nor sensitive to lactic acid, and I don’t generally have very sensitive skin. In fact, I did not experience any tingling in my skin at all when using this serum. However, I eventually worked out that if I use it on alternate days, I’d break out less. After about a month, I reduced the amount used to half a pump each evening, and I realised I could then use it nightly without breaking out. The serum pumps out a white lotion that absorbs easily into the skin and dries quite quickly. I use it after cleansing and toning, applying it to my skin then letting it dry, before following on with facial oils and moisturiser. Personally speaking, I find that when I use it daily, I notice that my skin does feel smoother, and it looks clearer. When I stop it for a while, and then come back to it, I do notice overnight results, in that tired skin looks a little less tired, and lines are noticeably softened. This is so if I’ve had a late night. This boosts my complexion the next day. Being a chemical exfoliant, this isn’t really surprising. However, while the serum also claims to even out hyperpigmentation, I personally did not experience any improvements in that area. If anyone should notice an improvement, that would be me, but my pigmentation is still there and not shifted one bit. If I spread out its use to alternate days or 3 times a week, as I was doing when I noticed I was getting spot, I noticed that the results were less significant, and you will take much longer to notice results. In that sense, and because I do experience minor spots when I use this too often, I’d personally say that it’s hard for me to tell you to run out and buy it on the strength of testimony alone. You’d have to be fairly patient and in tune with your skin, I feel, to best appreciate this product. Not just buy into the hype because oh yes! There is a huge huge hype surrounding this and most Sunday Riley products. So, is it worth £85 (RM553 at today’s exchange rate)? Yes and No. Yes, if you have the cash and are willing to splurge on skincare. You must also be someone who is in tune with your skin and realise that you may not notice as glowing a result as the next person. I like how it gives my skin a bit of a boost the next day, especially when I’ve not used it for a few days. Then, I notice the results. Sometimes, if I haven’t used it for a few days and my skin looks exceptionally tired or stressed, I give myself a full pump, massaged in all over and topped up with just a night moisturiser. A little like a “mask”. I always look better the next morning. I’m also someone who’s quite willing to splurge on skincare so I may be the exception. No, if you have very sensitive skin that doesn’t take well to lactic acid, and if the price is too prohibitive. I realise that there’s a lot that one can do with £85/RM553 so this isn’t something you MUST buy or use. If you already take care of your skin with other products (this isn’t one you can use on its own, but is an additional product in your skincare regimen) then you can and possibly will get by without this. You won’t miss what you’ve never had. But you might, if your skin takes well to it and you find it too prohibitive a habit to keep up. Will I repurchase? Again, yes and no. I will, if I feel like I have the funds and can justify a purchase. But because I don’t notice as significant result and improvement to my skin as many others do (For the uninitiated, I already do take pretty good care of my skin generally speaking) I might divert my funds to try something else unless there’s an offer on Good Genes that I can’t resist because I like using it as a “treatment”. In that sense, you could say that I’m not as sold on this as many people are, although I do like it as a product. Confused? ? IN A NUTSHELL Sunday Riley Good Genes treatment is a serum with high content of lactic acid, that helps plump up and smoothen fine lines, boost skin elasticity, and also brighten, refine and clarify. It isn’t recommended for those who have very sensitive skin, and you are warned about a tingling feeling on your skin, although I did not experience it. I found that using a full pump daily (in the evening) can cause me to break out in the odd spot or two. So I use it on alternate days or about 3 times a week, or half a pump if used daily. That seems to work for me. While I found that it does boost skin radiance (especially overnight, if your skin is very tired) and makes my skin feel and look smoother and clearer, it does nothing for my pigmentation. I like it for the boost it gives my skin, and how my skin takes to it, but I don’t personally think this a must have, simply because of the high pricetag. Because of the price, I’d say that it’s a good product to own and use, if you don’t feel the pinch; but otherwise, you probably won’t miss it. You don’t miss what you don’t have! PROS: High content of lactic acid works well to soften lines and skin, Skin looks and feels smoother, Skin looks clearer and more radiant, Noticeably boosts a tired complexion almost overnight, Lightweight texture, Absorbs quickly with no greasy feeling, Not drying CONS: The strong, sharp, metallic, vinegary smell may not sit well with many people though I’m alright with it, Very pricey, May cause minor breakouts, Not available in Malaysia WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who can afford the high price tag, Anyone who wants a product that can produce visible results to soften fine lines and improve skin texture, Anyone who is in tune with their skin and doesn’t mind a strong smelling serum This is the ingredient list for Good Genes for anyone interested. If you look at the directions, it says you can leave it on as a mask and then rinsed off. I’ve toyed with the idea of trying that, but every time, I balk. I just can’t justify washing this off! So, I use it only as a leave on serum – half or 1 pump will do the trick for most of us I feel. 2-3 pumps is A LOT (I tried it the 1st time, following instructions, and was so horrified at how much that was and how quickly that would mean I run through a bottle, that I hastily cut back the next day) and will just be too much for most of our wallets ? Have you tried the cult Good Genes serum? Are you in love with it? I’ve been asked quite a lot about this so I figured I’d better get my thoughts out there, jumbled as they appear to be. Like a lot of skincare, it works differently for everyone. I’d love to know if you love it, and whether the scent bugs you, or better yet, tell me if there are other Sunday Riley products I should try! ?

The reason I was so keen to put it into immediate use was because I walked out of the brief facial with skin that looked ethereal. Pores were tiny. Skin was glowy and fresh. I was so impressed by the Shiseido Yutaka Treatment facial that I’m going to try the full session at their salon soon. It was that impressive! But I also wanted to see if I could achieve this beautiful glow to the skin at home. So, I’ll walk you through each of the products in the Future Solution LX range and tell you what I think ? The Shiseido Future Solution LX range sits at the pinnacle of Shiseido’s skincare range, and is their luxury range. Prices therefore reflect that. While the Future Solution range isn’t new, Shiseido has recently reformulated it into the Future Solution LX range, by developing a new anti-aging ingredient they call the “skingenecellEnmei”. This is an ingredient derived from the Enmei herb, grown at the foot of Mt. Koya, and is a well known herb in Japan for its regenerative, restorative and healing properties. Combining this with skingenecell 1P and Vitamin C Ethyl II, they created skingenecellEnmei. The Shiseido Future Solution LX range is targeted at aging skin. It is supposed to activate skin cells to be more active, which results in better regenerative powers, to repair damaged skin and to boost skin protection, so fine lines are reduced, and skin is more healthy and radiant. It all sounds very promising. So, let’s see how it fared with me. Shiseido Future Solution LX Extra Rich Cleansing Foam – RM230 | US$60 for 125ml First off, I balked at using this product, because I do not use cleansing foam. Cleansing foam tends to be too drying and stripping to the skin, and it just too harsh for me. For the sake of experimentation, I used this. Once. That was all my skin could handle. It was rich and creamy, but like most cleansing foam, very stripping and drying to the skin. My skin felt tight and uncomfortable after rinsing. It also felt squeaky clean. While that is great for your plates and bowls, it is not a nice feeling on the skin. I never used it again. My skin is one used to gentle cream cleansers or milk cleansers. I could almost feel my skin crying out in horror that I was subjecting it to the ravages of a cleansing foam. I quickly apologised and promised I’d never subject it to that sort of torture again. Needless to say therefore, I’d tell you to skip this. While I have revised my view on cheap vs expensive cleansers, I will tell you that this one is just too harsh on the skin, and you are better off using something else. Ingredients: -Oshima Sakura Leaf Extract: Reveals a fresh, bright look. -NMT: Removes impurities and attracts moisture for a smooth feel.

Shiseido Future Solution LX Concentrated Balancing Softener – RM410 | US$105 for 170ml A softener is a product that may take a little getting used to. It is one commonly found in Japanese and Korean skincare, but I think mostly in the former. What it does is, as was explained to us during the presentation, to help open the pathways of your skin, to make it more receptive to the products that follow. Think of a softener as something akin to a hydrating toner, that you apply to your skin after cleansing, to hydrate (remember how stripping their cleansing foam was? You need to repair your skin and this is the first step) and to soften your skin, like a sponge. It makes it more receptive to receive the serums that will follow. This one pumps out as a rich lotion, that feels rather heavy. In a way, it has to be, after stripping your skin with their cleansing foam. You are recommended to use a cotton pad to apply to your skin. I thought I was being clever by using my hands, because it was so thick and I did not want to waste it. That was a mistake however. Using my hands resulted in too much product sitting on my skin and it was uncomfortable, and made me break out a little. It was too rich, especially because you are layering as you go. When I wised up after a week, I used a cotton pad to apply just a thin layer to the skin, and lo and behold! My skin felt so much better! It quite literally softened, soft, and when I applied serum on thereafter, it seemed to soak right in. When I used my hands, it sat on top of my skin. So, please follow instructions! I did however find it very fragranced, which as you will see below, eventually did not work out for me. Ingredients: -SkingenecellEnmei: Reduces the visible signs of aging. -4MSK: Gives skin a luminous look. -Uji Green Tea Extract: Provides antioxidant benefits. -Trimethylglycine: Refines skin texture and reduces the look of pores.

Shiseido Future Solution LX Intensive Firming Contour Serum – RM1,200 | US$300 for 50ml Hello! Are we still here? Did the price floor you? LOL ? This is the serum, and is targeted at those who have sagging skin and loss of elasticity in the skin. It promises to tighten your skin and lift and firm. Texturally, it was rich but comfortable. I initially thought it was heavy, but that was because I had layered it on the Softener, without using the cotton pad. When I used the Softener with a cotton pad, this serum sank right in, with a little massage. It is however rather creamy, and definitely works best for someone with drier skin. Let’s be honest, I couldn’t quite tell if it was firming my skin any more than my skin already is. As I have often explained, I do take care of my skin as best I can, and I am realistic about my age. Results for firm skin therefore are hard to gauge. But it was comfortable to use, albeit too fragranced for my liking. The packaging is lovely. I love the heavy glass bottle with its sparkly black exterior. However, the cap and pump was a little bit of a let down for something that cost this much. While it was sturdy, I’d have expected it to look a little more luxe. This one’s more for someone with deep pockets, who is already using a luxury brand serum, who might want to try a new lifting and firming serum. The regular woman will find it a little harder to splurge, especially in these rather trying times. Ingredients: -Licorice Extract and Okura Extract: Give skin a youthful, tightened look. -SkingenecellEnmei: Reduces visible signs of aging. -Rubus Leaf Extract: Improves the look of sagging. -Uji Green Tea Extract: Provides antioxidant benefits.

Shiseido Future Solution LX Total Protective Emulsion – RM1,100 | US$260 for 75ml For the day, Shiseido recommends an emulsion, as it feels lighter. To make things even easier, they’ve formulated the Total Protective Emulsion with SPF20 PA++++ sun protection. The bottle is lovely, with a heavy glass and an iridescent white exterior, to denote day use. Perhaps, if you lived in Japan, where the sun may not be as strong as it is near the Equator, you could get away with using just this, and no sunscreen. I however, top off with a separate sunscreen ( It’s by Shiseido as well, so that’s fine LOL!) The emulsion is rather creamy and will sit best on drier skin types. While I’m used to using a cream in the day time, I did find the emulsion quite hydrating enough for me. It was nice. But was it RM1,100 nice? I can’t quite say so, sorry. I found it too fragranced for me, as well. Ingredients: -SkingenecellEnmei: Reduces visible signs of aging. -Sansho Extract: Supports skin’s natural self-protective daytime defense for vibrant-looking beauty. -Hybrid Anti-Pollution Powder: Resists the effects of pollutants. -Uji Green Tea Extract: Provides antioxidant benefits. -Avobenzone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.4%, Octocrylene 2%, and Oxybenzone 1%: Provide sunscreen protection.

Shiseido Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream – RM1,200 | US$280 for 50ml Ok you know what? This cream I liked. It is a night cream, and the jar packaging is beautifully luxe as befits the brand and its price tag! The tub is a heavy glass with its deep purple-black iridescent packaging. The cream housed within is thick and creamy. It was a little runny, but still thick, and you literally only need a tiny amount each time. A spatula is included in the box, which is a beautiful origami creation. The cream sits nestled within an origami creation of the Shiseido camellia flower, and as you open, the paper unfolds, blooming and revealing the treasure within. It’s truly a treat for the senses! The cream feels silky on skin and is very comfortable if you use just a little bit, warmed up between your palms and pressed into your skin. Again, due to its thick texture, it is best enjoyed by those with drier skin. While it is very fragranced, I do enjoy using it, and it does seem to make my skin feel and look better overnight (when used on its own – not with the rest of the Future Solution line, as I’ll explain below) This is expensive, but it is the second product I found impressed me in the line, aside from the next one below which impressed me most of all. Ingredients: -SkingenecellEnmei: Visibly restores and reduces the appearance the signs of aging. -Burnet Extract: Promotes skin’s innate power at night for a beautiful look in the morning. -Hokkaido Angelica Root Extract: Reveals a youthful appearance. -Uji Green Tea Extract: Provides antioxidant benefits.

Shiseido Future Solution LX Eye and Lip Contour Regenerating Cream – RM590 | US$150 for 17ml This is my favourite product in the whole Future Solution LX line, and the one that I actually saw the best results with. The reason is this. I do not regularly use an eye cream. I am abysmal at sticking to using eye cream, which is a personal quirk. And I started noticing the effects a while back. As I age, my lids were starting to droop. I attributed it to genes. My family does have a history of droopy lids. I used an eye serum I found effective a while back, but was not diligent enough to be consistent. However, as I was trying out the products in this range, I forced myself to stick to a day and night eye cream regimen as well. You know what? I actually saw results. My lids are significantly less droopy now, which is noticeable for me, when I do my eye makeup. They are less hooded. At my age (40+) everything starts to droop, and because I don’t care enough for my eye area, I actually saw results while using this cream, and while being diligent about it. This leads me to believe therefore, that someone who is similarly not diligent with their skincare may notice a difference when using the serum in this range. The other thing I noticed was that the skin around my eyes was more firm. Again, I notice this most when I do my eye makeup. I get less drag when I apply under eye concealer, and my eye bags are a little less pronounced. Less of LV trunks, more of LV mini bags LOL! ? I am lucky to not have noticeable crows feet for my age, so that has nothing to do with this cream. But the skin was firmer and for that, I love this cream! It is very thick in the pot (It won’t spill even if you turn it over) so you only need very very little. I just run my finger over the surface, warm it up and then pat and massage it around my eyes. I’m actually starting to make a dent in the cream, which makes me feel torn. On the one hand, I don’t know if I can afford to repurchase (as much as I’d love to) and on the other hand, if I don’t use it, what’s the use of saving it? So, I’m using it, and will use it up, and I absolutely enjoy every moment of it. It does not mess with my eye makeup in case you’re wondering. It does not make my eye area oily at all. It’s absolutely wonderful! I did only just notice while writing this, that it is only a 17ml pot. That is TINY! MY GOODNESS! But you do only use very little, and I’m into Month 2 of using this, with just a tiny dent in the cream, so it can last a while yet. Ingredients: -SkingenecellEnmei: Reduces the visible signs of aging. -Houttuynia Cordata Extract: Gives skin a firm look and reduces appearance of puffiness. -Aura Radiance Power: Reduces appearance of dark circles. -Uji Green Tea Extract: Provides antioxidant benefits.

The fly in the ointment… I did run into a fly in the ointment with this range of skincare. Because I was using just this range, I noticed that my skin was becoming very sensitized over time. It was red and blotchy, and quite unusual for me. I later attributed it to the fragrance. I have talked about it in this post , and explained how it affected my skin. If I use the products individually i.e. mixed with other products, my skin does not turn blotchy. But when layered, I found the fragrance was too much for my skin. That said, to me there are 3 products I’d consider – the Intensive Firming Serum, the Regenerating Night Cream and the Eye and Lip Contour Regenerating Cream. I feel the others can be passed on. Especially the cleansing foam. Please pass on that one! ? While doing my research for this post, I also noticed that the products contain mineral oil (I did not have the ingredient list prior to this) and that does not make me happy. It makes me particularly upset because I love the eye cream and it has mineral oil in there. While I am not particularly sensitive to mineral oil, I prefer if my skincare products do not contain it (it is a known comodegenic ingredient) and it is not pleasant to see it in a product as expensive as this one (mineral oil is a cheap ingredient). The other point to note is that the products contain alcohol. That is not surprising, as most Japanese skincare does. Again, I am not particularly sensitive to alcohol in skincare, but I do try to reduce it on my skin. I often wish the Japanese brands would move with the times and formulate with better ingredients. They tend not to, being quite comfortable where they are, and for this reason, I’m often left a little more wanting, whether it be their more affordable brands or their luxury ranges. IN A NUTSHELL The Shiseido Future Solution LX range is a premium, luxury range in the Shiseido skincare stable. The range targets aging, sagging and loss of elasticity in skin. The products do tend to be quite rich in texture, so will suit drier skin types better. I do find their products highly fragranced, which when used all together, did not agree with my skin, and sensitized it. When I broke them apart and used them separately with other less fragranced products, my skin was fine. My picks from the range would be the Regenerating Night Cream and the Eye and Lip Contour Regenerating Cream . The latter is my favourite item because I saw significant results with prolonged use. They are however for those who have more luxurious tastes in skincare as the prices are high. PROS: Luxurious packaging, Nice fragrance, Comfortable on skin in thin layers, Eye cream is very effective and moisturising, Only very little product is needed with each application as they can feel heavy CONS: Expensive, Highly fragranced, For the softener you should follow instructions and use a cotton pad WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who is able to afford the prices, Anyone who has sagging and aging skin and haven’t been doing much about it PRICE: As listed above WHERE TO BUY: Shiseido counters, Sephora (USA) If the prices are off-putting, consider instead the Yutaka Treatment Facial for the occasional treat, which uses this Shiseido Future Solution LX range of products. My skin did look pretty amazing after the short 1 hour facial I was treated to, and I found out that they do it at Isetan The Gardens. So I’m going to book myself a facial to try the full 90 minutes. I think it is just under RM300 for 90 minutes. I can’t quite remember as it was a little while since I asked at the counter there. Have you come across this luxury range before? The Future Solution range isn’t new in Shiseido, but it is one that is less talked about, because it sits on such a premium price point. This is a reformulation, and I am very thankful to Shiseido for the chance to try it. I have found a wonderful eye cream that works, and that is great for my skin, and I should be glad, but my wallet isn’t! LOL ? Paris B']"

For a short few months, I couldn’t move without bumping into one person or another showing, mentioning or reviewing the Hylamide SubQ Anti-Age Serum and various other serums by Hylamide and under the Deciem umbrella brand. The first one I came across was from my Canadian friend, Tracy (who loves it), and I kept stumbling over it thereafter. So one day, when I caught a discount code floating around online, I bit the bullet to see what the fuss was about. Deciem is a brand from Canada, that houses a few different brands under its umbrella. I’d previously mentioned having tried the Fountain beauty drink , which is also a brand under Deciem. Hylamide is however, I think the more well known range. From the name, you can kind of imagine that the key ingredient will be our old friend, hyaluronic acid, which most of us know by now, address skin dryness and dehydration. The difference is that this claims to have 5 forms of hyaluronic acid compounds of different molecular weights so it targets dryness, dehydration more effectively and plumps up fine lines. In addition, it contains peptides to boost collagen production (which plumps up the skin) and a form of retinol that promises effects of retinol without irritation. It’s a very science-heavy product, with lots of ingredients that are beneficial to the skin, in one easy to use package. I’m a huge fan of anything that promises intense hydration and has anti-aging benefits so I was all over this! I also tell you if it lives up to my other Hall of Fame hydrating serum! ? Yet, for some reason, I wasn’t too blown away. I will attest to the fact that the Hylamide SubQ Anti-Age serum is very easy to use, and effective in terms of hydrating skin. The texture is like that of water, and it comes as a clear liquid in a frosted glass bottle. The box it comes in is sealed, and you have to rip it open, to open it. The bottle housed inside in a hollowed out chamber tends to shift A LOT in its travels from Canada all around the world, so be careful. To use, pick up some product with the dropper, drop a few drops in the palm of your hand (I’d suggest 3-4 drops) and then apply to the skin. The texture is very liquid and light, and the immediate feeling will be that of your skin going “Ahhh!!!” as it drinks up the serum. There is no sticky or filmy after-feel and you then follow up with your other serums or moisturiser, as you will. From most of the reviews I’d read, the common thread was that this Hylamide SubQ Anti-Age serum leaves skin feeling hydrated, plumped and over time, looking better. It does not irritate and there is no scent so I think it’s a good product. Except I’m not particularly crazy about it. The reason I feel this way, is because while this left my skin feeling hydrated (I don’t have significant lines so I can’t attest to any plumping effects) it did not give me any wow-factor. Results are apparently visible in 10 days, and when that passed without comment, I gave it another 10 and then another. I just wasn’t seeing anything that would place this in my Hall of Fame. Contrast this with my jump-out-of-the-chair-and-yell-hallelujah reaction to the REN Instant Firming Shot , from which I derived visible and tactile benefits to my skin. The other problem I face, is that this seems to break me out a little bit. Nothing drastic, but I’d get a spot or two. I noticed this most significantly, when I had switched over to the REN serum, and found that my skin was (almost) baby-smooth. Then, I came back to this one, to see how it felt by contrast, and within about 3 days, I developed 2 little spots. They go away eventually, but it always bugs me. I’m not saying this is a bad product. In fact, I think the science behind it is sound, and that on its own, it’s good at what it does. If your skin concerns are primarily that of hydration, or if you live where it’s cold and/or very dry, your skin will absolutely love this serum. The added peptides are a plus to target aging skin. I’m just a little more on the fence with this than most, that’s all ? If you’re interested, here is the ingredient list for the Hylamide SubQ Anti-Age serum. IN A NUTSHELL The Hylamide SubQ Anti-Age serum primarily targets hydration and aging skin. This lightweight liquid serum will benefit those who need intense hydration of skin, and is filled with ingredients that also boost collagen and help plump up fine lines. For those living overseas, this is fairly affordable, and it’s effective without a lot of story and crap surrounding it. I like that. Something that works because it says it does, and the science backs it up. However, I personally am not crazy about this. I’ll use it, if I have it, and I actually ended up buying another before I discovered my alternative hydrating serum, but I’m not otherwise singing its praises from the rafters. PROS: Light liquid texture absorbs quickly and easily into the skin, Hydrates skin almost instantly and keeps it hydrated, Chockfull of effective ingredients, No scent CONS: Glass bottle requires care when transporting WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants an effective serum targeting hydration concerns and anti-aging PRICE: US$49 (Hylamide website) US$38 (Target) | £30 for 30ml AVAILABILITY: Hylamide website (ships internationally for free – you may catch a discount code online sometimes), Target , Boots (UK) Hylamide SubQ Anti-Age Serum vs REN Instant Firming Beauty Shot Some of you may remember me raving over the REN Instant Firming Beauty Shot and are possibly wondering how these 2 serums compare and which I’d pick. In a sense, I find them a little similar, in that both have hydration as their key concern, and both target aging skin as well. In terms of ingredients, it appears that the Hylamide one has more anti-aging ingredients. The texture is also much lighter. The REN serum is thicker and has a rose scent that may or may not appeal. For me, in terms of efficacy, I find the REN better for my skin. It delivered visible results very quickly and actually had me sitting up and taking notice. With the Hylamide, I felt that the results did not match the hype. Price-wise, the Hylamide is a little cheaper. In the end, it’ll come down to which you prefer as both are good products. Have you tried the Hylamide SubQ Anti-Age serum and did you see dramatic results from it? I picked up a few other highly raved products from the brand so I’ll give them a go and see how I feel. The SubQ eye serum comes very highly raved too so that’s probably one to try soon! Let me know if you’ve tried anything else that I should! ? Paris B']"

I’m being proven right! We’re now in February and I’ve already showed you one from Estee Lauder which had gotten a lot of interest. Forward one month and I have for you another from Clinique and you know what? I have another waiting in the wings! Gosh, I’m a soothsayer, I am ? The Clinique Even Better Essence Lotion is yet another Asia exclusive product for now, which pretty much gels with my earlier theory that the brands are releasing these treatment lotions in Asia first because consumers in Asia are already familiar with these sort of treatment lotions thanks to the indoctrination received from multiple Asian skincare brands. Seeing it come out from the big Western brands however makes me realise just how much attention is focused on the Asian market and just how much more they are willing to cater to Asian skincare preferences, which is always a good thing. For friends in the Western world, you could find this popping up at a counter near you in time to come – hopefully! ? So, what is Clinique’s essence lotion offering like? I’ve been trialing this for a month or so thanks to a preview sample from Clinique Malaysia and these have just gone on shelves too. At an affordable price, I might add, so it’s a good time to tell you about it! ? Clinique placed their Essence Lotion under their Even Better range which targets skintone correction (the whitening range, as it were) and introduces their Even Better Essence Lotion to perform 3 skin functions:- Hydrate – Citrullus Vulgaris (Watermelon) Extract, Pyrus Malus Fruit (Apple) Extract, Lens Esculenta (Lentil) Extract, Sodium PCA (NMF complex) and Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract Brighten – Pyrus Malus (Apple) Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis (Root) Extract, and Cucumis Sativas (Cucumber) Extract Calm – Sucrose and Caffeine, Cladosiphon Okamuranus Extract and Algae Extract, Tamarindus Indica Seed Extract Interestingly also, it comes in 2 formulations – 1,2 for dry to very dry skintypes and 3,4 for combination to oily skintypes and their key ingredients are:- Skin Type 1 & 2 – Olive Squalane, Barley Extract, Wheat Germ Extract and Jojoba Esters to help keep skin hydrated and supple Skin Type 3 & 4 – Laminaria Saccharina Extract to normalize excess sebum production over time. The reason I’ve included the key ingredients above is because I don’t have the full ingredient list and this is the best I can do for now until I get it. It does specifically say that it is formulated without alcohol for those who have this concern ? As I do tend towards having dry skin, I’m using the Type 1 & 2 version which is a rather thick, opaque emulsion consistency. This isn’t watery like the Estee Lauder Micro Essence and SK-II Treatment Essence, nor does it have the liquid-gel consistency of La Mer Treatment Lotion. It is like a gel emulsion and I will tell you, will suit only those who really do have dry to very dry skin. The majority of you therefore will likely go for the one for Type 3 & 4 which has a lighter texture. You may be able to notice the slightly opaque and runny emulsion texture of the Essence Lotion that brings to mind barley water. As I have personally discovered myself, when my skin is dry and dehydrated, it looks lacklustre and dull and whatever freckles or pigmentation I have shows up more prominently. It is for this reason (and because so many whitening products dry my skin out) that I had forsaken using whitening creams and serums and focus on keeping my skin well hydrated and have been since 2011. The plus side of this shift in focus is that I ended up with better looking skin and while my pigmentation doesn’t go away, it does look less prominent and my skin looks better. When I slack off, it looks worse. Skincare is an on-going process! So this is where this Clinique Even Better Essence Lotion comes in. It serves as both an essence and a lotion to be used after cleansing and toning and before serum and moisturiser. It helps add moisture to skin, keep skin more hydrated and in the long run, also help to brighten skin. This isn’t a brightening serum however. Clinique has the Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector Serum for that (which is one of the more effective products I’ve used) so you would use this in tandem not as a replacement. I use this as recommended, by dropping a few drops on my palm and then applying to my face, and follow up with my other skincare. I did run into problems, however. You see, it’s a solid bottle and the emulsion is quite thick so it’s really really hard to get it out of the bottle without being able to squeeze the bottle. Shaking the bottle doesn’t help very much and I always risk dispensing too much product, so I have to be quite patient and allow 2-3 drops to fall into my palm on their own accord. I don’t know if the more liquid version fares better, but I believe this is a bit of a design fault that Clinique might want to look into for their Type 1 & 2 version. In terms of hydration, I will vouch for this lotion’s hydrating properties. My skin does feel nice and hydrated. Does it make my skin look even better? It’s hard to say. Remember, I’d been using the La Mer Treatment Lotion before this and then followed by the Estee Lauder Micro Essence lotion . I cannot in any good conscience or honesty show you a before/after because I don’t see any drastic improvement, just maintenance. I can tell you however, that it does make my skin feel very comfortable and it does hydrate well. Any improvement in skin radiance will I believe come at a much later date because I ran into another problem. This product contains Olive Squalene and my skin tends to react to anything with olive extract in it, which means simply I can use this but only once a day and on alternate days (which works because I use Liquid Gold every alternate day) so I use it at night on non-Liquid Gold nights and it’s fine. If I’m overzealous, I get little spots but that is quite unique to me coz of my olive extract problem – truly, I haven’t come across anyone else complaining about this since Olive extract is so well known for having lots of benefits! ? Coming in at RM125/150ml and don’t quote me, but coming from the Estee Lauder group, I’d say this is an affordable option to the other essence lotions that we’ve been seeing coming from the same group of companies. It will most certainly offer competition and the different formulation for different skin types is also an added bonus. If your skin will accept it that is ? In a nutshell The Clinique Even Better Essence Lotion is a treatment lotion to be used after cleansing and toning and before serum and moisturiser. The purpose is to help hydrate and keep skin hydrated as well as brighten and calm skin over time. It comes in 2 formulations for Dry and Oily skin types and has 2 different textures. I used the Type 1 & 2 for Dry to Very Dry skin which has an emulsion texture. It felt comfortable on skin although the inclusion of olive squalene meant I couldn’t use it too often as my skin can break out from using olive extract (I’m an odd case). My skin did feel hydrated and comfortable with this which is probably the best I can say. It is affordable and useful to have in your skincare routine to boost skin hydration, if you have been thinking of using similar products. My quibble will be with the packaging, which isn’t practical considering the texture of the product and Clinique might want to rethink that. Pros: Skin does feel hydrated after using this, Easy to use, Absorbs quickly without a sticky feeling Cons: The dispenser isn’t suitable for the thicker consistency of the Type 1 & 2 essence lotion, My sensitivity to olive extract means I cannot use this daily Who will like this: Anyone interested in these new treatment lotions and wanting an affordable alternative, Anyone who wants to add a treatment lotion or hydration treatment lotion to their skincare routine Clinique EBEL v EL Micro Essence vs La Mer Treatment Lotion vs SK-II FTE Alright, time to read minds again! ? Since this is one of the many treatment lotions that have been coming out, how do they stack up next to each other? Again, SK-II is a non-starter as it breaks me out quite badly but I put it in here because it’s the most recognisable treatment lotion out there. Pitting Clinique EBEL against Estee Lauder Micro Essence is a bit of a toughie because of the different textures. Clinique caters for different skin types, while Estee Lauder applies to all skin types. The textures are different and I believe my skin reacted differently as a result. However, due to the fact that my skin can’t handle too much of the Clinique EBEL, I’m picking the Micro Essence as my preference between the two. Clinique vs La Mer results in La Mer winning, but I also picked La Mer against EL so I’m just being consistent here ? For me: La Mer > Estee Lauder >= Clinique > SK-II If not for my olive extract sensitivity, I’d pick Clinique over Estee Lauder simply due to it’s lower pricetag for essentially a similar product (ingredients not withstanding). Whew! Thanks for reading my thesis ? Are you intrigued by the Clinique Even Better Essence Lotion then? Have you tried the other treatment lotions I’ve mentioned before this? This Clinique one just went on shelves and if you head down to the counters, you could be able to snag some samples and see if this works for you. Again, manage your expectations because we will all react to skincare differently, but do let me know how you find this should you try it! ? Oh and I believe this is available only in Asia for now. Paris B Clinique Even Better Essence Lotion comes in 2 types: Type 1 & 2 for Very Dry to Dry combination skin and Type 3 & 4 for Oily to Oily Combination skin Price: RM125/150ml Availability: All Clinique counters and the online store , Asia only until further notice']"

Guerlain truly outdid themselves this year, with one of the prettiest powders I ever did see. But despite the anticipation and social media-driven hype, I stayed away. For some reason, despite my Meteorites collecting habits, I couldn’t bring myself to drop almost RM300 on a tub. Prices sure have gone up since I started my collection. Instead, I picked up the Rouge G lipstick , which I happen to love. But as providence will have it, I was gifted with a tub of what is confusingly known as the Meteorites Flocons Enchantes or Enchanted Snowflake Meteorites or by some people, called the Perles des Neiges Meteorites. The former is what’s printed on the box. I’m not sure where some sources got the latter name from. Call it what you want, isn’t this a thing of beauty? ? I do have a bit of an axe to grind with Guerlain though. They call this the Enchanted Snowflake Meteorites, and in the press release, it says that it has snowflakes amidst the regular pearls. Yet, what they put in there were…. stars. Come on guys, aren’t those stars in there? No one in their right mind would say “Ooh, snowflakes!” Instead, everyone and their aunty are going “Ooh, such pretty stars!” Note to Guerlain – work on your presentation LOL! Since this has been done to death, let me just show you some photos and some quick thoughts I have about this. As to whether you should buy it, I think you can answer that for yourself… though I’ll offer some pointers ? First off, the US$80 and RM269 pricetag is a high one. If you managed to get this in Sephora during their 20% members sale, good on ya! It’s still pretty pricey though, so it’s not for everyone. I know we’re all feeling the pinch with the economic slowdown and rising prices, so this is 100% luxury, not a need. Balance your budgets accordingly ? It does however, come in a nice 30g tub, which is what Meteorites used to be before they were reduced to the 25g versions that you get in the permanent range . It shows, in that the tub looks fuller, instead of just a few balls rattling around the tub. Unlike previous years and in view of the limited edition packaging, Guerlain has made this a sturdy plastic tub, with a nice heft. The plastic isn’t a cheap plastic, but it is plastic. It also comes with a puff to hold the pearls in place so you don’t end up with a tub of powder, and the whole tub is fashioned after a snowglobe. The screw-off cover has a gradational translucency, to allow you to view an intricate golden design embedded into the cover, if you view it from the top. Let me show you. See how it looks like you’re viewing it through a snowglobe? I actually really liked it, and I appreciated the thought and design that went into it. Viewed from the side, you don’t really see the design. It’s only visible when viewed from the top. I loved that! But you all know I’m a Meteorites collector right? I’ve championed Guerlain’s Meteorites for so many years, they really should be paying me a commission LOL! But the long and short of it, is that I love the Meteorites, and I think it does wonders for the complexion. It’s a finishing powder, not a setting powder, so I can’t really say just how it’s supposed to look on you. All I can say is that Meteorites are the one product that pulls my makeup together, giving my skin an imperceptible glow that is unmatched by any other powder I’ve ever used. I’m a huge huge fan and can talk all day about it ? But today, it’s about the Enchanted Snowflake Meteorites, and I must say that these are a wee bit more shimmery than the regular permanent ones. The powders are a mix of champagne, white and gold pearls and stars, that is a little shimmery to the touch. In fact, I was a little put off initially. However, when I apply it to the skin, it isn’t shimmery at all. The combination of powders and pearly shimmer gives skin a bit of a boost and a glow that isn’t bang in your face. If you use a dense brush, and layer it on, you might actually be able to use it as a highlighter. But I just swirled it all over my face with a fluffy brush (you can use the Real Techniques Blush Brush , as I sometimes do) and what it does is make my makeup look just that touch more ethereal. I actually really like this! Being a true blue fan of Meteorites, I must say that I enjoyed this. They are up there with my other favourite, the Meteorites Perles de Nuit which gives skin the most AMAZING glow like nothing I’ve ever used. I find that this is a touch brighter while Perles de Nuit has a more champagne tint but they’re both impressive in quality. To buy or not to buy? It’s a question only you can answer. Get it, if the price doesn’t make you blanch, and you are a fan of the Meteorites, or want a more champagne toned Meteorites (the permanent range doesn’t have a champagne toned powder). Don’t, if you won’t use it. Makeup is best appreciated when it’s used ? IN A NUTSHELL The Guerlain Meteorites Flocons Enchantes or Enchanted Snowflake Meteorites are limited edition Meteorites powders from Guerlain that come in a limited edition packaging like that of a snow globe. The pearls are a mix of regular round pearls and stars (which are supposed to be snowflakes, but who are they kidding?) The powder swatches a little shimmery, but isn’t so when you brush it on the skin. It gives a bit of a bright, champagne glow to your skin that makes it look that much more impressive. Beautiful in the evenings under candlelight or evening lighting, but use a lighter hand for the day to avoid looking too shiny. There is the signature Guerlain scent but isn’t overpowering. One for the Meteorites collectors! PROS: Prettily designed packaging, Unique design of the powders, Lovely glowy effect of powder on skin CONS: Pricey, Limited Edition WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who missed out on Perles de Nuit, Anyone who wants a more champagne toned Meteorites powder for evening use in particular, Makeup collectors I thought you might like to see this alongside some of the Meteorites from previous years. Clockwise from Top Left: Meteorites Flocons Enchantes (2015), Meteorites Perles d’Etoiles (2014), Perles de Nuit (2011), Perles du Dragon (2012) I skipped the Crazy Paris Meteorites Perles (2013) although I picked up the rest of the collection , because I hated the packaging. And yes, I use them all ? I’m not much of a makeup collector, but Meteorites are my weakness. It’s getting hard to continue though, because the prices are going up and up, and I’m starting to balk. So hopefully Guerlain slows down on the new releases of the “bebolas” or I’d just have to call a halt! ? Did you get the Enchanted Snowflake Meteorites? Do you get what the hype of Meteorites is all about? I’ve been preaching about these balls since I started blogging, so that’s a long time LOL! I never quite understood them until I picked up my first tub (in the lurid, gaudy colourful cardboard tub of the days of yore) and then, I was drawn in, hook line and sinker! These days, these balls are my precioussssss….. ?

I make no secret of it because it’s the truth. I just am really bad about using eye serums and creams and stuff. Yeah, I still call myself a beauty blogger LOL! But at least I’m honest about it! So, while the La Mer The Lifting Eye Serum has been out since early this year, I took a while to get to it, because I was just so crap about using it. Incidentally however, it was because I was so sporadic about its use that I actually noticed something. The Lifting Eye Serum works! I know you hate me saying this especially because it’s by La Mer and therefore means it comes with a price tag that rivals the price of gold per gram ? But I did find that it did what it promised. However, before you say “Ok, that’s it. I’m going to throw a good percentage of my paycheck at this little bottle!” there are a few caveats and conditions you have to bear in mind. The primary caveat being age. So, let me be honest. If you are nowhere near your 40’s, save your money. This isn’t a preventative product. At least not to me. It just does what it says it does – lift. The reason I say that The Lifting Eye Serum works is this – it firmed and lifted my droopy lids. Perhaps I thought I was invincible and immune to aging (pish!) but due to a combination of age, laxity of skin elasticity and simple genetics (thanks Mom and Grandma!), I noticed that my eyelids were starting to droop. I’d always had typical Chinese eyes before this, small and without a lot of lid space. But in recent years as I entered my 40’s I noticed a certain heavy-liddedness about it. It isn’t terribly apparent, but noticeable to me, whenever I did my eye makeup. It didn’t bother me a lot, but that’s when I noticed that during my sporadic uses of the Lifting Eye Serum, I’d lose that heavy-lidded look, and my eyes looked a little more ‘lifted’. The La Mer The Lifting Eye Serum is a very lightweight product that comes in a dropper bottle. While it is an expensive little bottle, you only really need 1 little drop each time. What you see in the picture is just how much you need. One teeny little drop. So one bottle can and will last you over a year with regular use. It’s very viscous, so you just rub it gently between your ring fingers of both hands, and apply to your eye area. There is an eye massager tool type thing that comes with it, that you can see in the first picture up top. The metal ball bit is heavy and cool against the skin and very nice to roll around the eyes, but the plastic handle is incongruously light and feels cheap. I felt La Mer could have done better. But I’m a lazy bugger remember? So 99% of the time, I don’t use the applicator tool thingy. I just use my fingers, apply the product around my eyes and go on my merry way. It’s lightweight enough that it doesn’t mess with eye makeup in the day, although it’s really meant to be a serum. And we know all about serums – they are usually followed up by something else. So, you are really supposed to use this Lifting Eye Serum first, and then layer on your eye cream, whether it be from La Mer or another brand. Hello, I’m lazy remember? So I don’t. Just remembering to use the eye serum was achievement enough for me ? Yet, what I notice is this. When I use The Lifting Eye Serum for about a week or so straight, day and night, I notice a “lift” in my eye area. I lose that heavy lidded look (not that sexy, despite what romantic novels tell you) and I look a little more alert. But here’s the kicker – once I forget, and stop using it, it comes back after a while. So, just remember that this isn’t a surgical procedure. You will not get a lasting effect, if you aren’t hardworking and diligent, because what this product does is really, tighten your skin a little, on the surface that gives the illusion of a lift. Let’s not kid ourselves – this is a topical product. Everything topical is pretty much temporary in efficacy. Also, I’d be kind and say, don’t believe what you read online. You DO NOT get an immediate lifting effect the next time you look in the mirror. I notice improvements only after about a week at best. Maybe those who notice immediate results have REALLY saggy lids, I don’t know. But no, it’s not instantaneous. I like how it keeps my eye area feeling hydrated and comfortable, and how it gives me that little lift in the eye area. I use it on its own, because 1 eye care product is about all I can manage to be perfectly honest, and it seems fine. It’s definitely better than not using anything at all. But if you don’t have heavy, droppy lids, you will likely not see any results at all. Which is why I say, leave this till you start seeing the droop, because that’s what it’s really targeted to do – give your lids that lift. If nothing droops, there’s nothing to lift ? And that’s why I say that this isn’t a preventative product. For me, this is one of those “treatment” products – you have a problem, it treats it. La Mer says it offers to increase skin “density” over time. If that’s true, great. But I won’t hold my breath, to be honest. If you have deep pockets, sure, use it. But if you don’t see any results, it’s probably because everything’s still perky and firm. Wait till you’re in your 40’s. We’ll talk then LOL! ? IN A NUTSHELL The La Mer The Lifting Eye Serum is a very lightweight product that comes in a dropper bottle. You only need 1 little drop each time, which means one bottle goes a very long way. Like regular serums, this boasts a higher concentration of product and the famed Miracle Broth, to hydrate the eye area, as well as helping lift the skin around the eyes. I noticed that if you use it regularly, there is a noticeable lift to droppy lids. I personally have developed droopy lids, which is the only reason I noticed the effect. However, if you stop using it, the effects wear off. It’s not botox. You can layer another eye cream over, or use it on its own as I do. I’d personally say that this one is primarily for those who have a problem with droopy lids. If you don’t, skip it. You won’t notice any effects at all. PROS: Offers droopy eyelids a little lift, Hydrates the skin, Very lightweight texture, Comfortable, A very little product goes a long way CONS: Pricey, Applicator has a cheap plastic handle, Effects last so long as you’re diligent about use WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who has noticeably heavy or droopy eyelids PRICE: RM880 | US$240 for 15ml WHERE TO BUY: La Mer counters or online at Neiman Marcus , Nordstrom , Net-a-Porter For those interested, here’s the ingredient list for the Lifting Eye Serum.

Or any eye serum for that matter? I still use it, when I remember. I’m good about the rest of my face, crap about my eyes. So much for windows to my soul. Maybe I’m just hiding them windows behind droopy curtains LOL! ? But in a way, this reminds me that I can’t keep age nor genetics at bay. Want to see how you’ll age? Look at your Mom! Thankfully, Mom’s kept fairly well LOL! ? Paris B']"

Pierre Hermé, famous for his macarons, was an unlikely collaboration, I thought. Then again, Laduree has a makeup range that has nothing to do with pastries or macarons, so who am I to judge right? LOL As it turned out, I thought the combination of scents quite fascinating. Must be to do with that chef’s palate. I mean, who’d have thought to marry the bitter-citrus note of Pamplemousse (grapefruit) with the sour note of rhubarb?! Incidentally, I LOVE rhubarb, and don’t tell anyone, but after the press event, a few sticks of rhubarb went home with me in my bag and into a delicious crumble ? shhhh….. Ahem! Now, let me quickly tell you about my thoughts on the scents. It’s just a quick overview, nothing too detailed because scents are very personal things. I was gifted with the Jasmin-Immortelle-Neroli fragrance, so I will be able to tell you about that one after some wear ? There are 3 scents in the L’Occitane x Pierre Hermé range, which are then infused into the various bath and body products. Pamplemousse-Rhubarb : From memory (because I don’t have it) it has a nice burst of citrus and sourness, with a slight bitter note to keep it from smelling too fruity. I liked the idea of the scent and the combination, but on my skin, the scent dried down to something that smelled like… sweat. It wasn’t pleasant. The hand cream was much better for me because the scent was a little smoother. There is a full range of shower gel, body lotion, fragrance, and hand cream. Fragrance: RM275/75ml, Body Lotion: RM127/250ml, Body Wash: RM88/250ml Hand Cream: RM41/30ml Jasmin-Immortelle-Neroli : This one has a slightly sweet orange citrus note provided by the Neroli, that dries down to a warmer base scent of Jasmine. While I usually shy away from jasmine scents, this one sat well with me, primarily because of the Neroli and Immortelle that lifted it and prevented it from being too sweetly floral. I found it has a fizzy zing to it, that makes it a nice scent for the day. Similarly, this has a full range of shower gel, body lotion, fragrance and hand cream. Hand Cream: RM41/30ml Miel Mandarin : This range is only represented by the hand cream, which has a significant scent of mandarin oranges. It is a smooth scent without being too strongly citrus or too orangey, so it was quite pleasant to use. Like the regular L’Occitane hand creams, this was moisturising, not sticky or greasy and comfortable. I found that the scent was not too strong, which is how I like it. Fragrance: RM275/75ml As I have noted, I found the Jasmin-Immortelle-Neroli fragrance surprisingly pleasant on my skin. This, coming from someone who run as far away from Jasmine scents as possible, and isn’t a fan of sweet, floral scents. On paper, the Pamplemousse-Rhubarb would have been my choice. But in person, it was otherwise. I find that the fragrance spritzes out a little fizzy to my nose, like that of champagne, with a noticeable orange note contributed by Neroli. However, this fizzles out quite quickly and dries down to a more mellow floral note, that is lightened by the citrus scent of Neroli, so it isn’t cloying the way I find jasmine to be. For an EdT, it was fairly longlasting although I only prefer to use this in the day. Quite interestingly, I was told that the short, squat bottle of fragrance brings to mind a macaron, as does the packaging of the fragrances, as you can see above. The boxes bring to mind a macaron, with the band of colour in the middle. I thought it quite clever and keeping to theme, without being kitchsy and cute. L’Occitane x Pierre Hermé Hand Cream: RM41/30ml Personally, while I thought this an unlikely pairing, the collection turned out more palatable than I expected. If you are already a fan of L’Occitane products, then you will be familiar with their quality. As far as scents go, I’m personally for smelling it for yourself to decide which will suit you best. I never thought I’d own a perfume with jasmine in it, but for some reason, this pairing works on my skin. It’s a nice fresh scent that isn’t cloying or heavy, which is nice for our weather. Light, when it’s hot out, but slightly warmed when it’s cold and rainy. I’m a wee bit biased against the Grapefruit-Rhubarb one because it made me smell sweaty, but it smelled good on my friend. It had a nice bitter citrus top note, like that of grapefruit peel, but tempered with the tartness of rhubarb. It actually smelled a little musky once it dries down. Personally I’d pick one of the body washes or lotion or maybe hand cream in that scent ? Have you sniffed at the L’Occitane x Pierre Hermé collection? Does the food-fragrance pairing throw you off? It threw me for a loop initially, but I can see how it works. I suppose pastry chefs need a good nose as well as tastebuds! Special shoutout to @puiyeekong on Instagram who has been instrumental in making sure I got this post out when I said I would LOL! ? I hope this helps you decide ? Paris B The L’Occitane x Pierre Hermé collection is limited edition and available at all L’Occitane stores and are sold individually or in gift sets. If you don’t have a store in your city/town, you can pick them up online as well.']"

I have a new-found love for them. The reason is because I’ve incorporated misting into my daily skincare routine for a while now. I use an acid toner, and misting after that helps rehydrate my skin and helps my products absorb better. A while ago, I received a can of the Caudalie Grape Water spray, but mistook it for the Beauty Elixir (which I’m not much a fan of) so I stuck it away in my beauty cabinet for a while. One day, when I ran out of face mist, I decided to try it. It didn’t take me long to fall in love with it (and to realise that I was mistaken about it being like the famed Beauty Elixir – it’s MUCH BETTER!). I quickly picked up back up bottles while in Paris, because they were much more affordable there, but I’ve really enjoyed using this, and because it’s so under-rated, I had to share! ? Part of the reason I enjoy using this Caudalie Grape Water mist is because of the spray. It comes in an aerosol can, and the mist that comes out of the can is super fine. So fine, that it feels just like a whisper of air on your face as you mist your skin. Yet, the fine mist of water leaves enough water on skin to make it feel damp. Just how I like it, because when I layer on my serums or oils, it absorbs more quickly. You mean you don’t apply your products on damp skin? You should! Now, we aren’t strangers to mists that come in spray cans are we? I used to enjoy the Vichy ones before Vichy pulled out, and there are many more in the market. However, most of the spray mists you find in the market boast of thermal water. Caudalie, as may be expected from the brand, uses water derived from grapes. Does this feel any different on skin? To be honest, no it doesn’t. Yes, it feels very comfortable, moisturising even, but does it feel just like any other water? Yes it does. The spray does feel more fine, so my face is never sopping wet, just nicely damp. I was shown however, that if you do a PH test with the Caudalie Grape Water, it shows a result that is closer to the PH level of our skin. By contrast, a popular thermal water spray showed a more alkaline result. Does it mean the Caudalie one is better? Let me be honest – I don’t know. What I do know is this. The Caudalie Grape Water cools down my skin when it’s hot, soothes it when it’s irritated, feels amazing when I use it, and sandwiches well with my skincare. My skin seems to feel softer when I use this – again it could be nothing, or it could be everything. I took the small travel sized 75ml can with me to Paris (I know, carrying coal to Newcastle – does anyone still say these things?! ? ) and used it extensively on the plane. It doubled up as my facial rinse when I didn’t have one on board, it helped to hydrate my skin in dry airplane air (never let it air-dry after misting. Give it a few seconds and then gently blot with a piece of tissue for best results) and it refreshed me before landing. As a result, I bought bottles of it in every French pharmacie I could find LOL! If my luggage was bigger, I’d have bought more ? Do you need it? Of course not. Who needs anything ? I use this interchangeably with other facial mists. But I like how I can do a continuous spray with this (because of the aerosol action) and how the mist is so fine it doesn’t leave my face sopping wet. I like how soothing it is, and when I feel overheated, as I did on a recent visit to Bangkok, I like how it cooled and calmed my skin, so waiting for the public bus or even taking the tuk-tuk felt minutely more comfortable. Even my parents loved it after I convinced them it would make them feel better LOL! ? Will I repurchase? Why not. I have. Many! ? IN A NUTSHELL The Caudalie Grape Water spray comes in an aerosol can in 2 sizes – 200ml and 75ml. The small size is perfect for travel and I highly recommend it for when you are visiting a hot country, or on a plane. The interesting thing though, is that although it’s an aerosol can, I’ve passed airport security with this on a few flights now. I was asked to open my bag for security to take a look at the amount of content, but it was returned to me when they saw it was just 75ml. I like the very fine mist that comes out of the can, that leaves my skin feeling slightly damp but not sopping wet so you can use it even over makeup, just to refresh yourself. It is easy to control too. It has been a while since I’ve used a spray can type of facial mist so I cannot compare it with thermal water sprays. But I have enjoyed using this as it cools and soothes my skin, and allows my serums, lotions and potions to absorb better. I like it better than some other popular brands of facial sprays – I particularly dislike Evian which just feels like splashing mineral water on skin. Avene is OK but I don’t find it soothing; but I liked Vichy which we no longer get. It’s not a must have, but I have stocked up quite a few cans, so I’m good for a while! ? PROS: Soothing on hot or irritated skin, Very fine mist does not leave skin too wet, Travel sized can is handy for travel CONS: Rather pricey, Finishes quite quickly WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who enjoys using an aerosol facial mist spray PRICE: 200ml: RM70 | US$22 | €11 or 75ml: RM35 | US$11 | €5.90 WHERE TO BUY: Caudalie counters and stores, Ken’s Apothecary stores, Sephora stores and online If you’re curious as to what’s in there, here’s the ingredient list. In a nutshell, it’s just grape water in there LOL! ? If you’re wondering, no it isn’t sweet. It doesn’t taste of anything (yes I tasted it ? ) and I have wondered if the cooling effect might have anything to do with the aerosol function. But I will note that you can go through a can quite quickly. I blew through the 75ml can in just about a month with fairly regular use. So yes, it will hurt the wallet somewhat. That’s why I alternate it with other facial sprays – I’m not that frivolous LOL! ? Have you used this Grape Water spray? Do you use a facial spray or mist? You know what tickles me? That it’s called Grape Water in English and Eau de Raisin in French. Raisin in English refers to a dried grape so I just find it slightly oxymoronic to have an Eau de Raisin. Just me and my weird approach to life LOL! ? Now, tell me what spray you’re using right now? Paris B']"

( I have forgotten who, so if it’s you who sic-ed me onto this, please holler! ) If there was one product from NARS I should try, this Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer would be it! They swore up and down that it was the best they’d ever used, and that I’d love it, so I just HAD TO GET IT! Naturally, being suggestible, the next time I had the opportunity, I picked up a tube! Haha! And you guys say I’m the enabler?! ? In a world populated by BB and CC Creams, I thought it quite refreshing to find a product that calls itself an old-fashioned “tinted moisturiser” We don’t see many of them these days do we? If a base product is lighter than a usual foundation, it either gets tagged with a double alphabet, or likely be put in a cushion – that latest craze which I’ll get to at some point ? With a tinted moisturiser, you know where you stand. At least, I do! I therefore know not to expect a product with the coverage of a foundation, but one that is also more hydrating. Yet, you might like to know that this is one of my favourite quick-to-go bases for lazy days ? I got mine quite a while ago. When I first bought mine, Finland (Light 1) was the lightest shade available, which as you can see in the swatch below, has a warmer base tone. I believe they’ve since expanded the shade selection, but don’t quote me. I can’t quite keep up. I’m pretty regularly a Light 2 (Mont Blanc) in NARS foundations, where Sheer Glow is a very good match, as is my exalted Radiant Creamy Concealer in Vanilla (Light 2) . However, I noticed that my shade selection skews a little in the Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer as well as in the Velvet Matte Skin Tint. In both, I have to level down. I’ll be telling you a little more about the Velvet Matte Skin Tint soon, but if you’re wondering about shade selection, level down. To give you an idea of how Finland compares to other shades in the NARS bases that I own, as well as with other similarly textured bases, here are some swatch comparisons. You may notice how NARS Finland has the strongest yellow tones. It’s actually a fairly neutral shade, but does look more yellow compared to others I wear. As it is fairly sheer, I get away with it. I had no choice really, because at the time, that was the lightest option I had. It works, and I have no complaints. Next to the Sheer Glow in Mont Blanc (Light 2) as well as Velvet Matte Skin Tint in Terra Neuve (Light 0) , you may notice how both those shades have a more pink tint, which actually suits me better, but due to the texture, it doesn’t make too much of a difference. The Guerlain Baby Glow foundation in Light comes in significantly more pink-toned, with much higher coverage, while the Urban Decay Naked Foundation is lighter in texture. As the name of the product implies, the NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer, has a light coverage. What it does for me, is even out skin tone with a natural finish. As I have fairly normal skin that otherwise tends to slight dryness (I’ve managed to balance it out a lot with my favourite hydrating serum ), this sits well on my skin without feeling drying. It doesn’t turn oily either, although it will naturally fade off more quickly than a proper foundation would. To give you an idea of how it looks on me, here’s the usual unretouched before-after photos. You may see that what this tinted moisturiser does, is even out colouring, subtly covering up redness, so I just look a little less tired. Pigmentation and blemishes aren’t covered (coverage is fairly light), but I can address that with concealer if I really wanted. If I wanted even better coverage, I usually dust some powder over to set and add a bit of coverage. What I end up with, is a very natural base, that doesn’t look heavy or made-up. In fact, this is my default base technique these days, so I feel always feel like medium-high coverage foundations are too heavy on my skin. But it’s just a personal preference, primarily due also to the abnormally HOT weather we’re having these days. I tend to use this a lot on weekends, or light makeup days, when I can’t really be arsed to do my makeup. So I put this on, conceal, powder, draw in my brows, slap on a strong lip colour and a blush and I’m usually good to go. I like how this keeps my skin feeling comfortable, although I can’t in good conscience tell how those with oily or combination skin will fare since that’s not my skin type – if you have this skin type and have tried this, please weigh in and share your experience, k? ? So for me, I like this a lot, and to all of you enablers who have been egging me on for years to give this a go – I did it, I get it and I love it as much as you do! ? IN A NUTSHELL The NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer is a lightweight base product with fairly light coverage, that is buildable but only to a degree. The texture is fairly emollient and feels very comfortable on my skin. I use either fingers or a brush to apply and it works well either way. I wear Finland (Light 1) which at the time was the lightest shade available. The shade range now boasts 12 shades. I find that I have to level down from my usual NARS foundation shade (Light 2) for a better shade match. While coverage is light, it does a good job to even out skin tone and gives skin a healthy, natural finish that isn’t matte, nor as the name implies, too shiny. That said, I have normal-dry skin so this sits very well for my skin type, even in the hot and humid climate I live in. There is SPF30 but regulars will know how I feel about sunscreen in makeup by now – it’s not sufficient, use a separate sunscreen. This is makeup, pure and simple. Good, but still makeup. PROS: Nicely formulated creamy texture without feeling heavy on skin, Evens out skin tone well although coverage is fairly low, Not greasy or sticky, Easy to apply with fingers without being streaky, High sunscreen for lazy ones, Gives skin a healthy, radiant even toned appearance without looking oily or greasy, Works fine in hot and humid weather CONS: Shade selection can be tricky if you don’t test it out first, A little pricey WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who appreciates light coverage bases, Anyone who wants a light textured base that feels comfortable on drier skin PRICE: RM155 | US$44 | £29.50 AVAILABILITY: NARS boutiques and counters, NARS online , Sephora , Nordstrom For anyone interested, here is the ingredient list of what’s in there. Active Ingredients: Octinoxate 7.4%, Titanium Dioxide 6.1%; Inactive Ingredients: Water, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Succinate, Glycerin, Nylon-12, Cyclomethicone, Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Aluminum Hydroxide, Diphenylsiloxy Phenyl Trimethicone, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Sorbitan Sesquiisostearate, Stearic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Fragrance, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Trisodium Edta, Aluminum Distearate, Talc, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Polysilicone-2, Vibrio Alginolyticus Ferment Filtrate, Tocopherol, Alteromonas Ferment Filtrate, Sea Salt, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Bht, Algae Extract, Sodium Metabisulfite, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Potassium Sorbate; May Contain: Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides. Have you tried this tinted moisturiser and if you have, do you like it? Do you regularly wear tinted moisturisers? I’m in a sheer base phase, so tinted moisturisers suit me fine. If I want more coverage where I need it, I dab some concealer, apply some powder and it actually looks good. Natural, yet polished. Not many brands do it anymore though – now it’s all about alphabets ? If you have tried this with oily or combination skin, please share your thoughts! I’d love to know if it’s as universally appealing as NARS claims it to be ? Paris B']"

I haven’t been able to give very straight one word “I like it” or “I hate it” answers, because the truth is, it’s complicated. This isn’t the first time La Mer has had a foundation. They had a whole base makeup range a while back (their concealer and loose powder came highly recommended to me then) but in recent years, they discontinued the range, pulled back, retreated, reformulated, and they have now relaunched the Skincolor de La Mer range. The Skincolor de La Mer range consists of The Soft Fluid Long Wear Foundation, The Powder, The Concealer, The Reparative Skin Tint (which you have seen before ) and The Foundation Brush. I’d like to focus here on the Soft Fluid foundation, although I’ll give my 2 cents about The Powder as well (you don’t want to miss that! ? ). La Mer The Soft Fluid Long Wear Foundation The La Mer Soft Fluid foundation, as expected from this luxury brand, comes in a beautiful, solid frosted glass bottle. There is a lovely solid feel about it, its rounded sides moulding comfortably to the palm of your hand. The pump dispenses product well and really, in terms of packaging, I cannot fault this one bit. But the frosted glass and the name of the foundation does tell you a little bit more of what to expect from it. From experience, most foundations that come in a frosted glass tend to lend themselves to a more satin/matte texture. This gels, when you see that this is a Soft Fluid LONG WEAR foundation. “Long wear” tends to lend itself to a more matte finish as well. So, I really shouldn’t have been surprised that it does go on my skin with a satin-matte finish. The coverage is a little tricky as well. I’d peg this as a medium coverage foundation, but you can lighten the coverage by applying less for a sheerer finish, or by thinning out the formula with moisturiser or a drop of oil, as La Mer suggests. This not only gives you a lighter finish, it also offers a more moisturising formula that might feel more comfortable. You can also build this up by layering thin layers, for a fuller finish. I find that it lends itself well to layering, as the formula is fairly light and runny (unlike most long wear foundation formula that tends to be thicker in finish) so it doesn’t feel heavy or cakey on skin. What I like therefore about the Soft Fluid foundation, is the comfort and how even just a little bit of product evens out my skintone, and offers up the illusion of my having good skin, without me doing very much. Let me show you how the before-after looks (unretouched, of course) I think you’d agree that the La Mer Soft Fluid foundation offers a very nice, natural finish to the skin, with an almost satin effect. This is a fairly thin layer of product that I buffed into my skin (I do find that this foundation lends itself well to some gentle buffing – I use this foundation method , for the uninitiated) and I like how it looks. I usually top up with a little more concealer where I need it and a very very light dusting of powder to set it. But if you don’t want to set it, I do find that it has a satin finish on the skin. Here are a couple of comparison swatches of 3 different shades of the La Mer Soft Fluid foundation. There are 9 shades available to suit different depths of skin tone and whether you are warm or cool toned. There is a foundation shade finder tool at the La Mer counter that will be used to help determine your shade, so that would be helpful as well. I did find that the jump in shade from the light to the medium shade is rather drastic. I wear Porcelain, which I believe might be the second lightest shade available. It looks very light, but because of the texture, it blends itself quite seamlessly into my skin. I can’t go any higher, or it’d look too deep. To compare Porcelain with other foundation shades I regularly wear, here are some side-by-side swatches. This is one of the lightest shades I own but trust me, they all work. As I showed you the last time, that Bobbi Brown Glow Foundation , which looks strong and peachy in the swatch actually looks fine when I blend it out. BUT… and yes, there is that buzzing fly in the ointment that prevents me from gushing on about this foundation… What I’m not crazy about is the texture of the Soft Fluid foundation. I find that on my normal-dry skin, it has a tendency to sink into my skin as the day wears on, and has a slightly strange dry-but-not-dry feeling. It doesn’t feel drying for me, but it doesn’t look as good either. If you have bits of dry skin or flaky skin anywhere on your face, it will accentuate it. It will also settle a little into lines or large pores as the day wears on. I actually find that when I wear the La Mer Soft Fluid, and the day has been a hot and humid one, my base actually looks better. So, I personally feel that this foundation will lend itself better to those who have a combination skin-type, or who live where it’s hot and humid. If you live where it’s cold and dry and you have the heater going, or if you have very dry skin, I don’t personally think this is the best foundation for you. If you do like it, you can make it work. A drop of moisturiser or serum or facial oil will lighten the texture of the foundation, and allow it to sit more comfortably on drier skin. It also adds a bit of a glow to the skin, if a satin-matte texture isn’t your cup of tea. I tried it with the Renewal Oil ( which I love ) but I didn’t like how it felt. It seems to make it too glowy, and it makes it very light and slippery, to be almost like a BB cream or tinted moisturiser. That didn’t sit well with me. At La Mer’s price point for this foundation, I pretty much expect it to work right out of the bottle, without my having to tinker with it. But as I said, it does warn you by saying that it’s a Long Wear foundation, and I have to attest to the fact that it does wear well for long hours, but that is a clear message that something will have to give. At the same or similar price point, I feel that the Cle de Peau Radiant Fluid Foundation does a far better job and feels much more comfortable on those with a slightly drier skin type. It offers up a beautiful texture, glow, and photoshop finish that makes me reach for it any time I know I need to look good without trying. I can’t say the same about this La Mer one. What makes me conflicted however, is that I tend to get compliments when I wear the La Mer Soft Fluid! I don’t know why, but people I haven’t seen in a while often ask me if I’ve done something drastic with my skincare (perhaps I have, that Vitamin C thing ) but it’s always when I wear this foundation! So, do I like this? It’s complicated. I suggest you test it out for yourself. Get a sample if you can and test it out for a few days. I’m not crazy about this, but I still wear it because this girl’s vanity loves the compliments ? IN A NUTSHELL The La Mer Soft Fluid Long Wear foundation is a liquid foundation with SPF20 in a lightweight formula. It is infused with the signature Miracle Broth and while it touts to offer hydration, I personally don’t find that it sits as well on drier skin as it should. It will settle into lines or large pores as the day wears on, and may feel drying for some. I personally find that in hot and humid weather, it wears well, especially if my skin has a slight oily feel due to the weather. So, I personally think this will be more suitable for someone who has combination skin. The texture is very lightweight and comfortable, and has medium coverage which you can lighten, or layer to increase coverage. I’m not quite crazy about this foundation, but I tend to receive compliments when I wear it, which makes me very conflicted about this.

La Mer boasts of this being a weightless powder, and you know what? They were right. If you were to dip your finger into the powder, you wouldn’t even FEEL the grains of powder. You won’t even feel anything! All you feel is a slightly dense feeling of air. It’s crazy. Don’t believe me? You have to test it for yourself ? La Mer The Powder comes in a beautiful glass tub which doesn’t lend itself to travel unfortunately, and comes with a fluffy powder puff which, if I’m to be honest, serves little purpose. Use a fluffy brush. What I love about The Powder is how weightless it feels on the skin. Seriously, you can’t feel a thing on your skin and it does not look cakey at all. In fact, you can’t even see it. But when you touch your skin, after buffing on a light layer of powder, your skin feels so velvety soft! Just use a tiny little bit. I remove the puff, give the container a little shake, then use a powder brush to pick up the powder and dust it all over. Just once. No double-dipping. It gives a beautiful finish, no matter what liquid foundation you use. I had heard so much hype over this powder back in the day, but by the time I wanted to buy one, it had been discontinued. I’m so glad that La Mer brought it back, because if there’s one thing you should check out from the Skincolor de La Mer range, it’s The Powder. Sure, the Soft Fluid foundation will get all the hype, but when you look past the hype, look at that unobtrusive squat glass tub at back, with the silver cover. This one deserves every bit of hype it gets. It’s beautiful! ? Have you tested any products from this range? Did you try the previous versions? The range has been out for about a month now, at all La Mer counters and I’d love to hear your thoughts if you’ve sampled any of them. Always helpful to know how they work on different skin types, if you agree or disagree with my view ? Paris B']"

Whilst not new in the beauty industry, and once the main purview of the organic and natural skincare movement, it’s seen a renaissance in recent years, that’s had mainstream brands include an oil or two in their skincare ranges. Not a bad thing, I can assure you. All that said, I’d never quite pegged La Mer for being at the forefront of things. Sorry! They are a little traditional and stick very closely to their basics, so when I got wind of a facial oil coming out of La Mer, I was off like a shot to get the deets! I’ve been dipping my fingers (not literally!) into the La Mer The Renewal Oil for the better part of a month, since the press launch (which you can watch in a video below, if you haven’t already seen it) which has given me time to figure out what I think about it, and how it’s fared for me. The thing about me and La Mer is this – I can’t use their iconic creams. Every single one of them, from the classic Creme de la Mer to the lightest Soft Cream, breaks me out in varying degrees. So, I’ve given up on ever using them. By contrast, my sister has been a devout user for years and loves them, so go figure, really! ? That said, my skin tolerates the other products in the La Mer skincare range quite well. A personal favourite that I recommend to anyone who asks, is The Treatment Lotion , which is fairly affordable by La Mer standards. I always have a back up! Another one I quite like, albeit not slavishly devoted to, is the Illuminating Eye Gel . And since I’m such a HUGE fan of facial oils, I was hoping The Renewal Oil would work for me! Happily… or perhaps unhappily for my (and your) wallet… it does ? The La Mer Renewal Oil is La Mer’s first facial oil and what they have come up with, is less of an OIL oil, and more of a serum-0il-elixir thingy. What this means for you, is that this is a much more comfortable product to use, if you generally shy away from oils. If you look at this close up of the bottle, you will see that this is a bi-phase solution product. The oils, which are lighter, float on top of La Mer’s Miracle Broth and marine-sourced actives. It is a fairly clear yellow solution. So, what you have to do before using, is to shake it up. You then get something approximating this. Once shaken, and not stirred, you will end up with this bubbly, light yellow mixture, which you then pump out through the dropper, and into your palms. During the press launch, it was likened to a glass of bubbly champagne, and in some ways I agree – it’s like a bloody expensive Dom Perignon! LOL! ? Let me pause here for you to take a quick look at my quick vlog of the press launch, if you haven’t seen it. Let me know if you like seeing clips like this and I’ll try to make more in future interesting launches ? By making this a bi-phase formula, what La Mer has essentially done, is made this oil a much lighter product, that isn’t oily and yet absorbs easily into the skin. I know a lot of people shy away from using facial oils because of the heavy, oily texture associated with pure oils. So, if you are like that, then you will like this one. It has a thin texture that isn’t in the least bit oily, and sinks right into skin so quickly, just like a water-based serum. What I didn’t like however, is the rather strong, floral sort of scent. It isn’t unpleasant, but it brings to my mind the smell of scented soap, and while it does dissipate, it’s there and it’s fairly strong. Not many people mention that, so perhaps I’m just being sensitive. Because this is such a light oil, you can use it in a variety of ways. Drop 2-5 drops in the palm of your hands and apply to skin as a serum. Use it after cleansing and toning and before moisturiser. This is how I use it the most, but I’m very generous, and use 5-8 drops each time. This is because it’s so light that my skin seems to drink it all up. If you have oilier skin then 2 drops each time will suffice (and you stretch this further). In the day, I sometimes use about 4-5 drops but at night, it’s always at least 7-8 drops. Drop 2-3 drops into your moisturiser/cream. This is what I’d call the lazy way out ? To get the benefits of the oils without the layering hassle, drop 2-3 drops into your night moisturiser or cream, mix and apply to skin. This boosts the efficacy of most moisturisers, I find, to help soothe and protect and nourish your skin better. 2-3 drops to nourish hair. I didn’t try this because I’m an unconventional beauty blogger and have deliberately cut my hair very short ? But if you have longer hair, I’m told that you can actually apply this oil to the ends of your hair to nourish them. Caroline Hirons has a few more, more expert tips , that you can read if you’d like different ways to maximise the use of the oil. But what is it that I like about The Renewal Oil? Well, for starters, it makes for a very nice day serum, that keeps my skin plumped up all day, and comfortable in air-conditioned rooms. I have normal-dry skin so that might be why it works so well. On top of that, the superlight texture means that I have no issues with my makeup sliding around, and if anything, it seems to make my base look better. For me, after about 2 weeks of using this as my sole serum in my skincare routine (Cleansing -> acid tone -> hydrating lotion/face mist -> Good Genes (sometimes) -> La Mer Renewal oil -> Moisturiser) I noticed that my skin was noticeably calmer, more even-toned, and more hydrated. With well hydrated skin comes less visible lines and tiredness. I’ve had a very rough few months, so anything that doesn’t make that roughness and tiredness show on my skin is a boon. Also, I should note this. I turned 41 a month back, and to me you might notice better results from this oil if you are in the mid-late 30’s and up. This is when you will likely notice more significant fine lines or tiredness in your skin. Any younger, I think you can get by without, so save your money. I know for a fact I have to put in much more work to get my skin looking good in my 40’s than say, 20 years ago, but I’m also happy to say that I have much better skin now than I did 20 years ago ? However, the one thing I’m not so crazy about, is that I can’t use this oil as a mask like I would with other facial oils. It’s just too light for that. So, I sometimes layer a thin layer under a hydrating mask, to boost the efficacy, or sometimes use a little more especially in the evenings. So, despite its name, I’d treat this more like a serum because it feels that way to me. It makes my skin more hydrated, and feel and look better, my skin feels very much more comfortable in a dry environment, and it doesn’t look or feel oily or turn oily. It’s an expensive product, I will concede, but a bottle can last you a while. I’ve been using this day and night for more than a month, and what you see in the pictures is what I still have left – a lot! ? Besides, considering this is from La Mer, itself a luxury skincare brand, I think the price is par for the course ? Not for everyone, but for devotees, it’s a good addition to their routine ? IN A NUTSHELL The La Mer The Renewal Oil is a bi-phase product, that blends oils and water that contains their signature Miracle Broth and other marine derivatives. You must shake it up before using, and what you will get is a very light-textured serum/elixir that almost immediately sinks into the skin. I notice an almost immediate boost to hydration, and over a month, calmer, more even-toned skin that doesn’t look as ragged as I feel. I do take good care of my skin, so I cannot boast of any significantly noticeable improvements, but I experienced no breakouts, and I liked using this in the day to help my skin remain more hydrated and supple. Heat and drying air-conditioning can dry out skin more than necessary, and this oil prevents that for me. I also think that those in their mid-late 30’s and 40’s will appreciate this best. If you’ve never used a facial oil because you don’t like the texture, then you may prefer this one, with its very lightweight texture. While the high price is a stumbling block to many, it will last quite a while. But I’d advise taking a sniff first. The fairly strong scent may or may not appeal. PROS: Very lightweight texture absorbs quickly into the skin, Can be blended with moisturiser for better efficacy, Boosts hydration levels and keeps skin supple through the day, Skin is calmer and more even-toned and looks less tired CONS: Pricey, Strong scent can smell a little soapy, Not sufficient on its own due to the light texture WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who prefers a lightweight textured facial oil, Anyone who’s already using La Mer products Here’s the ingredient list for anyone keen to know what’s in there: meadowfoam seed oil, dimethicone, caprylic triglyceride, water, trisiloxane, sweet almond oil, jojoba seed oil, polydecene, hydrogenated polydecene, butylene glycol, propanediol, glycerin, algae extract, rapeseed seed oil, sunflower seed oil, sesame seed oil, eucalyptus leaf oil, camelina sativa seed oil, cranberry seed oil, olive fruit oil, hippophae rhamnoides oil, alfalfa seed powder, sunflower seedcake, sweet almond seed meal, sodium gluconate, copper gluconate, calcium gluconate, magnesium gluconate, zinc gluconate, tocopheryl succinate, niacin, sesame seed powder, laminaria ochroleuca extract, laminaria saccharina extract, hydrolyzed algin, sea salt, chlorella vulgaris extract, salicornia herbacea extract, st. pauls’ wort extract, laminaria digitata extract, rosemary leaf extract, magnolia officinalis bark extract, yeast extract, crithmum maritimum extract, commiphora mukul resin extract, lime peel extract, molasses extract, sucrose, acetyl hexapeptide-8, acetyl glucosamine, caffeine, tocopheryl acetate, phenyl trimethicone, sodium chloride, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, alcohol denat, fragrance, hexyl cinnamal, linalool, amyl cinnamal, geraniol, limonene, citral, benzyl benzoate, coumarin, citronellol, bht, phenoxyethanol, yellow 5 (cl 19140), yellow 6 (ci 15985),  If you’re sensitive to dimethicone or alcohol, do take note. But it is otherwise, packed with loads of oils and minerals like magnesium and zinc and niacin that is known to be good for skin. While I note alcohol is in there, I didn’t particularly notice it because the product doesn’t feel overly drying. Quite the opposite, in fact. However, it might also be why the texture is such, in that it kind of “dries” on the skin. So, do take note of that, again, if you may be sensitive. If you’re wondering how this may compare to another oil-serum I blogged about recently from A’kin , know that they’re different. A’kin is an oil. A lightweight oil, but an oil nonetheless and it feels that way. This is much lighter. A’kin, being more natural, needs a much longer period of time before you see results, that I noticed with this more quickly, and this is more hydrating to my skin. It’s not always possible to put products side by side and say that one is better than the other, because a lot of the time, they’re different. Work with whatever is within budget and either way, your skin will thank you for it ? Have you managed to take a look at the La Mer Renewal Oil or tried it? Have you started incorporating oils into your skincare routine? In many ways, facial oils have definitely turned my skin around. I’m all for using chemicals, which I do, but these oils have come at a time when my skin has been maturing and getting drier and I love them for keeping my skin supple and hydrated. When you hit my age, you’ll understand how important that is! ?

I’ve been extolling their beauty and benefits since I started blogging, and since before they were a “thing”, and the Météorites Perles a.k.a Guerlain Balls, are the only makeup I actively collect. I mean, I use them, but I also collect them – the newer incarnations anyway. Building on the popularity of their famed Météorites, that give skin a lovely, imperceptible and magical glow, Guerlain introduced this new foundation some time last year – the Guerlain Météorites Baby Glow Light Revealing Sheer Makeup Antifatigue Effect Baby Glow Foundation SPF25 PA++ – whew, what a mouthful! I’ll just call it the Meteorites Baby Glow foundation. I didn’t buy it when it first launched last year. For some reason, the reviews that came out back then weren’t very favourable. Many people complained of it being too sheer for a foundation, and many panned it as a result. However, some time towards the end of 2015, I decided to give it a go. For some reason, it was one of those things I just HAD to try, despite the bad press. I’m a self-proclaimed fan of most Guerlain foundations, and I even call their BB Beauty Booster a firm favourite, placing it on a pedestal, because I love it so much. I figured that if I enjoy their base products so much, I should give this a chance. The question of course, is whether I regret giving it a go? Perish the thought! I’m in freaking love with this Meteorites Baby Glow foundation! ? The critics are right. The Météorites Baby Glow foundation is fairly sheer, for a foundation. If this had swapped labels with the BB Beauty Booster, which is more foundation than BB cream, I think it would be more accurately labelled. However, what the Météorites Baby Glow foundation purports to do, as they have clearly pointed out, is to give skin a glow and lift tired complexions with just a sheer tint of colour. It’s all there on the tube, folks! And if I’m to be fair, I do not think this very sheer at all. I’ve come across worse. The product comes in a tube, with a pump, and is rather small in size, but houses a respectable 30ml of product, just like most foundation sizes. I kind of like this, because it makes the product very portable, and you can easily tuck this into your travel pouch, or daily makeup kit without it weighing you down, or without fear of it breaking and spilling. It only comes in 3 shades – 02 Clair/Light, 03 Medium, 04 Dore – which is rather limited, but because of the sheer texture, it may work with in-between skintones. However, as with most Guerlain colour bases, this Baby Glow foundation tends to a slightly more pink tone. While it might be this pink tint that helps to give tired skin a lift (most pink toned bases do) it might also mean that it may turn out looking ashy on warmer skintones. It’s a bit of a gamble, and I know that’s a common problem with all Guerlain foundations, not just this one. This is a comparison of the Baby Glow foundation to other foundations I also use, in the shades that suit my skintone. You may notice how the 2 Guerlain bases are more significantly pink compared to other popular foundations. You may also notice from the swatch, that the Baby Glow isn’t all THAT sheer as I’d been led to believe before. I’d consider this a foundation with light to medium coverage, which you can build up where you need. For me, I use just 1 pump of product each time, which I then spread out using this fool-proof foundation method , and I like blending out with a foundation brush. Then, I use the brush to pick up remaining product and dab it over areas where I need it most, to even out skintone and cover redness. You may be able to tell from the before-after collage below, just how well (or not) it works for me. With just the Baby Glow foundation, you may notice how most redness and uneven skintone is evened out. Skin almost immediately looks more radiant, with a glow that I can only attribute to the magic of Météorites , and I already look less tired! I usually apply base on my under-eye area as well, and you can see how my complexion is lifted. When I want to look a little more polished, I dab on some concealer where I need it (under-eye, pigmentation on cheeks), blend it out and then apply some powder to set, which results in picture #3. Once I set it, I’m good for practically the whole day, and it doesn’t dry out my skin either. If I don’t, it will slide off eventually. That’s fine by me. That said, I do not have oily skin so I don’t know how it fares for those who do. However, I have worn this for most of the day, then had a 40 minute session on the treadmill, and then cleaned house. It faded, naturally, but still looked pretty decent, so I was quite impressed. (No, I do not regularly wear makeup to the gym nor to do housework ? ) For me, someone who prefers a light-medium coverage product, this is wonderful. I can use as much or as little as I like, and sometimes, I apply Meteorites powder all over, which then makes me look pretty flawless. I didn’t expect to like this as much as I have, but I do! ? IN A NUTSHELL The Guerlain Météorites Baby Glow foundation is a light textured liquid foundation with a light-medium coverage on skin. It only comes in 3 shades – 02 Light, 03 Medium and 04 Dore. I find that the product is light on skin and easily blends. However, some may find that coverage isn’t up to par. For me, I like that it evens out skintone and redness very nicely, while leaving skin looking imperceptibly and impressively glowy, while lifting the complexion. They aren’t kidding about it having an anti-fatigue effect. It does! Once I set it with powder, I’m usually good for most of the day. You can also up the glow factor, by apply Meteorites powder all over, which I sometimes do as well. For me, I love this one. The downside would be the sheerness and the tint, which leans more pink the way all Guerlain bases do, and the price. Otherwise, it’s a beautiful foundation. PROS: Lightweight texture, Easy to blend, Gives skin a flattering glow and lifts tired complexions, Can be built up by dabbing on with a foundation brush or sponge CONS: Pricey, Shade may not suit warmer skintones, Some may find it too sheer WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes light-medium coverage foundation, Anyone who has a more pink toned skintone PRICE: RM190+ (I forget – if you know, please let me know!)| US$54 | £35.50 AVAILABILITY: Guerlain counters, Sephora stores and online , Nordstrom For anyone interested, here is the ingredient list for the Baby Glow foundation. I will note that there is also that signature scent that Guerlain infuses all their makeup with, which some say is the scent of violets, and I could personally do without. But it doesn’t bug me very much, so I’ll live! ? Did you try the Guerlain Baby Glow foundation? Do you like light/sheer foundations like this one? I’m glad I took a chance on this, despite the mixed reviews out there. Personally I think it’s a good one. Light enough not to be a mask, yet does everything a foundation should – lift the complexion, give skin a glow, even out skintone, and make you feel (and look) human enough to face the rest of the world ? Now, who doesn’t want that eh? ? Paris B']"

Back before NARS was available here in Malaysia (you lucky young ‘uns!) I stayed away from trying their base products. It was too risky trying to pick a foundation based solely on online swatches. So, the very first time I tried a NARS foundation, was during a trip to Thailand, where I picked up a bottle of Sheer Matte foundation (which I believe has been discontinued in favour of the All Day Luminous Weightless Foundation, one I have not tried and have no desire to due to its unsuitability with my skin type) What a mistake that was! The day I found out it was discontinued, I danced a jig. Although the shade in Mont Blanc was just right for me, the texture was such a failure, I gave up on all their foundations thereafter, in a fit of pique. However, some of you were persistent. You told me to please, for the love of God and all that’s flawless, PLEASE try the Sheer Glow, which will WOW me. Are you sure? I asked. YES! You will LOVE IT! I was assured. So, after dithering over it for a couple of years (I take my time to make up my mind, evidently ? ) I took the chance on the NARS Sheer Glow foundation , which I wear in Mont Blanc (Light 2) . The big question of course, is whether I am wowed, or am I about to slap this one silly and swear off all NARS foundations for good? Happily (or unhappily, for anyone looking into their tired wallets) this one is a winner in my books ? Only in formula though. The packaging is a bloody disaster. What you see in my pictures here, is a bottle of NARS Sheer Glow foundation, with a pump dispenser. The original bottle does not come with a pump, but merely a screw on cap. If you look at my pictures of the Sheer Matte foundation here , this is the exact packaging you get. You get a wide open mouthed bottle, with a screw on square cap, that eventually fails to align with the rest of the bottle, the more you use it. I’m not OCD and even that bugged me. The wide mouth is also a recipe for disaster. All this points to just one thing – NARS just wants you to pay another RM20 (US$6 / £3) for the pump that you now see in my pictures. I think it’s too bloody sneaky of the brand to make us spend that extra money, and if they really want to improve, just change the packaging and stick the pump on at the factory. This is also because, if you put the pump on, the original cap no longer fits, and if you store the bottle on its side, you will end up with an unholy mess in your foundation drawer. Yes, I speak from experience. It pissed me off. The pump itself can be swivelled left or right, to lock the pump if you’re carrying it around. But be sure not to leave it on its side. I thought I’d tightened it as best I could, but apparently, it’s not enough. If you want the foundation on your face and not in your drawer, or makeup bag, don’t tip it over. Grouchiness aside, I love the formula of the Sheer Glow foundation. The primary reason I do, is because it isn’t very sheer at all. I don’t quite get why NARS calls this “sheer”, because I feel it to be more of a medium coverage base, that you can layer on where you need, if you want more coverage. You won’t get full coverage, but I’d put it at 70% coverage. That’s pretty decent, considering that the formula is lovely and lightweight in texture. EDIT: As Kim & Hanny have kindly pointed out in the comments below, it’s the glow that’s sheer, not the formula – gels pretty much with my view. Thanks, girls! ? As for the “glow” bit, I won’t say that it glows per se, but it does make your skin look nice in a natural way. Not shiny, not greasy or oily, the way some “glowy” products make you look, but just natural and healthy and radiant. It’s very flattering, and doesn’t get oily or slippery as the day progresses. Here is a swatch of Sheer Glow Mont Blanc , alongside other foundations I wear, for you to gauge the shade. Mont Blanc , is one of the lightest shades (lightest is Siberia) and is a fairly neutral shade, with slight pink tones. This is the shade that flatters my skintone the best. You might notice from the swatch, that the texture is thicker than the Urban Decay Naked foundation, and also more pink when compared to the UD Naked and Chanel Perfection Lumiere Velvet in B10 . However, it isn’t as pink when compared to the MUFE HD Foundation or the Guerlain Parure Lumiere in 01 Beige Pale. In terms of coverage, Sheer Glow offers more coverage than UD Naked foundation, comparable to the Chanel Perfection Lumiere Velvet and is a little less than the Guerlain Parure Lumiere and MUFE HD Foundation. In that sense, the Sheer Glow foundation falls somewhere in the middle of the foundations I like wearing. It’s light and can be sheered out, yet it offers good coverage on its own, so I don’t even have to wear concealer, if I just layer it on the areas I need it most. Here’s how it looks when I wear it. The lighting is a little off, so I do apologise. It does not colour correct my skin THAT drastically, which you will realise when you look at my neck LOL! ? But shade aside, I think you can see just how well it evens out the skintone in general, and covers up redness and minor blemishes. This is just with 1 pump of foundation, spread evenly and blended all over, using my 5 line foundation method , and a flat top foundation brush. I dab on some extra where I need more coverage and if I really want to go all out, I dab on some concealer, and set everything with a light dusting of powder. It is otherwise, a very compact foundation, that looks lovely on skin, giving you decent coverage and a lovely radiant glow to the skin. There is a wide selection of shades, which will mean that you should find your shade quite easily. The formula is lovely, but the packaging … oh the packaging! How I hate thee! ? IN A NUTSHELL The NARS Sheer Glow foundation is a lightweight medium coverage liquid foundation that you can sheer out if you like, or layer on for slightly more coverage. It isn’t too heavy, and gives skin a natural but more radiant appearance, without looking glittery or shimmery or shiny or oily or greasy. It is fairly flattering, and if you set it with a little powder, it can last all day even in our tropical heat. The product itself is a very good one, spoilt only by the poorly designed packaging. The original bottle comes in a wide-mouthed bottle and cap which makes using this a mess. A foundation pump is sold separately which I think is ridiculous, yet absolutely necessary. That pisses me off an otherwise well-made product. PROS: Lightweight texture, Does not turn oily, Does not look shiny, glittery or shimmery or oily on skin, Medium coverage can be built up, Does not mask the skin, Makes skin look naturally radiant, Wide selection of shades CONS: Pricey, Packaging is a disaster, Pump is sold separately and is liable to leak if stored on its side WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes medium coverage foundation with a radiant and glowy appearance PRICE: RM165 | US$45 for 30ml (Pump is sold separately: RM20 | US$6) AVAILABILITY: NARS boutiques and counters, Sephora , Nordstrom , Beauty.com For anyone interested, here is the ingredient list for Sheer Glow foundation. Have you tried the Sheer Glow foundation and are you a fan? Do you hate the packaging as much as I do? I honestly don’t get why NARS can’t just upgrade the packaging to that of a pump. It works with the formula, it’s practical and it makes us, the consumer happy because we no longer have to buy a separate pump, nor do we have to spill half the bottle each time we want to use it. It appears they have taken note, because their new foundation bottle sports a pump. Now, please upgrade Sheer Glow, please. Do you feel the same way I do? ? Paris B']"

I started out using the Alpha-H Liquid Gold which I still use today, but I also read about how using a gentle exfoliating toner daily helps our skin cells turn over more quickly which generally means, better looking skin. So I went on my quest to find these “exfoliating toners” and it so happened that it was about this time that Hada Labo made available their Mild Peeling Lotion. I spotted it at a Guardian pharmacy going at a promotional discount and picked it up to see how my skin would fare with it. It is called a Mild Peeling Lotion but essentially what this is, is a chemical exfoliating lotion. A very gentle one, but do note that it comes with its attendant precautions. Hada Labo places this under the Tamagohada range which those of you familiar with Hada Labo will remember, consists of the popular AHA/BHA cleanser . I don’t deny the cleanser is a good one – friends love it! But I personally find it drying if used daily and it played merry hell with my sensitive hands. This lotion is its complementary product and it is at this point that I should pause for a moment to address the questions if this is a “toner” ? Short answer – yes. If your understanding of “toner” is that product that you use after cleansing and before your serums and moisturisers. In which case I know what you’re thinking “I don’t use toner. It’s a waste of money. Why do I need it?” In which case, read the long answer ? Long answer – not quite a toner. What this Mild Peeling Lotion is, is a gentle chemical exfoliating lotion. You use it after cleansing and before anything else and it serves the purpose of gently loosening and removing the top layer of dead cells on our skin, which helps skin turn around more quickly, and improve on dullness. The active ingredient is Gluconic Acid which is a naturally occuring acid in fruits, honey and wine. I don’t know enough of the science behind this since I’m not chemically trained so I’ll just tell you how I found this product. The product is a clear liquid, much like water that comes in a handy flip top bottle. All you do is saturate a cotton pad and run it over your face, after you have cleansed and you can use this twice a day. Used twice a day, I find it too drying for my combination-dry skin. I have spoken to people who have oily skin and they report good results which is why as with all skincare, mileage varies. What I do therefore, is use this only in the evenings on my non-Liquid Gold days. If I don’t use Liquid Gold, then I use this once a day on alternate days which suits my skin. I don’t find that it leaves my skin tight after using nor uncomfortable and when I’m diligent with it, I do reap results as my skin does look better and clearer and feels smoother. Hada Labo does recommend that you follow up with their Super Hyaluronic Acid lotion which I don’t use right now, but I do follow up with a hydrating toner or hydrating floral water . It drenches my skin with moisture and serves as a nice medium for the rest of my serums to go on. We do know after all that it’s optimum to apply skincare on damp skin for better absorption right? ? Is it all too much? No, but it is a lot and some people will just find it too tedious . Can you just apply this and follow on with serum and moisturiser? Yes you can. Can you just apply this and nothing else? If you feel comfortable, I don’t see why not although I wouldn’t do it too regularly. Can you use this daily? Yes you can, but listen to your skin. If it feels tight, cut back to once a day, or on alternate days. If you have oily skin then maybe you can use it daily but start with just once a day and build it up from there. Dry skins can use this too but it makes it more comfortable to follow up with a hydrating lotion or spray. Is this even necessary? Well, I can say that since I’ve started using an exfoliating toner (I am now using one from REN) I do notice benefits to my skin. It helps unclog pores, brighten and smoothen skin and help products absorb better. So yes, I find this necessary because I now subscribe to this school of thought. Naturally, opinions will differ so you’ll have to make up your own mind ? In a nutshell The Hada Labo Mild Peeling Lotion is a gentle exfoliating toner that you use after cleansing and before serum and moisturiser. It serves to gently exfoliate the top layer of your dead skin cells and promote brighter skin. I don’t find this drying on its own, but when I use this twice a day everyday, I find it too drying for my combination-dry skin. I use this once a day, or once every alternate day and it feels comfortable and to me, helps my skin look better. Whether you take to this depends on how you feel about using a product like a “toner”. I can’t say everyone will take to it but I like how there is an affordable option for anyone wanting to try the concept of an exfoliating toner Pros: Affordable, Not drying (unless you have very dry skin then you may experience dryness), Easy to use, Effective to make skin look and feel better and smoother with prolonged use Cons: Dry skins will feel that it is too drying if used too often Who will like this: Anyone who wants to try an exfoliating lotion at an affordable price Here is the ingredient list for the Mild Peeling Lotion. Remember. As this product helps exfoliate skin ALWAYS USE A SUNSCREEN in the day time. But then you already do right? RIGHT?! ? Have you tried this lotion and if you have, do you like it? Do you use an exfoliating lotion or toner? I’ve been using this off and on for something like 5 months or so now, and a bottle can last quite a while. I personally find it takes a while to see results but I like it and especially more so when I combine it with hydrating lotions and serums. Makes my skin feel and look plumped up and smooth! ?

I’m sort of that way with the La Mer Reparative Skintint SPF30 , which is La Mer’s version of a tinted moisturiser-sunscreen thingy. In fact, if you read La Mer’s description of this product, they don’t really talk about the “tint” of colour, calling it instead, a “healthy wash of colour” which I’ve learned, is marketing speak for “very sheer colour”. So, when you have that in mind, you’d be less inclined to be disappointed when you find out that the product doesn’t offer a lot of coverage. So why bother wearing a tinted product, if you aren’t going to get any coverage on skin? Well, speaking personally, I do, a little more often than I realise. It will depend on what you really need the product to do. Are you concerned about reducing the appearance of redness and uneven skintone on your skin? Or would you prefer something that will cover up imperfections as well? For the former, I find that soft tints or washes of colour do a pretty decent job. For the latter, go with a proper foundation. It also comes with being comfortable with your skin and realising that there are other ways you can actually wear a makeup base, without a) looking like you’re wearing makeup and b) without having too much product on the skin. I”ll actually show you below how I do this ? But coming back to the La Mer Reparative Skintint , I’d consider this a tinted moisturiser with sunscreen. The reason I say so is because the texture of the product is fairly thick and creamy so I’d hesitate to suggest this to someone who has combination-oily skin. You might find it uncomfortable or that it turns oily. On drier skin, like mine, it does help make your skin feel a bit more comfortable as the day wears on. Now, some of you weren’t sold on my theory about makeup base being good for your skin in polluted environments (nothing against you of course! ? ) but part of the reason I realised it was because I realised that when I wear this particular product, my skin seems to feel softer at the end of the day when I remove it. Texture-wise, it is fairly thick, and if I’ve one major complaint, it’s to do with the shades. For some reason, the shades of the Reparative Skintint are abysmal and orange. I honestly have no idea where La Mer are getting the idea that people are orange, but there’s that. The shades tend to be warm and orange and honestly speaking, I don’t find them flattering. The shade I use is Very Fair , which is what you see in the picture. It is light, with a slight pinkish tone. In fact, I think this shade will be worn by most people who have fair to medium skintones, because the next step up – Light – is orange. It is, I swear! I tried it and was quite horrified at how warm it was. If you have very deep skintones, the odds are that you’d only be using Medium. A magazine editor I know does, so that’s how I know it’ll work. The leap in shade from Very Fair to Light is a huge chasm. Very Fair blends out fairly transparent, as you can see in the picture above. Light will impart a warm, transparent shade of colour. I think that if you’re the sort who wants a “healthy glow” then Light might work, but I’d still caution you about looking orange. That said, despite the sheerness of colour, I do find myself quite happy with this product because for some reason, it seems to even out redness and skintone pretty impressively and makes skin look better than it really is. I treat this as I would a makeup base, so I apply it after skincare and sunscreen. While I can use my fingers to apply this, I find that this sometimes results in my using more product than I like, so I usually use a brush. This is more so because I find that when I use fingers to apply, the product doesn’t spread out very smoothly on my skin. The texture, as I’ve warned you above, is a little thick so using fingers to spread it isn’t quite the way to go for me, personally speaking. A brush seems to even it out better, and is actually quicker. Let me show you how it looks in this little collage, and what I mean when I said right at the top, that it works for me by giving me a good base, without my having to wear more makeup than necessary. The photos are unretouched, so on left is my bare skin. In the middle, I’ve applied a thin layer of the La Mer Reparative Skintint in Very Fair. You may notice how it has evened out the redness and uneven tone somewhat, especially around the shadows of the eyes and nose. You may also notice how the pigmentation I have isn’t really concealed, because it is very sheer. Yet, the skin looks better already doesn’t it? In the picture on right, what I’ve done is dabbed some concealer ( Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer ) on my under eye area and on my cheekbones where my pigmentation clusters are. And that’s it! On another day, I might even apply a light dusting of loose powder, and what this does is give me a very light, very natural base that doesn’t look like I have any makeup on. Magical! LOL ? Will you like this? I don’t know really. I’d love to tell you to try it, but this being a premium brand, it is quite pricey. This is more so, if you can’t actually test it, because the shade selection is very poor. However, if you have drier skin and do find a shade that suits you, and aren’t too put off by the price, and don’t really want to wear a lot of makeup, yet want to just have your skin look a bit better than it already does, I think it’s worth taking a look. IN A NUTSHELL The La Mer Reparative Skintint is a fairly creamy textured moisturiser with SPF30 PA+++. I’d wear this as makeup i.e. after skincare and sunscreen and not in place of either. However, I do find that this Skintint does make my skin feel softer and hydrated at the end of the day after I remove it, which is very comfortable. The tint is very sheer and there are only 5 shades, which tend to be deeper and more orange than usual, so I’d suggest stepping down a shade, if you’re buying sight unseen. I like how it evens out skintone very nicely, and leaves skin looking better, although the tint is so sheer. It is very comfortable for me, but there is a light scent. While I won’t categorise this as a favourite, I find myself reaching for it more often than I expect. Which I suppose says something about it. PROS: Keeps skin feeling hydrated, Sheer tint of colour evens out skintone and redness while keeping skin very transparent, Expensive CONS: Poor shade selection, Thick texture may not suit those with oilier skins, Very sheer tint of colour does not cover imperfections on skin WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who has drier skin as the texture is fairly creamy and thick, Anyone who can find a shade match as the shade selection is fairly poor I managed to unearth the ingredient list for The Reparative Skintint SPF30 PA+++ so here it is: Water, Butylene Glycol, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-4, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Algae (Seaweed) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Seed Powder, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seedcake, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Meal, Eucalyptus Globulus (Eucalyltus) Leaf Oil, Sodium Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Calcium Gluconate, Magnesium Gluconate, Zinc Gluconate, Tocopheryl Succinate, Niacin, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Powder, Polyethylene, Helichrysym Arenarium (Everlasting) Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Magnolia Officinalis Bark Extract, PEG-100 Stearate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Morus Nigra (Mulberry) Root Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Lysate Extract, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint), Pelargonium Graveolens (Geranium) Flower Oil, Lamirania Saccharina Extract, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Methyldihydrojasmonate, Segisbeckia Orientalis (St. Paul’s Wort) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Sucrose, Glycerin, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Caffeine, Propylene Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Lecithin, Isohexadecane, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Whey Protein, Dimethoxytolyl, Propylresorcinol, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Peel Extract, Acetyl Glucosamine, PVP/Hexadecane Copolymer, Tourmaline, Yeast Polysaccharides, Caprylyl Glycol, Rosa Damescena (Rose) Flower Oil, Yeast Extract, Isostearic Acid, Propylene Glycol Dicaprate, Stearic Acid, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Tromethamine, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Galactoarabinan, Nylon-12, Zeolite, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Tocopheryl Linoleate/Oleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Boron Nitrade, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Silica, Aluminium Hydroxide, Alcohol Denat, Tin Oxide, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Linolool, Geraniol, Citronellol, Limonene, Phyoxyethanol [+- titanium dioxide (CI77891) Iron Oxides (CI77492) Iron Oxides (CI77491) Iron Oxides (CI77499) Mica] Have you tried this La Mer Skintint? Do you use lightly tinted base products at all? I know that many people tend to slam sheer base products because of the lack of coverage. Yet, sometimes, they do have their uses, for those who’d rather not wear a foundation with more coverage. Quite often, foundations, no matter how light, tend to have more coverage than tinted products. So, curious minds want to know if you wear them? ?

If ye be part of me crew for long enough, ye’ll know that I’m no fan of lip glosses. Nasty, sticky, goopy things! But bless yer landlubber hearts, I’ve found one that I am happy to brandish around like my cutlass right here. Careful, don’t want to poke your eye out! The gloss in question is one that has been around a while, but one which I’ve only now grown to enjoy tremendously. So much, it’s found permanent residence in my daily bag! It’s the Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss and the shade I have is Pirate , which explains the slight descent into insanity up there! LOL! ? Now I might be late to the party, but I’m sure there are those among you who already use this and love or hate it so it’ll be interesting to hear your thoughts! The Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss is a pigmented lip gloss that wears like a lipstick because the coverage is stunning. To me, it feels pretty much just like a liquid lipstick, except that it’s got lovely lacquered gloss and shine to it. Not flat or matte. Those are the Allure Inks that I’ll tell you about another day. This is the lovely, more vibrant counterpoint that I prefer. I must say that part of my enchantment with the product lies with the packaging. The Chanel Rouge Allure Extrait de Gloss comes in a sleek long tube, as you see in the picture above. There is no discernible way to get the product out of the tube is there? At least, no conventional way! But if you’re familiar with the Rouge Allure line of lipsticks, you’d know what to expect. Depress the gold bit at the top, and the wand pops up! You then pull the wand out of the tube. Naturally, this can have its pitfalls. If you aren’t careful, you could risk popping it open while it’s inside your bag. However, the formula is fairly thick, and thus far, I haven’t experienced any mishaps *touchwood*! The shade I have is 19 Pirate , which as you guessed it, is a red. But this is a beautiful red that isn’t too bright and is one that I am quite convinced that most people of any skin tone will be able to pull off. You get a sponge-tipped applicator, which picks up quite a good amount of product, and which applies it evenly to your lips. The tip is a little tapered, so you can even out the edge of your lips. Always a bit of a tricky thing with bright lipsticks! But what I really like about this lipgloss, is really the texture. It is thick and very pigmented, yet it does not feel heavy when you wear it on lips. Although it’s a lip gloss, it wears more like a lipstick, that has a lovely shine and yet isn’t goopy. The best part is that, unlike many lipglosses that have the lifespan of a mayfly on lips, the colour just sticks and stays on and on and on! I often wear this one as my lipstick for the simple reason because it performs like one. I don’t have to worry about eating or drinking, because even if I do (and it will smear your coffee cup) the colour remains on my lips, so I don’t actually need to touch up until I wipe everything off and start again. I’m not sure if it’s to do with the shade Pirate, which is a beautiful, rich shade of red. This is just one swipe of the Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss in Pirate straight from the tube. I think you can appreciate how pigmented the colour is, and how the texture looks a little thick. Rest assured, it isn’t goopy. Goop is the reason I don’t wear many lipglosses. And here’s how it looks when I wear it. It’s an easy colour that I can wear for any occasion. The shade of red isn’t so bright to contrast too much against my skintone, as there is some depth to the colour that grounds it. This is a shade that I’m quite convinced will look as amazing on light skintones as it will on deeper skintones. The texture too isn’t so glossy that will make it look frivolous in a formal setting. It just imparts the right amount of shine to give lips dimension and attention. I feel it’s important as the texture is so pigmented as to be full coverage on your lips. Here’s the other thing I like – it’s not drying. While I wouldn’t call these Chanel Rouge Allure Glosses moisturising, they do not dry out my lips at all while I’m wearing it, and if anything, it keeps them plumped up. My only real grouse would be with the price (But it’s Chanel – it’s to be expected) but everything else gets the thumbs up for me! IN A NUTSHELL The Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss is an intense coloured, full coverage, pigmented lip gloss that applies like a lipstick. The texture is a little thick, but it spreads easily on lips and does not dry out the lips at all. The intensity of colour is stunning, as is the shine which imparts a gloss to the lips without making it look goopy or garish. This wears like a lipstick and feels very comfortable on. Oh, and the packaging can’t be beat! I love them! PROS: Sleek packaging, Very pigmented lip colour, Not goopy nor sticky for a lip gloss, Easy to apply, Gives a nice shine to lips without making it look too glossy, Long lasting, Not drying CONS: Nothing other than it being a little pricey WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes pigmented lip colours, Anyone who does not like goopy lipglosses PRICE: RM115 | US$37 WHERE TO BUY: Chanel counters and beauty boutiques, Chanel website , Bergdorf Goodman , Neiman Marcus Have you tried the Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss? Do you still wear gloss? I haven’t worn lip gloss in a while, until I came across this one I found in my drawer. I think I bought it quite a while ago. Oops! LOL! Do I want more? Hell yeah! Should I? Well, if I’m to be logical no LOL! ? But tell me what colour you have anyway ? Paris B']"

These are usually products, like serums, that perform a specific function – to give your skin that boost it needs, based on what you need. Bobbi Brown launched 6 of these targeted solutions, depending on what your skin needs. I know it feels like we were just talking about Bobbi Brown yesterday , but that was a bit of an impromptu post haha! The Bobbi Brown Remedies come in 6 versions, to target 6 different skin problems you may face. They are:- Skin Clarifier No. 75 – to target pores and blemishes, to balance oil and to unclog and clarify pores Skin Reviver No. 91 – for dull, tired skin, to energize skin and protect from environmental aggressors Skin Moisture Solution No. 86 – for dry, parched skin to help increase skin moisture factor Skin Fortifier No. 93 – for loss of elasticity, to help repair skin barrier Skin Relief No. 80 – for redness and irritated skin, to calm and quiet your irritated skin Skin Salve No. 57 – for chapped and cracked skin, to protect and provide a barrier to help skin heal A few months ago, I was sent a limited edition Bobbi Brown Remedies Recovery Rescue Kit mini set with 3 little samples, so I could have a go at them, to see what I thought. These mini sets are available for sale for a limited time in stores, so ask if they still have them, if you’re interested. As for me, here’s what I thought, after I’m almost finished with these – figured I better get going, before I had nothing left to photograph! LOL! ? If you’re wondering how these work, think of these serums as boosters. If you have a problem, these serums will help address your problem. However, I ran into a little problem when I was first using them. You see, I had no problem! LOL! In the Remedies Recovery Rescue Kit was mini versions of the Skin Salve No. 57, Skin Relief No. 80 and Skin Reviver No. 91. I used them on their own, as a serum as follows:- Cleansing -> Acid Toner -> Lotion/Hydrating Toner -> Bobbi Brown Remedies -> Moisturiser The directions do call for them to be used on clean skin, after cleansing. But because I use an acid toner, I didn’t feel that it made sense to use after that, as it would mean I’d effectively be wiping it off. So, I use it after. Don’t follow what I do, if it doesn’t make sense to you, or if you feel following the directions is more important ? For me initially, I used it a few times, but wasn’t sure what I should see. I had no redness to calm, and my skin wasn’t feeling or looking tired. I was rather stumped, I cannot deny. However, I was quite happy (initially) with the Skin alve No 57 balm, because it is a thick balm, that really effectively soothed some flaky, chapped skin on my nose. I thought it was quite decent at this. But I also thought it felt like I was applying petroleum jelly on my skin. It was thick and feels a little like wax going on. Hunting down the ingredient list online, I was a little disappointed. Here it is. Ingredients for Skin Salve No 57 : Petrolatum, Beeswax/Cera Alba/ Cire d’Abeille, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Caprylic/Capric/Myristic/Stearic Triglyceride, Parfum, Daucus Carota Satica (Carrot) Root Extract, Centella Asiatica (Hydrocotyl) Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Choleterol, Ceramide NG, Tocopheryl Acetate, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Octyldodecanol, Linoleic Acid, Lecithin, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Simethicone, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Chromium Oxide Greens (CI 77288), Iron Oxides (CI 77492, CI 77492, CI 77499) The first item on the list is Petrolatum, which is basically petroleum jelly. The second is Beeswax. It explains the texture, but I’m afraid to say, it lowered this product in my estimation, because it is expensive. Although it can last a long time, so can Petroleum Jelly. I’d be more willing to get behind this, if it was made of better quality base ingredients. As for the other 2 items, Skin Relief No. 80 is for calming redness, and Skin Reviver No. 91 was to revive tired skin. I wasn’t sure how they were reacting. It was not until my skin ran into trouble, that I could give them a try! I had spent a day out in the sun one day, quite unwittingly, and it left my skin feeling rather irritated for the next few days. In those few days, I have to say that the Skin Relief No. 80 seemed to help reduce the redness I saw on my skin. It made it feel more comfortable. Ingredients for Skin Relief No 80 – Calming Algae Complex : Water, Algae Extract, Butylene Glycol, Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Asparagopsis Armata Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Lactoperoxidase, Glucose Oxidase, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sorbitol, Caprylyl Glycol, Glucose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol As for the Skin Reviver No. 91, I put it to the test when I had to go for a short trip. Having to wake early in the morning for a flight, rushing around, putting your best face on for work, and then collapsing into bed after a long day, is not really my idea of fun. I brought the Skin Reviver along with me for a boost to REALLY tired skin that night, and what d’ya know, my skin actually LOOKED more rested the next day. I still felt tired, but at least I LOOKED better. Ingredients for Skin Reviver No 91 – Power Greens Ferment : Water, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Algae Extract, Brassica Oleracea Gemmifera (Brussels Sprouts) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Acephala (Kale) Leaf Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Bluberry) Fruit Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Echinacea Purpurea (Coneflower) Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Chlorella Vulgaris Extract, Glycerin, Caesalpina Spinosa Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Yeast Extract/Faex/Extrait de Levure, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylbisiminomethylguaiacol Manganese Chloride, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol My conclusion therefore, is that the Bobbi Brown Remedies booster serums work best if you have a problem that needs addressing. If you don’t have that problem, then it won’t do anything for you, and you may feel like you’re not seeing any results. Your skin probably doesn’t need it, that’s why! I can imagine that the Skin Clarifier (for oily, clogged and blemish prone skin) and Skin Moisture Solution (for dry, dehydrated skin) will probably be the most practical for everyday use, as most of us will have one or the other of these problems. The others are, I feel more targeted and more temporary problems, which may not need a solution in a bottle as large as they one they currently sell. So, to be honest, I have mixed feelings about this – it’s good, but only if you have the problem you want solved. IN A NUTSHELL Try these, if you have a problem that the Bobbi Brown Remedies booster serums can help with. These are serums that are very targeted for a specific purpose and it is best that you work out your problem, before identifying which serum you need. I find that they work only if you have a problem that specific serum addresses. Otherwise, you won’t notice much of a difference. The Skin Salve No. 57 I have mixed feelings about due to its ingredients. PROS: Works if you have a specific problem that the serums target CONS: Pricey, No visible results if you don’t have the problem the specific serum addresses, the ingredients in the Salve aren’t commensurate with the price WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone with a specific problem targeted by any of the serums in the Remedies range PRICE: RM178 | US$45 for 14ml WHERE TO BUY: Bobbi Brown counters and stores, Bobbi Brown online , Nordstrom , Selfridges , Adore Beauty Do these Bobbi Brown Remedies serums interest you? Have you tested them? I’m curious to know if you have tried them and have a view on them. I have mixed feelings as you can probably tell LOL! ? Paris B']"

When I found the sunscreen of my dreams , I stuck with it. I keep backups because I’m afraid of running out, and I’m very happy with it. But because I like exploring different products, I jumped at the chance to try some new sunscreen in the market, especially one that claims to be kind to corals and marine life. Quite often, the one time that people will be more diligent about using sunscreen will be when they head to the beach for some Vitamin Sea, and this brand claims that their sunscreen will not endanger marine life . Algotherm is a French brand of skincare that isn’t widely available, from what I can tell. I’ve stumbled across one or two of their products over the years, and while I’d been interested to try more, the lack of access daunts me. Locally, they are sold through selected salons and personally, I’m not one to hunt down a salon just to try or buy a product. Besides, I’m put off because often, you’re given the hardsell treatment. Yet, when I was given the opportunity to try the Algotherm Algosun Age Protect Sun Cream and Sun Lotion (without having to traipse off to a salon – whew!), I must say that I was pretty impressed. The Algotherm Algosun range claims to be mineral sunscreen, using titanium dioxide and zinc oxide as their UV blockers, and they are broad-spectrum sunscreens protecting against UVA and UVB rays. In addition to protecting the skin from sun damage, which makes skin age more quickly, the formula is supposed to be friendly to marine life so it isn’t toxic when you wear this and go into the sea. There are 2 formula available – Sun Cream SPF50+ and Sun Lotion SPF30. Algotherm Algosun Age Protect Sun Cream SPF50+ – RM190.80/ 50ml I picked this one to try first, as based on my personal preference, I wear SPF50 all the time, rain or shine. No matter what anyone says, I don’t believe that SPF30 is sufficient when you’re dealing with our sort of scorching sun. As it says it is a Sun Cream I expected the texture to be fairly creamy and thick, and it is. I haven’t used a cream based sunscreen for a while so it took some getting used to. The first impression I had was that it was a little too thick, but after a while, I got used to it. If you have drier skin or are in cold, dry weather, or are by the beach and don’t care that your skin may look greasy then I think this is the better option. For everyday, in our tropical heat, it can feel a little too much and cause makeup to slide. If you have oily skin, this is NOT for you. The other thing I noticed was how the Sun Cream has a bit of tint to it. It goes on skin and leaves a bit of a whitish cast on the skin. This, I attribute to the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. In many ways, this is a typical texture of a mineral sunscreen – thick and leaves a bit of a cast on skin. I did not find it drying, which was a boon, and it did not break me out. In terms of protection, how can we really tell? ? I don’t turn too red in the sun, but it will then start to shine, so it can cause a bit of havoc if you’re wearing the wrong makeup for the day. Because it’s thick, people might end up using less product that they should to avoid the thick texture and cast, and that might then diminish the efficacy. While I’ll use it, and sometimes, quite like it (it makes a very nice emollient base for more drying foundation) I don’t see myself putting it on any pedestal. I’d revert to my usual sunscreen in a heartbeat simply because the texture agrees better with me. Algotherm Algosun Age Protect Sun Cream (left) Sun Lotion (right) Algotherm Algosun Age Protect Sun Lotion SPF30 – RM233.20 / 100ml The Sun Lotion is a lighter textured version of the Sun Cream with a lower SPF30. It isn’t terribly light though. It still feels quite creamy but it feels much lighter on the skin as compared to the Sun Cream so it is more pleasing to use and will therefore be the one that appeals to most people. You must shake it up first, before squirting into your palm, but it doesn’t quite feel like the usual runny texture of Japanese sunscreen. This feels more emollient and doesn’t have a dry-touch finish. If you compare it to Japanese brand sunscreens, you’d run screaming in the opposite direction because this feels like cake batter next to Japanese sunscreen! My only problem is with the SPF30 which I feel is insufficient for me (opinions vary and this is mine). If however, you feel that SPF30 is good enough, then this one is decent because it’s easy to use not only on face, but on body as well. You can see how the texture is more runny, although it too leaves a bit of a white cast on the skin which again isn’t very surprising in a mineral sunscreen. Because of the texture, I use it on my body for the day, since I have it. IN A NUTSHELL The Algotherm Algosun Age Protect Sun Cream SPF50+ and Sun Lotion SPF30 are both mineral sunscreens with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide as their UV blockers, although no mention is made of their percentage. The Sun Cream has a thicker texture, while the Sun Lotion has a lighter texture, but both leave a bit of a white cast on skin and do not dry down to a powder finish, so shine is quite prevalent. This should not bother you if you’re by the sea, but in a tropical climate where it’s hot all the time, it can cause havoc with your makeup. I experienced no breakouts, and while I thought they were both decent enough products, I wasn’t too smitten. The lack of availability options bug me as well. PROS: Not drying, Mineral sunscreen broad-spectrum formula, Different formula suitable for different skin types, High SPF, Easy to use CONS: Hard to find, Slight white cast on skin, Can make skin look oily, Slight fragrance, Pricey WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a marine friendly sunscreen formula, Anyone who prefers using mineral sunscreen PRICE: Sun Cream RM190.80/50ml Sun Lotion RM233.20/100ml AVAILABILITY: Selected Algotherm salons (Find out from their facebook page ) For those interested, here are the ingredient lists for both the Algosun Sun Cream and Sun Lotion. Have you tried this sunscreen or any other products from Algotherm? I used a facial wash once that I quite liked but for some reason I just didn’t feel sufficiently driven to blog about it, due primarily to the price and availability. Salon brands tend to be expensive and elusive and that does bug me because sometimes, they are pretty good stuff! Now, about Algotherm – what have you tried? ? Paris B']"

You can read all about the range and what’s available in the previous post, and in this one, I’m going to tell you about the star product, the Perfect Renew Regenerator serum . The reason I’ll focus on the serum, is because for me, if you want something that really does make a difference, and which is the most potent product, it is likely to be found in a serum. The rest of the products are mostly complementary, and you can even mix and match to cater to other elements of your skin needs, and budget. But you know what? Brands probably don’t like me saying so, even if it’s true! LOL! ? The new Laneige Perfect Renew Regenerator serum is a lightweight serum that promises to deliver the key ingredients to renew, reenergize and regenerate your skin. What you are supposed to get at the end of it is smoother, firmer and younger looking skin, because any fine lines are plumped up and made to look smoother. Laneige also says that this effect is caused by the firming up of the “baby triangles”, which essentially are formed by firm skin. The looser these triangles get, the less elasticity we have in our skin. So, this serum serves to address this. I’ve been at this for over a month, and I’m sure you want to know just how well it’s worked (or not) for me eh? ? Well, to be honest, it’s hard for me to say how well it’s worked. As it turns out, this Perfect Renew range is targeted at the 20-30 somethings, who are experiencing the first signs of aging. While this serum serves to also help skin feel more hydrated, I couldn’t use this on its own. I needed a further boost of hydrating serum or lotions, or even oils to help my dry skin feel more comfortable. If your skin is oily or combination, then you will likely find that it’s sufficient. The product comes in a dropper bottle, and I use about 1 pump each time. I was told that 2-3 drops might be sufficient, but it wasn’t for me, so your mileage may vary. The texture is very lightweight, and it sinks in quickly into the skin leaving it feeling soft almost immediately. But like all Laneige products, there is a scent which isn’t as strong as other products I’ve used, but strong enough to be noticeable. Laneige does say that the scent is supposed to be calming and uplifting to the senses, but not being a fan of floral scents, I’m not keen on it. I much prefer my skincare products to smell of nothing, or to have a more natural scent to it. According to Laneige, this Regenerator Serum is an oil essence, in that they have blended oil, atomized under pressure into tiny little droplets, so it doesn’t feel like an oil, yet acts like one. While I can attest to my skin feeling comfortable with this, with no breakouts, I can’t vouch for much else because I have cared for my skin all this time, so fine lines are there, but kept at bay, and there’s no way it can look any better than it already is – I’m in my 40’s and I accept that there’s no way I can look 25 again, or like Song Hye Kyo – face of this new Perfect Renew range ? Because the texture is so light, the order of use for this Regenerator serum is to use if after the Skin Refiner (or any other hydrating lotion you maybe using) and before the Emulsion (or any moisturiser). Because it’s not hydrating enough on its own, after 2 weeks, I added a hydrating serum into the mix and my skin felt better. So, I think this makes for a beginner type serum, if you want to look for an anti-aging serum that’s fairly affordable, or if you’ve never really cared for your skin before this, and want something to bring it up to a manageable level, before going on to more potent serums and creams. It addresses fine lines, re-energizes your skin and hydrates. But if you have drier skin or more matured skin, or if you have been taking care of your skin all this time, then you may not appreciate this very much. IN A NUTSHELL The Laneige Perfect Renew Renegerator is an oil essence serum, which is very lightweight and sinks quickly into the skin without feeling oily or heavy. I didn’t notice a lot of difference while using this, which might be attributable to the fact that I already care for my skin so this essentially has acted as a maintenance serum, rather than a repair serum for me. Those who want something to start with, or to boost their skin’s suppleness may appreciate this better as it’s fairly affordable. I do find that it isn’t hydrating enough for anyone with dry or more matured skin, so you will have to layer on other hydrating products to help it feel more comfortable. PROS: Lightweight texture, Absorbs into skin quickly without feeling greasy, Comfortable to use CONS: Strong scent, Not hydrating enough for dry skin WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a fairly affordable anti-aging serum and has not used an anti-aging regimen before this, Anyone who is starting to see the first signs of aging PRICE: RM225/40ml AVAILABILITY: Laneige counters and eventually, worldwide While this promises to rejuvenate your skin, I personally feel that when you’re someone like me, who places a great emphasis on skincare and therefore dabbles in a lot of stronger, more potent products, the effects are very marginal for me. But if you’re starting to see the bloom of youth begin to fade, or have never felt the need to add a serum into your routine (WHY?!) then you might experience the promised benefits ? Have you tried this serum? Do you already incorporate serums into your skincare routine? This has just been made available since January 2016 so I expect it’s still fairly new. But some of you may have already tried it or tested it at a counter, and if you have, I’d love to hear what you think! ? Paris B']"

When I first got wind of the brand new Clinique Moisture Surge Hydrating Supercharged Concentrate, I zeroed it straight on it, like a bloodhound on a trail. One of the early products that worked for me from Clinique, was its older sibling, the Clinique Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief gel cream , which I found worked so well for me to give me bouncy, hydrated skin. Perfect for when my skin was oilier, to add hydration without being heavy. I haven’t used it for a while now, as it’s too light for my skin type now. But I’ve found something else that fits the bill in the Clinique Moisture Surge Hydrating Supercharged Concentrate ! ? First off, packaging. I love the airless pump bottle, and the way that the base of the bottle will move up as you use it, ensuring that you get every last drop out of the bottle – because you will want to! The transparent bottle and the peach gel within also serves to tell you how much product is left. The texture is a very lightweight gel that almost feels like water going on the skin. Yet, it does more than just water, for it seems to almost infuse skin with a burst of hydration, and keep skin hydrated all day long. I use it in the day, as my hydration serum, after my toner and before moisturiser. But you know what surprised me? When I did a little more digging, I found out that this is not technically a serum, but a moisturiser. If you have oily skin that needs hydration (you usually do) or if you have oily skin but dislike the feel of most moisturisers, even gel ones, then you may like this one for a hydrating moisturiser. It is very light and sinks easily into the skin. There is no greasy or sticky feeling at all, and it just feels very comfortable. It will help you feel more comfortable about putting moisturiser on your skin, to keep it hydrated, because a common problem that plagues people with oily skin is dehydration. And you don’t want that because that’s where your first signs of aging happens – fine lines is often caused by dehydration first. However, if you have normal-dry skin as I do, then the Clinique Moisture Surge Supercharged Concentrate will be too light for a moisturiser, but settles in quite nicely as a hydration serum. Because it is so light, it sandwiches well between my daytime products and helps keep my skin feeling hydrated for most of the day. It is hot and humid here, and especially in summer when you don’t want to slather a lot of products on your skin, then I’d use this, to lock moisture in the skin and leave it feeling plumped and bouncy. I find it therefore a very versatile moisturiser that serves its purpose, as it promises, to hydrate skin and keep it hydrated for hours. I use just one pump, smoothed over my skin. For me, that’s sufficient. I should think that it’ll be sufficient for most people. I should point out however, that this is a fairly basic hydrating moisturiser formula. It does exactly what it promises on the bottle i.e. to supercharge your skin with hydration and keep it hydrated for hours. So, if hydration is your concern, then this fits the bill exactly. However, if you’d prefer a product that has a little more e.g anti-aging ingredients, then this should not be the sole product you rely on. While the gel contains Vitamin C and E, and some antioxidants to fight free radicals, its primary function is to hydrate skin and replenish lost moisture in skin. For this reason therefore, I say I use it primarily as a daytime hydration serum, sometimes layered over a Vitamin C serum. In the evenings, I go for something more robust and more emollient or oilier. Another thing I was told was that I could even use this around the eye area, which I then proceeded to do. Yes, you can. It isn’t heavy and it’s great for someone like me, who is really quite lax about using eye creams. At least now I know I’m doing something to help the delicate skin around my eyes ? However, no review of mine would be complete without finding that irritating fly in the ointment, would it? And for the Clinique Moisture Surge Hydrating Supercharged Concentrate, I should make mention of the fact that I detect a metallic scent whenever I use it. It has no fragrance, which is a plus. But there is a hint of a metallic scent that dissipates, but which I noticed and I felt I should mention. Otherwise though, I have to say that I am pretty impressed by this new offering from Clinique! IN A NUTSHELL The Clinique Moisture Surge Hydrating Supercharged Concentrate is a versatile moisturiser that does double duty as a hydrating moisturiser for those with normal-oily skins or as a hydrating serum for someone who has normal-dry skin. I use it as a serum, under a moisturiser, in the day. The gel formula is very lightweight and sinks nicely into skin without leaving it feeling tacky. Importantly, it keeps my skin hydrated and plumped all day. The packaging is easy to use and portable, and hygienic. Generally, a well thought out product. PROS: Fairly affordable, Lightweight gel formula absorbs quickly into skin without leaving a greasy or oily residue, Hydrates skin and keeps skin feeling hydrated for hours, Can be used as moisturiser or as a hydration serum depending on skin type, Airless pump bottle packaging is hygienic and practical to get out most of the product, Easy to see how much product is left, Portable CONS: Slight metallic scent that dissipates WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants an effective hydration product whether as moisturiser or as a serum PRICE: RM150 | US$39 for 48ml WHERE TO BUY: Clinique counters, Clinique stores (and online ) and Sephora stores For anyone interested, here is the ingredient list for the Clinique Moisture Surge Hydrating Supercharged Concentrate. Have you tried this new Clinique product? Are you a fan of the original Moisture Surge gel cream? The original Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief was one of the first Clinique products that worked for me. I’d use it as a moisturiser and even as a sleeping mask. But it’s been years since I went there. It’s a classic though, so I’m sure you’d have tried it at some point or another! ? Paris B']"

When I find one that works, I stick with i come hell or high water. For richer or poorer… my HG sunscreen will eventually send me to the poorhouse I swear LOL! But due to mounting requests, I embarked on a mission to find an alternate, more affordable sunscreen that I might like. I do have a preference for Asian brand sunscreens, for the simple reason that they work, and for some reason, the formula feels more elegant than most Western brands. One of my favourites, before it was discontinued was the Hada Labo UV Whitening Emulsion sunscreen . So, when I went looking for a budget sunscreen option, one of my first stops was Hada Labo and I picked up the Hada Labo Koi-Gokujyun Perfect UV Gel SPF50+ PA++++ Long story short, I was pleasantly surprised to quite like this ? One of the things I liked was the texture – it is a pleasantly creamy texture that my drier skin likes. The creamy texture however, belies the name – Perfect UV Gel. This is no gel at all! The cream spreads easily on my skin and absorbs quickly, so it just feels very comfortable when worn. Another thing I like is how it seems to add moisture to my skin so it feels cushiony… is that even a word? ? I think it might be because of the hyaluronic acid in this product, which Hada Labo is known to be popular for. I was a little worried at first that the creamy texture might mean that it would turn oily over time, but to my surprise, it didn’t. In fact, it makes a nice base for my makeup as well, albeit a more moisturising base than I’m used to when using the Shiseido. I do wonder if it’s because my skin is a little drier, so it absorbs better and boosts the moisture, while protecting my skin. And yes, it does seem to protect my skin. From what I can tell anyway. When I wear this, my skin doesn’t seem to heat up and turn red when I’m exposed to heat. Whatever dark spots I have don’t seem to be getting worse, so I think it’s good LOL! However, I am given to understand that this Perfect UV Gel isn’t waterproof, so I wouldn’t wear it swimming or if I’m going to be sweating a lot. I don’t think you should too ? The other thing that should be mentioned is that there is alcohol in this product. I’m not terribly fussed nor sensitive to alcohol in skincare, so this is not something that troubles me. As for the scent, I perceive a slight scent, but not what people comment on as being an “alcohol scent”. Still, it’s probably one of those things. If this bugs you, then stay away. If it doesn’t, then take a chance on it. It’s a pretty decent, wallet-friendly sunscreen to have! ? IN A NUTSHELL The Hada Labo Koi-Gokujyun Perfect UV Gel sunscreen is a creamy textured sunscreen with high SPF and broad-spectrum protection that protects against UVA and UVB rays. I do like the texture, which I find comfortable to wear. Although it’s creamy, it doesn’t feel heavy nor oily on my skin and makes a nice base for my foundations. I don’t particularly notice it messing with any of my foundations, and because it seems more creamy than other sunscreens I’ve tried, it allows me to wear slightly more drying bases without too much trouble. The drawbacks would be the alcohol content and the fact that it isn’t waterproof. But otherwise, I like this! PROS: Lightweight creamy texture feels very comfortable on skin, Not drying, Affordable, Protects my skin from burning even under the sun, A good hydrating base for foundation CONS: Not waterproof, Contains alcohol which may not sit well with some people WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a creamy textured sunscreen that isn’t drying on the skin, Anyone who wants a more budget-friendly sunscreen for daily wear PRICE: RM52.90 (goes on sale often) AVAILABILITY: Most major pharmacies in Malaysia where Hada Labo is sold, Overseas try ebay For those interested, here is the ingredient list for the Hada Labo Perfect UV Gel sunscreen. From what I understand of the ingredients (I do have a fairly limited understanding) this is a hybrid formula, in that it has both chemical blockers and physical blockers, so I cannot strictly say that this is a chemical or physical sunscreen. It has a little of both. I’m fine with a chemical formula so again, I’m happy with this. Have you tried the Hada Labo Perfect UV Gel? Do you like how it feels? As I said, I was pleasantly surprised to like it. My skin didn’t burn nor feel heated although I had been exposed to the sun, and my foundation didn’t oil up and slip. For that, I give this sunscreen props. I also like how the texture doesn’t have that weird silicone/powdery feel that you get in some formulas. So on an overall basis, this is a wallet-friendly win for me! ? Care to weigh in? Paris B']"

They have also improved on and expanded their skincare range, with affordable, effective skincare so many now associate them with skincare. But what some of you may not have realised, is that Pixi was quite popular for their makeup before this. This was quite a few years back, when the brand was still rather small and unknown in the beauty world. Sometimes, it just takes one superstar hit to bring a brand onto the radar of beauty junkies. I thought I’d share one of my favourites from the brand – the Pixi Endless Silky Eye Pen . Mine bears the older packaging that has a lovely whimsical vibe with the outline flowers adorning the pale green body of the pencil. The new packaging is less romantic, but more streamlined, with the body of the pencil depicting the colour of the liner, for this is what it is – a pencil eyeliner. To be honest, I much prefer the older, more whimsical vibe given off by Pixi. Their packaging used to have little fairies on the cover and in its designs, that I found cute. Granted, I then didn’t take them as seriously, but it stood out. I have to tell you though, that I love these Endless Silky eyeliners! ? I bought two back in the day from the Pixi website, just to have a go at them, as I’d read that quite a lot of people loved them. I actually understand why, because these eyeliners are lovely and creamy and very easy to apply without tugging the skin. The one I use the most is BlackNoir , which is a deep, dark matte black. The other colour I own, EmeraldGold is I believe, discontinued as it is no longer displayed on their website. There are however, many other colours available. But here’s why I like these eyeliners. I primarily use eyeliners to tightline my eyes, which I do often. I was using an eyeliner from Guerlain, which is now discontinued, and when mine got too short to sharpen, I had to find something else. Few made the cut. I’m quite fussy about my eyeliners, because I like them a certain way. I like my eyeliners to be creamy and a deep dark black. They must not transfer too much (I accept that there is always a chance of colour transfer with all eyeliners) and they must be longlasting. These Pixi Endless Silky eyeliners fit my requirements. The creamy gel-like texture allows it to glide on easily, and it applies very easily to my waterline as well, without too much transfer. Often, pencil liners are hard to get on the waterline, as they can irritate or be diluted and go on more sheer. This one doesn’t. It goes on black, and importantly, stays black for hours. It sometimes smudges a little, but nothing that I can’t handle or that bothers me too much. You can see from the swatches just how deep and dark Black is. It almost feels like a gel liner, and once I let it set, it’s pretty immovable, which is great. Some smudging is to be expected, as the eyelid area can be oilier than your hand, but again, nothing I can’t handle. EmeraldGold is an emerald green shade with gold shimmer. I don’t use this as often, but it makes for a pretty pop of colour for days when I don’t want to wear eye colours. I use coloured eyeliners on my lids, not to tightline. I’ve been in a bit of a rut with eyeshadow recently, so colour eyeliner gives me that touch of colour I want , without my having to fuss around with blending and stuff ? Lazy girl’s guide to eye makeup ? This doesn’t smudge on me. I don’t have a problem sharpening this (no sharpener is included) but I do realise that you can’t get a sharp point on it as it does feel a little soft (I’m not sure if it’s because of our heat). It doesn’t matter to me, as I use it to tightline, but if you prefer sharp, precise lines for your lids, then you may prefer something else. I’m not fussed so I’m happy with these! IN A NUTSHELL The Pixi Endless Silky Eye Pen is a pencil eyeliner with a creamy gel-like texture that glides on skin like a dream. It is quite budge-proof when set, and does not smudge very much on me. That said, I do not have very oily lids and I use this primarily to tightline, instead of as a liner. As a liner, it can sometimes smudge a little more than I like, if I don’t allow it to set. However, it acts as a good base to apply eyeshadow to for smokier eye looks. I think the quality is very good and it’s absolutely worth a try. PROS: Creamy gel texture pencil applies very smoothly and easily to lids without tugging the skin, Once set it is budge-proof, Long lasting, Strong colour pigment CONS: No sharpener included, Can be a little soft in hot weather, May smudge especially on those with oily lids WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a strongly pigmented, creamy eyeliner that applies smoothly PRICE: £12 | RM84 WHERE TO BUY: Pixi website (ships internationally), Cult Beauty (Ships internationally and UK tax is deducted if shipped outside the EU), Sephora MY Have you tried these Pixi eyeliners or any other Pixi makeup? A friend gifted me with a large palette set once, but I regifted it to someone else because I had too much makeup. The person I gave it to loved it though and was very happy with it. I also have an eye palette I bought a while ago. It’s nice in a very basic sort of way, but I hear their blushes are quite pretty. Have you tried any Pixi makeup? ? Paris B']"

They can evoke different responses in different people (hence my policy to never “review” a fragrance – how will I know if you’d like it?!) but they can also work differently on different people. One such fragrance for me, is this Caudalie Rose de Vigne Eau Fraiche fragrance, which I’ve been sitting on since I received it last year. Oops! My bad! The primary reason was because, as easy on the nose as this fresh rose scent is (and as affordable it is on the pocket) I’m not crazy about wearing rose-scented perfumes. They tend to make my head feel heavy, instead of light, and I often feel overwhelmed – like I’m standing in the middle of a blooming field of roses. Not a bad thing, but heady. But that was until I figured out how I liked best to use this perfume! ? Didn’t know that Caudalie made perfumes? They do! I was surprised the first time I found out too. There is a whole selection of fresh scents, and Rose de Vigne is a new addition. To me though, this fragrance doesn’t smell as much of roses as it does of berries. I liken it to the scent of crushed berries, warmed by the sun, with a crisp floral note overlying the scent. It smells fresh, and yet unlike many fresh scents, it lasts. It isn’t a bad scent, if you want something easy on the nose. Importantly also, for those who might be tempted to venture into the grey area of copycat perfumes or *gasp* fakes, or even those who might lament the dearth of affordable perfumes that don’t smell like toilet fresheners, the scents by Caudalie are very affordable. As I said however, I’m not crazy about wearing this scent because it just isn’t very me. What I do like however, is to use this as a room scent. I know, it’s terribly decadent, but I like how this smells in a room. It smells fresh and clean and a little comforting. What I do is lightly saturate a blotter with the scent, and then leave it somewhere in my room. What this does is lightly fragrance the room with the soft smell of roses and berries and gives it a lovely refreshing feel. If they made a candle out of this, I might even buy it too! ? You can actually do this with your favourite scents too. It’s decadent, but sometimes, you know, a little bit of decadence never hurt anyone! ? Have you tried the Rose de Vigne fragrance or any other fragrance from Caudalie? I remember my surprise the first time I found out Caudalie made fragrances. I think it was Fleur de Vigne that I liked when I took a sniff at the counter. At the fairly affordable prices, I’m grateful to not get toilet freshener! LOL! ?

Me, that’s who! LOL We’re in Fall/Winter mode in the cosmetics world, and here we have, a product released by NARS as part of their Spring 2015 collection. But what the hey, it’s a permanent product, so you can still buy it if you like. Besides, friends in the Southern hemisphere are just coming on Spring… so I’m still on trend… somewhere in the world! LOL! The Nars Dual Intensity Blush is a blush counterpart to the dual intensity formula of eyeshadows they released to high acclaim some time last year. I’d never used any of them. Thought about getting the eyeshadow palette for a while but eventually passed. Each blush comes in a set of 2 shades that allows you to blend as you like. But what makes this formula somewhat unique, is that Nars made it so it can be used wet or dry, and you get two different intensities of pigment and colour this way. Hence the name. But to use a blush wet? Gosh…. I can’t imagine it, can you? While I understand the concept of using eyeshadow wet for stronger intensity of colour, I couldn’t get my head around using a blush wet. When I asked a Nars makeup artist how that would work, she explained it thus:- Dampen your blush brush by spritzing some water on it. Brush the damp (not wet please!) brush over the product. Apply to skin and blend out Depending on the colour you pick, and how much product you pick up, the effect will either be a) more intense colour payoff or b) a more transparent “watercolour” effect. Demonstrated on the back of my hand, it looked intriguing albeit splotchy. Attempted at home, it’s a mess. So, let’s just say that unless you’re the adventurous sort, just stick to using this dry , because it serves up pretty good pigment anyway, and you don’t have to faff about with damp brushes and what-not. In fact, I think it’s far more flattering when used dry because of the softer, more luminous effect, rather than the splotches of colour you get when using it wet. The 2 shades I was gifted with, are a study in contrasts. Panic which is pictured in the foreground, is a bright pink on one side, and a warm red on the other. This one is a straight blush, and fairly pigmented. For those with fair skintones, you need a soft, fluffy blush brush and a light hand or I swear, you will find it is too much. But for those with a deeper skintone, I think this will be perfect, because it will give your skin just that right amount of blush-flush. Jubilation , in the background, is a warm gold on one side, and a nude-peach on the other. This one I use strictly as a highlighter. While not highly shimmery when I use a soft fluffy brush, you can amp up the highlighting effect by using a denser brush. Here are the swatches on my arm, dry – I’m a Nars Foundation in Light 2 Mont Blanc for reference, and these swatches were done with my fingers. Pretty intense, and I hardly even scratched the surface of the blushes! The product feels hard, but the colour comes off quite easily onto brushes and fingers. It does remind me of a cake of watercolour you know ? I don’t wear Jubilation a lot, because I’m not really into the whole highlighting thing. But it is fairly subtle and not very shimmery or glittery at all, which makes it actually quite wearable. As for Panic , I tend to wear the pink side most of the time, because the warm red side doesn’t flatter my skintone as much, and in fact, makes my skin look blotchy. If you have a pigmentation problem like I do, then colours like these will emphasize your pigmentation and make it look worse than it is. Sometimes, I blend the shades, but the colour does turn out a little deeper than I like. For an idea of how these blushes look on my skin, here’s how I usually wear it. In these shots, I wore just the pink side of Panic, applied with a light hand using my Lunasol Cheek Brush , which is soft and fluffy enough, and rigorously blended out to soften. I also applied some of the Jubilation on the cheekbones for a touch of highlight. Nothing too noticeable. Some days, I get it right, and it comes out looking soft and flushed. Other days, I get it wrong and I look like someone slapped me, or worse, I look like I didn’t know how to apply blush, with 2 splotches of colour on my cheeks. So, if you’re wondering if I like these, I’ll have to say that I’m on the fence. On the one hand, I like the intensity of colour, and easy blendability of the product. You can buff and buff, and the colour doesn’t disappear, but looks much more natural. On the other hand, I feel that it’s a bit too much work, especially if you aren’t as dab a hand at using blush or makeup, or if you don’t own a soft fluffy blush brush. As for using it wet, I honestly wouldn’t bother. IN A NUTSHELL The Nars Dual Intensity Blushes come in a compact with 2 shades that you can use alone or blend. They are formulated to be used both wet and dry, although I find it a little too weird to use a blush with a wet brush. Errors abound, and it goes on splotchy. I find the colours fairly intense when dry, so there’s no real need to use them wet. As they are fairly pigmented, I’d suggest using a fluffy brush and a light hand to apply, and build up colour as you need. Also, gently buffing it into your skin gives a nice luminous flush, as the product isn’t very shimmery, yet gives a nice glow. Longevity is good for my normal-dry skin, lasting pretty much all day. I think these are particularly good for those with a deeper skintone, as the colours are quite intense and pigmented. For the very fair, be gentle. I’m not in love with either of the shades featured nor any of the shades in the collection as I feel they swing too wildly in the extremes of shade, tone and intensity. The packaging appears to be improved from the regular rubberized NARS packaging but it remains to be seen if it’ll degrade and turn sticky after a while. I can’t quite tell. PROS: Pigmented and intense colours, Not powdery, Packaging is sturdy and compact, 2 colours in each compact makes it versatile to use CONS: The concept of using it wet is just too weird, Due to the intensity of pigment and colour it is easy to overdo, Pricey WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who is familiar with and comfortable using blush, Anyone who wants more intense and pigmented blush shades especially if you have deeper skintones The new packaging does deserve mention though. I find that they feel less rubbery, and are more sturdy and feel less fragile. I don’t know if it will degrade as time goes on, so I’ll update if it does. It does attract dust and dirt so if you’re anal about keeping your products clean, avoid at all costs. You will go mad trying to keep it clean ? Did you try these Nars Dual Intensity blushes, or were you intrigued by them? If you tried them, which colour was your favourite? While I like the luminous effect I get from these blushes, the shades I feel, can be improved on. For now, they are just too much of a contrast, or just too bold. Above all, be sure to equip yourself with a soft blush brush and blend, blend, blend! ?

Recently, when I shared the super efficient liquid foundation application tutorial , quite a few of you expressed an interest in using or owning a face brush, and specifically, in the Shiseido Perfect Foundation brush which I had been raving about before. If I’m to be honest, its not the most expensive brush you’ll buy, at just RM95 and it’ll last you a long long time. But I know some of you operate on a budget, so here’s a good alternative for a face/foundation brush – the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush . Before I send you on a wild goose chase (because I do like this brush a lot too!) I must tell you that I have no idea where its available locally or if its available at Shins where some other Real Techniques brushes have been spotted. I’ll tell you below where its available online but if you know whether it can be found here, please share the info! Real Techniques by Samantha Chapman is a range of makeup brushes created with one half of the sisters running the Youtube/beauty blogger/makeup artists channel, Pixiwoo. I don’t personally watch Youtube beauty videos but I have watched some Pixiwoo videos and they are easy to follow and understand. None of the rambling you get with some other vloggers. If I were to do video, I’d ramble on so long, I’d forget what the subject matter was. Rather like what my posts are like ? But I digress! (as usual) What is it about the RT Expert Face Brush then? At the height of the raves when the Real Techniques line was first launched, I purchased a set of Real Techniques Core Collection brushes which come as a set of 4 face brushes. The yellow aluminium bodies tell you at a glance that these brushes are face brushes. Very helpful colour coordination, that! The only brush from the Core Collection that I ever really used or liked, was the Buffing Brush. Its why I never blogged about the Core Collection. I wasn’t terribly impressed despite all the raves. The Buffing Brush was meant for powder foundation or mineral foundation and as the name implies, is to be used in a buffing motion, to give a flawless, full coverage finish. I however, would use it to apply liquid foundation, or to buff or blend liquid foundation and it works well! The synthetic bristles are soft against the skin and the head is dense enough yet pliable enough to give a smooth, even finish to any foundation you apply on skin. So, when I came upon the stand alone Expert Face Brush , I was a little curious if it was similar. It did look rather similar. At the princely sum of US$9 I just had to pick it up and give it a go. Well, colour me impressed! The Expert Face Brush is nothing like the Buffing Brush so if you are thinking of owning both, go right ahead. The head of the brush is more dense and tightly packed, it is structured to be a little more flat, and the shorter bristles mean that there is less give and its less pliable. The slightly flatter structure mean its easier to buff and blend product and to get into the crevices around the nose and eyes etc. The synthetic bristles are soft and dense and it doesn’t hurt your skin even if you buff product in. I have tried the 5-line liquid foundation application technique with this brush and it works a treat and here’s the deal, is even quicker than using a flat paddle brush! So far, this is my favourite brush to use alongside the flat top foundation brushes that I own. Here are some comparison photographs to show you the differences between the Expert Face Brush and the Buffing Brush. You can see that the Buffing Brush is rounder and the bristles are longer. It is also less dense and works well for liquid or powder foundation, giving a lovely flawless finish. The Expert Face Brush doesn’t work as well for powder foundation, but it works very well for liquid or creamy foundation, similarly giving an even, flawless finish to skin. Used with the application technique I showed you before, this, its quick and quite flawless. The upside of these brushes, price aside, is that I find them much easier to clean than the Shiseido Perfect Foundation brush, which is a pain in the @$$ ? For me, I find that as the brush isn’t as dense as the Shiseido one, its easier to get into the bristles and clean them. The smooth synthetic bristles are also easy to wash and dry. One more difference between the Expert Face Brush and the Buffing Brush lies in the base. The Expert Face Brush is a standalone brush and quite literally, can stand alone. The base is widened so you can stand it unassisted on your dresser. Not quite sure why you’d do so, but you can if you want. The brushes that come in the set don’t have this widened base and therefore are not stand alone (hur hur ? ) So in a nutshell, get this if you’re on a budget. Or even if you’re not on a budget. Its a good brush to have in your arsenal ? In a nutshell The Real Techniques Expert Face Brush is a synthetic brush made for application of liquid or cream foundation. The dense slightly domed brush head makes it easy to apply and blend foundation in a buffing motion, and the soft dense bristles give skin a flawless appearance with minimal to no streaking if you do it right. Its an excellent brush, both in terms of use, application and price and worthy to have in anyone’s brush arsenal. Some people have mentioned that their brushes shed but I didn’t experience any shedding despite having washed it numerous times. Maybe I got lucky. Pros: Bristles and soft against skin, Light handle yet well weighted when held, Bright body colour makes the brush easy to spot in your collection, Dense bristles buff product well giving a smooth, flawless appearance, Affordable Cons: Not easily available Who will like this: Anyone who needs a liquid/cream foundation brush, Anyone on a budget Now for the $64,000 question. Where is this available? As I said, I don’t know about local availability. If it is, please let us know where you’ve seen it. Some other RT brushes including the sets are available in Shins (I know only of a store in MidValley Megamall). Depending on where you are in the world, you can find a list of places to buy Real Techniques brushes here . Not listed, is iherb.com where you can pick up a brush or two while shopping for your health supplements (You can use my iherb code MPW213 to get 5% off your order) ? Also note that I’ve realised that Real Techniques brushes sold on UK websites are substantially more expensive than on iherb so if you can, buy off iherb. I bought mine from HQHair which I no longer recommend for shipping to Malaysia because shipping used to be reasonably priced and even free but they now charge an astronomical wallet-busting sum of £18.99! So avoid at all costs. Do you own the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush? Have you used any other Real Techniques brushes and do you like them? I have the Core Collection (which I find meh) and the Blush Brush (also meh because its far too big) and this Expert Face Brush and the last one is the best of all I’ve tried so far. Definitely hits or misses with the brand. Let me know if you want an overview of the other Real Techniques brushes I have ?

It is also a favourite of mine , partly for sentimental reasons (I know that’s a weird reason to like a product, but it worked for me for many years when I was younger) and because I still find it effective at giving my skin the glowy boost it needs when my skin is tired. It works for me that way. The Advanced Night Repair serum stood out on its own, in its little brown bottle in the Estee Lauder stable. But it’s now the core of a brand new range, with the introduction of the Ampoules , a Mask in Oil and also, strangely enough, a cleansing balm! The Estee Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm comes in a jar with a shiny golden cover, bearing the iconic stripes along the edge, that brings it within the Advanced Night range of products. There was a lot of rave about this, and I had quite a few people telling me I had to give it a go, because everyone knows I love cleansing balms and this was a good one to add to my repository . I’d had it with me for a while, and I’m going to tell you that it’s good. I will not deny it. Yet, something bothered me about it. There was a niggling feeling at the back of my mind that I could not quite ignore, and just a few days ago, the penny dropped. Now, I’m ready to tell you what I think! ? The Estee Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm is a lightweight balm that cleanses skin, and is easily removed by emulsifying with water. In many ways, this is like a solid cleansing oil, and is perfect for those who are transitioning from using cleansing oil to a cleansing balm. The product comes in a flat jar, and you can scoop out its contents with any spatula you have on hand, if you’re the sqeamish sort, or use your fingers like I do, if you aren’t. You don’t need very much because once you warm it up between your palms, it softens and turns into a texture approximating a thick oil. I have found it useful for removing light makeup if you’re feeling lazy. Light makeup for me is a tinted base (e.g. a tinted moisturiser, cushion foundation, BB or CC cream), brows and maybe blush. For days when I have on more makeup or a foundation, I always cleanse first with a micellar water to remove the worst of the makeup, and then move on to this as my cleanse, before finishing off with a cream cleanser. I have tried removing makeup with it. It can work, if you use a face cloth to remove, but I otherwise don’t feel that it’s sufficient. Like a cleansing oil, remember to use it on dry skin and dry hands. This is because, like a cleansing oil, this one will emulsify on contact with water, and you can then rinse it off as you do a cleansing oil. Remember to keep emulsifying as you go, massaging all over your skin, not merely splash it off. These tips still apply . What this Estee Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm is then, is your first cleanse. Follow up with a second cleanse for a proper cleanse of your skin, especially in the evening. What I like about it? It’s effective. It’s easy to use, and it doesn’t irritate my skin. It cleans my skin and does not strip it, so my skin feels comfortable and clean. When I use my acid toner after that, there is no residue on my cotton pad. You do not need very much. I scoop out some with a finger, and massage it over my face to make sure it picks up the grime. I like it very much. There is little to no scent in the balm. But remember that niggling feeling that I had that wouldn’t let me rest? I worked out what it was. The Estee Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm is a DEADRINGER for the Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm! I absolutely kid you not. It is no wonder that I found the texture and formula so familiar every time I used it! Even the packaging is similar, with the Estee Lauder one looking a tad more elegant in its frosted jar and golden cover, while Clinique’s looks a little more utilitarian with it’s signature purple jar and silver cover. I haven’t replenished my Clinique TTDO Cleansing Balm for a while, so I didn’t have any on hand to compare side by side. But I’m going to stick my neck out and say that they are very very similar. In fact, based on the ingredient lists that you’ll see below, the formula is for the most part, exactly the same, with some additional ingredients in this Estee Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm. To be honest, I’m not surprised, as Estee Lauder and Clinique are under the same umbrella group anyway, and some sharing of technology is to be expected. Given that the two products are practically the same, and considering the price differential, I’m going to suggest that as nice as this EL cleansing balm is, just get the Clinique one, and save the difference for a lipstick ? IN A NUTSHELL The Estee Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm is a lightweight cleansing balm that comes in a solid texture, but softens into a thick balmy oil texture with the heat of your palms. Use dry hands and dry face to work with this, by warming up the product and massaging it all over your skin. You can emulsify to wash off, or use a face cloth, as I do. It leaves skin clean, comfortable and does not strip the oils so it doesn’t feel dry and tight. I’d use this as your first cleanse and follow up with a second cleanse after this. While it can remove light makeup, I feel that heavier makeup needs a makeup remover before hand, especially for waterproof makeup. It is good, but there is a more affordable option, within the same EL Group! PROS: Not scented, Lightweight balm texture makes it easy to massage into skin, Emulsifies with water for easier cleansing, Can remove light makeup, Does not strip skin and leave it feeling dry and uncomfortable, Easy to travel with CONS: Pricey WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes using cleansing balms that emulsify, Anyone familiar or new to using cleansing balms PRICE: RM175 | US$45 for 70ml WHERE TO BUY: Estee Lauder counters and boutiques, Sephora stores and online , Ulta , Nordstrom Estee Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm vs Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm I don’t have the exact products, but I remember what the Clinique one is like, and it’s super similar! Estee Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate; Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil; Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride; Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate; Polyethylene; Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate; Water\\Aqua\\Eau; Silybum Marianum (Lady’s Thistle) Extract; Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract; Algae Extract; Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile); Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender); Methyldihydrojasmonate; Tocopherol ; Bht; Linalool; Phenoxyethanol  Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol This is from my earlier review of the Clinique TTDO Cleansing Balm . I’ve highlighted in bold the common ingredients in both cleansing balms. In the Estee Lauder one, there are some additional ingredients which may or may not deliver benefits to your skin. However, as this is a cleansing product that you immediately wash off, I am not convinced that any soothing or antioxidant ingredients, will really benefit the skin. That’s just me though, so work within your understanding and beliefs. The other thing I want to point out is the price differential which is accurate as of today in 2017. Estee Lauder ANMCB: RM175/US$45 for 70ml (RM2.50/US$0.64 per ml) Clinique TTDOCB: RM135/US$29 for 125ml (RM1.08/US$0.23 per ml) I think it’s a no-brainer which to go for ? But don’t let me influence you ? Oh heck, let me! ? Have you tried this Estee Lauder cleansing balm? DO you like it? I’ve looked around online but no one seems to have noticed or picked up on the marked similarity between the Estee Lauder and Clinique cleansing balms. They are so similar as to practically be the same – price and slight additional ingredients notwithstanding. So really, just pick whichever you like and that suits your budget. But I think I know which you (and I) will pick! ? Paris B']"

These days, I’m all about cleansing balms because cleansing oils are far too drying for my skin and I find that balms work better on my dry skin. I started out using the Antipodes Grapeseed Butter Cleanser which I loved, and have incidentally finished and scraped clean, so it was time I experimented with another. It was at about this time that I discovered that The Body Shop had come up with the Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter , which had my senses pricked and my interest piqued. This then, is a balm cleanser which comes in a large flat screw top tin and a consistency that reminds me a lot of shoe wax. I’m sorry, it does! I spent many weekends as a child helping to wax my parents’ leather shoes (child labour yo! LOL) and I know my shoe waxes. I managed to get a sample of this for evaluation and I must say that it is interesting. It retails for just RM63 which isn’t very pricey, considering all the other cleansing balms I’m using or have stockpiled and will be using and a little does go a long way. But this is something that I think you have to work out for yourself if you’d like it. As I said, the product comes in a large flat tin and it has a waxy feel. I have the ingredient list below and while I’m not the cleverest person around to read ingredient lists, there is something called “synthetic wax” on the list. So my analogy of shoe wax isn’t too far off the mark ? To use it, you use your fingers (or a spare spatula you have lying around if you’re not keen on using your fingers) and dig into the wax to gouge out some product. Once you dig that first hole, it gets easier, as you can see above. I’m working my way through this tub from one side so technically, in the jargon of enthusiastic beauty bloggers everywhere, “I’ve hit pan!” ? I find this quite interesting, because when I place the product in the palm of my hand, it almost immediately starts to melt. Rub my hands together and it turns into a texture approximating a clear oil. Yes, it seems to turn right into a cleansing oil! The texture is light, which is a marked difference from the Antipodes butter cleanser that has a pronounced balmy texture. I find the product applies very easily over the skin and you can massage it in the way you do an oil cleanser, to remove your makeup and impurities. If you are familiar with an oil cleanser, then this feels the same and works the same way. It just starts out in a solid form, so if you choose to travel with it, it’s excellent. I don’t use this as a makeup remover however. I do one round of cleansing with Bioderma micellar water first. Also, although it says in the instructions that you can just rinse this off (think cleansing oil again – emulsify and then wash off) I find that it is best removed with a face cloth (I wish it was sold with one!) You see, I don’t know if it’s that synthetic wax ingredient in there, but I find that there’s a film on my skin after using this. So, if I don’t remove with a face cloth, then this film is very pronounced. Even when I do use a face cloth, after going over my skin a few times with the cloth, and then rinsing it, I still find that there is a film on my skin. A second round of cleansing usually gets rid of it, but for this reason, I am not a fan of this product. When I was using the Antipodes Butter Cleanser, once I wiped it off, my skin would feel smooth, soft and clean. With this one, it feels smooth but with a strange slippery feeling on my skin. Personally, I think if you have skin that is prone to clogging or acne, I don’t think this is the best product for you. Oh there is also a scent which I believe is that of camomile. Not unpleasant but not a scent I like. All in all, this isn’t a dud for me, and I will finish it off. I just will not repurchase. In a nutshell The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter is to me, a solid cleansing oil. It has a solid form in the flat tin that it comes in, but on contact with skin, it melts quite easily into a clear liquid form. It is easy to use – just spread over your face, massage it in and then remove. While it says that it can be removed by just rinsing with water (please be sure to emulsify properly before that using the cleansing oil method ) I will suggest that a muslin or face cloth removes the product better. I feel that it leaves a film on my skin even after using a cloth which is removed when I do my second cleanse, but I don’t like that feeling. So, I think this is a nice bridge for those who want to try something other than a cleansing oil. It’s different, yet familiar. Pros: Portable, Affordable, Easy to use if you are used to using cleansing oils, Easy to remove Cons: Film on skin after washing off, Should be sold with a cloth for better product removal, Minor breakouts due to presence of olive oil (I can’t use anything with olive oil or its derivatives) Who will like this: Anyone who wants to try a different cleanser and makeup remover other than cleansing oils, Anyone who wants a makeup remover that is more portable than cleansing oil Here is the ingredient list for anyone interested. Oh interestingly, I just noticed that this has olive fruit oil which usually breaks me out like nothing else if it’s present in skincare. I did notice one or two spots since, which I thought were due to poor sleeping habits but I now think may be attributed to this one. It isn’t as bad as some of the other breakouts I’ve suffered thanks to olive oil and its derivatives, but I’m cutting back on using this one for now. If your skin isn’t bugged by olive oil then ignore this bit of rambling ? Have you already tried this cleansing butter? Have you tried the cloth cleansing method yet? It upsets me when a highly anticipated product falters as this has, for me. I suppose I rather expected a little more or maybe I was spoilt by the truly sumptuous textured Antipodes Grapeseed Butter Cleanser. Oh and the cloth cleansing method is truly life … ok, not life, but skin changing for me and for the better! ?

On a previous occasion, I was playing around with cleansing milk or cream cleansers . They were ok, but not quite what I was looking for. Then, I was using cleansing water and micellar water. Refreshing, but although I really like the Bioderma micellar water and use it almost daily, something was lacking. So lately, I’m trying out cleansing balms. The first one I tried was the Eve Lom Cleanser . I like it. I love travelling with it in particular, because it is an excellent makeup remover and leaves my skin feeling lovely, soft and clean. It is also chock-a-block with mineral oil which many people shy away from. So, I recently gave an organic option a go. The organic option is the Antipodes Grapeseed Butter Cleanser and I must say, it took me months to warm up to this and it came down to learning how much to use, and the best way to remove it. Ever since being introduced to the brand, I have to say that my perception of organic skincare has changed a little. I used to shy away, because I had a poor experience before. But my experience with Antipodes skincare has so far been positive in almost all respects. It does please me to realise this as I now have a brand I can turn to if I want something organic and natural. So, the Grapeseed Butter Cleaner. You have to firstly understand that this is a cleansing balm. It is quite unlike your regular wash and go cleanser. It takes a little more effort and a little more work. But it is worth it, I promise ? The product comes in a plastic tub and the tub leaks. Trust me when I tell you that you do not want to travel with this one. I found that if you leave this without using, you may find some oil on the surface. Also, because it is a natural and organic product, it doesn’t last very long on the shelves. There is a little spatula inside I believe but I’ve lost mine ? So I just use my fingers. It’s just me using this, and I’m cootie-free ? First, I have to mention the scent. It’s not all that pleasant to most but I’m ok with it. It is a scent of lavender and herbs and honey and smells very “natural” if you get my meaning. I will say that it won’t appeal to everyone. Second the texture takes some getting used to. It is quite soft, and oily. Very much like butter. I take some, warm it up and then apply it to dry skin. It will lighten as you warm it up, and applies like a balm on your skin. I like to take a few minutes to massage it over my face and there seem to be some very small exfoliating bits in it. Now comes the difficult part. Removing. Unlike a cleansing oil that emulsifies in water, this cleanser, like the Eve Lom Cleanser needs to be removed with a cloth. Don’t make the mistake I did of thinking I could wash it off. You can’t. Eve Lom provides you with a muslin cloth in the box. Antipodes doesn’t. I do wish they did, because not everyone may realise that they need a wash cloth to remove this balm! If you don’t have a muslin cloth, fret not. I found that a muslin cloth didn’t work very well ? So, I just use a wash cloth. A face towel, if you may. You know those terry cloth squares that you may not be sure what to do with? Or if you have kids, the handkerchiefs you use to mop up their mess. Those. I wet it in hot water (my shower water) then squeeze out the water and lay it on my skin, pressing lightly. Then, I wet it again, squeeze out the water again, and repeat. On my third time, I then start to wipe away the balm. You will see it on your wash cloth and it isn’t a very pretty sight. I do it about 3 times to make sure it is all clean. But once you’re done, your skin feels amazing. It feels clean and soft and smooth. Apparently you can use this as a makeup remover as well, but I don’t (I tried, it doesn’t work very well). I take off my makeup using an eye makeup remover and the Bioderma micellar water first just to be sure. Ever since I worked out how best to use this, I have been using it very often. I hesitate to say everyday, because some days, it just takes too much effort. But I try. My skin seems to like it and I did not experience clogging or anything uncomfortable. In fact, my skin seems to look better but I’m not sure it’s 100% attributable to this product. I will warn you that if you don’t remove it properly, your skin will feel a little uncomfortable, and oily and sticky. As if you have a layer of balm on it, which you do. It put me off initially. So, the removal is important. Follow up with a foaming cleanser if you like. I sometimes do, and sometimes don’t. It is almost as if you are giving yourself a little facial at home, and my skin has been looking much better since I started trying this one. I don’t know if it’s the whole process that’s making a difference, but I’m starting to warm up to using a cleansing balm. In a nutshell The Antipodes Grapeseed Butter Cleanser is a balm type face cleanser. The brand is natural and organic and hails from New Zealand. The balm is quite easy to use. You do have to massage it into your skin and the removal process is quite a pain as you have to use a washcloth. But I like how clean and comfortable my skin feels thereafter. I sometimes follow up with a cleansing gel but sometimes I don’t. If you are familiar with the Eve Lom Cleanser or a cleansing balm, then this is a natural and organic alternative. Doesn’t smell wonderful, but skin feels lovely thereafter. Pros: Skin feels very clean and smooth after using, Feels gentle on skin Cons: Pricey, Removal takes a longer time, Smell may not agree with everyone, Hard to travel with as packaging may leak Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for an organic and natural alternative cleansing balm Here is the ingredient list for anyone interested. Have you tried this before? Have you used a cleansing balm and have one to recommend? I do have this on my repurchase list, unless I find a substitute in a different brand, but there aren’t that many cleansing balms available, I’ve noticed. I have the RMK Cleansing Balm up next and I also hear the Clinique Cleansing Balm is quite good so that’s 2 more to go before I come back to this one, I reckon.

I’m good at it… I guess? hehe) but you know what? I’m not immune either and friends, fellow bloggers and that damned Instagram take the cake! So, after seeing friend, fellow blogger and Instagrammer Lyn of Beautycabby (all 3 enablers rolled into one – it’s no wonder I caved!) rave about the Revlon Colorburst Matte Balms , away I went to the local Revlon display at Watson’s to take a look. Not just a look, I picked one up and I wanted to see how I liked it or if it would be enough. You see, I don’t particularly go for matte lipsticks. I’m now leaning towards wearing more matte eyeshadow and even blush, but matte lipstick can age a person somewhat. Revlon Colorburst Matte Balm Left: Standout Right: Sultry We get 8 shades here in Malaysia and to my (and most people’s surprise) the one I picked out for myself was Sultry . I know, most of you would have expected me to pick Standout , right? Right?! ? Well, so did the Revlon peeps coz I received Standout a couple of weeks ago ? How do you distinguish the Matte Balm from the other Revlon Colorstay Just Bitten Balm stain that I also like ? Simple. The body of the Matte Balm pencils are matte. In case you are confused, there is also a sticker on the base of the pencil that says “Matte” so you don’t make a mistake. Importantly, how do these hold up? Are they too matte? Do they make me look old? Does it dry out my lips as many matte pencils do? Do you like these? ? Ok, I do like these and I’m surprisingly sold on them! I say surprisingly, because I’d been using the Matte Balm in Sultry for a week or so and found that I’d reach for it often because the colour was a great everyday colour for me, and I liked the pigment and longevity. Like the other Revlon Colorburst lip pencils, these are your de rigueur twist up chubby lip pencils, hence no sharpening is required, and they come with a cap in the same colour as the body so it’s quite easy to pick out the colour you want from your stash. These were swatched just one time, running the lip pencil down my arm and you can see just how pigmented they are! It’s absolutely wonderful to see this sort of quality from a pharmacy/drugstore brand! You may also notice how these don’t look flat despite being a matte lip colour. I personally find that these aren’t truly matte on skin, and there is a little shine to them, which will not sit pretty with purists. I however, like that it’s not a true matte. I feel that that touch of subtle shine is more flattering than a flat matte but that’s me. Sultry is a berry with slight browned base which is a colour I wear and pick out often. It’s my everyday lip colour for days when I don’t really want to think about what lip colour to wear or when I want a no-fail colour that flatters without being too in your face. Standout is as the name implies, a standout bright red with a blue base. It is incredibly flattering when worn and that bit of shine in the product makes it looks better and a touch more glamorous than a flat red, to me. I managed to quickly swatch 2 other shades while at the counter so here they are. Complex is a nude shade that I don’t particularly find very complex and one I personally won’t pick for myself but if you are the sort to wear light lip shades then this will be one you could look at. Showy is a bright bubblegum pink that I think will look really cute on some people but again, not a colour I’d pick for myself because I know that pink will make my teeth and skin look sallow. But it’s a vibrant colour. So since we don’t wear lipstick in stripes down our hands, here’s how Sultry and Standout look on lips when I wear them. Left: Standout Right: Sultry Standout as you can see, despite it’s claim of being a Matte Balm doesn’t look like a flat matte and you can see that touch of shine in the middle of the lip. I find that a more flattering texture although it might irritate purists. Sultry has a more traditional matte look to it although it too doesn’t look flat. These Colorburst Matte Balms have the same minty smell and slight tingle on lips when first applied, although it goes away and despite the texture, I didn’t find them particularly drying, which surprised me. I originally felt that the Just Bitten Balm Stains were drying but much later, I found they were fine. Since then, I haven’t had a problem with Revlon’s pencils but I won’t discount the fact that some people may find it drying on lips. They glide on very easily and smoothly with no tugging and I find the wear time incredible. It’s longlasting and doesn’t mark coffee cups as much as some other lipsticks I own, and I can wear these for hours without having to reapply. At just RM35.90 RRP I think these pretty good value for money. For completeness, here’s how they look in a full face shot. Matte Balm in Sultry Matte Balm in Standout In a nutshell The Revlon Colorburst Matte Balm lip colours are twist up chubby lip crayons in a matte formula. They are easy to spot because the bodies are matte when compared to similar products in the range. I find them easy to apply as they glide on quite smoothly and are very pigmented with good longevity. However, I don’t find them particularly matte as I detect a touch of shine in some of the colours, which for me is great because a matte lip can be quite aging. However, those who want a true matte lip colour may not be happy with this. There is a minty smell and taste which dissipate and some people may find it a bit drying. I don’t although I wouldn’t call them moisturising either. I find some of the colours a little strange but there’ll be a colour to suit everyone depending on your preference. I think these pretty good value for money and absolutely worth checking out. Pros: Intense pigment, Smooth texture and easy to use, Twist up mechanism means no sharpening is required, Longlasting colour, Colour isn’t flat and dull, Affordable Cons: It isn’t truly matte, Some people may find it drying Who will like this: Anyone who wants a matte lip colour with good pigment that isn’t too matte I don’t find these to stain, but they do last a long time and fade off quite nicely leaving a tint of colour so you can just top up with a clear balm or gloss for a shiny pout with a hint of colour as the day wears on, or to freshen your pout. I do find that if you try to layer on more colour it can look too heavy. Oh and these trump the Suede lipsticks Revlon came up with last year . I ended up hating them because the texture killed me. Sticky and dry and that weird shine to it. Ick! These are MUCH better in terms of how flattering they look on lips and I think if you just look at the swatches, you can deduce that for yourself too! In a toss up between the two, get the Matte Balm, ditch the Ultimate Suede. Are you a fan of these Revlon Matte Balms? Do you wear matte lipsticks? I wouldn’t call myself a fan because I do find Revlon’s colour selection a little weird. There are one or two really neutral colours that most people can wear and then there’ll be a bright pink or orange that most people can’t. It always puzzles me. As for matte lipstick, I’m generally not a fan of it but I’d admit they have their place. I sometimes prefer a matte lipstick in a work place or when I have to put on a meeting face. It somehow makes me feel a bit more professional LOL ?

Does that shock you? It shouldn’t. It’s the reason why I hardly ever talk about lip balm here on my blog. I don’t believe in it, but then I don’t believe in a lot of things, like delusional people, romance novels and organic food. But I don’t deny that there are times when you need a lip balm. When your lips feel chapped, the worst thing you can do is pick at the dry flaky skin, and lick your lips. In those (rare) situations, I turn to a product I’ve kept on hand for this purpose. It’s the Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment SPF15 which I own in Rose. I’ve had this one for a while to be honest, and I picked it up at Sephora one day, a long while ago, because I was curious. The retail price was RM65 back then (now RM84) which puts a huge ding in your wallet for something as inconsequential as a lip balm, but I just had to try it la… you know how it is right? Scratch that itch and it’ll go away. Except in my case, I think it’s been worth it. Sure, I could get maybe 10 lip balms for that price if I were to hop over to a pharmacy, but where’s the fun in that eh? ? This is my first Fresh product, and I must say that I like it. I like how the case screws shut. It prevents the cap from going off on its own jaunt and exposing the balm to all sorts of lint and gross mess. As a balm, I like that the Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment does not leave a waxy film on my lips the way a lot of lip balm do. It glides on, leaving a layer of slightly oily wax over my lips, which gives lips a nice glossy shine, but does not leave that weird feeling of having rubbed candle wax on your lips. I do find that the product is a little soft in warm or hot weather, but in cooler weather, it firms up a little more. It still doesn’t harden up into a candle, for which I’m very happy. I detest having to rub at my lips with a chapstick over and over, only to feel like there’s nothing on my lips. While these come in an untinted version, mine is in Rose which imparts a slight rosy tint to the lips. Not a lot of colour, but on days when I wear a lipstick that stains, I like to refresh the colour in the afternoons with this one. It adds a bit of shine and gloss to the lips and a hint of colour, which when blended with a stain, looks lovely! One more thing I like about this tint of colour, is that it does not deepen as you go and it does not look unnatural. I don’t know if you’ve come across tinted lipbalms that tend to look strange after a while, or look gunky around the product the more you use it. This, I can happily say, doesn’t happen with this one. The balm is tinted and the colour on your lips does not deepen or change as you go along, which I appreciate. I believe some of the darker/brighter shades do apply with more visible colour. I chose a lighter shade on purpose, so I could apply it on the go, without a mirror and not come out of it looking like the Joker ? Oh and as a lip balm, I like it a lot. I took it with me on holiday recently to a place which was cold and dry and it kept my lips lovely and chap-free. I did use a different lip balm at other times, but this was what I kept in my bag with me at all times, so I had something I could use to protect my lips when they were feeling dry, and adding a hint of color as well, since I was all about not wearing makeup. I didn’t notice a taste so I guess it’s all good with me. Doesn’t taste of sugar if that’s what you’re wondering ? So I’m happy I own this, and if you ask if I’d recommend it, I’d say yes because it functions well without making my lips feel weird and waxy. But because the price is so steep, I’d tell you to sleep on it. If you use lip balm daily, every hour on the hour, like it’s going out of style then this will bankrupt you. But if you use it just occasionally as I do, then this is a nice treat for your lips. IN A NUTSHELL The Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment SPF15 is what I’d call a luxury lip balm. It’s pricey but I like how the texture feels comfortable without feeling like I’ve layered a thick layer of wax over my lips. It also seems to treat my lips on top of helping them stay chap-free when it’s dry or when my lips feel dry. It comes in a tinted and untinted version but the one featured here is tinted a slight rose. It doesn’t impart a lot of colour, but it gives a nice hint of colour to the lips for when you need it. I like this a lot, but the steep price can be off putting for many. If you’re feeling flush then this might be something to indulge in. PROS: No waxy feeling, Comfortable and melts into lips, Protects lips from dryness and chapping, Lips feel soft, Light tint of colour that doesn’t change or deepen with use CONS: Pricey WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who doesn’t wear a lot of lip balm or who does not like the waxy feeling of a lot of lip balms in the market, Anyone who wants a lipbalm with a tint of colour that does not deepen or change as the day wears on For those curious about what goes into the product, here’s the ingredient list:- Octinoxate (Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate) 7.49%, Oxybenzone (Benzophenone-3) 2.00%. Cera Alba (Beeswax), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Decyl Esters, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Parfum (Fragrance), Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Retinyl Palmitate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Tocopherol, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Ci 15985 (Yellow 6 Lake), Ci 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), Ci 15850 (Red 7 Lake), Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Ci 77491 (Iron Oxides), Ci 77499 (Iron Oxides), Propyl Gallate, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Bht, Citral, Citronellol, Geraniol. Have you tried a Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment? Would you pay more for a lip balm? I think this product is one of Fresh’s most popular products and having tried it, I can see why. It’s good and my lips love it. It has also made me curious about trying the other highly raved products from Fresh but gosh, they are pretty pricey aren’t they?

In a way, I was right. It is a perfume scent, just in lower concentrations. With these lower concentrations of perfume comes a lighter scent that is more suited for use in the day or when it is warm. When temperatures rise, you don’t really want to have anything on you that smells heavy and musky or strong. Earlier this year, Annick Goutal released a range of colognes in 3 classic Annick Goutal scents – Eau d’Hadrien, Neroli and Vétiver. They are meant to be light interpretations of the classic scents. Something that might sit better here where it’s warm and humid. I stopped by the Annick Goutal store in Bangsar Shopping Centre a few months ago to take a sniff of them. Other than the very lovely Petite Cherie, I have found most Annick Goutal scents to be a bit heavy even for me. So, I was curious to see if a cologne might be better. In a way it was, and in a way it wasn’t. Before I tell you about the Annick Goutal Les Colognes collection, I wanted to just tell you to please take my post or anyone else’s post on fragrance with a very generous pinch of salt. Grab a whole handful of salt, if you may, because fragrances are so individual that it is practically impossible to “review”. Also, remember that what smells wonderful to me could smell like pee on you. I say this by way of a preface because I recently fell for the descriptions of Diptyque Eau Duelle online and picked up a bottle only to find it was not what I was expecting. For now, in the Les Colognes collection are 3 scents. The descriptions are mine and based on my perceptions as I smell them. Neroli – The first spritz brought forth the fresh scent of orange blossom initially but as it dried down, I found it getting more flowery. I actually thought the scent was quite strong and lasted quite a while on my skin. It didn’t smell good on me however, so I was not too pleased with the fact that it lasted on my skin for a while. Eau d’Hadrien – This opens up with a zesty citrus top note which very quickly settled to a powdery and then floral scent on my skin. Eau d’Hadrien is described as a fresh citrus fragrance and I was expecting to like this, but it turned out that I did not. It’s funny how different a description of a scent can turn out on skin, but this just smelled wrong on me. Didn’t last very long, as is de rigueur with most citrus based perfumes. I therefore settled for Vétiver for the simple reason, this was the spiciest scent of the 3 and I like my scents spicy. When I spray the Vétiver cologne on me, I find the first hit on the nose quite sharp. If you like something with flowers or something sweet and gourmand, you may not like this one. The scent of Vétiver is sharp and spicy and then settles down to a warmer note, still retaining the spiciness but rounding out a little on my skin. Of the 3, I found Vétiver has the strongest scent, followed by Neroli and then Eau d’Hadrien. Unlike the other perfumes I have which have Vétiver as their notes, this one smells very clear and clean. It smells like I’ve stepped out from a shower after using a man’s spicy body wash LOL It has that hint of masculine spiciness, with a tiny hint of flowers underlying it as it goes along. It smells… fresh! But with a decided masculine slant ? The only drawback therefore is the longevity. This is a cologne as the name implies which makes this the lightest formulation available. The next up is Eau de Toilette and we already know that many EdT don’t quite pass the full day of wear test. So, Vétiver lasts on me quite comfortably for a little over half a day in the office. A little longer if it’s cool and the air-conditioning is particularly powerful and it’s a rainy day. If it’s a day when I’m outside in the heat and humidity, it goes off after a couple of hours. Quite something to be expected of a cologne, but a little disappointing if you like smelling fresh all day. So, this is one where having a travel atomizer on you will be quite appreciated. I plan to pick one up so I can carry Vétiver around with me for the day. The bottle comes with a gold cap but a spray pump is included and once you attach it, you can’t use the cap anymore. I thought it was a pity. I’d have liked for the cap to be made such that it could fit over the spray. Also, notice how the packaging has changed from the classic ribbed design of Annick Goutal fragrances to a very simple, clean design. I don’t know if this is going to reflect a change across the board. Whilst I like the sharp, clean, minimalistic lines of the new bottle, I find they look more generic. I’ve come to associate the ribbed bottles and gold caps with Annick Goutal fragrances so if there is going to be a change, it’ll take some getting used to. Oh and the Les Colognes come in a very generous 200ml bottle, hence the hefty size you see above, which makes sense because you will likely end up using more due to its lack of longevity. At RM800 however, it is still an ouch to the wallet, as with all niche scents. Do you have a favourite cologne or do you prefer wearing a EdT or EdP? Have you a favourite Annick Goutal scent I might like? My experiences with cologne has been a little limited, and in fact only really those by Jo Malone . I do find some stay on longer, and some not as long so much again will depend on the formula and scent, weather and our body chemistry! So complex ?

I have to say that as I rarely pay a lot of attention to Nars blushes these days (after poor experiences with their packaging ) I overlooked this one. I was however sent a blush in the titillatingly named “Sex Fantasy” along with a Satin Lip Pencil in “Villa Lante” so I thought I’d quickly tell you what I thought about them because one was a surprise hit and the other, a rather expected, washout. It’s also limited edition, so don’t pause for too long if you’re contemplating something from the collection. The question of course, is which is which?! Wouldn’t you like to know eh? ? A little tidbit of information re: naming of the rather more exotic Nars blushes here in Malaysia and I’m told in a couple more conservative countries, is that numbers maybe used in place of the name we know. So for example, Sex Fantasy will be labelled 4006 at the display. Less shocking, but if you know the name of the blush, the Makeup Artists will be able to help you ? Another thing I learned recently also, is that the infamous Nars rubbery packaging has been reformulated and improved upon to withstand heat and humidity. Guess they were listening to us after all! Someone I know showed me her blush compact that she carries around in her bag and has been for the past 6 months and although a little dusty, it wasn’t yet sticky and melty so perhaps there is some truth in it after all! I do find that it feels smoother. So onto Sex Fantasy and Villa Lante. Are these colours you’d wear? Let’s just say that the Villa Lante Satin Lip Pencil (RM85) isn’t one I’d have picked for myself. I don’t generally fare well with pale sweet pinks like these for lips as they have a nasty habit of making my skin look sallow and my teeth yellow. Granted, when I actually tested it, it doesn’t look too bad. I suppose I could top it up with a bolder gloss or apply it over a base of a deep toned lip pencil to warm up the colour a little. I’ll keep experimenting ? The texture is quite nice, with a nice slip and I didn’t find it too drying. I own a Satin Lip Pencil in Hyde Park that I bought a while ago and I might tell you about that at a later stage. They aren’t matte, but they aren’t glossy either. Satin is quite an apt description. It is also surprisingly quite small. All these close ups that I see online doesn’t help me manage my expectations at all! It’s quite small and short much to my surprise and it doesn’t come with a sharpener, which is sold separately. I bought the sharpener the last time so I already have one but if you don’t want to buy theirs, I suppose you could try a jumbo sharpener from a stationery shop ? I’ve got a swatch of this below, if you’d like to scroll a little further down. As I said, it’s not a pink I’d wear usually but I can make it work, as it doesn’t wash me out very much. But I have to make sure I wear something a little stronger on cheeks and eyes. The moment I laid eyes on Sex Fantasy blush (RM120) , I wondered aloud, just how this very pale cool pink blush could ever conjure up a Sex Fantasy. Maybe one filled with fluffy cotton-tailed rabbits? ? Hmm… maybe scratch that thought ? Sex Fantasy in pan is a very pale powder. Very very pale, cool, pink. Quite unexciting if you ask me. However, I found that when worn on skin, it translated into a lovely soft pink flush that was very alluring. The powder is pretty pigmented and quite true to what you see in the pan, except that I found that when I wore it on cheeks, it warmed up a little so it was much more flattering on skin. However, the caveat is that this will likely work only for the fair skinned since it is so light. So if you have a fairly light skintone, I urge you to give this a try because you, like me, may end up being quite surprised at how sweet a look it gives you. I also caution against applying too much because it can look a bit powdery. But it looks nice even as the day wears on, giving you that “Look! I’ve got a sweet healthy glow… or is it blush? You can’t tell can you?!” sort of look. I did have it last for at least 6 hours without problems and even a little longer so that’s practically a whole work day. A surprise hit for me! Note: As Legeeque has pointed out in her comment below, Sex Fantasy does appear to be the pink counterpart to Sex Appeal (permanent). That too is a very pale powder blush with peachier undertones that I’m assured looks better on skin than in pan. I thought I’d show you a quick comparison with some other pale pink blushes I own. I didn’t have time to trawl through my whole stash but some pale pinks I have can be found here . I’ve compared it here to Benefit Dandelion and Shu Uemura M Pink 33E (which I don’t know if it still exists because this one’s quite old). In terms of colour in pan, Sex Fantasy is closest to the Shu Uemura one. Dandelion has a little more peachy tones as you can see. Here are the swatches then, swatched heavily as I these light blushes don’t show up very well otherwise. Sex Fantasy isn’t similar to Dandelion at all, which as a slightly more peach cast. Shu Uemura M Pink 33E is a little brighter and warmer compared to Sex Fantasy. You may also notice that Sex Fantasy doesn’t look very pale does it? It has a significantly cool toned base with a light pink tone that is sweet but anyone with deeper skintones will not appreciate it, that I will guarantee! You will likely appreciate colours like Love or Final Cut more, or New Attitude if you want something pink. Oh and one more thing I liked about Sex Fantasy – it’s a matte blush! I have been warming up to using matte makeup in recent times (Is this a sign of age catching up, I wonder ? ) and I have and liked Angelika blush which is full of shimmer but a lovely pink. So having a matte pink blush that is easy to use and makes me look perky and sweet without having a face full of shimmer is a boon! ? Here’s how Sex Fantasy blush and Villa Lante Satin Lip Pencil looks on me. In terms of the blush, I applied it as I would to work, so I didn’t want to put on a lot. You may just see the hint of pink on the apples of the cheeks? I hope so ? The lip colour as I expected, wasn’t something I’d fancy. I can make it work but I’d prefer something that isn’t pink-pink ? In a nutshell The Nars Final Cut collection has 4 blushes, 4 Satin Lip Pencils and an Illuminator. Of the 4 powder blushes, Sex Fantasy is the lightest colour and I am sure, will be hard to show up on deeper toned skin. On light skinned gals however, I’d say it’s worth a look. Or at least, a try on your skin to see if you like how it looks on you. I’m not saying it’s a must have. But if you are afraid of wearing blush and want something easy and fool proof, it’s worth giving Sex Fantasy a look. Villa Lante is a cool toned pink which is a colour I personally don’t wear a lot of as it doesn’t quite flatter my skintone as much as something with a bit more colour or warmth does. The texture is nice and easy to use but the pencil doesn’t come with a sharpener which I wish wasn’t the case. Pros: Sex Fantasy blush despite the pale pink colour in pan goes on skin a surprisingly complimentary gentle pink that perks up the complexion, The Satin Lip Pencil applies smoothly and comfortably Cons: Sex Fantasy blush will not show up on deeper skintones, Villa Lante lip pencil may not suit all skintones and will accentuate yellowness on teeth, Lip pencil doesn’t come with a sharpener Who will like this: Anyone who wants a light toned matte pale pink blush, Anyone looking for a cool pink lip colour Here’s an overview of the Final Cut collection for your viewing pleasure ? Sex Fantasy in person is quite underwhelming but I’d say it’s worth asking one of the Makeup Artists to give you a test on your cheeks. I wasn’t impressed till I wore it and then I was quite happy to wear it for a week straight ? Does anything from the Final Cut collection catch your eye? Would you wear something like Sex Fantasy blush or Villa Lante lip pencil? I never thought I’d take to Sex Fantasy blush but I did! Did you check out anything from the collection? ?

The tubs of bright green and bright pink gel were so reminiscent of…. 90’s HAIR GEL! ? Come on, I can’t be the only person out there who thinks so right? Tip: Keeping the gel masks in the fridge offer a lovely cooling treat for skin on warm days but don’t keep it with your veges or within reach of children or anyone who might dip a spoon in here and taste the product ? But you know what? Don’t go smearing these colourful gel in your hair, they go on your face instead. I’ve never really tried anything from Peter Thomas Roth before but apparently their gel masks are highly acclaimed. The Cucumber Gel Mask in particular, seems to get raves for being soothing, hydrating and gentle on skin so I was curious to see how I’d like that one. The Rose Stem Cell Bio-Repair Gel Mask is a new addition and touts an anti-aging function, helping to soften lines while hydrating and rejuvenating skin. If you’ve tried either, or any other, I’d love to hear your thoughts on this too! The first thing I’d make mention of is the texture. Like hair gel, the wobbly jelly texture of these gel masks behave in the same manner. Be careful when removing the cover, because they can jiggle their way out of the tub if you’re not careful. The tub is a fairly large size and the clear plastic offers a fun view to the clear jelly within. Both these products are face masks that you can use for a quick treatment by applying and then washing off after about 10 minutes, or if you prefer something a little more intensive, leave them on overnight. In the latter function, it operates much like a sleeping pack or sleeping mask and anyone already familiar with using a sleeping mask will know how that works. Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Gel Mask – RM188/150ml The Cucumber Gel Mask actually reminds me a lot of after-sun soothing aloe vera gel. It has the same green gel texture and the same feeling when it goes on skin. This one claims to boost hydration in skin while moisturising and calming the skin with its refreshing texture. In many ways, it does what it says on the tin (or tub, as it were). It feels lovely and cool going on my skin especially if it’s been a hot day, and it does seem to calm my skin so if your skin feels irritated or just flushed, it seems to calm it right down. It’s very nice to slap on on warm evenings while you relax. But it does feel like that’s about it. It gives an instant refreshing feel to the skin that continues even after you wash it off (and it washes off quite easily) and apply your skincare, but it doesn’t seem to give an intensive hydration boost to the skin that lasts you a couple of days, as most intensive masks do. So, I’d consider this a nice treat for the skin but it isn’t a product that significantly hydrates my skin nor does it particularly boost moisture and hydration levels in skin. You can sleep in this, for which I’d advise a thinner layer of product, and it is nice, because you do then wake up with skin that feels moisturised (something you’d notice in drier air, or in an air-conditioned room) but it doesn’t last and that is a bit of a pity. Peter Thomas Roth Rose Stem Cell Bio-Repair Gel Mask – RM193/150ml This one’s relatively new in the PTR line up and is more targeted at an anti-aging function. While the Cucumber Gel Mask doesn’t have a discernible scent, this one’s lightly fragranced with the scent of fresh roses. I was a little concerned, expecting a stronger rose scent but it isn’t very strong. When I have it on, it does make me feel like having Turkish Delight (which I happen to really like eating!) but it doesn’t bug me although I’m not the biggest fan of the scent of roses. I find the texture of the Rose Stem Cell mask a little more dense than the Cucumber Gel Mask. Just a smidge, but it feels and looks less wobbly and jiggly. It too, feels lovely and cooling going on the skin and it too seems to calm the skin especially when you’re feeling hot and irritated. I have been at this for about a month (the levels barely dip right? It can last you a while) where I use it about 3 times a week and it is nice… but not special. I don’t really have very prominent lines (thank you good genes!) and my biggest concerns would be hydration which I feel that this mask addresses better than the Cucumber one. I hesitate to talk about things like glow and bouncy skin, because I don’t particularly notice either but then, it is a very special product indeed that can deliver all that in just one bottle or tub and this just isn’t it. It is however, a nice lovely treat, and a nice sleeping mask on days when you are just too tired or lazy to go through all your skincare routine. Slap this on, go to sleep and it does a good enough job. IN A NUTSHELL The Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Gel Mask and Rose Stem Cell Bio-Repair Gel Mask have a nice, cooling gel texture on skin and both masks help calm the skin and offer hydration. I do find that the Rose Stem Cell mask feels a bit more hydrating on skin than the Cucumber one and both can be left on and then washed off after a few minutes, or even left on overnight for a more intensive treatment. While I think they’re both nice and easy to use and you can even use them daily if you like, I didn’t quite notice that they did anything dramatic to my skin. They probably help maintain how my skin looks, but they aren’t really making any revolutionary changes to my skin despite my very regular use of it. So it’s a nice to have, but there are options out there. Pros: Fun gel texture, Almost instantly cools and calms the skin especially if irritated by heat, Offers an instant boost of hydration to the skin but doesn’t seem to last Cons: Pricey, No significant improvements to my skin which is normal-dry but it does feel comfortable in dry air Who will like this: Anyone who wants a daily and easy to use mask that helps soothe skin and offers to boost hydration in skin Here is the ingredient list for both these gel masks. Top: Rose Stem Cell Bio-Repair Gel Mask Bottom: Cucumber Gel Mask Of the 2, I prefer the Rose Stem Cell mask because I feel that it does more than the Cucumber Gel Mask and feels better on my skin. I like slapping them on in a thickish layer, watching an episode of my favourite TV series and then washing it off after. My skin always feels lovely thereafter ? Have you used either of these gel masks? Do you have other Peter Thomas Roth products to recommend?

Loads of product, great value! Smells amazing!” and you know what I thought? Wait a minute – Bobbi Brown? They do skincare?! Apparently they do! And apparently I’m told that some of their skincare isn’t too bad which made me curious, because I don’t always associate known makeup brands like Bobbi Brown and Nars with skincare. But when you know of the big companies backing them who do do skincare (Estee Lauder Group and Shiseido Group respectively) then it sort of makes sense doesn’t it? ? So one day, I was given the opportunity to try the Bobbi Brown Extra Rinse Balm cleansing balm and after I’d finished up a few of the ones I had in rotation, it was time to break this out and see how I felt about it. I use the word “break” in a rather hesitant way, as this product comes in a large, heavy glass jar and that just spells disaster all over the bathroom! So I am very careful to keep this out of the wet area and as I use dry hands to handle it, accidents can be minimized, but not eradicated. Please be very careful because it is large and unwieldy. I’ve given this almost 2 months use to see what I think about it, and apologies to the fans out there, I’m afraid I’m a little on the fence about this one. I can’t fault the quantity. Although it’s expensive at about RM245 a jar, there’s a hefty 200ml of product in there which is a lot more than many other cleansing balms in the market. So once you break down the price, it isn’t that bad. Oh and it will last you a long long time, because you don’t really need that much each time you use it. See? It’s large! The yellow balm is as the name implies, a balm texture. It is sticky and doesn’t come with a spatula but that doesn’t bug me. I just dig right in with fingers. Dry ones mind you! You don’t want to use wet fingers because I’m sure it’ll spoil the product. As with most cleansing balms, this operates on a dry hands, dry face method of cleansing. Scoop out a generous amount of cleansing balm depending on your personal preference. I am quite generous as I like to perform a little massage and you need lubrication. You will notice that the texture is sticky. It’s like the balm sucks at your fingers when you try to scoop some out and when you do, it’s sticky. See? You may notice the texture, which is a translucent yellow and a balmy texture that is unlike that of the Antipodes one which has a more buttery texture. I’ve read of people experiencing problems using this because it’s so sticky and hard to use on skin but I didn’t experience problems. So here’s how I use it to give you an idea. Scoop out a generous amount and place in palm of hand. Using the other palm, rub at the balm to warm it up and spread it out in your hands. It starts out sticky but gets easier to work with as it warms up. Apply to face and massage. There is a warm sensation on skin and it’ll soften further. After a few minutes, add some warm water to melt the balm, continuing your massage, to emulsify the product. After a few more minutes, rinse off. Warming it up in your palms makes it easier going on your face and minimizes painful tugging at your facial skin. As you massage, the balm will feel softer and it gets easier to handle. There is a strange warming sensation on the skin for a short while that I can’t explain. However, unlike balms like The Body Shop one or even Clinique, it does not turn into an oil. It remains a balm and I like that. I am not much of a fan of those that turn into oils. Another point to note is that this balm is easily washed off without using a face cloth. You can just rinse it off after emulsifying it a little with warm water. I however prefer to use a face cloth and although I enjoy it, I know people find it a hassle so if you don’t like those wipe-off balms, you will prefer this one. Another thing to note – the strong citrus smell. It is very strong and very sweet. I always feel like I’m washing my face with orange cordial or an orange rind whenever I use this because it is so strong! Some people will enjoy this, and although I do enjoy citrus scents, I actually find this a bit too much. A light scent is fine, but something this overwhelming doesn’t sit well with me. Also, because of this strong citrus smell, I took a look at the ingredients and noticed that it contains citrus fruit extracts which I will warn can be irritating to sensitive skin so I will exercise a little caution if you do have sensitive skin. It cleans my skin well enough, leaving it soft and feeling smooth and lovely but the strong citrus smell doesn’t sit well with me and I have a feeling that it dries my skin a little so I don’t use this every evening as I would usually do. I’ve been alternating this with another simply because I feel that my skin doesn’t tolerate this cleanser as well as it should. It is however, convenient due to it’s rinse off formula so what I’d like to see is for this to come in a smaller, handier tub, maybe not in glass so we don’t have accidents in the bathroom and a lower pricetag. It’s not a bad product, I don’t think, but it can be prohibitive for people who may not be sure if the formula or ingredients will suit them. I’ll use this up, as I did the one from The Body Shop that I emptied just recently, but this isn’t one I’d repurchase. The hunt is back on! In a nutshell The Bobbi Brown Extra Balm Rinse is a balm cleanser that can be easily rinsed off with water instead of having to use a wash cloth or face flannel. The texture is quite sticky but once you warm it up in your hands, it’s quite easy to apply to skin and massaging it lightens the texture somewhat. The strong citrus scent appeals to many, but it does not appeal much to me and I will caution anyone with sensitive skin to take note of the citrus oils used as that can be irritating to skin. This cleans my skin well although if I use this too often it feels a wee bit drying so I use it on alternate days, alternating with another balm cleanser. I will suggest following up with another cleanser as this is the first step of a double cleansing routine and it does remove makeup although I didn’t test it on my eye area. The citrus makes my eyes water. The glass jar is large, heavy and unwieldy so this is one instance when I think a plastic jar will do better in a bathroom. Pros: Cleans skin well and leaves it soft and clean, Balmy texture makes it useful for massaging over skin, Those who enjoy the scent will enjoy using this, Rinse off formula makes it very convenient Cons: Glass jar is heavy and awkward especially in the bathroom, Citrus scent is far too strong Who will like this: Anyone who enjoys strong citrus scents, Anyone familiar with using a balm cleanser and prefers a rinse off formula Here is the ingredient list for anyone keen to see if you can use this Some of you may be wondering if you can use this as a makeup remover and cleanser in one. My answer is yes you can, however I don’t recommend it. The reason I say so is because I would never use this around my eyes (too strong and too much tugging) and if you’re going to remove your eye makeup first, it would also make sense to remove your face makeup first. That’s what I do as I do not believe in all in one products. So I’d remove my makeup first with a cleansing water (I don’t bother if it’s too clean) and then I follow up with a balm cleanser for my face area (never eyes!) and end with another face cleanser. That’s me ? Have you used this Bobbi Brown Balm? Have you tried other Bobbi Brown skincare? I haven’t tried other Bobbi Brown skincare but they actually have a treatment lotion that intrigues me! Also I’ve read their face moisturiser is quite good. Thoughts? ? Paris B Bobbi Brown Extra Balm Rinse Price: RM245/200ml Availability: Bobbi Brown counters and stores']"

Not a conventional item to see on a beauty blog, I’d warrant but it’s not entirely irrelevant either ? You see, I do my own dishes (I don’t believe in dishwashers) and not long ago, I discovered that I have sensitive hands. Yes, princess hands even, because at the mere touch of a strong detergent, the skin on my hands will dry out and peel. It’s part of the reason why I started wearing kitchen gloves . It protects my hands from a lot of harshness, but it primarily protects my hands from looking like a scaly reptile’s. Well, until now ? I’m not a very green person so when I saw this natural Tough Love dishwashing liquid from Human Nature that claimed to be gentle on hands, I was more interested in that than the fact that it was natural. Most that claim to be gentle aren’t. That’s a fact. I’m a living testimony of that. But you know what? It’s a very good dishwashing liquid. Not only because it is as gentle as it claims to be, it does clean impressively well with very little, and makes my glasses shine. So I just had to wax lyrical about it! ? To test if its claims of being gentle on skin was true, I forsook kitchen gloves when doing my dishes for over 2 weeks. It was not without some trepidation because when I get my dry scaly skin, it takes me weeks to recover. I was taking a huge risk here. But happily, I didn’t experience the dryness I associate with using detergent and I knew then I was in love. Yes, in love with a dishwashing liquid LOL ? The one I have has a Lemon-Calamansi scent, which is a sweetish, citrus scent that isn’t the sharp artificial lemon scents that you usually get from most cleaning materials. It is pleasant but it does take a little getting used to, for those of us who have been using commercial cleaners before this. You don’t have to use a lot as I find it fairly concentrated. I squeeze a little onto a sponge, lather it up with water and then wash my dishes. It seems to cut oil and grease quite well, although very soiled or oily dishes may need more product. What impressed me was that it actually cleaned oily plastic containers well, and that is a feat for any dishwashing liquid! As for my wine glasses, it left them with a lovely shine that I found impressive. Ok, I haven’t used a lot of natural kitchen cleaners so in my mind, I get this impression that they don’t work as effectively and maybe I’m just easily impressed ? But I loved using this one and I loved that I didn’t have to don my gloves just to wash out a glass or two. I let my friend try this and even they were impressed. I was afraid I wouldn’t get it back ? That said, I still do wear gloves. It used to protect my hands against harsh chemical detergents but now it mainly protects my hands against dirty crockery. Sometimes, it can get icky clearing up after eating ? Here’s the ingredient list and some blurb on the back of the bottle about the product. I love this dishwashing liquid but I will tell you one downside. The price. It comes in 2 sizes, but it doesn’t come cheap. I paid about RM5 for my Sunlight dishwashing liquid and I thought it was expensive. So, finding out that Tough Love Dishwashing Liquid costs RM19.90 for 250ml does come as quite a shock to the system. If you do a lot of washing or have someone do it for you, then you will find it a bit too expensive to upkeep. If you use a dishwasher, you shouldn’t even have read this far! ? But if you do your own washing and like me, have sensitive skin on your hands then do consider trying this out. I’m planning to continue using this for the sake of my hands, and I guess, helping the environment a wee bit doesn’t hurt either ? Do you do your own dishes? Are there brands of natural kitchen/household cleaners that you like? I do because I don’t really see the point of a dishwasher and I’m paranoid it never really gets very clean ? I’m new to using natural household cleaners but for now, I’m very happy with this dishwashing liquid. I’ll probably suck it up and get the big bottle once I’m done, unless you have another natural and gentle brand to recommend me! ?

It behaves itself, it isn’t too unhealthy, it isn’t oily and I don’t have dandruff *touch wood* All in all, I’m that lucky girl to have good hair days most days of the week. I know you hate me now, sorry ? But you know, I wasn’t the only one who thought so. When I was invited by Aveda to try their Botanical Therapy for Hair and Scalp at the newly opened Aveda-exclusive salon Restyle+ at Nu Sentral (super convenient mall linked to public trains. And there’s a Sephora there too ? ) the stylist was at a bit of a loss as well as to what to do with my hair LOL! ? He pronounced a healthy scalp and healthy hair that was just a wee bit dry. He was surprised that I didn’t colour my hair (it’s been years and my hair’s all natural and yes, it’s brown) nor did I treat it in one way or another. I’ve been there and done that. I’m not going back till I turn grey ? In the end, we settled for a Moisture Treatment . I’ll just quickly tell you what to expect and if you’re looking for a natural option to all the chemicals you put on your hair and head, you might want to check out Aveda treatments. The treatment starts with a cup of special Aveda tea that is very calming and soothing to the throat. Once your hair concerns are sorted and the treatment decided, you are treated to a very very lovely sensorial experience with the Aveda Blue Oil . This has a refreshing and uplifting peppermint scent and cuts through the fog in your head while calming you down. You then get a very lovely neck and shoulder massage. Mmm…. Oh ok, where was I? After the massage, the Scalp Remedy is applied to your scalp section by section and carefully massaged in so you get a very very lovely and fairly head massage as well as the product is massaged into your scalp! You are then led off to have a wash. Coming back, your hair is then treated to Dry Remedy treatment enriched with buriti and pomegranate oils to leave hair looking and feeling silky and soft, which is again massaged into your hair section by section. Then, your head is stuffed into a contraption to steam your hair, like so. Ohai! Yes, that’s steam seeping out of my head. It was amusing but your head doesn’t get hot and bothered. It feels really quite comfortable and a normal person would be immersed in the magazines by now, instead of taking strange selfies in the mirror ? Once the timer dings, you go back for a hair wash and then your hair is blow dried and Dry Remedy oil is applied to keep your hair feeling and looking swishable. The thing is, I don’t have long hair so I can’t do any swishing, but my hair took on a softer, less structured look. When I ran my fingers through my hair, it would fall back nicely into place although I found the fringe a little too floppy for my liking. But still, it was nice and my head felt light and I can imagine that if you have longer hair that is prone to frizziness, it would be a lovely feeling to have your hair fall straight and smooth instead of fanning out like a lion’s mane. I was told also that regular treatment would be helpful for those who do have a problem with dry and frizzy hair and that’s true of all treatments. The only thing is that you may find the scents take some getting used to. Being botanical based, Aveda hair products have an earthy, herbal scent that may not sit well with every nose. I found it pleasant and if you like essential oils, you may too. But if you don’t, then you probably won’t like this because the smell will linger and is quite strong. As for how long it lasts, it lasted me about 3 days before my hair lost its floppiness but I must note that I wash my hair daily, and in that time, I started swimming almost daily and we know just what chlorine does to hair right? Yes it kills it ? So don’t use my experience as a yardstick. I had my treatment done at Restyle+ hair salon at Nu Sentral, which is an Aveda exclusive salon in that they only use Aveda products. You can also buy products for them and I picked up a Dry Remedy Oil as well. The treatment costs between RM130-180 depending on hair length. There are a few other Aveda exclusive salons where you can get a treatment done if you like. You can find them at this link so if you’re interested, head to a salon closest to you and make some enquiries. Are you an Aveda haircare fan? Have you had their Botanical Treatments done before? I haven’t really used Aveda hair products before this so I’m open to your recommendations if you have. As for hair treatments, if I had longer hair that I wanted to keep sleek and smooth, I’d probably go back and get it done. It’s nice to know you don’t get a boatload of chemicals dumped on your head, and your scalp doesn’t feel sensitive nor tingly. But as I have short and fairly healthy hair and scalp, it’s not my top priority at this moment in time. Perhaps when I start going grey, I’ll try their hair colour ? Paris B']"

There were a few in previous years with Michael Kors and recently the Mad Men collection which we didn’t get. But at the end of 2013 news came out that Estee Lauder would be doing a collaboration with fashion designer Derek Lam, a designer with whom they’d spent a decade working. If you didn’t already notice, this capsule collection has quietly sneaked into selected major Estee Lauder counters. I did think you might miss it because we haven’t heard a lot about the Estee Lauder Derek Lam Collection for Spring/Summer 2014 so I thought I’d tell you a little more about it ? This capsule collection was created by Estee Lauder’s creative director Tom Pecheaux for Derek Lam’s Spring/Summer 2014 fashion show held late last year. I don’t personally follow fashion myself so I have to admit I’m not too familiar with Derek Lam’s style although I had come across his name before this. His style does look quite simple and fuss free which makes them look wearable. Not like those haute couture creations that look best on a runway only. What I found fascinating in this small collection that comes housed in a deep navy blue satin miniaudiere is that they are all stick products! The hard satin miniaudiere houses 5 products for eyes and lips that were created specifically only for this collection The Kajal Crayon in Near Night – a deep navy blue The LipColor in Smoked Blush – a wearable brown-pink The Mascara in Black Black – self explanatory The Eyeshadow in Smoked Gold – a liquid cream eyeshadow in an old gold The Gloss in Barely Gold – a clear gloss with golden shimmer All the items sit comfortably in a pouch in the miniaudiere, held with a hidden elastic band. I found it interesting that cream and liquid textures were predominant in this collection. It made sense (it’s easy to store and carry) and the idea behind it was because it would be at once subtle yet buildable in texture and intensity. So, if you wanted, you could wear this from day to night and I’ll show you just quickly what it’d look like used in a subtle way built up for a bolder look ? These are the contents of the pouch, all in portable travel sizes. Barring The Kajal Crayon which is a fat soft, kajal eye pencil that you can use both as a liner or as a shadow base, the rest of the items are liquid/cream. L-R: The Eyeshadow in Smoked Gold, The Kajal Crayon in Near Night, The Mascara in Black Black, The LipColor in Smoked Blush and The Gloss in Barely Gold I found that the colours were intense yet you can quite easily sheer them out if you prefer something more subtle and light. The Eyeshadow in Smoked Gold is on my skin, a barely there sheen of gold if I just apply a little product, but I can build it up if I like for a stronger golden hue. The Kajal Crayon in Near Night looks like a deep black in the pencil so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it swatched a deep navy blue. When used as a liner, it is a little less harsh than a pure black, yet deep enough. The texture is soft and it applies very pigmented. The above swatch is just 1 swipe down my skin. However, like most kajal pencils the soft texture is also its downfall as on oily lids, it may travel or smudge. If you use an eyelid primer, it will hold better. You can also use it as a base, applying it thickly and then smudging it out for a smokey eye look. For a subtle look, just use it to tightline or draw a line close to your lashes. Once it sets, it doesn’t move much for me but be warned if you have oily lids (which I don’t have and thus can’t tell you how it fares) The Mascara in Black Black is black, but I wasn’t too impressed with it because it didn’t do much for my lashes. Since it’s in there, you’d use it, but it’s not something to write home (or on a blog) about. My favourite item in the collection is The LipColor in Smoked Blush which is a beautiful neutral shade for the lips. This is a liquid lipstick that is lovely and pigmented without being sticky and tacky. It’s a colour that I dare say will suit most, flattering your complexion if you choose to go for a subtle eye, yet not looking too overdone if you go for a bolder eye look. Absolutely beautiful, and the only thing I’m not crazy about is the slight vanilla scent. I’m not a gloss girl so The Gloss in Barely Gold barely holds my interest ? It’s a clear gloss with golden shimmer that you can layer over the lip colour if you want to add more shine and bling, but for some reason, it doesn’t quite do it for me. It isn’t sticky which is a boon, but it also isn’t something I’d write home about. I do find that the longevity of the eye colour depends on your lids (oily or not) and whether you use an eyelid primer. When I do, they last well. When I don’t (I don’t have oily lids) and in our heat, it doesn’t hold up as well. A fact true in most cream/liquid based products. I did these looks quite quickly just for an idea on how you might use the items in this collection. On left is a subtle eye look. I applied a thin wash of The Eyeshadow over my lid and drew a line with The Kajal Crayon close to my lashes and did a bit of tightlining and applied mascara. I have hooded eyes so it doesn’t quite look like much. In real life, it looks a little more accentuated. On right, I went for a slightly bolder look. Applied The Kajal Crayon thickly on my upper lid, smudged out the edges, and applied The Eyeshadow over and blended it. For some reason when the eyeshadow meets the liner, it takes on a greenish hue that is quite interesting, transforming the colour to a smokier hue. I also lined the lower lid and drew a golden line underneath. To get an idea of how it looks in an overall look, here’s how I did it. Left: Subtle Eye Right: Bold Eye Cheeks: Clinique Plum Pop blush On the look on the left I applied The LipColor alone. It is a neutral but bold shade and I love the colour! It isn’t matte, but very flattering. In the look on the right, I dabbed on some gloss over and you can see the glossiness and shine it adds to the lip. Whilst I don’t think this collection will sit well with many who may be wondering how to work with the different products, I do think it an interesting one for the flattering choices of colour and presentation. I also think it very easy to work with and allows for a seamless day to night makeup tranformation that’s very useful ? In a nutshell The Estee Lauder Derek Lam Collection is a limited edition offering of 5 eye and lip products housed in a hard satin covered miniaudiere clutch. The products are all cream/liquid products that are surprisingly easy to use and flattering on most skintones. I managed to transition this quite easily from a day to night look by just playing around with the layering of the products. Description of colours and textures are as above and my personal favourite is The LipColor in Smoked Blush, a lovely neutral lip colour I feel is flattering on most women. The miniaudiere is quite a handy size and elegant with the signature Derek Lam barbell design on the clasp. Ultimately I think this not only a collectible collection, but one that you could easily use. I do recommend the use of an eyelid primer with the eye products if you have oily lids because I found that the Kajal Crayon can travel a little especially if you have oily lids or in our tropical heat, as it takes a while to set. Once set, it’s fine and doesn’t move. Pros: Pretty miniaudiere, Colours are flattering to most skintones, Easy to use textures that can be built up for intensity if preferred, Portable sizes and handy to use Cons: Kajal Crayon is very soft and may travel so an eyelid primer helps it stay in place for those with oily lids, Mascara didn’t do very much for my short spare lashes Who will like this: Fans of Derek Lam designs, Anyone who is eyeing a collection that is a little different from all the other beauty collections out there If you’re wondering, the miniaudiere is actually a pretty handy size. It is covered with navy blue satin with gold hardware that sets off beautifully against each other. If you aren’t using a phablet like I am, then it should quite easily fit most mobile phones. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 doesn’t fit (naturally, it’s a monster!) but I dare say it should fit the popular iPhone with room for The LipColor for touch ups if necessary. On one side is a satin band which easily holds a credit card and a little cash. It’s a miniaudiere after all, and meant to be compact and hold the essentials, not the kitchen sink ? A little attention to detail worth mentioning is the Derek Lam name engraved on the gold hardware of the barbell clasp. Apparently this is a signature design of Derek Lam’s and I thought this to be a nice little touch, and a clear nod of approval by the fashion designer for this Estee Lauder collection. Did you notice this Estee Lauder Derek Lam collection? Are you familiar with Derek Lam’s designs? I believe the collection has been out for about a week by now but I haven’t noticed a lot of buzz about it which I thought strange. The only other review I’ve come across is by Mag of Makeupstash . It is quite a lovely one and in comparison to other limited edition items or collections I’ve seen, not even as expensive as some others out there. If you haven’t already, ask to take a look the next time you stroll past an Estee Lauder counter and let me know what you think ?

A phrase as true to anything in life as it is in makeup, for if I had judged the new (and unfortunately, limited edition) NARS Dolomites eyeshadow duo by how it looked, I’d be the first to pass it over. Mistake! Don’t. If you pass this over, you might miss out on one of the most versatile neutral eyeshadow colours in a handy small compact, that I’ve come across in recent times. I know it sounds like so much hoopla, but I was pleasantly surprised by how Dolomites performed and it happily also, sports a better texture than regular NARS eyeshadows. I don’t know if you feel the way I do about NARS eyeshadows, but I always feel them to be a bit of a hit or miss, if you’re buying them sight unseen. I was a little put off by them before (packaging aside) because I felt the texture was a little dry. Sure, they’re pigmented but they take a bit of work and I found it too much work. But I have also noticed that in recent times, NARS has stepped up their game for certain colours, a change I noticed with Kauai and now, Dolomites. The texture of the eyeshadow in Dolomites is more creamy, more pigmented, and adheres to skin better. Let me try and show you in the swatches below ? Knowing NARS’ penchant for naming their eyeshadow duos after places, it probably comes as no surprise that the Dolomites is the name of a place – a mountain range to be precise, in Italy. I’m making the tenuous connection here and it’s not the official story, but hey, we can make up our own stories right? ? Dolomite (sans S) is a type of rock. NARS Dolomites however, is an eyeshadow duo in an interesting colour combination. NARS Dolomites Eyeshadow Duo The right half, described as ‘Chocolate’ is a matte-satin cool brown with slight red undertones, and the left half, described as ‘Shiny Rose Quartz’ is a metallic rose pink shade with slightly warm undertones. This, I’d freely admit, is a colour combination I usually shy away from. I’ve only in recent times made my peace with brown eyeshadows, being very careful to stay away from anything that had red undertones, because they have a tendency to make my eyes look tired and pink? I still haven’t made my peace with that yet. Yet, for some reason, the combination works for me. Both colours swatch effortlessly with fingers and the shiny side is metallic without fall out nor glitter. It is just smooth shine. The chocolate side which I thought to be matte isn’t. There is a slight sheen to it which prevents it from looking flat. Both colours are easy to pick up with a brush and to blend, and both are incredibly pigmented on skin. The ease of blending and picking up with a brush means application is super easy. I apply the chocolate colour as a base, tap on some of the shiny side and then blend it out. On work days, you don’t want too much shine around the eyes, so blend and buff it out, and the metallic shine is reduced, leaving an iridescent shine on lid. If you want it to look more shiny, pat on more product and don’t blend so much. The nice part is that you can even wear both colours separately if you like. Just dab on colour, blend it out, line and apply mascara (if you do) and go. I must admit being pleasantly surprised by the versatility, practicality and just general usefulness of this duo. I used to be all about colour, but am in recent times, more partial towards neutral eye shades and this duo works when you don’t want to carry a full palette with you. Pull out a little to see how this works in a full face shot, and this is how it looks. It looks a little more smokey than in the closeup, and you can lighten it or deepen it as you like. I thought this to be quite a Fall/Autumn appropriate look when paired with a berry-plum lip ( Clinique Chubby Stick Intense in Grandest Grape ). If I wanted it to look lighter, I’d use the shiny side as a base shade and the chocolate to shade and then pair it with a lighter pink lip. That’s pretty as well. I’ll say this again – Dolomites is a very practical and compact neutral eyeshadow duo and never judge a book by its cover! IN A NUTSHELL The NARS Dolomites eyeshadow duo is a limited edition shade for Fall 2014 but it would have been great if it had been made permanent, because it should be. This is a lovely, practical and compact eyeshadow duo that you can quite easily tote about, takes up little space, and can be used for a variety of looks from the simple to the smokey. The shades do look a little warm in pan, but on skin, don’t bring out the red tones, which I appreciate because that can make you look tired. I like using it on its own, with a dark eyeliner and some quick blending, you’re ready to go. Pros: Creamy texture, Pigmented, Not too metallic, No fall out, Adheres well to skin, Easy to blend, Easy colours to use for almost anyone Cons: Limited Edition, Rubberized packaging is potentially a sticky problem Who will like this: Anyone who likes neutral eyeshadow, Anyone who wants a very compact neutral eyeshadow combination that can be used for a variety of looks As much as I’d like to tell you that it’s a must have, I won’t. It is potentially dupeable and if you have a large variety of neutral eyeshadows in your stash, I’m quite sure you’d find a way to dupe this, or at least a close enough match. But for those who can’t, or who just want to own one of the better quality NARS eyeshadow duos (yes, quality does differ so I’m not going to tell you that ALL Nars eyeshadows are wonderful – some suck! I’m looking at you Cleo and Lost Coast ) then don’t miss out on Dolomites. Yes, it’s worth it. I’ve put it as a permanent rotation in my stash! ? Did you check out Dolomites or anything from the NARS Fall 2014 collection? Are you a NARS Eyeshadow fan? I started out on the wrong footing. One of my first eyeshadow duos was Cleo which really sucked. Hated the texture and colour. Then, I got Mediteranee (don’t ask me why – look up the colour online and then tell me I was nuts) and then I gave up. Kauai and Dolomites have slowly dragged me back to the fold so I’m more willing to experiment now. How about you? ?

On the one hand, here is a product touting to make me look up to 10 years younger in 40 seconds and yet, my innate sense of of scepticism rears its ugly head with that raised eyebrow going “Really?!” I know, 10 years. That’s a heck lot of time to turn back (although personally, I’m not one for turning back time unless it’s to undo mistakes and boy, are there some I’d like to undo!) The product is Nanoblur by Indeed Labs, the people who brought us Hydraluron . What this is, is a product that purports to be based on optics technology and it’s not sold as a makeup, so it’s NOT a primer. I know, then what is it? Well, it’s a product that you apply on skin to correct the appearance of skin aging, lines, wrinkles, pores and it does this all within seconds. 40 seconds to be exact. Sounds like a primer? Yeah, I thought so too. I’ve held on to this for over 2 months now, trying to get my head around it, but I’m afraid to say, quite failing to see how it fits into my routine. The thing is this. It works as it claims – to a degree. If you have problems with lines or wrinkles and you want to just lessen the appearance of them then Nanoblur does the job. When you apply it on the lines, it almost magically blurs and looks significantly softer and less visible. Let me show you using the lines on the back of my hand. I tested this on the back of my wrist where you can quite clearly see the lines with nothing applied on the skin. A dab of Nanoblur applied, give it a few seconds, and can you see the lightened effect? Fine lines are smoothened while deeper lines are lightened. It’s pretty impressive, and if you can imagine this on your face, yes, it does lift the years off. But for enlarged pores, I didn’t find it as effective and as my face has less of a problem with lines than it does with pores, here is how it looks. I tested this on bare skin not over makeup, which I’ll talk about in a bit. (1) Bare skin, some enlarged bores and shine on cheeks (2) Nanoblur applied on cheek area mattifies the skin a little and pores doesn’t look as noticeable but are still there (3) Pressed powder applied over Nanoblur When you use liquid foundation, Nanoblur says you should apply it OVER your liquid foundation where you need it. So don’t apply it all over your face unless you want to but you can tap it in on areas where you need it or see lines. This is important to note because if you wear it UNDER liquid foundation, it sucks. Boy, does it suck! I tried it and bleh! Wanted to scrub off my makeup immediately. When wearing powder foundation you can apply Nanoblur first and then apply powder foundation on top. This is especially if you notice that powder foundation settles into lines on your skin. Nanoblur gives you that base you need so it doesn’t. When I do use Nanoblur, I use it on bare skin, and then apply some pressed powder (I use the RMK Pressed Powder N ) over. The powder is translucent but it evens out my skintone well, as you can see above. It goes without saying therefore that if I do use it, I use this only on weekends when I don’t really want to put a base on, but want to just have better looking, more evened out skin. But I’m not a fan of Nanoblur. For me, it’s an additional step and an additional product that I don’t particularly see much use for. I might change my mind in about 5-10 years when the lines kick in but for now, I’m not sold on it. I personally think it benefits those who do have a problem with lines – laugh lines, crows feet, forehead lines – and want something that can soften the appearance of those lines visually. But if it’s not something that bugs you then this isn’t something you’d need. IN A NUTSHELL Nanoblur is a product that visually reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles on skin very quickly so skin looks fresher and younger. It works over or under makeup depending on the type of makeup you use, and it does work as it says on the tin for lines. Lines are almost immediately softened and in the case of fine lines, almost seem to disappear. It also reduces the appearance of enlarged pores, but not as impressively as it does lines. I think it’s a good product for anyone who fits their target market, but it isn’t one for me. I’m kind of lazy and kind of unfussed about having lines or imperfections ? Pros: Affordable, Softens fine lines and wrinkles almost immediately as it claims, A little goes a long way Cons: A bit of a learning curve (pat it on skin, don’t spread) Who will like this: Anyone who wants to soften the appearance of lines and wrinkles on skin with or without wearing makeup Here is the ingredient list for Nanoblur which as you can expect contains silicones so if you are sensitive to silicone, please stay far away! Have you tried Nanoblur and did you like it? I think it’s great it exists, because I can imagine that it fills a niche that not many brands have thought to explore, since this is marketed not as makeup but as skincare. Tine and Shashay like it, for example. But for me personally, I’m not sold. I guess I’m just lazy ?

Much of the hype has rolled out of the UK with skincare guru Caroline Hirons leading the charge, placing this product in her hall of fame and creating some sort of worldwide frenzy for it. I was curious about it, although I was also using a similar product under a different brand at the time. I didn’t even know Hydraluron was available here in Malaysia! That just tells you how unassuming it is and how little publicity it gets. Tsk! I picked this up one day when I happened to be in Sunway Pyramid, on which day I swear, there was a blue moon in the sky. Hydraluron hails from Canada under Indeed Laboratories and in Malaysia is found in just 1 store – Muse by Watson’s – in Sunway Pyramid. It is obscure and frustrating. It needs to be more widely sold so a) I can get hold of it if I need to replenish (I never go to Sunway) and b) more people can try it because it’s fab! Well, I say fab, because it is, but only because the other product which I think is more fab isn’t available here, and will cost you more. So for all intents and purposes, this is a fab little product that looks unassuming, gives skin that ol’ boost it needs to plump up moisture and just makes skin look and feel better all around. Say it with me – FAB! ? As the name implies, Hydraluron is a Moisture Booster which contains our old friend hyaluronic acid in high quantities. What this also means is that if you have a known allergy or reaction to hyaluronic acid then this is not for you, no matter how much you want to try it. Some people have reported breaking out from products with too much hyaluronic acid which tells you that you can have too much of a good thing. The product comes in a small little unassuming tube in a large box. The packaging is pretty unassuming and I might even say clinical. It is one of those things that you will likely miss when scanning the shelves, because it just isn’t very impressive to look at. But do look again. I promise you, it’s worth your time. The product itself is a clear gel-liquid or is it a liquid-gel? Either way, it’s clear and has a slightly runny gel consistency, which makes it very easy to spread. Hyaluronic acid, if we didn’t already know, is the latest “star ingredient” for trapping moisture in skin and attracting moisture, so it keeps the top layer of your skin plump and hydrated and this translates to better looking, clearer skin. I had realised that keeping my skin well hydrated is a key factor in keeping breakouts and dull skin at bay. It even helps scars and marks heal and fade more quickly as my skin heals more efficiently. However, I have to point out that Hydraluron is a serum NOT a moisturiser . Do not ask if you can just use this product in place of a moisturiser. You cannot. The way it works is to attract moisture and if you don’t apply any moisturiser over this, what is it supposed to attract then? Nothing, I’d warrant. So treat this as you will a serum. Apply it after cleansing and toning and before other serums, oils or moisturiser. Basically, think of it as a magnet. You want it on your skin to attract moisture from whatever else goes on top of it. I am sometimes perverse and apply it over other serums and it’s fine because I seal everything with oil and/or moisturiser anyway. If you aren’t as experimental as I am, stick to the Cleanse -> Tone -> Hydraluron -> Serum -> Moisturiser routine and you’ll be ok. I was using this twice a day when I first bought it. Morning and night. But then I created too many skincare steps in the night, so I now use it primarily in the day when I feel my skin gets dehydrated more quickly from the sun, heat and air-conditioning. I cannot attest to my skin looking or feeling even better because as I said, I already use a similar hydrating serum in the day (Dr. Lewinn’s S8 Super Hydrator if anyone’s wondering. I am supposed to review it. I have 2 bottles on standby. That’s how much faith I have in it!) but my skin didn’t get any worse. It helps keep my skin plumped up and hydrated in the day and you know what that means right? Makeup goes on more easily and looks so much better. If you have oily skin try this anyway because I’ve found that well hydrated skin can actually balance out your skin oils and help you have less oily skin. Besides, oily skin can also be dehydrated below the surface. If you have dry or dehydrated skin then this is what you need for boosting moisture in your skin. Give it a month of at least once a day use and you WILL notice the difference. I’ve all but turned my skin around in the last 6 months, thanks to a daily routine of hydration and exfoliating and anti-aging and my skin is looking far better today than it ever did 5 years ago. Some day, I’ll find the time and words to talk about it without gushing over myself LOL! ? To use, just squeeze out a dollop of product – what you see in my picture above is about right. Spread it over your face. I find that it will feel a little tacky before it dries and settles. I don’t wait for it to dry to continue with my routine and neither should you. In a nutshell If you can get your hands on this, give this a go. Anyone can benefit from it, not just those with problematic skin. What Hydraluron does is boost your moisture with high hyaluronic acid content in a no fuss clear gel. It will help your skin look better, stay more hydrated, and that means fewer breakouts, less lines, faster healing time and better skin. On the other hand, if you can get Dr. Lewinn’s S8 Super Hydrator and can afford it, I prefer that one which serves primarily the same functions. Irrational or not, I like that one better, but if you can’t get it, then Hydraluron will do the job. Pros: Lightweight gel absorbs quickly into skin, Boosts moisture with high hyaluronic acid ingredients, Helps skin look and feel better and more hydrated, Affordable Cons: Hard to find in some parts of the world, May break out anyone who is sensitive to hyaluronic acid Who will like this: Anyone with dehydrated skin, Anyone who feels their skin needs that boost of moisture Here is the Hydraluron ingredient list. Have you tried Hydraluron and are you a fan? I have to say that it’s nice and although I didn’t notice too much of a difference to my skin because as I said, I already use a similar product, it does the job at a slightly smaller pricetag. My friend Juan is quite impressed as well and she has oily skin. It’s simple and effective and you know, when it comes to skincare that’s all that matters! Now, if only it was more easily accessible because I hate travelling cross state to get one bloody serum ?

I received a very unexpected gift recently and nestled in its contents was the Bobbi Brown Nude Glow Shimmer Brick . Now, if you’re as familiar with the famed Bobbi Brown Shimmer Bricks as I am, then you would likely recoil a little. I did. I used to own so many Shimmer Bricks from the popular Bronze and Beige all the way to the limited edition Brownie and Apricot Shimmer Bricks. I’m not even sure why because all they did was make me look like I fell face first into a vat of glitter and oil. Sure, I thought I was all glam back then. Folly of youth eh? ? Eventually, I gave or swapped away most of them and promptly forgot about them. So, when I saw the Nude Glow Shimmer Brick, I had a bit of a flashback to my glitter faced days. Did I dare try it again? Well, I’ll spare you the suspense. I’m glad I did, because this has quickly become a fave ? I found the texture of the Nude Glow Shimmer Brick quite different from the regular ones. Instead of gradational coloured shimmery stripes, there were 4 squares of finely milled shimmer powders in the compact of a fair size. This is important because it means you can quite easily pick up only the colour you want with your cheek brush. With the regular stripes, it’s near impossible to. Bobbi Brown Nude Glow Shimmer Brick I admit I felt that ol’ flutter in my chest that comes with looking at a pretty compact powder. I’m quite a sucker for these LOL ? In the compact, you get 4 squares of a golden shimmer, bronze shimmer, champagne shimmer and plum shimmer. They don’t look too glittery, which set my heart at ease almost immediately. However, as the name implies, this is about shimmer. If you aren’t into using highlighting powders or blushes with shimmer in them, then this isn’t for you. Also, because this has shimmer, limit it’s use to only just highlighting because you do not want to use this all over. I’ll show you how they swatch, before I tell you a little more about them. Bobbi Brown Nude Glow Shimmer Brick swatches – individual and blended I swatched them in a clockwise motion with my fingers and each colour was swatched just once. So the first thing to notice is that they are pretty pigmented! The first 4 colours from the left are the individual colours swatched. If you’re thinking they make pretty eyeshadows, you’d be right. You can quite easily wear them as eyeshadow. Just be sure to add a deep shade or dark liner to tie them in and they’re great. The 5th colour from left is all 4 colours blended together, which gets you a plummy, golden-bronze sort of colour. If you have fair skin, I caution using a light hand because this is pretty pigmented and the colour can go on looking too dark and too bronzed. I personally find that the depth of the colour is caused by the plum shimmer in the lower left corner, and it risks looking muddy on my skin if I’m careless and use too much. If you have a deeper skintone then it will help you add depth of colour and look really fab. For myself, I like using just 3 shades blended together which is the swatch on the far right. I get a neutral golden tone that is surprisingly flattering when topped up over a pink or coral blush. It adds height and dimension to cheekbones and just makes my skin look smooth and glowy. The million dollar question of course, is whether it’ll emphasize pores, the way the regular Shimmer Bricks do. I say yes and no. Yes, if you use too much or have significantly large pores. No, if you use a light hand, adding just a touch of glow to the skin. If you peer in closely, then pores will look more visible. If you view from a normal distance (few of us have our faces mere inches from each other, and if you do have your faces mere inches from each other, you will scarcely notice things like pores anyway :P) then I find the glowy shimmer actually helps bounce light and makes my skin look even better. BUT it is important to use a light hand. I can’t stress that enough. I use my regular blush brush which works wonderfully to add product and buff, or I also sometimes use the Tom Ford Bronzer Brush which has a dense head but buffs product out well and doesn’t deposit too much colour. I would use a brush with a smaller head, not a large fluffy brush because you do need to place your product properly with this one. This is what it looks like when I swirl my brush over all 4 colours and apply to cheeks. It looks a bit bronzey doesn’t it? I had to blend this out a lot and had to wear more than usual for it to show up in photographs. On normal times, I just gently swipe across the colours, tap off on a piece of tissue or on the back of my hand, and only then apply to my cheeks to avoid a shimmer explosion and too deep colour. Do I like it? Yes I do. The quality is far better than the regular Shimmer Bricks and I wear this on its own or with a pink or coral blush as I did in this look and this one . It brings a glow to the skin that I find flattering, and it lasts. One of my favourite gifts to date because it pushed me out of my comfort zone and made it easy for me! In a nutshell The limited edition Nude Glow Shimmer Brick has a quality that far exceeds the regular striped Shimmer Bricks from Bobbi Brown. The quality of the powders are fine milled and the colour is pigmented. Use separately as eyeshadows or highlighters or blend together for a lovely glow to the skin. I like to wear it on its own or on the cheekbones with a bright blush for a pop of colour. What I like most of all is that it doesn’t look glittery nor too shimmery nor oily. I often wear it on its own on casual days where it gives me that barely there glow. Perfect. Pros: Pigmented colour, Not overly glittery or shimmery, Fine milled powder and shimmer gives skin a lovely glow, Does not emphasize pores too much unless used with a heavy hand, Long lasting Cons: Limited Edition, Can be easy to overdo if not careful – blending and a light hand is key, May emphasize pores Who will like this: Anyone familiar with the concept of highlighting, Anyone who wants tinted natural glow to the skin Guerlain Crazy Terracotta or Bobbi Brown Nude Glow Shimmer Brick? I know what some of you may be wondering at this point (Isn’t it interesting how I profess to read all your minds?! ? ) How does this Nude Glow Shimmer Brick compare to the Guerlain Crazy Terracotta Healthy Glow Powder and if you could only get one, which should you get? Ok, maybe you weren’t thinking of that, but I’ll tell you anyway ? If you want just face colour without too much shimmer, then Guerlain’s your best bet. It’s gorgeous and you can’t go wrong with it. However, if you are comfortable with having some shimmer and want a more multitasking compact, then this Nude Glow Shimmer Brick maybe what you’re looking for. The colours can be used individually for skin or as eyeshadow and you can use it as a blush or just highlight. I personally find it very flattering when I want to have that effortless “no-makeup” look because it just makes me look like I have great skin. So what I did last weekend was just dab on some concealer, apply Meteorites all over and then apply some Nude Glow on cheeks with a light hand. Took me 2 minutes and I looked fab *preen* ? Fools me! ? Have you seen the Nude Glow Shimmer Brick? Have you used any Bobbi Brown Shimmer Bricks? I used to be such a collector of Shimmer Bricks, I shame myself ? I say collector, because I barely used any of them at the end of the day. I didn’t have very good skin back then either so I don’t know what possessed me to think I could pull off shimmer/glitter over oily, spotty and pore-y skin. But there you go. If you never try, you’d never know LOL! I’m glad with age comes wisdom (and better skin to wear a better quality product) ?

Yet, so often, lightweight is equated with sheer doesn’t it? Well, this one isn’t, and it’s one of my favourite new foundations (I’m working on a new compilation after my Top 8 fave foundations – Next 8 favourite maybe?) with 2 caveats. This new foundation is the Laura Mercier Smooth Finish Flawless Fluide Foundation , which is such a mouthful I just call it the Fluide foundation. It was released early in 2015 and from online reports, seems very well received, and rightly so I feel ? First off, the packaging is sleek and compact. If you ever want a foundation that you can take travelling with you or slip it into a slim makeup pouch, this would be it. The formula calls for you to shake it up, and I highly recommend you get some elbow action into it. If you don’t, the formula doesn’t mix up properly and the product that squeezes out is thin and uninspiring. Shake it up well, and it squeezes out like a lotion. Here’s the first caveat. After you shake it up, turn it over and tap the top of the tube (screw cover facing up) firmly against your dresser top. If you don’t do this, the minute you twist off the cover, the product will explode all over you and create an unholy mess. Believe me on this one because it happened when I forgot. So, this tip was taught to us by Laura Mercier Global Makeup Artist Benjamin Ruiz when he introduced this to us. After shaking it up, turn it over and tap the top firmly against a hard surface. This will resettle the product and nothing will explode. But, even then, you will have a problem with the nozzle getting dirty. Not a problem if you clean it up after use. But once you’ve had the product explode once, it does leave quite a messy residue. I find that the product has a light, slightly creamy texture and a little product goes a long way because the coverage is fairly high. I’d peg it at medium coverage so if you like product with a lot of coverage, you may like this one. It’s a step down and more fluid than the Silk Creme foundation but has higher coverage than a lot of other foundations I regularly use. So I tend to use just quite little product and sheer it out. I wear Creme which is the lightest shade they have and it’s described as for very fair with neutral undertones. I have to say the shade is fairly neutral, that much I agree because the next shade up, Ivory, which I first tested had significant warm undertones. Here are some comparison swatches with other foundations I wear and own. In terms of texture, Laura Mercier’s Fluide foundation is liquid like Urban Decay’s Naked foundation but it has significantly more coverage. It is more liquid than the Silk Creme foundation which is heavier and more matte. Fluide Foundation is more liquid with a smoother finish. I also wear Diorskin Nude in 010 Ivory which has significant pink tones as you can see. But here’s my second caveat about this foundation. It’s not easy finding a shade match. There are many shades available and technically, it shouldn’t be hard, but I found it quite hard, because Ivory was a decent match, but oxidised and turned a whole shade darker and warmer on my skin. Creme is a better match, but it tends to be a tiny bit light. Over the day, it does even out, but on initial application, I do sometimes wonder if I have the right shade. I sometimes even things out with a dusting of a beige or slightly warmer powder to make it look better. Guerlain Meteorites in Beige is a good option for times like this. Here’s how it looks appoximately on me when I wear this foundation. On left is bare skin, redness, pigmentation and all. On right is after a layer of just the Fluide Foundation in Creme. The shade looks a touch light, you may agree but it’s to do with shifts in lighting as well since I don’t have constant lighting. In terms of coverage, you will agree that the coverage is pretty good. Pigmentation is almost covered up and redness and dark circles are neutralised. But remember, a little product goes a long way so I’d recommend using just a little to start, and build up from there. I like wearing this one when I feel like I want a little more coverage, or when I want something that lasts me all day and gives me nice, smooth looking skin. I do find that I have to allow it to settle for it to look better so it does look better as the day progresses. It holds up well in our hot and humid weather, and I think it photographs quite well too, except that for me, I find it reflects a bit of a white cast. I’m not sure if it’s to do with the shade. In person, you can’t quite tell, but when I take pictures, then I do notice the base. Still, I like this one despite its pitfalls. It’s comfortable, it hides a multitude of sins and you only need a bit of product each time so it’ll go a long way! IN A NUTSHELL The Laura Mercier Smooth Finish Flawless Fluide foundation is a lightweight medium-full coverage foundation. You have to shake it up properly to ensure that the product mixes up properly. Then, tap the top of the product firmly against a hard surface so the product settles BEFORE opening the cap. Else, it’ll explode all over you and that’s an awful experience. Trust me on this one. The product itself is lovely. Creamy, lightweight, and offers good coverage. Shade matching maybe a bit of a hassle for those who don’t have very warm skintone though. It lasts well and holds up well in heat and humidity. I enjoy using this, despite my complaints and I have been using it fairly often because you only need a little, as it goes a long way! PROS: Lightweight texture but medium to full coverage, Holds up well in heat and humidity without melting, Looks smooth on skin, Comfortable to wear CONS: Liable to explode if you don’t tap it to settle first, Must shake it up properly so the product mixes up well, I found shade matching for neutral-fair skintones a bit of a challenge WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes medium to full coverage foundations but wants a lightweight texture Here’s the ingredient list for anyone interested in what’s in this foundation. You do have to squint a little, but I wasn’t up to typing all that out ? Have you tried this I like this, I think it’s a great product because there aren’t many high coverage foundations that feel like nothing on skin. But I can also see how the messiness can get to people if you aren’t aware of the trick about tapping it to settle. So remember, shake, turn over, tap on surface. Only then open the cap and you’ll be in for quite a treat! ?

This last post doesn’t quite count LOL! But I am still buying and using my brushes, it’s just that the slow down in my posting schedule means my blog real estate is really quite precious space these days. So I’ve put off telling you about the makeup brushes I use… until now. You see, I can’t put this one off any longer. I realised that I just HAD to share with you how much I love this little brush, after I realised that I didn’t like when I wash it and then have to use something else while waiting for this to dry. So, this is back-up material, this is! I bought this last year during one of the Sephora 20% off storewide sales. I passed the Make Up For Ever counter and for some reason, paused to peep at their (then) new brushes on display. For some reason, this one caught my eye and with a 20% discount making it even more attractive, I bought it. It’s the 216 Medium Precision Eye Blender Brush and next to my MAC 239 , it’s my favourite eyeshadow brush that I own! It may even be yours too, if you have small eyelid space like me and want a brush that can help you with crease and accent colour ? Make Up For Ever’s new Artisan brushes released last year are all of synthetic hair. This will please those of you who don’t like natural hair brushes or can’t use them for whatever reason. The bristles are very lovely and soft against the skin, which is quite normal for synthetic brushes. I personally am not into synthetic hair makeup brushes, which is why I didn’t pay a lot of attention to the new Artisan brush range. I mean, I like my makeup brushes, but I like them of luxurious natural hair because I feel it’s easier to work with them and they pick up colour better. But this MUFE 216 brush totally changed my mind. The brush head is quite small as you can see in the picture. It is however, fairly dense but soft and fairly pliable. The wooden handle is long, which won’t be useful for those of you who have to get close to the mirror (I know how it feels for short-sighted gals! I feel you I really do!) It is also fairly light but well balanced. The dense brush head is what makes this brush so amazing for me. It picks up powder product very easily and the small size allows it to deposit the colour very precisely. The pliable bristles then allow this brush to blend the colour easily. I use this MUFE 216 brush to apply crease or contrast colour. I don’t have a defined crease, so it’s not that easy to create contrast in my eye looks. However, the day I got this small wonder, all problems ceased. The size of the head is just right to fit into the hollow of my lid to create a “crease” and to provide shading on the outer part of my lid. The dense head also allows me to use this brush to apply colour along the upper lash line. Not a defined line, but when I want a soft but defined contrast colour along the lash line, I use this. If I want a contrast crease shade, or a contrast shade on the outer lid, I use this brush. In fact, I use this brush everyday because it’s just so easy to use, blends colour so well and is basically fool-proof for me! IN A NUTSHELL The Make Up For Ever 216 Medium Precision Eye Blender brush makes a perfect blending tool for applying contrast colour to the crease for me. The size, density and pliability also makes this perfect for those who do not have a defined crease like me, or who don’t have a lot of eyelid space for applying colour. This brush deposits colour precisely and blends it out beautifully. I use this almost everyday and feel lost without it when I have it drying. I think I need another! PROS: Very soft synthetic bristles, Dense but pliable, Small size allows it to apply product precisely and is especially useful for applying crease colour CONS: Long handle may get in the way for those who like to get close to the mirror WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who has small eyelid space, Anyone who wants a brush that helps to make the application of a crease colour easier, Anyone who likes using synthetic brushes BRUSH HAIR: Synthetic I’m not sure why the ends of the new MUFE brushes are angled. I read somewhere that it was to allow the make up artists to use it to help with application of false lashes and to blend colour. I’m not sure how that latter works coz I’m no makeup artist. But I don’t really see the point otherwise. Point. Geddit? ? Have you tried any of the new Make Up For Ever Artisan brushes? Do you use a brush similar to this one? I had a similar brush from a different brand but with a larger head. It was how I first learned to apply colour in the crease but this brush makes it a lot easier due to its size. I’m waiting till Sephora has another 20% off storewide sale to pick up a back up ?

Like, REALLY into it. The last time I went to Australia, I returned with a suitcase full of candles and little else. They truly are my guilty pleasure. But often, good quality soy candles that don’t smell horribly chemical, don’t come cheap. If you want something high quality, especially when it involves scent, it usually comes at a price. Until now. Ladies and gents, let me introduce you to Sanctuary , an affordable local brand of soy candles that burn beautifully, smell amazing and importantly, does not make you feel like you’re burning money! ? I love it when I find a local brand that lives up to my ideals. There aren’t many, but the few I’ve come across are gems. I discovered these candles one day while I was browing a handicraft bazaar. I don’t usually visit these bazaars (my taste doesn’t quite run in that direction) but I came across this one (I can’t remember which anymore) and as I walked past, there was a lovely soothing scent in the air. So, like a sniffer dog, there I was, standing in the middle of the bazaar, sniffing the air, trying to get a lock on the stall where it originated from. That was when I came across the Sanctuary candles . They are made locally by a local artist, Jasmine Gan, who happened to be manning the stall when I was there. We got to chatting about candles and scents and she was lovely and not pushy at all, and informative. She was quite happy to walk me through her Sanctuary candles selection, and talk me through her brand and her love for scent. I enjoyed our little chat, and I loved how her candles smelled. There are a few different scent combinations that are sweet, refreshing or uplifting. Best of all, they were all soy candles and they didn’t cost me an arm and a leg! Each 6oz candle retails at RM45 and has a burn time of 30-35 hours. To give you an idea of how that translates, a large sized Diptyque candle that’s slightly larger at 6.5oz retails here at RM249. I could buy 6 Sanctuary Candles! During the bazaar, there was a promotion where they were selling for RM40 if you buy 2 and above, so naturally, I had to buy 2. Who am I to pass on a deal? ? I picked Green Tea & Lemongrass and Lime Basil & Mandarin . I personally highly recommend Green Tea & Lemongrass because it smells so refreshing. If you can imagine the fresh green scent of crushed green tea, tempered with the sharp, cleansing notes of lemongrass. This smells like a balinese spa in a jar! I love burning this in my living room, and the scent throw is very good, so within a few minutes of it being lit, I can smell it from every corner of my apartment. It makes the house smell refreshing and clean and relaxing, and truly turns it into a Sanctuary. What is even better is that after about an hour, blow out the flame and let the scent linger as the soy candle solidifies. I find that leaving the candle uncovered gives a lovely piquant scent to the air. Not strong, but a freshness that’s very relaxing. Another good thing about the Green Tea & Lemongrass candle is that it masks the smell of cooking. I cook fairly often so I find that burning this candle after I’m done refreshes the air and removes the stale scent of food. Lime Basil & Mandarin reminds me of a scent from Jo Malone. It has that fresh zest to it that is energizing and refreshing. I don’t burn it as often, but it is just as impressive as Green Tea & Lemongrass. This is especially so when you consider the price of RM45 each (just a little over US$10 per candle). It isn’t often I get anything of quality at that price point, so these candles are truly one to have. Being soy candles, I find that they melt quite quickly from the heat, but they burn very evenly. Jasmine also provides you with some tips for candle care, to ensure that you get the most out of your candle. So, if you want to get into candles, but aren’t into the strong artificial scents like those by Yankee Candles or Bath and Body Works (no offence if you like these, I don’t sorry!) get these from Sanctuary instead. You’re buying local, you get a good quality product, and you don’t have to sell a kidney for them. I’d say that’s worth it ? IN A NUTSHELL Sanctuary is a local (Malaysian) brand of handmade soy candles that come in various scent combinations. I found them by chance during a bazaar in the city. The scents I chose were refreshing and scented the air beautifully. The candle throw was good, and I find that it scents my living room very easily, unlike some other more expensive candles I own. The scents don’t smell artificial nor are they cloying. Being soy candles, they last longer, and they burn very evenly and well. I have absolutely no complaints! PROS: Soy candles that burn evenly and well, Lovely scent combinations to suit most tastes, Smells natural without being artificial and crass, Good throw of scent, Long lasting, Affordable CONS: Not easy to find although they are available online WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who loves a good quality soy candle PRICE: RM45 for 6oz jars (30-35 hour burn time) AVAILABILITY: Online at Jasmine Gan or at their selected stockists I see that there is a new range out now, Sanctuary Voyage, that costs more. Not having smelled them, I’m not sure if I’ll get them for now. Maybe if I stumble across their stall at a bazaar in future, I’ll check them out ? Have you come across these Sanctuary candles before? Do you know of other good local candle brands? I’m glad I came across these. They last a surprisingly long time and I’m not even halfway through my candles yet. Seriously, for this value, it can’t be beat! ? Paris B']"

I make no apologies as I’ve had my run ins with the brand and the (lack of) service and there is very little from the brand that I’m attracted to. Yet, there is one item I own from MAC that I do like using. Fortunately, it’s one item that I don’t have to go back and replenish so I can continue to avoid the stores LOL ? The one item I have from MAC that I really enjoy and use almost every day is the MAC #239 Eye Shader Brush . I picked this one up many years ago as one of my first “high end” makeup brushes because at the time, I was really into loose pigments and loose powder eyeshadow, and the advise I got then, for the best brush to use those products with, was this one. I bought it for about RM80 back then but it now retails for RM103 and from the very faded lettering on the handle, you can tell that I’ve had this for a very long time, and that it’s very well used! ? The MAC 239 Eye Shader Brush is a natural hair brush, with short, rounded bristles that are densely packed. The bristles are, I believe, white goat hair, and very soft on skin. I’ve had mine for so long (pre-blogging! That’s more than 7 years) that the constant use and washing has turned the bristles a shade of cream but I’m fine with it. I don’t have much of a problem getting it clean with just regular soap or baby shampoo and it cleans out quite easily. What I use this brush for is to lay down colour for eyeshadow. The density and firmness of the bristles allow you to really pack on colour on your lid if you use a dabbing motion, which makes this useful for product that is loose like pigments or colours that aren’t as intense as you like. This is the upside – that you can get vibrant colours to look vibrant, and to get lots of colour on your lid. The downside is that it can sometimes be easy to overdo if you aren’t careful. This is especially true if you’re working with dark colours. It always surprises me how intense dark colours look when I use this brush and this is one brush that works well with harder eyeshadow textures like those in the Narsissist eyeshadow palette . This is the reason why I didn’t hate the palette nor have a lot of problems getting colour to show. I just used a brush I knew would do the job, and it saved the day! ? This brush really does make life a lot easier. I use it mostly for lid colour and shading, using one side for colour and the other side for a dark colour to shade. If I want a less intense look, I swipe on colour instead of dabbing. In between washes, I just run it on a piece of tissue paper to clean it, since I use it almost daily, but it works fine. The short bristles mean however that it doesn’t blend out colour very well so you may need a blending brush to blend out the edges of colour. I usually use just 2 brushes everyday – this one to lay down colour and shade which I then blend together, and then I use the Sigma E25 or similar to apply highlight colour or a nude blending shade. I really like this brush and it’s one I’m happy to walk back into the MAC store to repurchase should it ever happen. But it’s been years and it’s still going strong so I (thankfully) do not have to make that trip any time soon! ? In a nutshell The MAC 239 Eye Shader brush is a natural bristle brush with white goat hair, that has short dense, firm bristles. It works very well to pack on colour on lid and to blend out using the edge of the brush. The bristles are soft against the skin and it works very well if you want intense colour or have to work with hard textured eyeshadows that you find hard to pick colour up and to apply on skin. I love this brush and I don’t like many (or any) things from MAC ? Brush Hair: Natural (white goat possibly) Pros: Soft against skin, Picks up colour very well, Packs on colour on lid with little trouble, Very good for hard textured eyeshadows Cons: None that I can see Who will like this: Anyone who wants to apply intense vibrant colour on lids, Anyone who likes using loose pigments or loose powder eyeshadows and want an intense effect, Anyone who wants an all in one brush MAC 239 Eye Shader Brush vs Hakuhodo J004G Eye Shadow Brush Front View – Left: Hakuhodo J004G Right: MAC 239 Eye Shader brush When I picked up some Hakuhodo brushes recently, I picked up one that I thought was similar to the MAC 239 on the basis that if it worked as well as the MAC 239 (It’s a wee bit cheaper) then I would have a winner or at least 2 brushes I could rotate. However, I found that they weren’t quite as similar as I first expected. The Hakuhodo has longer bristles so there is a little more give and flexibility and it blends better. It also means that it doesn’t deposit colour as well as the MAC one does. Side View – Left: Hakuhodo J004G Right: MAC 239 Eye Shader brush From the side, you can see that the Hakuhodo isn’t as thick nor as dense as the MAC brush. Don’t get me wrong, I like it. It’s just that I actually found myself preferring the MAC 239 all said and done. It’s rare that you’d see me say this, but I’ve said it. Get the MAC 239 and save yourself looking for dupes ? Do you own the MAC 239 Eye Shader brush? Do you like it as much as I do or do you know of similar ones? I love this one. It really changed the way I saw eyeshadow application and with it, I have little trouble getting most colours or product to show up on my lids. So, if I complain, you can bet you that the quality of the product must be really crap! LOL ? Paris B MAC 239 Eye Shader Brush Price: RM103 | US$25 Availability: MAC Cosmetics stores or online']"

Ugh I say, because they’re such luxurious treats that cause a serious dent to the wallet, and to the head of someone who you throw this at. I always say the Rouge G is like a weapon. When they called it a lipstick bullet, I didn’t think they meant it literally until the Rouge G came along LOL! ? I have quite a thing for the Guerlain Rouge G formula and while the regular heavy silver bullet is luxury personified, Guerlain shows off their playful side in their few limited edition Rouge G offerings. I have a few of them from previous collections so when I saw that there was a new one out, I was champing at the bit to get at it! As luck would have it, one of the limited edition beauties landed on my messy desk and with a squeal of delight, it was the one I was lusting after – Rouge G in Rose Grenat 864 . Guerlain has gone after all pink lovers’ hearts by making a limited edition bright pink case to house the limited edition Rose Grenat and a pale pink case to house its sibling Rose Glace (866) which is a light pink – a colour I wouldn’t wear. But let me tell you about Rose Grenat, because it’s flying off the shelves, despite the hefty pricetag and if you still don’t know what the fuss is about Rouge G lipsticks, you have to get Rose Grenat because it embodies everything that’s wonderful about these creamy lipsticks. I hesitate to say “must have” but if pockets allow, this is a must have… unless you have Provocative ? Let me show you what I mean. We should be familiar with the Guerlain Rouge G packaging by now, but if you aren’t, this is one of the heaviest lipsticks out there. I haven’t weighed it but trust me, when you’re carrying 3 of them in your makeup pouch at one go, you definitely feel the weight. Aside from the hot pink enamel cover, the packaging is pretty much the same as the regular Rouge G line. The lipstick fits with a magnetic click into the cover and when you pull it out, it pops open to reveal a very handy mirror. It’s saved me countless times from having to pull out a separate mirror for touch ups (that you don’t really need anyway!) The bright pink cover is a surprise departure. Previous limited edition designs had the body come in a black case or a cover with a design on it. This one’s different and while pink or hot pink isn’t a colour to get my blood rushing, the lipstick colour is. Rose Grenat 864 is a beautiful rose red with a slightly cool base. This colour is one I can quite safely say will flatter most skintones, light or dark, cool or warm. It has a wonderful mix of shades and tones that makes it so wearable. The texture is creamy as with all Rouge G lipsticks, it is opaque in one swipe and it feels and looks incredible on lips. I love the colour to bits, but I couldn’t help feeling that it looked rather familiar. It wasn’t until I did a side by side swatch test that I realised why I fell in love with Rose Grenat. It is almost a perfect dupe for the Limited Edition Provocative Rouge G that was released for Christmas 2013 ! Just look at the swatches above (just 1 swipe mind you!) and tell me I’m not seeing things. Madame Batifole (another fave – what am I saying, I love all the Rouge G colours I have!) is a much cooler and deeper fuchsia as compared to Rose Grenat and Provocative. The latter two are practically the same colour! So, if you already have Provocative then you won’t need Rose Grenat, unless you love pink and want the pink cover, or you are kicking yourself for not getting another Provocative Rouge G when it was available. Now you can get a colour that’s practically the same. I don’t quite mind having 2 of the same or similar shade because I love this colour. It’s a colour that really brightens the complexion and makes you look alive. The opacity and pigment is incredible, staying put for hours if that’s your thing and even lasting quite well through food and drink. Did I mention how incredible the Rouge G formula is? I have haven’t I? I’m raving aren’t I? ? Ok I’ll stop now. But for the sake of completeness, since I realise that few of us wear lipstick on our arms, here’s how it looks when I wear Rose Grenat. The colour is absolutely stunning, and I love bright shades like this because it means I can downplay the rest of my makeup! It’s far easier and quicker to slick on a bright lip as opposed to messing about with the eyes and getting it wrong (as I’ve been wont to do lately) so Rose Grenat has been quite a saviour for me in the mornings. So if budget permits, run, don’t walk to your nearest Guerlain counter and pick this one up ? In a nutshell I love Guerlain Rouge G lipsticks as is well documented on the blog whenever I come across it. The texture is creamy yet light, the opacity and colour pigment is incredible and the staying power is wonderful for a product so opaque. Rose Grenat is a limited edition colour for Spring 2014 and comes in a limited edition case with a hot pink cover. The colour is a beautiful rose-red-pink that I feel will flatter almost every skintone but it is incredibly similar to Provocative from Christmas 2013. So, if you have Provocative, you can pass on Rose Grenat. But if you missed out on Provocative or want a back up, then this is it. Love! Pros: Creamy texture yet light on lips, Opaque in 1 swipe, Strong pigment, Good lasting power on lips, Beautiful lip shade that will flatter most skintones, Mirror included in the cover is very useful, Beautiful packaging as befits the brand Cons: Pricey, Limited Edition Who will like this: Anyone who likes wearing creamy, opaque, pigmented lipstick I’ve slacked off checking out limited edition stuff this year. It’s just a turn I’m taking, preferring to go back to basics i.e. what works from each brand, which means permanent items. A lot of limited edition items just aren’t living up to standard, but with this lipstick, Guerlain has scored a winner! Did you check out Rose Grenat or Rose Glace with their limited edition pink covers? Do you have a favourite Rouge G colour? I love all the Rouge G lipsticks I have but I have to say that the bright shades and reds are among the best I’ve come across in a lipstick from any brand. A personal favourite is Garconne (25), a permanent colour and a bee-yoo-ti-ful red. If you’re ever in the market for a flattering red lipstick, check out Garconne.

I wouldn’t categorize my skin as being sensitive, but even skin like mine, used to being bombarded with various products, can’t tolerate Chanel skincare. That’s the primary reason you don’t read about Chanel skincare on my blog – I just can’t use them! I tried a long while ago, when I was venturing into more premium brands, and promptly found myself breaking out. I’m not sure what I attribute it to – alcohol or fragrance could well be the culprits. So, I’ve stayed away, with a yard long stick before me… until now. The only reason I agreed to trial the new La Solution 10 de Chanel Sensitive Skin Cream is because of its claims. The name is derived from the fact that this product, the first of what I believe will be a new range of skincare within Chanel’s stables, contains just 10 ingredients, took 4 years and 117 trials to get right, and is formulated with New York dematologist, Dr Amy Wechsler, with the express intention to soothe skin with the fewest possible ingredients. The reason behind having few ingredients is manifold. You know exactly what’s in there, it’s not very complex, and there is less potential for it to irritate the skin. But Chanel went one step further. They removed many known skin irritants – fragrance, mineral oil, parabens – and made this not only soothing, but also protective of skin. I had to see if this was something of a breakthrough product! ? And you know what? I never realised how much my skin appreciated a calming, soothing cream like this one until I tried this! ? Ok, let’s backtrack a little. As I don’t categorize my skin as being highly sensitive (I don’t have the usual redness, flakiness, dry spots etc associated with sensitive skin) I sometimes do encounter a little sensitivity or reaction to things like acids or exfoliators. I wasn’t sure what to expect when I first embarked on using the La Solution 10 de Chanel cream. After all, wasn’t it just a moisturiser? But much to my surprise, it was a little more than that. I realised that when I don’t have makeup on, and while I’m using this cream, my skin would stay fairly even toned throughout the day. Sometimes, I get red patches around my cheeks in the afternoons, when it’s hot, but for some reason, every time I used this my skin remained calm and did not look blotchy. After a few weeks, I stopped, used another moisturiser, and noticed how my skin would turn towards the warmest times of the day. But with this, it didn’t. That’s when I realised what a difference a cream that soothes and calms the skin does. Another thing I noticed with prolonged use, was that my skin took on a more even texture. One of the key ingredients in the La Solution 10 de Chanel cream is Silver Needle Tea, which is a rare ingredient. From these delicate leaves, Chanel has extracted a concentrate that contains high antioxidants to protect skin from free radicals. This makes skin less reactive, and calmer. I hate to say this, but this has been quite an amazing experience for me using this cream. Not only does my skin love it, it actually seems to respond better, and FEELS better. It reminds me of the REN V-Cense Day Cream , which I love, but without the scent. The REN one targets a slightly different function, but it feels similar. The packaging is kept very simple, with Chanel’s iconic black and white packaging, with a nice heft and a good pump. The pump dispenses about the right amount of cream each time, which isn’t very much. For most people, I think 1 pump should be about right. I use 1.5 pumps, because I don’t find it moisturising enough for drier skin, and that irks me a little. What I do instead is use it in the day time, and use something heavier in the evenings because this one just doesn’t quite cut the mustard for me. At night, at the moment, I’m using the Tatcha Indigo Soothing Triple Recovery Cream and I swear that the combination has been WONDERFUL for my skin! I might have to start looking into using more skincare like these, because my skin seems to really enjoy it! ? I love that no fragrance has been added, so it has no scent, and the texture of the cream is soft and velvety, sinking into skin without any greasy after-feel. This is an oil-free formula, so if you have oily skin, you can use it too but you might feel more comfortable using a little less. In many ways, this is a very simple moisturiser, that doesn’t purport to hydrate or treat or do anything miraculous. It is a cream that I think most people with sensitive skin might enjoy using, simply because it’s so soothing on the skin, and the soothing effect is actually noticeable for me. The fly in the ointment is of course the price. This carries the Chanel name after all so it costs a pretty penny. But I’d suggest that you try to wrangle a sample from your local Chanel counter or boutique, just to see how you like it. If your budget permits, and your skin could do with a bit of soothing, then take a look at this one. My skin loves it, and I think yours might too! ? IN A NUTSHELL The La Solution 10 de Chanel Sensitive Skin Cream is a moisturiser targeted at people who have sensitive or reactive skin concerns. This would include redness, flakiness, easily irritated skin and tight, dry patches of skin. The cream feels a little creamy but absorbs quickly and very comfortably into the skin without leaving any greasy residue. With prolonged use, I find that my skin seems to calm down and not react through the day by not turning red or blotchy. I don’t have particularly sensitive skin myself, but I have noticed the soothing feel and when my skin feels tired or burdened, this calms it down. However, I feel that it isn’t moisturising enough for those with drier skin, so I use this in the day. It sits very well under makeup and does not turn my skin oily at all. Barring the price, I think this to be an excellent product and not something I expected from Chanel, but one I’m very happy they made! PROS: Lightweight cream texture absorbs easily and quickly into skin, No greasy after-feel, No mineral oil, parabens and fragrance, Short ingredient list, Calms and soothes skin and keeps it from getting irritated even by heat, Keeps skin feeling comfortable all day CONS: Pricey, May feel a little thick for those with oily skin, Not moisturising enough if you have dry or very dry skin WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone with reactive and sensitive skin PRICE: RM308 | US$80 | £58 for 30ml AVAILABILITY: Chanel counters and boutiques, Nordstrom , Chanel online If you’re interested, here’s the ingredient list for the La Solution 10 de Chanel cream. The 10 ingredients are helpfully also listed at the back of the bottle, although in descriptive form which makes it easier to understand. I don’t think that they are particularly earth-shattering or unique in any way, but it is impressive to see that a brand like Chanel who can live off their name by selling us anything, can actually cater for an emerging segment of the market yet untapped by many premium brands. I take my hat off to them for their far sightedness and I’d love if this sparks a bit of a revolution within the premium beauty industry to make better skincare, because once you can make something for sensitive skin types, you’ve practically nailed it! ? Is the La Solution 10 de Chanel cream something you’ve been interested to try? I was very excited when I first read about it, simply because it’s just not something I expected to come from Chanel. I was very fortunate to be able to try it, and I have to say that this is one of those products that I’ll be keeping on my ever-changing curated list of products to repurchase if budget permits. Do I know of an alternative? To be honest, no I don’t. I’m not very familiar with this segment of skincare products, but if you are and you think there’s an alternative out there that might be more budget friendly, do give a shout out. Personally, I like this one, and damn, it pains me (and my wallet) to say so! ? Paris B']"

The Dior Serum de Rouge was one of my favourite lipsticks ever, despite their hefty pricetag and rather boring colour selection. I had, and went through quite a few, which would have landed me in the poorhouse, but I loved it and Mom loved it. And then they only went and discontinued it. Sigh… So, when I spotted the Chanel Rouge Coco Stylo lipstick launching recently, my eyes gleamed. Oh hello there, balm-gloss-lipstick hybrids in a twist-up pen! ? Where have I seen you before? ? The Chanel Rouge Coco Stylo lipsticks are creamy lipsticks that are formulated to be very creamy and smooth and balmy on lips. I can attest to them feeling ever so comfortable, and moisturising, although there is one thing I wish they could have done better with. The scent. I’m not much of a fan of scents in lip products. My lips are too near to my nose, and scents in lip products tend to linger. While I’m not too surprised that these Chanel lipsticks are scented, I was hoping they wouldn’t be. After all, the new Rouge Coco Ultra Hydrating Lip Colour , which I also thoroughly enjoy using, are unscented. They should have kept it that way. The other downside is the texture. I find the texture very very soft. While, this makes it very creamy and imparts colour on your lips like a dream, it also makes the lipstick liable to smear and break off around the edges. Because this is a twist-up mechanism, you might be tempted to twist up a sizeable amount, before applying to your lips. I’d caution against that, because you will quite likely find the tip of the product breaking off, causing an unholy mess, and also find yourself putting too much product on your lips and then desperately trying to clean it off. Instead, I’d only suggest twisting it just once, to expose a tiny amount, and then apply it to your lips. The formula is beautiful. It is like smearing a liquid cream all over your lips, and I find the texture semi-opaque. What this means is that the colour in the tube might not look as intense on your lips (depending on how pigmented your lips are) but it allows you to wear deeper/brighter colours if you’re not brave enough to at the best of times. The creamy texture is glossy on your lips, and for me, not drying albeit it isn’t terribly moisturising either. But I find it very comfortable, although the formula means it doesn’t last as well as something that is a little drier. Still, it’s an excuse to actually swipe more colour on! ? As for the packaging, another reason to not twist up too much product is because you may not be able to retract it. I am able to, but that’s because I only twisted it up 2-3 times. If you twist it up more, I’m unable to say if it will retract, and if it doesn’t, that will be a messy (and expensive) mistake! I have 3 shades to show you, and I have a strong feeling I might be picking up one or two more of the brighter shades, because I think the formula is absolutely lovely! The 3 shades of the Rouge Coco Stylo that I have are as follows:- 202 Conte – This looks like a light warm pink in tube, and is not one I’d pick for myself because it’s not a colour I’d use. When applied to my fairly pigmented lips, the colour isn’t too noticeable, and it gives a lovely glossy sheen, but as you can see, does not look exactly as it does in tube. If you want something pink, this isn’t one to pick, but if you want to wear a pink without it looking too pink, you might like this because I find the formula a little more sheer than the other 2 shades featured here. 218 Script – Again, this isn’t a colour I’d pick for myself. In tube, it is a brown that I usually shy away from. However, because of the semi-opacity of the texture, the brown allows the red in my lips to come through and tempers the dull colour. This too gives my lips a lovely sheen, and is a surprisingly wearable colour for me. 212 Recit – Regulars will know that if I were to pick a shade from the 3 available, this would be the one I’d pick. In the tube, Recit looks like a deep plummy red. However, on my lips, I found that it applied a deep red that I found very flattering! I wasn’t too excited about how it looked in the tube. This colour seemed the more pigmented and opaque of the 3 featured here, and it wasn’t as glossy as well, although the creamy formula and texture does make it a little harder to colour within the lines. For an idea of how it looks when I wear it in a full face of makeup, here are a couple of quick looks. The makeup is the same, I only changed the lip colours. You may notice that Conte gives my lips a hint of pink, but does not otherwise look very obvious on. On my arm, it looks much more pink, but then I don’t wear lipsticks on my arm. Script on my arm looks a straight brown, but on lips is far more flattering. Ditto Recit – less opaque on my arm than it looks on my lips but a lovely lip that brightens the look. I don’t personally consider these sheer as they are fairly pigmented when you swipe them on. However, different shades might appear differently on different lips and skin tones and that’s what makes the difference. These aren’t sheer, the way a lip balm is (they are not lip balms), but I’d say they’re semi-opaque and creamy. In general, I can safely say that I love these lipsticks. It’s like the Dior Serum de Rouge reincarnated in the House of Chanel, and that makes me happy! I’d be happier of course, if there was no scent, but you know, I’ll quit while I’m ahead ? IN A NUTSHELL The Chanel Rouge Coco Stylo lipsticks will please whoever used to love the discontinued Dior Serum de Rouge lipsticks. The formula is creamy, balmy, moisturising and semi-opaque with very safe, wearable shades available in the range. I do find that it feels a little soft, and if you twist up too much, it is liable to smear and be messy around the edges. They will transfer, although I find them fairly long-lasting. I don’t have a lot of complaints, mostly because I like formula like this, and because it feels so comfortable. What I didn’t like was the scent, but we can’t have it all, I guess! PROS: Moisturising, Creamy and semi-opaque in 1 swipe, Easy to use, Portable, Unexciting but wearable colours, Lightweight and comfortable on lips CONS: Twist up packaging may not retract, The soft formula is liable to mess up the packaging, Scented WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes creamy, moisturising lipsticks, Anyone who used to be a fan of the discontinued Dior Serum de Rouge PRICE: RM115 | US$37 – 8 colours available for now AVAILABILITY: Chanel counters, boutiques, Chanel Online , Nordstrom , Saks 5th Avenue Are these lipsticks something you’d like to check out? Have you tried them? There are only 8 shades available and I think I might like to check out Roman (pink-red), Histoire (coral-red) and Message (plum-red). But you know what? I might just want to check them ALL out – the formula is sublime! (and I don’t say that lightly!) ? Paris B']"

At the time, the shades available were only deep shades. I wore it a few times, but considered myself unimpressed. Then, I lost it and promptly forgot about it. I later acquired one more in Cocoa and was also a little on the fence about it. But early this year, Laura Mercier came out with light colours for the popular Caviar Stick Eyeshadows and suddenly, everything fell into place. I fortuitously found my Khaki one, and it is now one of my favourite eyeshadows. In fact, I’d like you to meet my favourite brand of stick/crayon cream eyeshadows now available in the market. There are different brands that have them, but these from Laura Mercier are simply the best in terms of colour, application, texture and longevity. I’m not sure why it took me so long to get to grips with it, but having done so, it’s what I use when I want a very quick and simple eye look whether for day or night, and I can be assured that it’d stick around for hours without budging or fading. The Caviar Stick Eyeshadow come in twist up pencil form in a slim, very portable packaging. The ends of the pencil indicate the colour in the tube, which makes it easy for you to identify the colour you want at a glance. Otherwise, the body is the signature Laura Mercier brown which can be confusing. The crayon is easily twisted up and down and if I’m to be honest, doesn’t look quite like much in the tube. I will warn you not to twist it up too far as it will then be liable to break off. So, just twist it up a few millimetres above the plastic rim, and that will be enough for you to swipe it on your eye. The key is not to use too much, because these Caviar Stick Eyeshadow thingies are seriously pigmented! Here are swatches with just 1 swipe of the crayon down my arm. From left to right: Cocoa, Sand Glow, Khaki Cocoa is a deep reddened brown that looks pretty much like cocoa. I don’t usually gravitate towards colours like these, but it was gifted to me and I have found that it can work, if I cool it down with a touch of Sand Glow. It is very rich and intense, and if you layer it on, you can create a very interesting brown smokey eye look. There is no discernible shimmer in this one and it dries a little matte. Sand Glow is shimmery golden beige neutral that works beautifully as an all over lid shade, brightening the eyes, or to draw on your lower lid, to make your eyes look bigger and brighter. I like using this one both ways and this has quickly become my to-go neutral eyeshadow. A slick of this on my lids, eyeliner and mascara and I’m done! Khaki was a colour I picked out. It isn’t a true khaki, if you ask me. The green tones are very subdued under the brown but I picked it because it is a very nice neutral shade. I wear this on my lid as a light smudge on light makeup days, and I’ve worn it heavy, as an evening eye. It works well both times. The best thing about these crayons is the staying power. Man! You have to be quick to blend, because once it sets, that’s it. It’s not budging till you take a makeup remover to it. Bioderma gets it off, but not without a bit of rubbing, so I prefer using a bi-phase eye makeup remover. To wear these, here’s how I do it:- When using a deep colour like Cocoa or Khaki, I draw a thick line close to my lashes, halfway up my lid. Using my finger, I smudge the edges of the colour to blend out the harsh edges, and I’m done! With the lighter Sand Glow, I colour in my lid and then use my finger to blend out the harsh edges I end up with eye makeup that looks something like this:- Note: Picture #1 should read Sand Glow – I’m not sure where Sunglow came from ? In all these looks, I tightline and line the lower lid part of the way with a black eyeliner pencil. For Sand Glow, I coloured in the lid and then blended out the edges with my fingers, and drew a line on my lower lie. It opens up the eyes and helps masks red rimmed eyes and makes you look more alert. I didn’t apply Cocoa or Khaki as intensely as I might for a more intense look. In both, I drew a thick line from the inner corner to the outer corner, close to my lashes and then part of the way up. Then, I blend the colour out to soften the colour, so what you see when I open my eyes is the lighter blended shade. If I wanted something more intense, I’d colour the whole lid, then blend out the further edges, so what you see when I open my eyes, is the full intensity of the crayon. You can apply it how you like – your imagination is the limit ? For an idea of what it might look when I zoom back out, here’s a look of me wearing Khaki. Khaki is a very work friendly colour, and my other favourite next to Sand Glow. I like using them both together for that POW! effect, because Khaki is a very pretty lid colour and Sand Glow, used to line the bottom lid perks up the complexion and makes you look awake almost instantly while defining the eyes. You can also use these as a base for powder eyeshadow, or as a liner. If you have a liner brush, you can use it to pick off the colour to draw in a thin line. The texture is creamy smooth, the formula is simply amazingly longlasting and the ease of use is second to none. These days, when I travel or if I want a very quick, fuss-free eye look, I just whip out Khaki and Sand Glow and I’m ready in half the time it takes me to open an eyeshadow palette. Gets me loads of compliments too! ? In a nutshell Laura Mercier’s Caviar Stick Eyeshadow are cream eyeshadows in twist up crayon form. The texture is very creamy and very pigmented. One swipe gets you very intense colour that is very easy to blend out to lighten. The formula is also very long lasting. I have picture-perfect eye makeup from morning till evening with these. The only 2 problems I’d identify are the small selection of colours, and that you have to work quickly to blend before it sets. Once it sets, there’s no budging it! Pros: Creamy texture, Very pigmented colours, Easy to blend, Longlasting on skin once it sets, A little goes a long way Cons: Small selection of colours, Have to blend it out quickly before it sets Who will like this: Anyone who uses cream eyeshadow, Anyone who wants a very easy to use and fuss-free eyeshadow with fairly neutral colours When I reviewed the Chanel Stylo Eyeshadow in Moon River a while back, I was asked how Moon River compares to the Laura Mercier Sand Glow. So, I did a side by side swatch comparison for your viewing pleasure ? Left-Right: Laura Mercier Cocoa Caviar Stick Eyeshadow, Laura Mercier Sand Glow Caviar Stick Eyeshadow, Chanel Stylo Eyeshadow in Moon River You might be able to tell that where Sand Glow is pigmented but a light shade of golden beige, Moon River is a sheer metallic beige. What this means is that Sand Glow shows up much better on skin than Moon River. The shimmer in Sand Glow is elegant and pretty on eyes while Moon River tends to be very shimmery and shiny with a “wet” look. Having used both, I would personally pick Sand Glow over Moon River for the reason that it’s a more versatile colour that’s easy to wear and shows up on skin without looking too shiny or shimmery. Moon River is pretty, but it was limited edition and for the price and texture, I’d get Sand Glow in a heartbeat. Have you tried these Caviar Stick Eyeshadows? Do you have a favourite colour that you think I should own? I am itching to get more, simply because I use these so often as they are so effortless. Laura Mercier came up with some lighter, more shimmery eye-brightening shades this year as opposed to the previous versions which are deep colours and work well as lid shades or as a quick smokey eye. This means, there’s greater scope for blending now. So, I’m thinking of getting Amethyst, Plum, Jungle… Damn, I’ll just have them all please? What’s your fave? ?

Me? I can barely apply polish properly, much less do anything fancy with my nails! That said, I’m one of those rare birds who prefers going bare-nailed. So, I think nail polish innovations like crackle polish (remember that? I’m glad it’s died out!) and magnetic nail polish and even the funky caviar manicures are made for nail art dodos like me who want to look a little funky but aren’t sure how. I thought it was very interesting when Dior announced that in the Fall collection, they were releasing a magnetic nail polish (!!) Mystic Magnetics . In all honesty, I thought magnetic nail polish had gone the way of the dodo. Dior have been quite current, coming out with their crocodile crackle last summer and magnetic for Fall this year, but I think they have been a little bit slow to the party. Yet, behind or not, they always do it one step better than the mainstream. Their crackle polish was noted to be one of the best in the industry, and now, their magnetic polish is gaining accolades. I’m no polish afficionado but having this to play with is very gratifying and loads of fun! ? The Dior Vernis Mystic Magnetics comes in just 1 shade – a metallic gunmetal grey, packaged with a magnet. That’s where the fun is! Watch, I’ll show you ? On its own, I like the colour of the polish on nails. It is a neutral toned gunmetal grey that isn’t too dark nor too light, not too cool nor too warm. It wasn’t even too metallic. In the words of Goldilocks, it was just right. It is also very easy to apply, and you can get it opaque in just 1 coat. The fun however is with this little gadget. After applying one coat as a base, apply another coat of polish and then immediately, while the polish is wet, place this magnet as close to your nail as possible without touching it. The closer and the longer you hold it there, the stronger the pattern. The curved bit you see above should be placed at your cuticle, facing you. This will give you the nice striped pattern on your nails. Left: 1 coat of colour Middle: Magnet on nail (I placed it differently, you may notice) Right: I ended up with a different pattern! The magnet causes the pattern to form in the wet polish on your nail, and you can get different patterns depending on how adventurous you are with placing your magnet. Here’s an idea of how else it might look. Left – Right: Magnet with curved edge facing inwards gives you an upward curved pattern, Magnet placed with curved edge on the side gives you a vertical wavy pattern and magnet placed with curved edge away from you gives you a U pattern I personally like the 2 middle fingers. The wavy pattern isn’t very distinct but it appeals to me because it looks like it’s there but it isn’t. Could that be a bad paint job or is it an interesting abstract art? Ah, no one can tell! ? Also, if you use that on all nails, it doesn’t look too much. It can, if you go at it all with stripes. What I think I like most about this polish is not so much the magnetic properties, but the fact that you get 2 polishes in one. On its own, I love the colour and the metallic shine. Adding the magnet lets you get creative looking nails without too much effort – win-win! ? Did you try any magnetic nail polish when they were all the rage? I was gifted one by a generous friend, so I have to say I have had practice and knew what to expect. I think I like the indistinct wavy lines as opposed to the stripes. I keep thinking of a mackerel when I see those stripes LOL! ? Paris B Dior Vernis Mystic Magnetics Price: RM86 Availability: Dior counters Limited Edition: Fall 2013, Mystic Metallics collection']"

They are a range of organic handmade soap originating from Taiwan. It was a very good range of soaps, for various uses although some people did say they weren’t used to the strong herbal smells. I personally liked them! The brand is quite niche and a few years back , when I heard that there was going to be a skincare range, I was quite interested. Well, the day is here! I had the opportunity to sample some of the key products from the skincare line in generous sample sizes and I must say, I was quite surprised that I liked it! There are 3 lines available for different types of skin:- Alpina Speciosa – Dry and ageing skin – anti-aging Momoridca – Normal skin and brightening Bidens Pilosa – Combination to oily skin True to Ah Yuan’s philosophy, the products are natural and herbal based. Even the names of the ranges are the latin names of plants which extracts form the base of the skincare range. I tried a couple of products from the Alpina Speciosa range for dry and ageing skin (ahem! moi :P). The Alpina Speciosa is a member of the ginger family, as I discovered later, which explains the spicy, peppery unmistakable smell of ginger in the products haha! The Ah Yuan skincare products come in very sleek packaging if the samples are anything to go by! Sleek plain white tubes, with simple black writing. Very zen. Very Asian ? It is very pleasant, and I liked the textures. I’ll just run through them quickly, and tell you a little about each of the products I sampled so you have an idea of this new natural and organic skincare brand in the market ? Alpina Speciosa Herbal Toner – RM179/150ml The toner has no discernible scent to me, and is quite hydrating. The colour is a clear brown and I apply it using a piece of cotton, swiping it over my skin and then lightly tapping it in. It makes my skin feel comfortable and isn’t drying at all. I think I’d like for it to come in a spray bottle, so I can spray it on. I think that would be nice ? Alpina Speciosa Restoring Serum – RM329/30ml The serum is a light textured lotion with a faint smell of ginger that I found very interesting. I couldn’t even identify the smell at first LOL! The smell is faint but definitely there. The texture is light and it absorbs into skin without any sticky feeling. You don’t get the oily feeling either that you sometimes get with serums so it was actually very nice. I can’t say if there was any wow factor on my skin but it didn’t break me out either. I generally expect natural products to not work with as much vigour or speed as chemical products so it might just take time. Clockwise from Top: Alpina Speciosa Herbal Toner, Alpina Speciosa Restoring Cream, Alpina Speciosa Restoring Serum Alpina Speciosa Restoring Cream – RM369/50ml I found the cream quite interesting because it has a slightly thick texture, yet it absorbs very nicely and quickly into the skin without leaving any sticky or oily after feel. In fact, my skin feels like there’s nothing on it at all! The first few times I used it, I thought it wasn’t enough. I mean, I have dry skin and usually creams for dry skin leave a slight residue on the surface. But this one didn’t. Yet, much to my surprise, after a few days use day and night, my skin did feel comfortable. It didn’t look nor feel flaky or dry at all. I can use it in the day without it turning oily which is always a boon. It too has that faint, fresh, sharp, spicy smell of ginger which I actually find quite comforting. I noticed that the Restoring Cream contains olive extracts which usually break me out but this didn’t. I do wonder why. Maybe it’s the formula? ? Here are the ingredient lists for each of the 3 products above. I also had the opportunity to sample 2 face sheet masks from Ah Yuan skincare and goodness, I loved these! Ok, its no secret I like my face sheet masks and these are truly very nice. Face Masks – Alpina Speciosa Anti-Aging Mask RM208/box of 5 pieces and Momoridca Lightening Mask RM179/box of 5 pieces I happen to really like the smooth, sleek packaging of the sheet masks. Plain and simple. It is your regular one time use sheet mask, and the material of the mask is a thin cloth that looks like gauze. It is very well infused with essence and adheres to the skin very very well. It isn’t too large either and was just right. I was snacking on fruits while I had this on and it didn’t even fall or peel off! The essence feels light, but it didn’t dry out very quickly and my skin was very lovely, cool and looked well moisturised for a couple of days thereafter. I really liked it! I did get a little jolt at the price because it is very pricey ? It was good while it lasted…. In a nutshell The Ah Yuan skincare range is a natural range from Taiwan incorporating herbal extracts from plants. I sampled some from the Alpina Speciosa range for dry to ageing skin and I found it quite good. They weren’t heavy nor oily even for day time use, and absorbed very nicely into skin, helping it feel and look hydrated. The faint smell of ginger in the serum and cream may not appeal to some, but I quite liked it. It had a spa feel. The Face Masks were very nice and very well made. Taiwanese know their face masks! Overall, I think the line holds a lot of promise, but the high prices can be a stumbling block for many. I know it is for me, but if I were in the market for a natural skincare brand, I will definitely consider this one. Pros: Not heavy, Absorbs quickly, Skin feels and looks well hydrated, Face Masks are a very good fit and adhere well to skin, don’t dry out too quickly and leaves skin looking brighter and better Cons: Pricey, Herbal scent may not appeal to everyone Who will like this: Anyone who is into natural plant based skincare The Momoridca (normal/brightening) and Bidens Polisa (combination/oily) ranges are a little bit cheaper. I didn’t sample them so I can’t tell you about the texture. If they are anything like the Alpina Speciosa one, then they will feel quite comfortable on skin. Does this new skincare range tickle your fancy? Have you used the Ah Yuan soaps before? I must say that having sampled them, I am quite interested. The high price does make me balk though. I have heard Ah Yuan himself speak and he is very passionate about what he makes and what he does, which does inspire confidence, you know. You don’t often get to hear the philosophies of a brand creator. It keeps it real ? Paris B Ah Yuan Skincare is available only at Isetan KLCC, 2nd Floor Living and Household Department']"

Gosh! It feels good to finally be back online. Had some internet woes the past few days and well, you know how that is. It’s incredibly frustrating! Often, we just don’t realise how reliant we are on being connected to that great wide web. While nice to detox, it’s frustrating when you need to get work done. But whining aside, let me show you something cheery instead. When I was down in Singapore a few weeks ago, I met up with Mag of makeupstash.com , a beauty blogger I’d known since our early blogging days. We finally had the chance to meet up after all these years and I have to say that it was one of the most incredible meet-ups I’ve ever had! We were jawing on like old friends (which we technically are) and spent a mind-boggling 7 hours just chatting and doing a bit of makeup shopping – as you do! ? I had loads of fun! One of our pit-stops was Kiehl’s because the cheery Christmas decorations drew us in, and I wanted to snag a sample of their new face oil. In the process, I ended up with one of the limited edition Christmas items – the Kiehl’s Richly Hydrating Hand Cream in Lavender . There are 3 scents – Lavender, Grapefruit and Coriander. I know… Coriander?! Bleh… ? I don’t even eat it, much less want to smell like a herb salad ? It’s funny that I’d pick up a hand cream though. I’m not your usual hand cream user. In fact, I don’t use it at all! But I blame the lovely lavender scent that drew me right in and made me pop the tube into my basket. I know Kiehl’s makes a hand cream (which I’ve never used) so I don’t know how this is different. All I know is that the 3 scents and perhaps this formula, are limited edition for Christmas 2015. There was a sampler set with all 3 scents, in limited edition Peter Max box packaging, but I opted not to get that, because I wasn’t keen on the other 2 scents. Coriander, while interesting, smelled too green for my tastes, while Grapefruit, while interestingly fresh on paper, didn’t sit well on my skin. For some reason, I have this love-hate relationship with Grapefruit scents. Often, they end up smelling like pee on me ? So, it was Lavender by default, and also because it was such a lovely burst of comfort! I liked the slightly thick hand cream texture, that melts right into skin without feeling the least bit sticky or greasy. After a little while, you don’t feel it anymore. The scent of lavender is a rather sharp, fresh scent, that doesn’t smell powdery or musty. It smells refreshingly relaxing, if that even makes sense. But happily (or unhappily, depending on how you feel) the scent doesn’t linger very long on your hands. I find that when I first use it, I get to breathe in the wonderfully relaxing scent of lavender, which is a nice way to wind down in the evenings, or to bring a spot of calm in the middle of your day. But after a little while, the scent dissipates, and I don’t smell it anymore. I like that, because it means it doesn’t mess with my perfumes of the day. So what I bought was the full size 75ml tube of the Lavender hand cream, and I got everything else gratis! I don’t know if the full size is sold here in Malaysia (the Kiehl’s website is very unhelpful in that regard) but I paid S$27 for the tube. The lovely SA at Kiehl’s Ngee Ann City packed it for me in the limited edition Peter Max gifting pack, together with a generous bunch of samples and even a very very useful travel sized body wash because she found out I was visiting! While I bitched about product samples recently , I have to say that this generosity did bring a song to my heart and a bounce to my step ? Never underestimate the joy of freebies! LOL! ? IN A NUTSHELL The Kiehl’s Richly Hydrating Hand Cream is a limited edition range of hand creams available in 3 scents for Christmas 2015 – Lavender, Grapefruit and Coriander. I picked Lavender due to the fresh scent of lavender that relaxes and calms. The texture of the cream is fairly thick, but absorbs quickly into the hands without a greasy or sticky after-feel. I think it’s a pretty decent hand cream, and the lavender one smells absolutely lovely! There is a sampler set containing all 3 scents in limited edition box packaging, and I don’t know if the full size version is available here in Malaysia. This was purchased in Singapore. PROS: Not greasy or sticky, Does not leave hands feeling oily, Absorbs quickly, Lavender smells lovely and fresh and relaxing CONS: Limited edition WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who dislikes oily or sticky hand creams, Anyone who likes the scent of lavender PRICE: S$27 | US$15 for 75ml AVAILABILITY: Kiehl’s stores For those interested, here is the ingredient list for this hand cream Did you check out Kiehl’s Christmas offerings for this year? Would you have picked up a Coriander scented hand cream?! I admit to a morbid fascination, enough to smell the Coriander scented hand cream at the store, but nope. I usually pick coriander out of my food, and while I’m slowly now eating it, when I can’t help it, or when the dish calls for it (I love Vietnamese and Thai food and salsa, and there’s a LOT of coriander in there!) I will opt out of putting it on my hands ? Quite a strange scent to include, if you ask me ? Paris B']"

People were raving about them, and the texture too, of course. But for some reason, the hype seems to have died down in the past year or so, and that’s when I came on board. I’m a little perverse that way. I picked up a tube sometime ago, because I admit, I was suckered in by the smooth, tactile feel of leather on the cover and the edgy design. Yep, that’s leather on the cover! Quite different from your regular lipstick, this one. The leather clad cover of the Givenchy Le Rouge covers the whole tube of lipstick, and you extract the tube by gripping on the little metallic stud protrusions on the side, as you can see in the picture above. Fascinating packaging aside, I have to say that I was quite won over by the formula too… but not immediately! The formula of the Givenchy Le Rouge is what I’d term a “satin” formula. It isn’t glossy nor is it matte. So, you can’t just peg it for a single formula. However, this runs rather at odds with the description of the Le Rouge, which is that of “Sensuously Mat”. I find that there is a little shine so this isn’t the usual flat matte that we, or maybe I, have come to expect. But I like that. It keeps things interesting. The tube is engraved with the Givenchy logo on the side, quite is something we’ve been seeing in most luxury lipsticks in recent times. I suppose it’s a way of “branding” your lipstick bullet, because otherwise, one bullet looks pretty much like another. Initially, I wasn’t too taken with it. I found that it tugged a little on my lips and wasn’t as smooth as I hoped it would be. I also mentioned once about how I felt that it wasn’t as opaque as I hoped it to be. since it claims to have “intense colour”. However, after using it a few times, I’ve found that it now applies more smoothly and evenly on lips, and is pretty much almost opaque in one swipe. However, I sometimes feel it isn’t, because of the shade I chose. Unlike my usual choice of lip colours, I opted for a shade called Rose Boudoir (204), which is a lip colour that’s easier to wear than the reds or bright colours I’m used to. In tube, it’s a fairly nondescript rose. Rose Boudoir is a lip shade that I’m fairly confident will sit well with many people, because it is one of those shades that anyone can wear without feeling self-conscious about themselves. On my lips, I find that the colour swatches a little more red, so it shows up more than I originally expected. That’s fine with me, but it is something you might want to think about if you are the sort who shies away from wearing red lipstick. On some others, it looks a little more pink. For reference, this is how it looks when I wear Rose Boudoir. See what I mean about it looking more red than expected? It does go on a little more bold, but it’s very flattering and wearable and above all, very comfortable to wear for a matte lipstick. If all matte lipsticks were like this, I might actually be more receptive to wearing them! ? The only fly in the otherwise sweet-smelling ointment, is that there is a bit of a scent and a taste. I find French luxury brands tend to have them and Givenchy is no expection. It does dissipate so it doesn’t bug me as much as it should, but it is there. If you are at a counter, you can take a sniff to see if it bothers you. But if it doesn’t bother me, someone who is extremely fussy about scent in lip products, then it shouldn’t bother most people ? IN A NUTSHELL The Givenchy Le Rouge lipstick is a bit of a haute couture design. The cover is clad with soft, tactile black leather, that when paired with the metallic finishes, gives a bit of a edgy vibe. The lipstick is a mostly matte formula, with a little bit of shine to keep things interesting, and is fairly opaque in 1 or 2 swipes. I do find that the shade I chose appears a little deeper on my lips than in the tube, but it is flattering and comfortable to wear. I’m glad I caved only after the hype had died down. It allowed me a more objective view, after I was able to discount all the rah-rahs, only to find that it truly deserved all its raves! PROS: Interesting packaging, Smooth texture and not drying, Opaque, Formula does not accentuate lines on lips, Fairly intense colour CONS: Pricey, Fragrance and taste initially but dissipates WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes a lipstick with a more matte appearance, Anyone who wants to wear a matte lipstick that isn’t too matte or dry PRICE: RM130 | US$36 | £25 AVAILABILITY: Givenchy counters at Sephora and some department stores, online at Sephora (USA) Have you tried the Le Rouge lipstick? Is there a colour you think I should check out? After being on the fence about this for a while, I have to say that I’m quite keen to get another. I like how long lasting the formula is, and is especially useful for when you need your lipstick to last through menial things like drinking water or coffee. I wore it for a fancy dinner once, and made it through without having to touch up. Talk about long lasting! ? So, hit me with your recommended shades! ? Paris B']"

But as they say, better late than never! After all, it’s a permanent item so there’s no LE rush *whew!* On a side note, I’m starting to move away from LE products. I’ll expound on my theory in a separate post but am just throwing the idea out there because I’ve been so consistently disappointed lately, I’m planning to just stick with the tried and true permanent items with few exceptions. Now that’s off my chest, let’s talk lipstick! ? Estee Lauder has a new lipstick range! After I had given it a good ol’ rave on IG, I was made to realise that Asia gets a whole different range of Pure Color Envy Sculpting lipsticks! What’s this obsession with segregating the world into Asia exclusive and non-Asia exclusives eh? ? That aside, the one we get is the Pure Color Envy SHINE Sculpting Lipstick which is supposed to have a lighter, sheerer formula with a shine, as compared to the regular range available in the rest of the world. Not having seen the other one I will reserve comment, but I will tell you that I FREAKING LOVE THESE! Ahem, yes I’ll get a grip of myself now ? Despite it being supposedly sheerer, I wouldn’t pay too much heed to that. The colour I have is Blossom Bright 250 which is a lovely bright yet soft pink-berry that is opaque in one swipe. Yep, just one swipe. Let me demonstrate. Estee Lauder Pure Color Envy Shine Sculpting Lipstick Blossom Bright 250 Left: 1 swipe Right: 3 swipes from tube Can you tell the difference? Nope, me neither. I love how the colour is pretty much opaque with just 1 swipe straight from the tube and it’s a beautiful colour to boot! There is no tugging and the lightweight formula quite literally glides over lips leaving a beautiful pigmented coat of colour with some shine (but not gaudy shimmer or glitter). It hugs your lips without once feeling drying or heavy or uncomfortable and I must say, I was impressed the moment it touched my lips. I did like the previous versions of Pure Color lipsticks which you see in the picture but I know people often find the texture heavy and there is always that signature Fig scent that can be off-putting. I don’t mind it on some days but I mind terribly on other days so I don’t get a lot of wear from them. So imagine how happy I was when I took the Pure Color Envy Shine lipstick up close to my nose, took a healthy sniff (it’s ok, I don’t share my lipsticks so my cooties are my own) and discovered NO SCENT! Not a hint of perfume or fig or berry or rose. Hallelujah! For this reason alone, combined with the gorgeous formula, I’m calling a buy on this beauty! And that’s even before I wax lyrical about the packaging. The new Pure Color Envy Shine lipsticks come in a terribly sleek and hefty navy blue case with a gold coloured tip at the cap. There is absolutely nothing on the body that says what brand it is. The only hint you get is the name embossed in the top of the cap. The cap closes with a magnet which is terribly modern, but I was just so impressed with the sleek silhouette and luxe case that is a significant shift away from the previous gaudy gold and plastic packaging. I love it. Have I said that already? ? When I mentioned the lovely texture of the lipstick and how smitten I was with it, a friend on IG noted that Estee Lauder owns Tom Ford, which is lauded for their lipsticks and that had me thinking that maybe, just maybe, some of the technology and influence had rubbed off on the mother brand. For sure, this new Pure Color Envy Shine lipstick range is stunning and I’m already plotting to get more. I haven’t been this excited about an Estee Lauder lipstick in years. Or ever ? So after all that rather incoherent raving and flapping my hands about, here’s what Blossom Bright looks like when I wear it. Blossom Bright is a very lovely skintone brightening colour that isn’t as in your face as a red lipstick yet is bright enough to draw attention. I’ve just applied 1 layer straight from the bullet and I just love how it goes on and how it looks and how well it wears. I have no problem with it fading and I wear it for hours from the morning till lunchtime when I will usually wipe everything off and start over. So that’s a good 5 hours at least. I can’t think of anything bad to say about this lipstick so if you find a colour you like, get it. I can almost promise you, you won’t regret it… and you might even want another, like I do ? In a nutshell The Estee Lauder Pure Color Envy Shine Sculpting lipstick is a new range of lipsticks that is exclusive to Asia. Outside of Asia, it is the non-shine version. The texture is lovely being at once lightweight yet creamy and not drying yet pigmented and opaque in one swipe. I do not find this one sheer at all, which is good news for me but bad news for those who prefer sheer lip colours. There is a shine which is very flattering but it isn’t over the top so it works well in conservative working environments. The colour I have, Blossom Bright 250, is a very flattering colour and one I feel will flatter many, and especially will attract those who prefer brighter lip colours. It isn’t too bright and is just right. The packaging is sleek and the cap closes with a magnet and I find it very elegant and luxurious. I’ve nothing bad to say, only good things so I’ll stop here. Get one! Pros: No scent, Pigmented, Opaque in 1 swipe, Soft shine on lips, Lightweight yet creamy texture, Not drying, Longlasting for at least 5 hours Cons: None Who will like this: Anyone who likes pigmented, opaque, creamy lip colours with some shine, Anyone who likes unscented lipsticks I might even say that these lipsticks remind me of the Rouge Dior and feels like a mash up between Rouge Dior and Dior Addict. Next to Tom Ford regular lipsticks, these aren’t as hard but feel impressively comfortable so I’d even pick this because TF lipsticks have a scent haha! At this moment, you could say that these can do no wrong so I’ll pick this as my favourite lipstick du jour because it hits all the right spots for me. My next problem is getting more. Yes, I’m obsessive that way ? Have you tried the Pure Color Envy Shine lipsticks and have a favourite colour? If you’re outside of Asia, have you tried the Pure Color Envy lipsticks and do you like them? I can’t compare the two formulas as I don’t have access to the non-shine version, but I was told those have a scent so I’m already feeling a bit iffy about them. That said, I’m not going to prejudge, so if I have access, I’ll get one to compare but for now, if you can get the Pure Color Envy Shine lipsticks, do. I love them and if you have a favourite colour, let me know – I might like it too! ?

That’s me and the Chanel Les Beiges powders. Let me just say that I’m not quite sure what they are. Pressed powders? Finishing powders? Do they add colour? What?! Beiges? How blah is that? But while on a shopping jaunt not too long ago, I found myself standing in front of the Les Beiges display at Chanel looking at the very pretty Les Beiges Healthy Glow Multi-Colour powder . The pretty stripey detail reminded me of a pretty blush I own from the brand and I was sort of smitten. Tell me you wouldn’t be too ? I haven’t bought anything from Chanel in a very long time and for some reason, I got it into my head that I wanted this powder. This is a limited edition powder that is part of the Les Beiges line, and comes in 2 shades, imaginatively identified as 01 and 02. 01 which you see pictured here is the lighter shade meant for fairer skintones. 02 is more bronzed and slightly deeper in tone for medium to deeper skintones. Each palette contains a highlighter at top, a Les Beiges powder in the middle and in the case of 01, a blush at bottom or in the case of 02, a bronzer. Ideally, you could then use this powder in a few ways. You can blend all the colours and use it all over as a finishing powder to add glow and warmth to your skin; or you could pick up each colour individually and use them separately. Well, let’s just say that the latter ain’t gonna happen! The fact is that the pan, despite the deceptively large size in photographs, isn’t very large. You will need a very narrow brush if you wanted to pick up each colour individually. There is one packaged with the product, a half moon curved brush that lies on a hard piece of plastic covering the powder. It isn’t too bad, but I found it flimsy and too thin to be of any real use. It’d work in a pinch but I rarely work with anything in a pinch. It either works or it doesn’t and this, for me, doesn’t. The other thing I noticed was that the tester at the counter felt relatively soft, so when I ran my finger over the powder, it picked up product quite well. But when I took mine home, it feels hard to the touch and there is little product pay off. Am I the only one who feels this way or did I get a dud? The strange thing is that when you run your finger over the powder and then swatch it on your hand, it looks like there is a lot of shimmer and “glow”. When I pointed it out to the SA and asked if it might be too much to wear all over, her reply was that it was the “glow” and that it’s what these powders were for, plus there was SPF15 for sun protection. Wow… not ? Anyway, despite all my misgivings I took this powder home and put it to the test. Can I say I’m wowed by it? No I’m not. I’d rather have bought another RMK Kaleidoscope Nuance Color powder to be perfectly honest. I found that it was far too fiddly trying to pick up product from each individual stripe. If that’s your intention, forget it. It’s not big enough a pan for you to do so. So, I ended up swirling a brush over all the colours and then applying as a finishing powder to set my foundation. The last step of my base, as it were. Let me try to show you a swatch (which I always feel a little silly doing for powders but it’s expected isn’t it? Please tell me it isn’t so I can stop this madness ? ) Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Multi Colour 01 Powder Left: Swatched heavily Right: Light When swatched heavily, you may see a bit of a pinky toned colour down the stripe but to be honest, when you use a brush, you don’t get that sort of colour intensity, so you won’t risk walking around with a pink face. I found that the colours were very sheer on skin and the shimmer which shows up on my arm and fingers, don’t show up on my face. As a finishing powder, I found it alright. It didn’t particularly seem to add a glow to my skin but it did seem to finish off my base nicely. The colour pay off is very sheer and light so if you’re looking for colour, this isn’t the product to get. I do have to mention the scent. There is a perfumed scent that I didn’t detect in the tester but which is absolutely present in the powder and it smells musty to my nose. I absolutely detest it so if you have a sensitive nose or sensitive skin, be warned. The packaging is, like everything Chanel, chic. I liked the solid beige compact and the consistent quality of the velvet pouch it comes in. At least some things don’t change. I can say I’ve assuaged my curiosity but I can’t say I’m sold on this product nor am I about to shout about it from the rooftops. It’s OK. It’s not wonderful nor life changing nor even something I’m about to tell you to run out and buy because it’s simply just… OK ? In a nutshell The Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Multi-Colour Powder is a limited edition powder that comes in 2 shades. 01 is a lighter glowy-pink shade for fairer skins while 02 is a deeper bronzer shade that would suit medium-tanned skintones or serve as a bronzer for those who like that. I found the quality of the powder a little inconsistent. It felt hard and there were very little colour pay off for the Les Beiges powder and the pink blush shade, but the highlighter shade was softer and as a result, there is more shimmer. Ideally you can use them separately but I just swirl the colours together to use as a finishing powder. I find it alright but nothing to write home about. There is a musty perfume scent I dislike and it isn’t a product I’d naturally reach for. I prefer the RMK Kaleidoscope Nuance Color powder which serves a similar purpose and for me, looks far better on skin than this one. Pros: Chic packaging, Easy to use, Included brush isn’t crappy Cons: Pricey, Powders have a hard and inconsistent texture in pan, Strongly perfumed Who will like this: Anyone who already likes Chanel powders or Chanel Les Beiges powders Here is the ingredient list for the Les Beiges Healthy Glow Multi-Colour powder for anyone interested. Are you a fan of the Chanel Les Beiges powders? What do you use them for? Are these limited edition powders on your radar? To be honest, I never quite “got” the Chanel Les Beiges powders so I stayed away. From what I understand, they are supposed to be powders you can use for finishing or as a light bronzer. Seeing as bronzing isn’t my thing, I guess I’d not be dabbling in this anymore. The scent really got to me and I haven’t had much of a good run with Chanel in recent times. Haven’t bought a thing I’m happy with! ?

There are a few items in Guerlain’s Les Tendres Spring 2015 collection but to be honest, I wasn’t taken by anything else in the collection except one – the Météorites Perles de Blush Eclat Angelique . There are some pretty looking eyeshadow palettes and some coral lipsticks but I wasn’t interested. I was there at the Guerlain counter for one thing and one thing only – my blush balls! ? There are some misconceptions I should clear up before I tell you what I think though. While these are part of the Guerlain Météorites franchise, it is a blush. It isn’t meant to be anything else except a blush so please do not try to use this as an all over powder the way I’ve actually seen some people mention. Of course it will make you look silly – try applying any blush all over your face and see how silly you look! ? Secondly, please do not be fooled by the enormous close up pictures you’re seeing everyday on Instagram and online. The product is tiny. Not merely tiny, it’s teeny tiny. I will show you some basis for comparison in the following pictures but be aware of what you’re getting and don’t pan the product just because you thought you were getting a larger product. Remember, images seen online always appear larger (and better) than in real life. It’s called photo editing and perspective. So, you know I love love love my Guerlain Météorites and you know that I love love love blush. It’s something I’m sort of known for, so naturally, the minute I knew it was available at counters, I was off like a shot to pick one up for my very own ? Here’s another complaint about the Météorites Perles de Blush – it comes in cardboard packaging. I’m not going to defend that because I, like everyone plundering their savings for this little limited edition gem, would have preferred something better that would potentially last longer. Yet, from my experience with the plastic tubs we get now as compared to the cardboard tubs we used to get before (I gave mine to my sister) I find that the plastic tubs end up with more powder residue than when I had the cardboard tubs. Is it because plastic is harder and therefore when the powder pearls move around in transit they break up more? Is it because cardboard is more forgiving to impact? I don’t know and I won’t speculate. Guerlain picking cardboard, with the vintage design embossed on it seems to imply a throwback to a more classic, vintage period. Also, it is because they know they can get away with it LOL! ? See, suckers like me still buy it! ? I’ve also read comments by people saying that the box is flimsy or that it will crush easily to which my reply is – what on earth are people doing with their makeup?! This isn’t a product you will travel with (It’s too messy to) and unless you have Hulk-like strength, just be a little more careful with your belongings and you’ll be fine. Again, Guerlain isn’t going to care about what we think because this was a one off release and they knew full well they’d get away with it despite all the complaints ? There is a puff that keeps the balls in place in transit, but it does pick up product so don’t use it to apply the product because you will end up using too much. The colour is pretty pigmented despite its diminutive size and packs a punch. So, use a light hand and build up colour as you go along. Oh and the pearls in this one are tiny. They reminded me of sherbet candy that I used to eat as a kid, that snaps, crackles and pops in the mouth. It is so tiny, I’m afraid to hold it and sneeze because it will end up all over the floor, or I might accidentally inhale it. It is miniscule! Keep it away from children and pets. Besides being a potential choking hazard, your wallet will weep an ocean of tears. I’m showing you a comparison between the regular sized Météorites and the ones from the Perles de Blush. The 3 that are smaller are from the blush. It’s like those little pearls you get on cupcakes. Can I forgive them the size and reduced quantity? (the Perles de Blush are a mere 13g vs 25g in the regular sized Météorites powders) Actually, no I can’t. I can understand the smaller sizes – it allows for your brush to pick up a more uniform shade which is useful because the product is so pigmented. Yet, I would have appreciated more product for the price we’re paying. Again however, Guerlain knew they’d get away with it – the proof is in the way it flies off the shelves with everyone cooing “It’s so cute!!” ? This is what happens when I dip a blush brush into the tub. You may notice how my brush picks up quite a lot of product, and the colour you see is about what you’d get on your skin – a warmed rose-red-pink flush, with some shimmer. I don’t find it very shimmery. In fact, I find that it has a very transparent colour that offers a glow as opposed to outright shimmer, and that is very flattering when worn by anyone of any skintone. Just layer it on for your preferred colour depth. My advise is to just tap on the surface of the product. Don’t go jabbing your brush in and swirling it around. You’ll lose all the product and end up with too much colour. Be gentle. Tame that Hulk-like strength ? Here is an approximation of how it looks when I wear it. I had to use the phone camera so please excuse the lower quality pictures, but it gave me what I needed. You may notice the pinkish glow I get on the cheeks. This is with just 1-2 layers of colour. It’s very natural, transparent and flattering. It also lasts all day for me. I love the Perles de Blush. It looks lovely when worn and it fits prettily into my Météorites collection. It however, isn’t a rational purchase. Do bear in mind that I’m a Guerlain Météorites collector and a blush fiend – that makes me irrational in my choices. For everyone else who are on the fence and wondering if this is worth buying or if it’s mere hype, ask yourself these questions:- Do you love blush? Can you spare RM192/ US$53? Do you understand the siren song of the Météorites powders/pearls? If you answered “Yes” to any or all of the above, then buy the Perles de Blush – you will not regret it. But if you didn’t, skip it. You won’t miss it. IN A NUTSHELL The Météorites Perles de Blush Angelic Radiance is part of the Les Tendres Spring 2015 collection from Guerlain. It is a loose powder blush in a very small cardboard tub. However, the product is lovely when worn on skin as it is well pigmented, and yet disperses a very transparent flush on skin. The colour can be easily built up for most skin tones, and while there is shimmer, it isn’t very shimmery. For me, it offers a glow to the skin as opposed to outright shimmer. I would advise using a light hand due to the intensity of colour. This isn’t a must have, nothing is. But if you love blush and Météorites and have money to spare, it is very nice to have. PROS: Lovely flush of colour when applied on skin, Gives skin a natural transparent glow, Pigmented product, Suitable for most skin tones, Completes the Météorites collection for collectors CONS: Pricey, Little product, Cardboard box WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who loves blush, Guerlain Météorites powders and have money to spare because it’s expensive LIMITED EDITION: Yes, Guerlain Les Tendres Spring 2015 One more shot showing you the size of the tub and the blush balls held in the palm of my hand. I don’t have a very large hand, so you might have an idea of what I mean when I say it’s tiny. But I’d say this is a tiny product that packs quite a pretty punch! So naturally no, I don’t regret my purchase one bit. Remember, I’m irrational ? Did you pick up the Météorites Perles de Blush? Are you tempted to and if you did, do you love it or are you disappointed? This was the one item I’d waited for for Spring 2015 and it’s my first purchase to date of any makeup in 2015! I’m very happy about that, and the fact that it’s a) blush and b) Météorites. I couldn’t get any happier ?

By that time, CC Creams had come on the scene and I had a headdesk moment. I was going to have to re-learn the whole notion of alphabet creams again! CC Creams, or Colour Correcting creams claimed to be an improvement on BB Creams. They boasted a lighter texture, and colour correcting pigments instead of mere tint. If you ask me however, barring some truly colour correcting creams that are basically primers to correct sallowness or redness in skintone, there is very little to distinguish BB or CC Creams. So you know what? Don’t bother. Just use whatever you like, whatever it may be called. Even if it be a GG (Glamorously Gorgeous) Cream which isn’t yet invented but which just might be ? Remember however, it is first and foremost a makeup item, not skincare so please clean it off accordingly and please do not attempt to sleep in it. But because everyone loves labels, I thought I’d share with you 3 CC Creams I’ve tried that I actually like and use pretty often. It might surprise you that a popular CC Cream that was said to have started the whole trend isn’t here in my list, but you know, that’s life ? I just found myself preferring these. So let me quickly share them with you because I’ve never reviewed them individually before this and I’ve got a tip for making these CC Creams work better for me! ? Clinique Moisture Surge CC Cream – Natural Fair RM125/40ml You might think “Liar! You have reviewed the Clinique CC Cream and you hated it !” Well, yes and no. When I first reviewed the Clinique CC Cream, it was a press sample that was one of the colour correcting primer types. That, I wasn’t impressed with as it didn’t seem to do much of anything for me. However, not very long after, I was browsing the Clinique counter at the airport, when I decided on a whim, to get one of the tinted versions in Natural Fair. Turned out that I liked it a lot! The tint in Natural Fair was a close match to my skintone and it offered a light coverage, to just even out my skintone quite nicely. It was a nice base to wear on a lazy weekend or while on holiday if I wanted to just have a light base on. The high SPF30/PA+++ rating was a good thing to have as well. The texture is fairly creamy and it isn’t drying nor does it make my skin oily. It doesn’t offer very much coverage, but if what you need is just to even out skintone so it doesn’t look blotchy and you aren’t too concerned about covering up blemishes, pigmentation or marks on skin then this is a nice, lightweight base to have on. I actually used this one quite a lot until the next one in this list came along. Ingredient list: Active Ingredients: Octinoxate 7.5%, Octisalate 5%, Titanium Dioxide 5.2%, and Zinc Oxide 3.2%; Inactive Ingredients: Water, Squalane, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Glyceryl Stearate, Behenyl Alcohol, PEG-40 Stearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Pentastearate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Trehalose, Caffeine , Glycerin, Linoleic Acid, Lecithin, Stearic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sorbitol, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-t-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Isopropyl Titanium Triisostearate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Xanthan Gum, Silica, Alumina, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Tin Oxide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol. May Contain: Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides. Peter Thomas Roth CC Cream – Light & Light to Medium RM198/50ml I have to say that of the 3 that I like, this one’s my favourite and I wasn’t even expecting to like it! The Peter Thomas Roth CC Cream contains fairly high sunscreen protection with both Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide and on top of that, is supposed to contain Camu Camu which is said to have 30 times the Vitamin C in oranges. Vitamin C and arbutin help protect and brighten the skin’s complexion while the tint in the product minimizes the appearance of imperfections. I find that this PTR CC Cream has slightly better coverage than the Clinique CC Cream and a slightly thicker texture. I find that it does a pretty good job at making my skin look good with very minimal effort and that’s something every woman craves, trust me. Not all of us want to take hours to primp in front of the mirror in the early mornings, attempting to make our skins look flawless. Some of us (me actually) actually value our beauty sleep more so a quick fix is often helpful and this is my quick fix. As you can see, coverage isn’t 100%. Anyone who has pigmentation fights this problem, but I’ve taken a more laid back attitude to it now. It evens out my skintone enough to make me happy to head to work sometimes, but I have a little trick to help it along to make my skin look better. My tip for making CC Creams work better This is a simple tip but it requires the help of my magic balls – Guerlain Meteorites . I like to use either 02 Clair (previously Teint Rose) or Medium (previously Teint Beige) for this purpose. What I do is apply a CC Cream on my skin as base. Then, I buff Meteorites powder all over. The CC Cream base evens out my skintone and offers a slight tint of colour, while the Meteorites pulls the look together and gives it a glow that allows me to fake the effect of a good night’s sleep and clear natural makeup-free skin when neither is true! CC Cream, being of a lighter and sheerer texture than foundation or most BB Creams allow more of the natural skin to come through so it looks more natural. Try it, if you don’t believe me and tell me if it works for you! Here is the ingredient list for the Peter Thomas Roth CC Cream. I like the texture of this one, it doesn’t turn oily and it sits well on my skin and looks natural. I have 2 shades. Light is very light as you will see in the swatches below. It is more like a primer that brightens the skin if you have a deeper skintone, and if you are very fair skinned then this may be the shade for you. Light to Medium is fairly deep in the swatch, but when I wear it actually seems fine. I do only wear a thin layer, which you can see in the picture above and I buff it out with Meteorites which actually help brighten the skintone and help it look better. Olay Total Effects Pore Minimizing CC Cream – Light RM49.90/50g This one was purchased completely on a whim while out on a jaunt to the local pharmacy. I believe it was on sale when I picked it up and from recollection, there are 3 or 4 shades available. I picked it up in Light. The first thing I noticed is that it has the signature Olay Total Effects scent. It isn’t unpleasant, but it is there and quite strong. The texture is quite liquid which I found a little unusual compared to the other CC Creams I’ve used that tend to have a slightly thicker texture. As a result, it also has a very light coverage and really, works best for someone who already has fairly good skin. While I can’t say I noticed any pore minimizing going on, I actually thought this wasn’t too bad, for the price and for the way it performed because it seemed to neutralize redness on my skin fairly well. It did nothing for me in terms of coverage but when I dab on some concealer and use my Guerlain Meteorites trick as I told you above, I get away with a fairly natural base even for work days. That was what I liked. This Olay CC Cream made a good base. If I needed a little more coverage, I’d use a pressed powder (I like the RMK Pressed Powder N ) all over, buffed gently into the skin and everything looks natural, almost as if I didn’t have a base on. Here is the ingredient list for the Olay Total Effects Pore Minimizing CC Cream. I don’t know if it’s the same with the ones sold in the USA or Europe as ours are made in Thailand but if you are based in Asia then this is the one you’d likely get. Of the 3 featured, this has the lowest sun protection at SPF15 so if you dislike wearing sunscreen and are depending on this to protect your skin ( please don’t! ) then don’t get this because SPF15 in the tropical sun is far too low. And finally, here are the swatches of the CC Creams I’ve featured here. The Clinique CC Cream in Natural Fair and Olay CC Cream in Fair are fairly close in tone. The difference between the two is texture. Clinique’s is thicker while Olay is lighter and more like a lotion than a cream. I also find that Olay offers less coverage and can slip on my skin as the day wears on while Clinique’s doesn’t slip as much. Setting both with some powder definitely helps with coverage and longevity. The Peter Thomas Roth CC Creams both have a rather warm tone but I like their texture which you can see offers better and smoother coverage. Light, on the extreme right is very light and has less coverage than Light/Medium. I can actually wear both although I definitely use the Meteorites with Light/Medium to brighten the skintone. Funnily enough, it swatches very dark, but as you can see in the FOTD above, it doesn’t make me look orange. It just kinda works! Have you tried any of these CC Creams? Do you use CC Creams and is there one you like? Of the 3 brands here, I like the Peter Thomas Roth, followed by Clinique and then Olay. However, I don’t usually wear them for long hours because I keep these for weekends or holidays or off days so I don’t really test them for longevity. As far as light casual bases go, these work for me, but I can’t say they’ll work for everyone out there ?

At least I can try to ease myself into this mindset of glorious blue waters and bright sunshine with fragrance; and when I want that mindset, my fingers find themselves reaching for the crystal clear blue glass bottle of the Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo scents. One of my favourite perfumes is the citrus whiff of Arancia di Capri that brings to mind sun-ripened oranges. Friends I’ve introduced it to have happily embraced it as well, which makes me happy of course. I have a rather strange nose for scents and what I like doesn’t always sit well with everyone. The newest inclusion in the Blu Mediterraneo range of scents is Ginepro di Sardegna or Juniper of Sardinia. I’d tried a juniper based scent before this from Penhaligons and I can safely tell you I ran screaming in the opposite direction. So I approached Ginepro di Sardegna with a lot of trepidation. But my fears were for naught because I love this one! Ginepro di Sardegna proposes to conjure up the scent of Sardinia but as I’ve never been there, it’s hard for me to know or imagine what it does smell like. I’m guessing not the smog-filled, smokey haze I can expect from living in a city right? If you live in Sardinia (Oh lucky you!) please tell me how it smells down there! ? When I first sprayed Ginepro di Sardegna on my skin, I get a fairly warm feeling, like warmed, slightly powdery wood. Generally, I’d shy away from powdery scents but this one’s light enough to not irritate my nose or overwhelm, because it’s fairly light. It’s supposed to start out with a burst of citrus and bergamot, but I don’t really get that. Instead, my nose seems to skip the whole top note altogether and the scent stays quite true to itself all day for me. I find it fairly warm with a hint of woods and spices, yet fresh on skin. The notes are said to contain pepper, nutmeg, bergamot, juniper, cypress, sage and Virginia cedarwood and cedarwood which might have you thinking that this is one heavy, masculine scent. But you’d be wrong. Unlike the other woodsy and spicy fragrances I’m used to, Ginepro di Sardegna is, I can safely say, the least offensive to the nose. It’s fairly unisex so both men and women can wear it (and smell quite different) and it isn’t noticeably masculine. In fact, I find that the warm powdery scent gives it a feminine slant that also grounds it and makes it smell more pleasing to the nose than the usual sharp scent of spices and woods. Wearing Ginepro di Sardegna makes me happy for some reason. It makes me feel warm and loved and comforted. Unlike Arancia di Capri that uplifts the spirit but is fleeting like so many bursts of happiness, Ginepro di Sardegna lasts much longer, rounding down to a gentle scent that takes me through most of my day. It is like a warm, comforting blanket that holds you close and assures you that you’re safe and secure. That said, I do not find Ginepro di Sardegna particularly special in a true sense. It’s not a scent that will irritate the people around you, nor is it one that will make people stop you and ask you what it is. But it warms me and settles me when my spirits feels uneasy and it cocoons me in a comforting, warm blanket of scent and for that reason, I love Ginepro di Sardegna ? Have you tried any of the Blu Mediterraneo fragrances? Do you have one from Acqua di Parma that you like? I’ve tried 2 so far and I like them both. I wear Arancia di Capri when I’m not fussed about longevity of scent which is generally if I am out on a weekend but for a work day or when I’m feeling a little down, I wear Ginepro di Sardegna so I feel comforted, and I’ve been wearing it a lot lately so yes, I’ve been needing a lot of comforting ?

I’d wanted to try it for the longest time due, I admit, for the simple reason that it contained flower petals in the bottle. How many products do you know that contain flower petals in the bottle? ? But I couldn’t use it because it was formulated for oily skins and I was repeatedly warned that it would be too drying for my normal-dry skin. So, I was quite surprised when offered the new Kiehl’s Calendula Deep Cleansing Foaming Face Wash to try, because this too, is formulated for normal to oily skin types and I just don’t fall into that category. However, I was emboldened to try it, because I’d read that it wasn’t drying and that it was a soap and sulfate-free cleanser so it was more gentle on skin. Well, never a better time than the present to try this, I say! When I moved house , I made sure to prep my bathroom. I like having proper shower items at hand, and since I was between houses at the time, I thought it was a good time to break out this cleanser to try. Now, I have to note one thing – this is not a makeup remover. I happened to come across a few reviews and comments online that talked about using this product to remove makeup and how successful (or not) it was, and I was puzzled. Kiehl’s never intended for this product to be a makeup remover. They say that it gently cleanses skin of impurities which does not equal removing makeup. Always use a separate makeup remover, whatever you want to use and then use this as your second step of cleansing, which is what I do. And I’m happy to report that despite my misgivings, this face wash isn’t drying, not even on my normal-dry skin. It comes in a yellow plastic bottle, but the product itself is a clear gel. You only need a little, pumped into your palm and then lather it up with water. Despite being a sulfate-free product, it does lather up quite well so that’ll please those who can’t get used to a non-lather face wash. There is a faint scent which bug some people but doesn’t bug me – a slightly herbal-flower scent but I like herbal scents. As promised on the label, this face wash does cleanse the skin quite impressively and does not dry out the skin, which I appreciate. It also feels fairly gentle, and you get a nice clean feeling on skin, without that squeaky clean, tight feel. Having used this for over a month, I’m actually quite happy with it remaining in my shower for my evening face wash. However, I am still partial to using my Vichy Normaderm face wash for keeping spots at bay, so I can’t in all good conscience say I’ll repurchase it, simply because I prefer something else. But if you want a gentle face cleanser that is soap and sulfate free and isn’t drying, then this is one to consider. In a nutshell The Kiehl’s Calendula Deep Cleansing Foaming Face Wash is formulated for normal to oily skin types, but I found it relatively gentle and non-drying even on my normal-dry skin. It has a soap and sulfate-free formula and only a little is needed to lather up, and it cleanses the skin well without leaving it feeling tight and uncomfortable or dry after that. I find it works well as a basic cleanser or as a double cleanse, but not to remove makeup as some people have suggested. For that, use a proper makeup remover. Pros: Lasts a long time, Soap and sulfate free formula for those who want to stay away from those, Does not dry out the skin, Feels gentle and cleanses skin well, Works well as a second cleanser for a double-cleansing routine Cons: The faint floral-herbal scent may not suit everyone Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for a soap and sulfate free face wash, Anyone who wants a gentle face wash that does not dry out the skin too much yet wants some foam action Here is the ingredient list for anyone interested to know what’s in there. The bottle is round so you’re going to have to piece it together for yourself ? Have you used the iconic Calendula toner before? Have you tested this complementary face wash? This is fairly new on shelves, so I’m sure Kiehl’s will have samples on hand if you’d like to give this a try and see if it works for your skin type. They are generally quite good about sampling after all. If you’ve tried this, I’d love to know what you think – did you find it comfortable or too drying or did the scent bug you?

When I come across a scent like this, I want the full size bottle, dammit! ? The one that has me feeling this way is the new Diptyque l’Eau du Trente-Quatre or the new Water 34 fragrance. This is a new scent that is a fresh interpretation of the mainstay, 34 Boulevard Saint Germain. I usually gravitate towards heavier, spicier, woody scents but I can’t quite explain why I am so taken with the freshness of this one. The L’Eau du Trente-Quatre is a 2013 version of the 34 scent and is supposed to be a lighter version, almost made for warmer temperatures, if you ask me. In our hot, tropical weather Water 34 is almost perfect. It spritzes out very lovely fresh citrus notes described as lemon, verbena, bitter orange and grapefruit. It is so refreshing, as if your senses just took a cool shower. I love the fresh notes that don’t smell too citrusy if you know my meaning. I love the smell of lemons and oranges but I don’t particularly want to walk around smelling like I doused myself in lemonade. I risk smelling like I fell into a vat of dishwashing liquid. Yet, behind the fresh citrus notes hides a hint of mellow spice represented by lavender and cinnamon, that I think is what attracts me. Remember I said I love spicy scents? Well L’Eau du Trente-Quatre on me settles down to a slightly warmer scent with that hint of spice in the air and a touch of green offered by the birch tree leaf. It smells almost as if I have just taken a fresh shower! It doesn’t smell soapy, if that’s what you’re wondering, but it does make me feel refreshed, as if I have just walked out of a shower (Have you been counting how many times I’ve used the word “shower”? ? ). It smells… for want of a better word, clean. Yet, there is a lingering powdery, spicy almost musky note that takes me well into the day, developed from the floral geranium and tuberose and resting on a base of cedarwood, patchouli and some incense, enveloping me in its scent. Despite it being an eau de toilette, it lasts me well into a full day. That’s just over 8 hours usually, and I still get the little hint here and there by the time I get home. Its so complex and I. LOVE. IT! ? I just want to keep sniffing myself over and over every time I spritz it on. That didn’t come out right, did it? ? I think this is a great scent for when the weather is warming up (or when its hot as it is here) because it gives that wonderful fresh feeling without ever being cloying. I’ve worked out that most sweet, floral or gourmand scents aren’t my thing except some exceptions, and so I have also realised that many women’s scents don’t quite hit that spot for me. Diptyque on the other hand, seems to fit the niche that my body chemistry and nose gravitates towards. Their scents are for both men and women without segregating them so a man could quite easily wear the same scent I do but yet, could smell quite different due to our different body chemistries. I do find that L’Eau du Trente-Quatre seems a little feminine, but my judgment may be clouded by the fact that I am the one wearing it. Absolutely nothing to stop a man who loves this scent from picking it up as well, and the rather masculine full size packaging does make it a little easier too. I also personally think that L’Eau du Trente-Quatre is a scent that is potentially a little easier for most people to wear. Not every scent in Diptyque hits the spot because I do find them a little more unique and more niche than most, but this one has a little more mass appeal, I think. I don’t plan to finish up this sample vial I have. I plan to save it to tote around when I travel, for a comforting, familiar scent. i tried, but the vial is not refillable so icant use it as a travel atomizer. But to fulfil my love for Water 34, I will be picking up the full size bottle. When you fall in love this hard, its worth it ? Here’s something else that I wanted to share with you that I’m truly taken with – the Hourglass Home Diffuser. None of those reed things that collect dust and easily topple over when I’m not careful (yes, I speak from experience). This comes in a few different popular home scents but what I was really taken with, was that it came in 34 Boulevard Saint Germain! EEEKKKSSS! Now I can get my home to smell of this. So naturally, this has gone on my wishlist. Birthday maybe? I better start dropping hints LOL ? Fragrances are such personal things that I hesitate to tell you to try this one but if you do have a Diptyque counter near you, do take a sniff and have a little spray on your skin. Then, tell me if it captivates you as much as it has me ? Have you smelled this new Diptyque L’eau du Trente-Quatre? Do you have a scent that you’ve fallen in love from just a sample? As I’ve said above, I’ve found that Diptyque scents suit me, my skin and my personality better than other more feminine brands/scents so I’m planning to learn a little more about the perfumes they have and see what else I like. If you can’t pronounce it, just ask for Water 34 so the people at Diptyque know you want this version and not the original 34 Boulevard Saint Germain ?

Thank you to those of you on Twitter and Facebook who helped me check! It was gone for almost a day, and here’s a tip for all bloggers amongst you – BACK UP! Quick, go do your backups now. I’ll wait. Back? Ok, so I was going to tell you about this product that I’d had my eye on for the longest time. There was something about the hourglass aesthetic, the heavy glass containers and just the whole idea of a non-exposed home fragrance diffuser that captured my imagination. I first saw this during the launch of the L’Eau du Trente-Quarte (which is a more musical, more romantic way of saying Water 34) and it had stuck in my mind ever since. It was so bad that at the end of last year, I sucked it up and bought me the Sablier (Hourglass) Home Diffuser in 34. I love my home fragrances and I usually do scented candles, as many amongst you will know, but I’m always open to alternatives. The only alternatives I knew of was reed diffusers and you know what? I hate them. Hate! They look flimsy and are liable to fall over if you so much as look at them and the reeds gather dust like nothing I’ve ever known. So when I’m introduced to an enclosed, aesthetically pleasing diffuser, I fell. The problem is that when you fall so hard for something this expensive, you want it to work. And you won’t stand for any truck if it doesn’t. Oh boy, Diptyque. You are in trouble ? The Hourglass Home Diffuser works in a clever way. The fragrance is housed in a refillable glass bottle which forms half of the hourglass. The other is attached to the bit that diffuses the scent. Like an hourglass, turn it over and allow the liquid fragrance to drip through to the bottom. The scent will be diffused along the way, through the whorls of the black plastic bit in the middle. That is what I was told anyway. I was also told that the scent should last and linger for at least 20 minutes or more and it will take 10-15 minutes for it to drip through so you get about an hour of scent. Long enough to relax and wind down after the day. Or so I thought. It currently comes in 3 popular Diptyque scents – Baies, Figuier and 34 Boulevard Saint Germain. I picked 34 because it is the least sweet and fruity smelling of the 3 scents available. I love the scent of the perfume and the candle, and logically therefore, I would love the scent wafting around my home. Boy, was I wrong. Ok, to be fair, there’s nothing wrong with the scent. It has the same spicy, woody, warm scent that I like, that feels at the same time warm yet fresh. It smells lovely. When the diffuser works that is. And it doesn’t. I’d saved this to be opened in my new home so I was understandably excited the day I finally set it up. I had images in my head of walking into my living room with the fragrant scent of 34 wafting in the air. In reality, there was nothing. I turned the hourglass over a few times, just to be sure and yep, I smelled nothing. Ok, so maybe my living room was too big (which it by no stretch of imagination is) so I took it to my room. A smaller place, so it should work right? Wrong. Again, there was nothing. It just sat on my dresser looking like a pretty ornament (and pretty expensive) and not working. I decided to try again, in an even smaller room and stuck it in the bathroom. This time, I could smell it. A faint, familiar scent of 34 in the air. What was Diptyque thinking making a diffuser that would work in a room as small as a bathroom I have no idea. It could perhaps accompany me during my bath or it might even work to banish toilet smells. But you know what? So does Febreeze and that doesn’t cost an arm, leg and kidney. They haven’t invented smell-o-vision yet, but if you stick your nose close to that black bit, you will smell what I smell. Nothing. And I have the real thing! Ok, yes I do smell something if I get that close but it’s not what I bought a home fragrance diffuser for right? I expected it to fragrance a room. I didn’t expect to have to stick my nose right into it to smell anything. Perhaps Baies or Figuier might work better, I don’t know. They are stronger, sweeter scents. Perhaps it works better in a colder environment, but again I wouldn’t know since the weather here is mostly hot and humid. But it doesn’t work even in an air-conditioned room so I’m not holding out a lot of hope, and I’m not about to try to find out if the other scents work. Fool me once Diptyque, shame on you; but there won’t be a second time. Let’s just say therefore that if you are tempted by the alluring aesthetics of this Diptyque Hourglass Home Fragrance Diffuser and are thinking of putting down good money for it, don’t. I did it so you don’t have to ? Do you use home fragrance diffusers? Do you have others to recommend aside from the reed ones? I’m still stocking up on scented candles but it’s nice to have alternatives. Reed diffusers really bug me so I’m sorry if you like them, I just can’t handle anything that looks like chopsticks sticking out from a bottle ?

And you are more susceptible to impulse buying, AND you are liable to make mistakes. That’s what happened to me not too long ago. Let loose in the beauty hall of Isetan KLCC, I found myself stealing a look at the sole Burberry Beauty counter here in Malaysia, wondering what was new and my eye fell on an interesting looking product – the Burberry Fresh Glow BB Cream – Luminous Skin Correcting Beauty Balm . I was quite surprised to see it, because I didn’t expect to see a BB Cream come out of the Burberry Beauty stable already. Locally, the line has been quite quiet in terms of marketing and PR so I honestly had no idea what has been going on with the brand. I’m told it’s a a worldwide thing too, as there’s some shake-ups going on internationally. Long story short, the Burberry Fresh Glow BB Cream is a limited edition product launched under the Burberry Beauty Summer 2014 collection (of which I paid no attention to as the rest of the items didn’t grab my attention) Locally, there are 2 shades available – 01 Nude Rose and 02 Nude Honey . I later found out after looking up information online, that 01 Nude Rose (cool toned) and 02 Nude Honey (warm toned) are meant for Asian skins and elsewhere in the world, there are 3 more shades – Fair, Medium and Dark. All this is very confusing, so suffice to say that all we get here are the “Asian” shades, 01 being a little lighter and a touch cooler in tone and 02 being warmer and a touch darker. I don’t deny that a part of the reason my eye was drawn to the product was due to its similarity in packaging to one of my favourite BB Creams, the Guerlain Lingerie de Peau BB Cream . It has a similar nude-pink tube with the cap bearing the signature checks of the Burberry fashion line. I noticed that the product claims to be a Luminous Skin Correcting Beauty Balm with SPF30 PA+++ and it claims to give skin a natural looking finish with healthy luminosity, and is enriched with rosehip, tea and lavender extracts. I get the impression therefore, that the Asian versions of Nude Rose and Nude Honey are more like tinted moisturisers with a cool or warm base, depending on your skintone while the Fair, Medium and Deep versions overseas are more like foundation. Skin Correcting – is that what it’s supposed to mean? Anyway, here’s a swatch of 01 Nude Rose. For the very fair, I’m afraid even this is will be too dark in tone, because I find the light to medium coverage does impart quite a lot of colour to the skin. Burberry Fresh Glow BB Cream 01 Nude Rose Left: Swatched heavily Right: Blended out I can wear Nude Rose, but only as a thin layer, which means I get medium coverage at best, and light coverage otherwise. I don’t quite mind that to be honest. I usually wear very thin, light layers of base makeup so it suited me, and the heavier tint of colour doesn’t bug me as much, as the cool undertones help temper that, so it doesn’t look so dark. But the texture does take some getting used to. I find that it feels a little tacky, and it never really dries down properly. When I set it with powder, it stays on better, but starts slipping off after a few hours. I have normal-dry skin so having base makeup slip off my skin isn’t something I’m used to. Nor is an oilier feeling to the skin. Or is that supposed to be “dewy” and “luminous”? ? I don’t quite mind this, but I’d say it’s not something I’d reach for. When I have this on, I have been told that my skin doesn’t look as nice as when I have other base makeup on, and I do notice it as well. It looks alright, but doesn’t make me want to keep looking in the mirror, marvelling at my skin. So, this is something I’d wear on a weekend, when I have to be out for a couple of hours to run errands, but it doesn’t last on my skin long enough to take me through a whole day, so I will ultimately pass this up for foundation or even one of the other BB creams that I like. Here’s an approximation of how it looks on me. Due to the light-medium coverage, it’s hard to get the after picture looking much different from the before one ? I use about half to one pump each time, spread thinly on my skin and then blended in with a flat top brush . But you may hopefully notice that the skintone is a wee bit more evened out with the BB Cream on, with redness reduced, but blemishes and pigmentation aren’t fully covered up. You still need a concealer for that. In a nutshell The Burberry Fresh Glow BB Cream is a limited edition release with their Summer 2014 collection and in Malaysia, comes in 2 shades – 01 Nude Rose and 02 Nude Honey. Nude Rose isn’t a very light shade, but the cooler tone does help to brighten a little. Nude Honey has a warm tone and is more suited to a medium skintone. I find the coverage light to medium, and it doesn’t offer much coverage for blemishes and discolourations on skin, but it does a fair enough job evening out the skin tone. The texture is rather tacky and I only use about half to one pump, blended out in a thin layer on my skin. The tacky feeling doesn’t quite go away, and I do find that it is prone to get oily on my normal-dry skin after a few hours. The plus point is that it doesn’t feel drying so this is one for those who doesn’t need much coverage, just at touch of skintone evening out, and willing to touch up after a few hours. For me, this is my weekend errands base. Pros: Not drying, Lightweight and evens out skintone even with a very light layer of product Cons: Pricey, Feels tacky to the touch, Turns oily on my skin after a few hours even after setting with powder, Colour may not suit those who are very fair Who will like this: Anyone who doesn’t need a lot of coverage Here is the ingredient list but you have to squint a little. It’s hard to get it all in when brands go and print it all along the side of the box in tiny print. I didn’t manage to get a swatch of 02 Nude Honey but I found a blog that has a review on it here . I thought it might be helpful, because I haven’t come across many reviews about this Burberry BB Cream at all! Have you come across the Burberry BB Cream and did you test it out? What’s your favourite item from Burberry Beauty? I haven’t been paying a lot of attention to the brand, primarily because I haven’t been going out a lot to the malls and there’s just 1 Burberry Beauty counter here. I have liked some of what I’ve tried but their base makeup hasn’t sat well with me so far. Maybe I’m looking at all the wrong things so point me in the right direction! ?

Hmm… far be it for me to always be the Debbie Downer, the gel foundation did not make its way to my “most used foundation” list and now that I’ve given the Style Eye-Con No. 7 Plush Eyeshadow palette its chance over several uses, neither does it get a thumbs up from me. Sorry folks! Let’s cut to the chase. I am not wow-ed. Sure, we could wax lyrical about the packaging. The long slim palette is certainly different from other palettes we get out there. It is sleek, but sleekly impractical if you want to take it on your travels. Well, unless you have a large makeup bag which I don’t. I like to keep things compact when I travel. It comes sheathed in a pouch with a button to keep it closed. Again, something different from the velvet pouches we’re used to seeing from other luxury brands. But you know what? Velvet gives the impression of luxury. Polyester doesn’t. But I digress. Some people like it, I don’t because I don’t see the point. My final gripe with packaging comes hot on the heels of the sponge tip applicator that seems to have been tossed into the pouch almost as if it was an afterthought. It was like someone said “Oh we forgot to provide an applicator. Let’s just buy one of those cheap sponge things and toss it in. No one will notice” Seriously, Marc Jacobs, you would have been better off not including an applicator at all. The included one is a cheap and horrible item that you’d immediately bin and I did. Bah. Ok that said, the quality of the shadows aren’t too bad and that would be their redeeming point. I don’t have the very popular neutral Lolita palette but mine’s the rather more exciting looking The Vamp 208 palette. There are 7 good sized eyeshadows laid out in a row. If you use the burgundy shade as a mid-point, you may notice how the shades on the left are cool toned while the shades on the right have a warmer tone. The Vamp palette is therefore one of the more interesting palettes available in the collection as it will suit a variety of eyeshadow looks. I notice some fall out with the deep shades – the dark blue and black in particular tend to not stay put. The other shades seem to be of better quality. They are fairly smooth to the touch and soft, so colour is quite easily picked up. I did these swatches on my arm using my finger and just 1 swipe of colour (except for the dark blue-grey that took 2 swipes) so it is pretty well pigmented. Dark Blue-Grey : Satin texture with some silver glitter. It took 2 swipes to get it to this intensity and I experience fall out when using a brush. Shimmer medium-grey : A medium grey with shimmer and a warm base that was quite interesting. It can be used as a lid colour or as a highlight and is pretty wearable. Satin warm white : The colour with the poorest colour pay off. A brush kicks up a lot of powder and dust, but it does not translate into much on skin. Best use as a brow bone colour or to blend. Shimmer burgundy : The most interesting colour in the palette. Satin smooth, pigmented, intense and all with 1 swipe of the finger. I struggle using this colour but then I’m not very adventurous. Shimmer Emerald green : A colour I eyed up immediately as it’s been a long time since I wore emerald green on eyes. Like the burgundy, it is satin smooth, pigmented and intense. Shimmer Khaki Brown : A warm brown with shimmer that is like the burgundy and emerald green, smooth, intense and pigmented but prone to muddy on lids. Matte black with silver glitter : A normal black with silver glitter and has a tendency to generate fall out. The thing is this. While I get lovely swatches using my finger to swipe the product, I found that it did not quite translate to the same sort of loveliness and intensity when I used a brush. I use the MAC 239 to pick up colour and usually with this brush, I have little trouble packing the colour on. However, I found that while it picked up the colour well enough, I never got the same metallic intensity that I see in the pan and in my swatches. I also found that the colours, when blended together, had a tendency to look muddy, which was frustrating. However, I attribute that more to my skills as I’m not that great at doing my eye makeup. I keep things very simple and I found that I got the best results when using 2 colours max. 3 colours and I end up with a muddy looking eye. In this very simple eye, I applied the emerald green all over, using the khaki to blend and shade and on the lower lash line, with the silver as a touch of highlight over the green. It turns out a little less exciting than it looks in the swatch right? One more note – wear a primer with these shadows. I don’t wear primer on a daily basis but I usually have little to no trouble with most eyeshadows. There are exceptions of course, and this happens to be the exception. On my non-oily lids, these Marc Jacob eyeshadows fade after a few hours. The only other brand I’ve experienced this is with MAC shadows which means I’m a little less enamoured with this than most people. With a primer, you get slightly better intensity of colour and longer wear time. All said and done folks, I’m glad I had the chance to experience the Marc Jacobs Style Eye-Con eyeshadow palette, but I have no desire to get another, or to use this very much. It doesn’t live up to my expectations, and for the asking price of RM207 I’d top up a little more money and get myself a Guerlain Ecrin 6 couleurs eyeshadow palette . 6 shadows of beautiful, amazing quality that stays put and looks good all day. I wasn’t crazy about it initially, but I’ve since fallen in love with it. It’s not as exciting as the Marc Jacobs one, but it performs beautifully and that is ultimately what I want. Or I’d get a palette from Inglot for a smaller price tag or even MAC. I find them to be similar in quality anyway. In a nutshell The Marc Jacobs Style Eye-Con eyeshadow palette is a sleek, long eyeshadow palette that houses 7 shades. It comes in a pouch and a useless sponge tip applicator that should be binned. Based on the Vamp palette, I found the quality of the shadows average at best. They swatched well with fingers, but were less impressive when I use a brush. I also found that when blending, the colours tend to muddy but that could be attributed to my lack of skills. You could quite easily wear this palette in an adventurous manner, thanks to the burgundy and emerald shades, but you could just as easily wear it in a neutral manner as there are sufficient neutral shades in there. On my non-oily lids, I found that they faded after a few hours, a problem I don’t have with many brands. Using a primer helps with intensity and longevity. But I ultimately do not think this worth the asking price as I find it far too average in quality to merit the raves. Pros: Compact and sleek palette, Pigmented colours Cons: Dark colours were prone to fall out, Useless applicator included, Colours appear less intense on lid applied with a brush, Quality is average Who will like this: Fans of sleek and unique packaging, Anyone who regularly uses an eyelid primer Here’s one more thing. I found the quality of the shadows quite similar to that of Sleek Makeup palettes . I hate to say it but it does remind me of them. A lot. Sorry, fans ? Do you like the Marc Jacobs Style Eye-Con palettes? Has anything from MJB wowed you? I’m afraid I haven’t yet had my socks knocked off by anything from the brand. Perhaps it’s because I hold them to a very high standards, since they are setting very high prices. Perhaps I’m a little jaded. Perhaps it’s a little of both. I shall plod on with the brand, in search of something to like. Maybe you could tell me what you like? ? p/s To mark a personal milestone, this rather grinchy post marks Post #3000 here on MWS!

After that 3000-th post yesterday, I reckon you may be tired of just me rambling on and on eh? ? So today, I’d like to feature a guest review today of an iconic product from an iconic brand…. that I cannot use! For some unknown reason, every single version of the Shu Uemura cleansing oils break me out. I’ve tried them all, I promise. I break out every single time and I’ve chalked it up to being one of “those things”. I work well with many other brands of cleansing oils though so it’s not the oil nor the technique. It’s the product. So, when I was requested to give the Shu Uemura Porefinist Anti-Shine Fresh Cleansing Oil a go, I demurred. I no longer use cleansing oils but I was pressed into it so I decided to pass it on to a long time user for her evaluation. Porefinist is touted to be a very light textured blend of oils targeted at those with combination-oily skin, which not only cleans skin of makeup and oil but also minimizes the appearance of pores and reduces shine. I recall a similar pink version of the cleansing oil from previous years, called Fresh Cleansing Oil, if I’m not mistaken. So, I now hand you over to my buddy LeGeeque, who not only is a long time fan and user of the Shu Uemura cleansing oils, she is a long time use of the pink coloured Fresh cleansing oil, and will tell you about this and how it compares to the old version. ####### Let’s get some facts straight before we delve into the product. I’ve got dry and and sensitive skin. My major concerns are fine lines, ageing, premature ageing and sun damage. The final simply stems from my irrational fears that I’m not topping up my sunscreen as religiously as I should during the harsh Australian summer months. (According to the sun-worshipper locals I call mates, I am too sun-conscious but heck, what do these sun-worshippers know!) According to the Shu Uemura website, this particular product – Porefinist Anti-Shine Fresh Cleansing Oil – is marketed for oily and combination skin. Here’s the shocker. I’ve been using this exact product for the past 7 years! Yes, you would think that for one with sensitive and dry skin, I would be using one that’s more suitable for my skin. Pssst… Let me let you in on a very shallow secret of mine. I chose this because it was… PINK! New full bottle of Porefinist Anti-Shine Fresh cleansing oil and old empty bottle of Fresh Cleansing Oil I use the product as advised – a couple of pumps onto my dry palms. Massage my palms and apply that onto my dry skin. I gently massage my entire face in small circular motions. This effectively dislodges makeup and even waterproof sunscreen. I then wet my palms and repeat the small circular motions on my face. This emulsifies the oil and turns it milky white. I repeat that another time before I jump into the shower and wash everything off. (Pssst… Let me let you in on a naughty secret. I even massage this onto my eyes to remove my eye makeup. Just be extra gentle and make sure you have removed your contact lenses prior if you wear them) According to the instructions, this oil can be used with wet or dry hands, which is helpful if you forget and wet your hands before using it. But I use it with dry hands as advised before. It’s hard to break a habit of 7 years. Once the milky lotion has been rinsed off, my face feels extremely clean and soft. Every trace of makeup and skincare used from the day would have been successfully and gently removed. There is no tight nor taut sensation to my skin at all. Abiding by the double cleansing methodology religiously, I usually reach for my trusted cleanser to complete the cleansing routine. For a product that’s marketed for the oily and combination skin, it is not particularly drying nor harsh on my skin. I can attest to this from the numerous re-purchases I have made over the years. I have used this over harsh and dry winters where my skin is parched from heating vents and I have used this over hot and humid summers where humidity seems to be a gajillion percent. (Hair would be so Simba-like I’m certain he would be envious) The results are the same: clean and comfortable. So, when I was given the opportunity to try the new cleansing oil called Porefinist, in the familiar pink bottle, I was a little hesitant. I’m not a fan of skincare companies tweaking their formulas. When it comes to skincare, you don’t fix what’s not broken. However, after about a month of trialling this product, I’m relieved to report that all is well. If they have tweaked the formula, my skin has not reacted to it nor did I notice any additional benefits or improvements. I get the same results as I always have. I have thus come to the conclusion that Shu might have just updated the packaging and the name. So if you are already using the pink oil, just continue with it. It’s practically the same thing with a different name. At this point, I will not advise you to run out to get the biggest bottle you can land your hands on, if you’ve never used it, so I’d advise you to bribe a friend/co-worker/family who will be travelling soon to get you a sampler pack. It’s a set of 5 to 6 bottles of the different cleansers there are in the range. It’s not as painful on the hip pocket and you get to pick the best version of the cleanser for your skin. I will continue to be a loyal oil cleanser user as long as it keeps my skin happy. For now, it’s happy, calm and comfortable so I’m happy to fork out a rather large amount of money for this. Just bear in mind that it will last you for a long time so it does work out to be rather economical in the long run. In a nutshell The Shu Uemura Porefinist Anti-Shine Fresh Cleansing Oil is basically a renamed version of the existing pink cleansing oil. It has the same light feel, the same pink colour and works well to clean skin without drying it out. You can use it as a one step makeup remover and first cleanser, and then follow up with a second cleanse. It is important to emulsify the product properly as failure to do so can result in clogged pores. The formula says it works with wet or dry hands but I prefer using dry hands as I had been taught years ago. It may not work for everyone but it works for me. Pros: Clean, soft and comfortable skin. No angry flare ups nor dry, taut skin Cons: Quite a large initial outlay Who will like this: Anyone already using the pink version of the Shu Uemura cleansing oil, Anyone who wants to use a lighter version of the iconic cleansing oil Here is the ingredient list for Porefinist. Thanks for being my guinea pig, LeGeeque, and I’m glad it all worked out fine in the end! Are you a fan of the Shu Uemura cleansing oils? Have you tried this pink version? I was recommended the pink version years ago when I complained of breakouts but it too broke me out! Clearly there was something in the oil that my skin hated. It was interesting for me to know therefore that LeGeeque, who has more sensitive skin than I do, loves this oil! It goes to tell you not to judge a product by one review – always do your research and if you’re brave enough, sample it for yourself! ? Are you a fan of these cleansing oils?

I shared it on Instagram and it had me very intrigued. The reason was two-fold. First, the packaging reminds me of the very much more affordable Maybelline Lip Polish (which are really nice by the way!). Second, Dior had a product called Lip Fluid back in 2005/2006 that I actually really liked using. It came in the Dior Addict packaging, with a solid coloured opaque tube, and was a liquid lipstick that was creamy, well pigmented and very nice. Loved it and was sad to see it discontinued. Seeing a similar formula return was surprising and intriguing. So yes, I was very excited about the Dior Addict Fluid Stick , which is touted to be a hybrid lip product, that is liquid and shiny like a gloss, highly pigmented like a lipstick and with a thin film that offers comfort. The problem is, once I got hold of a few, I realised that these are quite possibly the first Dior lip products that I have little love for ? The packaging is unique, but not something we haven’t seen before this . The exterior gives the impression of a Dior Addict lipstick. It shares the same Addict packaging and looks rather like the Dior Addict Gloss . What sets it apart, is the lipstick-shaped product holder embedded in the clear base, that holds the product. So, the colour is pretty much what you will get and it’s easy to spot. Like the Addict Gloss, the top twists off but unlike the Addict Gloss, the Fluid Stick comes with a sponge applicator. While I love the brush applicator used in Addict Glosses, I have to say that the sponge applicator in this case serves a very good purpose. It is shaped in such a way that it picks up and is saturated with a lot of colour. The sponge tip is very soft on skin and it holds a lot of product in the little “well” within the applicator, so I would advise that you wipe off excess before applying to lips. The sponge too holds a lot of product, so if you want a very thin layer, you have to wipe off quite a lot and then use a light hand. The texture of the Fluid Stick is in a word, strange. I didn’t quite like it the first time I tried it and I still don’t like it much on first swipe. Dior says that they made this product without wax, and it is water based for maximum lightness and a fresh effect. To that extent I’d agree somewhat. You do not get the usual slippery, waxy feel of lipstick or gloss on lips. Instead, when I apply the product to my lips, it seems to feel almost like a film of water on my lips. Yet, it’s sticky. And that’s what makes it weird. I personally dislike sticky lip products so sticky glosses gets the thumbs down from me, as well as sticky lipsticks. I like them feeling fresh and comfortable. I love Dior Addict lipsticks and Addict glosses, neither of which I’d consider sticky. But this one feels weird on my lips. When I smack my lips together, I feel the tackiness. It isn’t uncomfortable, but I don’t like it very much. It doesn’t go away either. So in terms of texture, I’m not a fan of this. However, I have to give Dior full props for colour. There is a range of 16 shades available in the Fluid Sticks and they are very vibrant and bright. In fact, I’d say that most of the range consist of bright, eye popping shades that are absolutely gorgeous. I have 3 here for your viewing pleasure. Aren’t they absolutely gorgeous shades? These swatches were made with just 1 swipe of a cleaned applicator down my arm. The colour is amazing and I love that! 551 Aventure and 754 Pandore are 2 of the 4 colours picked out by Dior as their signature colours for this range, the other 2 being Wonderland and Mirage. I purchased 669 Rose Tricheuse because I wanted to try something a little more everyday, without realising that it was so bright! Lighting in beauty halls really need revising ? The longevity is fair for me. I wouldn’t say it’s very longlasting, but it does last me well enough for most of the morning. The Fluid Sticks apply with a high gloss shine if you go over your lips straight with the applicator, and the colour is brilliant. However, I learned that if you don’t want such a brilliant glossy shine, just lay a piece of tissue over your lips, blot it a little and the colour immediately tones down to a much more wearable, less glossy shade. I also found that lasts for me well enough through most of the morning but not through lunch. It does and will mark coffee cups like most glosses do, but the colour stays on for me. I don’t detect much of a stain but I read of some people experiencing a bit of a stain. Here are how these 3 colours look on lips for me. These were done also with just 1 swipe of the applicator over the lips. The colour as you can see, is freaking brilliant! I love it just for the colour alone! 669 Rose Tricheuse – A wearable rosy red that is a little more transparent, with a little less glossy shine 551 Aventure – An opaque orange-red with high glossy shine 754 Pandore – A bright opaque pink-red with high glossy shine. Pandore is the shade used in the promotional visuals and it’s a gorgeous colour if you have the guts to wear bright lip colours. For me, Aventure was the boldest colour for me because of the strong orange tone. I rarely wear orange lipstick because it makes me look sallow but the red tones in this one really lift the complexion and the bold orange-red pigment is very summery and fun.I love this one ? Pandore, Aventure, Mirage and Wonderland come with matching Dior Addict and Dior Addict Extreme lipsticks and nail colours. I love the colour of Aventure, even if I’m not a fan of the formula, but I found that the same colour wasn’t as bold in the solid lipsticks. I might cave for the Addict Extreme in Aventure but I might not. We’ll see ? Anyway, long story short, I’m not a fan of the Dior Addict Fluid Stick formula, but I absolutely love the intensity of the colour. In a nutshell The Dior Addict Fluid Stick is a new hybrid lip product that is a liquid lipstick with high glossy shine and the opacity, pigment and lasting power of a lipstick. The applicator applies product very well and can hold a lot of product so it is advisable to wipe off excess first before applying. The colours are brilliant especially if you like bright lip colours and I find the lasting power fair. However, I am not a fan of the formula. It feels a little strange on lips, like a film and it is tacky which is something I dislike in lip products. So I’m not a fan of the formula but I love the colours in the range. They need to make lipsticks with these sort of intensity, not the other way around! Pros: Beautifully pigmented and intense colours, Bright lip colours are very well done, Applicator is easy to use and applies colour with just 1 swipe, High gloss shine, Lightweight texture Cons: Tacky feeling on lips, A strange feeling film on lips, Pricey Who will like this: Anyone who doesn’t mind a tacky liquid lip product, Anyone who loves bright and intense lip colours For completeness, here are full face shots with 3 of the colours I have for an idea how they look. 669 Rose Tricheuse 551 Aventure 754 Pandore With the Fluid Sticks, I feel the bright colours are really what makes them special so if you are planning to get one, go for a bright shade. The intensity of colour is seriously impressive. I noticed this most when testing the solid lipsticks in Aventure. They just didn’t quite measure up to the intensity of colour of the Fluid Stick which is why I passed on them although I love the texture. Some things you just have to overlook so while I’m not a fan of these and do not plan on getting more, I will use what I have because the colours just can’t be beat ? Which colour grabs you the most? Might this be something you’d like? Do you remember the Dior Addict Lip Fluid? I actually like all 3 shades. I love the bold, fun colours but I much prefer the old version of the Lip Fluid. I remember it as having a better texture even if not such a brilliant choice of colours. Which would you pick? ?

Suddenly cream blush was back IN! I’d say its rather opportune since I’ve only just worked out how best to apply cream blush for a lovely natural look, so I was finally brave enough to tackle these. For your viewing pleasure today is the Diorblush Cheek Creme in 651 Panama and 851 Capri , 2 of the 4 shades available in the capsule Summer Mix collection. The cream blushes come with matching nail polishes in similar bright pops of colour. Dior’s offering come in a glass pot with a black screw on cap, with CD printed on the cover. What I like about the pots is that the opening is large so its easy for you to get your fingers or the tip of a brush in there quite easily. It reminds me of the pots used for cream eyeshadow and its about as big. Something that perturbs me when I open the cap is to find that the cream blush has “shrunk”. You may notice even from a brand new tub, that the sides are pulled away from the glass tub and if you are experimental as I am and upturn the tub over your palm, the cream blush falls out like a little cake. It does look very much like a macaron at this point! ? In this regard, I do think a little work needs to be done with the formula in terms of presentation. In terms of performance, I have to say, colour me impressed! The texture of these cream blushes are actually rather dry to the touch. They aren’t sticky or “wet” the way some cream blushes are and have a dry touch so it is pretty much a cream to powder finish that is comfortable for application and when wearing on skin. Left-Right: Panama and Capri You might be able to see how the blush has pulled away from the sides of the tub. I tipped Panama out by accident while taking these sets of pictures ? 651 Panama is a bright coral shade with warm orange tones. Truth to tell, I was a little afraid of it. It looks a little too bright for my use and a little too warm. The swatch which you’ll see below didn’t quite help allay my fears either. However, as you will see a little further down, when I sheer it out on my cheeks and only use a little what I get on my skin is a lovely coral-pink flush. It is a little bright, but quite easily sheered out and has a nice pop of colour. On a more medium-deep skintone, I think this shade would be made for you for the prettiest flush on your cheeks! 851 Capri is a much more acceptable to the masses light pink shade that is described as “cotton candy”. Its light, but not that light to me. This one does not swatch very impressive. It looks almost too light going on my arm but remember, you don’t wear blushes on your arms, you wear them on your cheeks! So I was very pleasantly surprised to see the very pretty fresh kawaii glow it gives to my cheeks, seemingly a bloom of youth from within. Very pretty! However, this one will likely work best for those who have light to light-medium skintones because it is a very light shade and anyone with a deeper skintone will be frustrated. These swatches of Panama on left and Capri on right should give you an idea of what it looks when applied heavily. I just rubbed my finger over the surface of the blush and drew 1 swipe down my arm. It is surprisingly pigmented! You might also see how Panama on my skin is such a bright orange while Capri is a much more wearable colour on my skintone, but how it may not show up well on a deeper skintone. But its when its on the cheeks that I think these cream blushes come into their own. They are very easy to apply with your fingers. I use my 3rd and 4th finger, pick up a little colour and then tap it on my cheeks, blending as I go. The colour goes on quite strongly but it is very easy to blend but I don’t favour this method because I find it messes up my base of foundation and concealer. However, what I’ve found is that when I use my cream blush application technique with a brush , lightly bouncing it on my skin, the colour goes on a little more light, but much more even and makes it a lot easier to get it right immediately and to add layers, and I don’t mess up my base! On left, we have Panama which as you have seen in the arm swatch above, is a scary bright orange. But when just a little is used and sheered out, I get a warm glow to the cheeks, that looks like I’ve spent some time out in the sun. This was applied using fingers and I used a little more so it’d show up in photographs. When I wear this normally, I apply a little less and it is less of a “sunburnt” look ? On right is Capri which is a very pretty glow-from-within pink on the skin. Again, I applied this with my fingers and a little more than I would wear normally so the glow is generally a lot more subtle. It does dry down to a powder finish and doesn’t really slip once it goes on. It doesn’t stain skin either, so you can wipe your fingers on a piece of tissue when you’re done and it’s clean. As for longevity, the general consensus I’ve gleaned from Tracy and Tine is that they last long, almost all day. I do wonder if it might be the climate where they are both based (cooler and drier) because here in the tropics, I didn’t experience all day longevity. It does last on me up to about 5-6 hours with no problems (and even through very vigorous house cleaning as I did after I took the photos haah! ? ) but not much longer than that. I also find that how well it lasts depends on the foundation base I use. When I use the Diorsnow BB Creme , it lasts longer than when I use the Guerlain BB Creme or the Clinique CC Cream. When I use the Revlon Colorstay foundation or the Laura Mercier Silk Creme foundation as I did in these photos, it lasts longer than when I use a more emollient foundation. So, for me mileage varies but I sort of forgive that, because the very natural transparent flush on your skin is just SO. DAMN. PRETTY. ’nuff said ? In a nutshell The Diorblush Cheek Creme cream blushes are limited edition offerings from Dior in their Summer Mix capsule collection that introduces 4 shades of cream blush and matching nail polishes. The cream blushes have a dry powdery finish and they perform like a cream to powder product so it isn’t sticky or slippery at all. It is very easy to apply whether with fingers or a brush and the colour is very easily built up. I like the transparent pigment that allows it to give your skin a very natural flush of colour, almost as if you were truly blushing from within. A very healthy sort of look, without looking like you’ve put on makeup. The only thing I don’t quite like is the packaging element where the product looks like its dried out and pulled away from the sides of the tub even though its brand new, and also how it can fall out like a piece of cake if you aren’t careful. Otherwise, these are winners in my blush book. Pros: Portable, Lightweight texture never turns oily on skin, Cream to powder finish that gives a lovely natural flush to the cheeks, Wide opening makes it easy to pick up product, Pigmented colour that is easily adjustable with fingers or a brush, Longlasting with the right foundation or in cooler drier climates Cons: Pricey, Limited Edition, Looks dry even though its new Who will like this: Anyone who likes using cream blushes, Anyone who wants an easy to use non-staining cheek colour that looks very natural on skin In case you were wondering, yes for purposes of this post, I did wear both Panama and Capri on different sides of my cheeks ? Panama on your left, Capri on your right. Other products used: Laura Mercier Silk Creme Foundation in Soft Ivory dusted with Guerlain Meteorites in Teint Beige, Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer in Vanilla Light 2, Giorgio Armani Eyes to Kill Silk Eyeshadow in #15, Lancome Gloss in Love I might even be able to get away with going out looking like this. Eh? Eh? ? Have you checked these new Dior cream blushes out? Which colour do you prefer? I spotted these at the counter early last week when I was hurrying through and peeped at the other 2 colours not featured here – Bikini 871 (a bright warm pink) and Pareo 971 (a bright deep fuchsia pink). I’m sort of glad I didn’t get those because they do look like quite a handful. But I’m also glad Dior came out with those shades because I can safely tell you that there’s a blush for everyone in this little collection of 4. Most of the shades will show up very prettily on most medium-deep skintone while Capri prettily covers the light skintones. Sometimes, less is more ?

They seem to be doing it quite often don’t they? The first of these was available about a month ago in the limited edition Spring 2013 Aqua collection. The eyeshadow palette, which you can see on your right of the image above, is the Lagoon i-Divine palette . The other palette that has just become available online only for a limited time this month, is the Showstoppers palette . You can see the palette on your left in the photo above, and what it is, is a collection of shadows from the various i-Divine eyeshadow palettes launched by Sleek Makeup. Ostensibly, its the best of the best – the best shadows from each of Sleek’s best palettes to date. I think that’s a nice little concept but… yes, there is a but. I’ll run them down quickly for you with swatches so you have an idea of what to expect. That said, if you are familiar with Sleek Makeup i-Divine palettes, you should already know what to expect, right? ? Lagoon i-Divine palette (Aqua Collection, Spring 2013) This is the limited edition Lagoon palette from the Aqua Collection for Spring 2013. As befitting the season, the colours are bright but keeping to a fresh pastel tone, and drawing from the aqua theme, has a beachy vibe to it. I must confess when I saw this, that I thought it looked very familiar. I looked back at the various colourful palettes I’ve featured so far – Glory , Aruba , Sparkle 2 – and realised that although it looks familiar, there was no one palette that was exactly the same. That said, I’m sure the people at Sleek would have done their homework else people would be rightfully pissed ? Still, it does remind me of some of their previous palettes if not the combination of colours, perhaps the colours themselves. Just something I can’t quite put my finger one. Like most of the Sleek Makeup i-Divine palettes, the shimmer textures stand out remarkably. There are only 2 matte textures in this one, and to be fair, the quality wasn’t too bad. I forgot to label and name them, so please bear with me as you do a bit of legwork. Descriptions are mine, names are theirs, and we’ll be running this down from left to right. All swatches correspond to the layout in the palette. Top Row: Sassea – a turquoise/teal with golden shimmer. This is my favourite colour in the palette and sums up the whole palette perfectly. It channels the ocean or a blue lagoon with sunlight glinting off its surface. Very lovely. Deep Water – Matte deep violet. This turned out to be quite pigmented for a Sleek Makeup matte and didn’t have too much fall out. The strong red tones in this do not flatter my skin nor eyes so its not a colour I like. Reflection – A shimmer pale pink that makes a pretty highlight and brings out the colour when you layer it over the mattes. Emerald – A shimmer green that isn’t as deep an emerald as I’d like but it keeps to the Lagoon theme by channeling the deeper depths of the lagoon. A pretty colour Oyster – A high shimmer white that can pretty much only work for a highlight or for going out partying. Not for the faint hearted unless blended out very very well. Black Pearl – A pigmented black with a little shimmer. The colour is strong and easy to blend. Beware fall out though. Bottom Row: Pink Jewel – a shimmer fuchsia that I personally find very hard to wear. Sand Dollar – a shimmering pink-beige shell shade that is very pretty worn on its own or as a highlight. One of the more easy to wear colours. Underworld – A light blue with a little shimmer, that if you aren’t careful can channel the 80’s so use sparingly. Sea Shell – I thought it would be a pretty shimmering camel but it somehow swatches on my skin bronze. A bit too warm to flatter me but it will be very flattering on warmer skintones. Night Sky – A matte lilac that is the night sky at twilight. For a matte, it is quite pigmented and smooth to apply. Ariel – a bright satin coral that I can’t bring myself to wear on eyes but which, if used with a VERY light hand, could work as a blush. I haven’t been very wow-ed by many of the Sleek Makeup palettes but this one does have merit. There is usually a dud in there somewhere in the form of a matte, but the mattes in this palette perform quite well. I think its a fun little palette for someone starting to experiment with colour. For those who prefer something a bit more neutral, you may find this one too bright. Yet, if you don’t wear colours a lot and just want a palette for that occasional wear, this makes the cut. Quality is fairly good and the small pricetag adds to the allure. Showstoppers i-Divine palette (Online exclusive) The Showstoppers palette is an online exclusive so you won’t be able to find it in stores, only at the Sleek Makeup website . This one is a combination of the best picks from each of the best Sleek i-Divine palettes that have been released so far. For those who found Lagoon too loud and brash, then the Showstoppers palette may sit better with you. It looks like Sleek picked out most of the more neutral colours from each of the featured palettes and put them together so you have a palette that is at once neutral yet with colour. Again, you have to do a bit of legwork. Swatches correspond to the layout of the palette and descriptions are mine. Please view from left to right Top Row: Paraguaya – The colour is Sandstone from the Paraguaya palette. I couldn’t get any colour to show but ideally, its a matte beige. Waste of time, if you ask me ? Sunset – Unnamed shade from the Sunset palette which is a shimmer burgandy in pan that applies on my skin a warm copper. Pretty on the right skintone, not so pretty on me. Me, Myself & Eye – We fall into a bit of confusion at this point. On the plastic insert, it says that this high shimmer white is from the Me, Myself & Eye palette but from other sources, this is supposed to be Innocence from the Bad Girl palette. Either way, its a high shimmer white that only has one function which is to highlight. Prone to fall out. Bad Girl – Another bit of confusion as this one is labelled Bad Girl in the insert but which is apparently the colour named Primal Green from the Me, Myself & Eye palette. The colour is a very pretty shimmer olive that you can easily wear on its own with black liner. My fave colour in this palette. Noir – Confusion again, as Noir is supposed to be the last colour which is a matte black. Unlike other matte blacks I’ve come across in Sleek i-Divine palettes, this is fairly pigmented with less fall out. Might they actually be improving?! As for the colour labelled Noir in this palette, it is a shimmery charcoal gray that is quite wearable. Ultra-Mattes V2 – Matte black. In fact, at this point, I’ve discovered that the names printed on the insert may have been jumbled up so I’m just going to tell you what they are based on what I see. Bottom Row: Oh So Special – A matte grey that is horrible. No colour payoff at all. Waste of space ? Bohemian – A bright matte coral-pink that could work as a blush with a very light hand. Storm – A matte dark blue that was fairly pigmented. Sparkle – A shimmer beige-cream that can be worn on its own or to add shine to one of the deeper matte shades. Au Natural – A matte maroon shade I could never pull off. Graphite – A shimmer brown but the red tones in this one makes it hard for me or anyone with cooler skintones to pull off well. I can’t say I’m impressed, nor that I’m unimpressed with these palettes. They are quite typical of the quality found in Sleek Makeup i-Divine palettes. When I do wear them, the colours do last and the vibrant colours are very vibrant. But as always, their strength lies in the shimmer colours. They did improve the matte shades in the Lagoon palette but the matte shades in the Showstopper palette were duds. Which of the 2 palettes catch your eye? Have you tried any Sleek Makeup i-Divine palettes? The funny thing is, if I were to just look at the palettes, I would actually pick Showstoppers because it looks more neutral and easier to wear. But after swatching them, I’d personally pick Lagoon. Granted, the colours are a bit bright and perhaps, harder to pull off, but the quality of the product is so much better colour for colour. Showstoppers pulled out 2 duds in the form of Parguaya and Oh So Special which really pulled down the ranking of this palette as far as I was concerned. The attractive price point however, is what Sleek has going for them so most people will be willing to overlook the duds.

But as it goes with mass and affordable products, it doesn’t satisfy the needs of those who prefer something natural or organic. So here’s one that is. Natural and organic I mean. Introducing Marius Fabre , a brand I warrant few of us have come across thus far. It is distributed locally by The Brand Story , alongside other niche brands and products, primarily in the bath and body department – a category I love to indulge in! Marius Fabre is the name of the founder of the brand, who started up brewing potions and soaps in his garden shed in Salon-de-Provence at the tender age of 22, back in 1900. Yes folks, 1900. This is a soap company that is over a century old! Their speciality are their solid soaps but I suppose we have to move with the times. Modern times call for shower gels, and Marius Fabre delivers in this one from the Olivia range – an Organic Relaxing Shower Gel with Bitter Orange Flower essential oils . The first thing I noted was the packaging. The shower gel is packaged in an opaque bottle that looks very much like frosted glass, but is in fact, plastic! Now, as much as I like the use of glass in my skincare products, I opt for plastic every time for the shower. I had a glass jar of body scrub once. An accident in the shower left me with a lot of cleaning and a bloody foot. So, lesson learnt. No more glass thingamajics in the shower! So yes, I like the rather old school packaging, with the metal twist off cap and all. I’m not crazy about the wide open mouth, because it does get hard to control the amount of product you use, and to be honest, you don’t need very much. The shower gel uses olive leaf extract and orange flower water, and it is scented with essential oils of bitter orange and mandarin. You might be wondering at this point how something that sounds so zesty and citrusy could possibly be relaxing, right? Shouldn’t it be uplifting? Energizing? Ah, have you smelled bitter orange? It has a mellow, slightly musky masculine scent that isn’t zesty at all. Contrary to what we have been led to believe, it is truly a relaxing scent and a wonderful way to wind down at the end of the day. On days when the weather feels cool, the scent makes me feel warm, as if it is infused with the warm sun. As with many natural and organic products, the shower gel does not lather up very much, but it does clean, the essential oils do a lot to relax you in the hot shower, and it really does mellow my mood. Just what I reach for, at the end of a long, tiring day. In a nutshell The Marius Fabre Olivia Organic Relaxing Shower Gel with Bitter Orange Flower essential oil extracts is a certified organic product by EcoCert and Cosmetique Bio. The non-drying shower gel contains olive leaf extract and the scent is that of bitter orange and mandarin, which is a very surprisingly relaxing scent. It smells slightly spicy, warm and a little masculine. A little product does go a long way, and I also like the simple packaging that looks old school, yet is in modern plastic. Looks lovely in the shower, smells lovely and feels lovely. Pricetag is a little unlovely, but that’s the trade off I guess. Pros: Natural and certified organic product, Non drying, Smells lovely and relaxing in the shower Cons: Rather pricey Who will like this: Anyone who wants a natural and certified organic shower gel Here is the ingredient list. I noted that it contains Cocamidopropyl betaine, which is a coconut derivative and alternative to SLS. My skin doesn’t tolerate that ingredient very well, so my sensitive hands can’t handle me using this more than twice a week, not consecutively. A good thing for me, because this bottle then lasts longer ? Not many people know this, but I am really into bath and body products. Skincare and bath and body products are my crack haha! ? I can never resist trying a new brand ? Have you heard of Marius Fabre before this? Are you into natural or organic bath products? I’d never come across them before this, but I’m going to try the bar soap next. After all, if the founder built his company on soap, it must be quite impressive! I’m not personally into nor against natural or organic products. Guess I could take it or leave it. Not terribly fussed, although of course, if a good natural option was available, then it would make sense to use it ?

Things have been quite hectic around here on many different fronts and I just haven’t been able to settle down to do much blog related stuff, nor if I’m to be honest, am I in the right frame of mind to. But, having stolen a few minutes to myself, I thought I’d do a quick, simple update. It’ll be mostly that, or silence from now on for a while, I’m afraid ? While it seems awkward coming after my rant about limited edition makeup and the effect it has on us , I’m afraid I’m going to show you something limited edition today. Bad me. I know ? The item in question is something I have a very soft spot for – Guerlain Meteorites Light Reflecting Pearls of Powder. I confess to a weakness for these colourful balls and am almost on a mission to catch them all, like they were Pokemon ? One which seems to have sidled in almost unnoticed among the Spring/Summer collections is the Aquarella Meteorites . I only spotted them online fleetingly and there doesn’t seem to be a lot of hype or information about it, which surprises me. But when I spotted them on sale during the Sephora sale a while ago, I picked up a tub. At 20% off to boot! Yay! ? This limited edition tub of light reflecting powder pearls comes in a pale pink tub, as opposed to the regular silver tubs, and the pale pink box comes in a mint green interior. This would be the newest formula of Meteorites which means it comes in a 25g tub and the pearls have a softer texture than previous versions. This also means that it is easier now for most brushes to pick up product as opposed to previously. I managed to identify 6 different shades of balls in the tub – a pearly white, a pearly champagne, a gold, a mint green, a light pink and a shimmery purple-grey. The last is the most interesting of all because I’ve never seen that shade in any of the tubs I own. While each colour is supposed to perform a different function to illuminate and infuse skin with radiance, it is quite futile even picking up colour individually, because it all blends seamlessly on the skin to a translucent glow. So, the easiest way to use this is to use a brush, swirl it over the pearls and apply to the skin. I find that Aquarella Meteorites gives skin a very lovely radiant glow that is very noticeable, without too much paleness as I’d experienced with Perles du Dragon . However, I also find it to be among the more shimmery/glittery Meteorites out there. There is noticeable glitter and shimmer on my skin especially in sunlight, and if I touch my hands to my face, it does come away with shimmer bits on it. So, while it does give a lovely glow, it isn’t as subtle as it’s permanent cousin, Clair. Guerlain Meteorites Pearls Left: 02 Clair Right: Aquarella If you compare the permanent shade 02 Clair (formerly Teint Rose) with Aquarella, you may notice how Aquarella appears to be the softer, more pastel, more shimmery version of Clair. (Please ignore what looks like red balls in both tubs, they’re all pink, it’s shadow that’s turning the colour weird) So, if you want that radiant Guerlain Meteorites glow sans shimmer, then go for Clair. If you aren’t averse to having some shimmer and highlight on your skin, then Aquarella may suit you. It after all performs the same function, and on skin, looks the same as Clair, except more “glowy”. Whether you’ll like Aquarella depends on whether you like shimmer. In a nutshell The Guerlain Aquarella Meteorites Pearls are a limited edition tub of Meteorites that, like all Meteorites powders, infuse skin with a very subtle glow and luminance that I personally find very flattering. It is similar in effect to Clair, which is permanent, but I find it to be more shimmery on skin. When you compare both Clair and Aquarella, you will notice that Aquarella contains markedly more shimmery balls, while Clair is a mixture of matte and shimmer balls of powder. I don’t find it super shimmery, but it is quite noticeable especially in the sunlight. So I prefer to wear Aquarella for the evenings, when the light is softer and you don’t looks like a character from Twilight. Pros: Adds a soft luminous glow to skin, Gives skin a flattering smoothened effect with a touch of highlight Cons: Limited Edition, Pricey, Shimmery Who will like this: Anyone who is a fan of Meteorites powders I did notice that the Aquarella Meteorites is less “dusty” than Clair so I am wondering if they may have improved on the formula a touch. Here’s the catch though – I don’t know if this is still available but when I was last at Sephora, there was a substantial number of boxes with very little interest. So if you’re interested, check this out at Sephora or at Guerlain counters. Did you grab the Aquarella Meteorites? Have you succumbed to the lure of the Guerlain Meteorites pearls yet? If there’s one item I’m a little more than bonkers over, it’s these coloured powder balls. Heaven knows why, but there’re some things we can’t explain yes? Now, have YOU succumbed? ? NOTE: I may slip into radio silence again but you can always check out what I’m up to on Instagram or Twitter where I’m most active, or just get in touch with me there. I’ll reply, just that it’ll take a while when I manage to grab a moment of peace ?

So technically, a coral coloured lipstick could be blue or green or yellow. But we’d look rather strange walking around with blue, green or yellow lips (beautiful if we were tropical fish, less beautiful on humans, I can assure you) so the most common shade we associate with “Coral” is a reddish-orange. The Lipstick Bandit assignment this time is to pick a coral lipstick. There was a bit of a debate as to what entails the colour “Coral” but I’ve always associated it with the reddish orange of a coral trout. Ever seen one? (If you haven’t, you’re in for a treat!) I think that’s where the color “Coral” comes from. I picked a coral lipstick once for the summer edition last year so I was a little stumped because as much as I love the bright shade that is coral, I realised I don’t own many. But as I started to despair, as providence would have it, along came a coral delight ? My pick for this edition of Coral coloured lipsticks is the Dior Addict Extreme lipstick in Délice layered with the new Addict lipgloss in Délice . Délice means “Delight” in French and none is as delightful as these bright sunny shades that bring thoughts of sunning on the Riviera with the deep blue sea yonder. The lipstick is in the Dior Addict Extreme formula which by way of a quick refresher is a more pigmented version of the regular Dior Addict lipsticks, without losing the balmy, moisturising, smooth texture that I associate with Dior Addict lipsticks. Délice is a new shade available from this month, and is in tube, a lovely bright coral that is a true blend of orange and red. I received these last month and have been dying to tell you about them since simply because the colour calls to me ? The lipstick on its own is glossy and fairly pigmented in one swipe and absolutely non drying on lips. Don’t expect it to last though. Lipsticks that have slip and are moisturising rarely last very long on lips but the colour is a very lovely coral that immediately brightens up the complexion. I layered it with the new formula Dior Addict lipgloss extreme in Délice which is the sparkly version (It comes in 3 formula and I’ll talk about it in a separate post) and as a colour, pulls more orange than coral. Here’s Délice lipstick layered with Délice lipgloss. It is a bright shade but not so bright that you feel self-conscious wearing it. You may also notice that it pulls more orange than red but it has a lovely way of brightening up the complexion even worn with minimal makeup as I did here. Here’s another shot to show you that no, its not as washed out as it looks in the first picture. The Délice lipgloss is very shiny and flashy. Less pigmented on its own than when layered over the matching lipstick. I like how this is orange but not orange, and bright but not too bright. Its a very fun colour to wear and definitely worth checking out if you’re a fan of the Addict lipgloss and lipstick as I am. If this shade of coral doesn’t do it for you, the rest of the Bandits will have something that you may like, I’m sure :- Beauty Reflections BellaChique ChloeAsh Eye Heart It Getting Cheeky Glitter Geek Makeup Morsels Messy Wands Mostly Sunny Musing on Beauty My Funny Valentine My Women Stuff theNotice: a beauty blog I realise the lip swatch in this post isn’t as clear as I’d like it to be, but its one of those times when I just couldn’t quite take a good enough shot to save my life. So I leave you instead of a bunch of outtakes where I was goofing off in front of the camera, trying my darnest to get a good lip swatch and failing at every turn. Ah well, at least we’d have a good laugh over it ? You may even get an idea of how Délice looks under different circumstances LOL! I love the colour – not so crazy about what I did with it ? On a related note, following on that trout pout in the montage above, here is an image of a coral trout for those unfamiliar with our pelagic friends ? This is the colour I associate with “Coral”, as nature intended. How often do you see ocean fish appear on a beauty blog? Not often, eh? ? Image was from 21food.com and yes, this is a very yummy fish. The coral trout (locals may recognise it as a “ chat sing pan ” – cantonese) is a sea fish, and isn’t technically part of the trout family but related to the grouper family. Its usually found in tropical waters worldwide and is an expensive fish when served in restaurants or even if you can find it at the fresh fish market. Best eaten freshly steamed with ginger and spring onions ? Do you have a favourite coral lipstick? Are you confused about “coral” as a colour or do you have a clear idea on what the colour looks like? I do, but then I have a very attractive (and yummy) point of reference ?

Times are hard. As much as we want to enjoy our fancy schmancy shower gels, the fact is that fancy schmancy shower gels can cost a pretty penny. What I do now is reserve them for a special treat. For daily use, I’ve been using an affordable oldie but goodie – Dove Body Wash! Well, ok this isn’t your regular Dove Body Wash, it is the new and improved Dove Body Wash containing something called NutrimMoisture™ which the folks at Dove says nourishes the skin even as it cleans. In fact, it claims to be even more nourishing to skin than bathing in milk! Cleopatra, eat your heart out! ? I have this in the variant Beauty Nourishing which is, I believe the “Original” version with the signature dark blue and white colours. There are other variants but call me old-fashioned – I never took to Dove’s other scents. I remember one that was cucumber scented in a light green bottle – anyone remember that? Didn’t appeal to me one bit. What I like about this new Dove Body Wash is that it has a luxuriously thick and creamy texture, rather like a lotion. It lathers up very very well, so I never use more than 1 pump or a little less. If you use a bath puff, use half a pump. It’s more than enough to clean your whole body, I can assure you! What I don’t quite like is the very strong perfumed scent that is the Dove signature scent. It is strong and powdery and doesn’t quite appeal to me. But there’s one thing I have to note – this body wash is kind to sensitive skin. I say so because I have very sensitive skin on my hands (not my face :P). My test for all bath and shower products is to see how the skin of my hands react to the product after a few uses. If it is harsh, then the skin of my hands will harden, dry and peel. Not a pretty sight I can tell you. I can’t touch detergents with bare hands. The effects are almost instantaneous! I can never quite say which I might react to. Many high end shower products cause this, as well as grocery stores brands. The only one so far that I go back to time and again when my hands act up is the Eucerin PH5 Wash Lotion . Now, I’ll add the Dove Body Wash to the mix. It’s been over a month and my hands are in pristine condition. No peeling nor dryness. Maybe it’s the NutrimMoisture™ at work nourishing my skin? I don’t know, but it works and this is already dragging on far too long for a review of a shower gel LOL! In a nutshell The new Dove Body Wash with NutrimMoisture™ claims to nourish your skin as it cleans. It isn’t drying, it doesn’t affect the sensitive skin of my hands, it cleans well and a little goes a long long way. The only thing I’m not crazy about is the powdery fragrance, but I’ll live. Pros: Affordable, A little product goes a long way, Not drying, Does not affect my sensitive hands Cons: Strong powdery fragrance Who will like this: Anyone looking for a non-drying budget body wash for the whole family Here’s the ingredient list for anyone interested. Have you been a Dove Body Wash user? Do you go for the original fragrance or the new-fangled ones? I used to use Dove ages ago. I don’t know how much more improved this new one is, but at least they didn’t wreck it, and its still quite nice. I also use the Dove Beauty Bar for my brushes. What do you mean you didn’t know?

Let’s be honest. It takes A LOT to wow me these days. Otherwise it’s usually “Yes, that’s pretty but haven’t we already seen something similar?” So, when I tell you that here’s a product that made me sit up and pay attention about 2 months ago, you betcha it’s something quite impressive. And it’s coming out of left field for me because it’s coming from Bobbi Brown, a brand from which I never quite expected a product that leaves me absolutely BURSTING to tell you all about it! ? Even better when it’s a product that isn’t all that revolutionary – eyeliner. How much more revolutionary can you get?! Ah but these Bobbi Brown Perfectly Defined Gel Eyeliners are so good! Imagine if you will, the smoothness and lasting power of the iconic Bobbi Brown Longwear Gel Liners but in a pencil form. No more faffing about with brushes and little tiny pots. Just twist, swipe and go! Not new right? True. But these stay on all day long, all through a vigorous house cleaning session and a quick yoga workout. Now how many eyeliners can boast that? ? The Perfectly Defined Gel Eyeliner is new from the Bobbi Brown stables and I was first introduced to it in a preview by BB Makeup Artist, Kai Vinson a few months back . He showed me this new product and used Pitch Black to line my eyes. The colour is truly, as the name implies, a pitch black! If you’re looking for a true black liner, this is it! I have been waiting for these to launch since then because I just knew, I was going to go crazy! There are 6 colours available, of which I was sent 2 by the lovely folks at Bobbi Brown Malaysia, and the minute I knew they were out at counters, I ran off to buy another 2. I couldn’t decide on the balance 2 which is why I only have 4 for now, but they are permanent so I have time to decide ? This operates like a retractable pencil liner. Twist it up to expose enough product to draw a line and then twist it back to avoid breaking. My advise is not to twist up too much, because it can and will break off and that will be heart breaking because they are rather pricey. When they come brand new as you see from Pitch Black and Sapphire, the tip is fairly sharp so you can draw a thin line very easily. Scotch and Violet Night are used and have been sharpened (a little more on that below) so you don’t get as precise an appearance. Bobbi Brown calls these Gel Eyeliners, and if you can imagine, they are rather like the gel liners but in pencil form as opposed to being in a pot. The product is very creamy and very pigmented and it draws a line very smoothly on skin, without skipping or tugging at your lid. The best part is their lasting power. I’m serious, it’s incredible! After Kai used it on me, I went home, cleaned my house (yes, with a full face on makeup on – you mean you don’t do that? ? ) and then did a quick half an hour session of yoga. When I went to clean off my makeup, I was quite stunned that after all the vigorous activity, I only have the mildest of smudges under my eyes. For the most part, the eyeliner was intact. That takes a hell of a lot of doing! If you apply it on your hand (though I’m not sure why you will) you will realise just how hard it is to remove it. You do need a waterproof eye makeup remover or cleansing oil for this one so take note of that! Here are the swatches of the colour I own in relative natural light drawn with just 1 swipe down my hand. I’ll describe it for you thus:- Pitch Black – a matte deep black Violet Night – a deep violet with some shimmer Sapphire – a matte deep dark sapphire blue Scotch – a medium toned brown with shimmer Scotch and Sapphire are colours you can wear on their own without any eye makeup and with Scotch, if you apply a thick line and blend out the edges, you can even wear it like a cream eyeshadow. It makes the colour very versatile and I like wearing it that way. On its own. Violet Night looks like a black when you draw it on, except that there is some shimmer (not as much as in Scotch) and gives a softer appearance as opposed to black. Pitch Black is as the name implies, a deep dark black. As you can see, the pigment is very strong and the texture is very smooth and creamy. Absolutely freaking fabulous! Here are some swatches I took in store under store lighting. The other 2 colours are:- Steel Grey – a medium toned matte dark grey Chocolate Truffle – a matte dark brown I may pass on Steel Grey but I may go back and get Chocolate Truffle. The reason I didn’t was that I wasn’t sure if I already had it or Scotch but it turned out I had Scotch! Chocolate Truffle reminds me of the pot gel liner in Sepia, which is a colour I used to the last bits. The reason I stopped using them was mostly due to the hassle having to use a proper brush etc etc. But now with this, it’s just a twist, swipe and go! I must say however that although it is pretty much budge proof, I do get some shadow on my lower lid when I use it on my lower lash line, to tightline and when I squeeze my eyes shut when I sneeze or laugh a lot. If I don’t do all that, I’m pretty much smudge free for most of the day. The thin nib allows you to apply the product very close to your lash line so tightlining isn’t quite necessary, and the tip also allows you to do a cat eye flick if you like that. I will say however, that for a more precise line, the pot gel liner and a brush does a smoother, cleaner job but this pencil gel liner version makes it more convenient. I do find that it blunts very easily and I only found out in store that the back end hides a mini sharpener! So if you want a sharp tip, you can sharpen it quite easily. This explains how I got the Scotch and Violet Night to have the tip again, in the picture above. They were already flat ? The other down side to the price is that I forsee it to finish quickly if you use it often. The texture is so soft that drawing on your liner results in this being used up fairly quickly. Of course, if you just draw a thin line and not thickly line to define it’ll last longer than someone who does, but it’s a point to note. Otherwise, this my friends, has me bouncing up and down in my seat with glee at its arrival. If Bobbi Brown discontinues this, I think I’ll cry. And my eyeliner wouldn’t budge even then ? In a nutshell The Bobbi Brown Perfectly Defined Gel Eyeliner is a pencil version of the pot gel liners that the brand is famous for. I like how creamy they are and how easy they are to use. It is thin enough that you can get close to your lash line and draw in a nice strong line and there is a hidden sharpener at the back to allow you to get a sharp nib if you want. The colours are fairly dark and incredibly pigmented and opaque. One pass is all you really need especially with colours like Pitch Black or Violet Night. For me, they last and last through sweat and tears and thus far, have been the only product to have truly wowed me. Absolutely worth trying, if dark, pigmented, budgeproof liners are your thing! Pros: Longlasting, Deep dark pigmented colours, Creamy and soft, No tugging or skipping on skin, Easy to use, Mini sharpener allows you to get a fresh sharp tip if you want, Budge-proof Cons: Pricey, Soft texture results in you using up more product more quickly Who will like this: Anyone who has trouble using pencil eyeliner, Anyone who wants a deep dark black liner, Anyone who likes using gel liner but wants something in a more convenient packaging Here’s an idea of what it might look like when worn. I wore Violet Night here (you can’t even see the shimmer although you can in Scotch) and this is the same look in this post if you want to get an idea of an overall look. If the nib is blunt, it’s harder to get a defined cat eye flick, so for that, the pot gel version might be a better way to go. Am I raving too much? I am aren’t I? I’m all *flaps hands* “Oh gawd! These are like, you know, the bestest liners everrrrr!!” Ok I’ll shut up now ? Does this product interest you? Do you like the Bobbi Brown gel eyeliner? I used to have Sepia, Cobalt and Hunter. The one I used up eventually was Sepia but I found having to use brush daily was a hassle so I never repurchased. It might interest you to note that I’ve replaced my old HG pencil liner ( Guerlain Kohl pencil liner ) with this one, and I tightline with the Wayne Goss Brush 8 . Yes, it’s that good! ?

There, said it. But I’m a junkie within reason (I hope!) in that I usually go with brands and products I trust, and that usually comes with my previous experiences with it. But there’s one skincare product I never quite got the hang of and that’s eye cream. Whenever I get asked which eye cream I recommend, I’m stumped simply because I hardly use any. I know I should – age isn’t kind to the delicate skin around the eyes – but I’m just bad at it. Over the years, I’ve stuck primarily to the Estee Lauder ANR Eye Cream because it’s light and it’s familiar. But even then, I’ve been tardy about it. Until now. Oh boy, you guys aren’t going to like this, but I’ve now found an eye cream that I’m happy to use twice a day, and have been, for the past 3 months ? The eye cream that has me hooked is the Dior Prestige Satin Revitalizing Eye Creme , a product from the Dior Prestige range of skincare. And you know what that means right? Yes, it’s expensive. Make no mistake! I’d been curious about the Dior Prestige line for a long time, since I knew that the Capture Totale range works well for my skin so some time last year, when I was passing through duty free, I picked up a set of Dior Prestige skincare. The Prestige skincare range of Dior is a premium range of skincare targeted at anti-aging, which they say is formulated for delicate skin and is infused with the essence and vitality of Rose Granville, a species of rose grown by Dior and is said to have twice the cellular vitality of a regular rose. The nectar or Rose Granville is used in the Dior Prestige range and soothes and repairs micro-inflammations in skin that causes skin aging, revitalizes and regenerates skin and protects skin. Mumbo jumbo aside, it smells incredibly of fresh, soft rose petals. If you love the scent of roses, you will fall head over heels for this range. I’m less of a fan of rose scents so I can’t say that it sits well with me, but from the efficacy point of view, I love this eye cream. Love! ? First off, let me just swoon over the packaging. It comes in a beautiful, heavy, glass jar capped with a golden twist off cap with the logo embedded in the clear lucite covered top. This is so luxurious, you can tell with just one look that it’s not a regular product. It just screams luxury! The packaging is rather large, which is a little different from most eye creams that come in small jars. It contains the same 15ml quantity as most eye creams, but the luxe packaging makes up the other 50% of the size. See? It’s fairly large. Twist off the cap and the product comes in a white well with a cap on the inside. The scent of roses is so strong that you get a whiff of it the moment you twist off the cap. This isn’t an unpleasant scent and can even be quite relaxing. It is that of soft, fresh rose petals, moistened by the morning dew. Very lovely, but very strong. The cream itself has a soft, satiny texture. I know I keep using the word “soft” but I can’t think of anything else to describe it. It’s soft! Being an eye cream, I don’t use very much, so I just dab at the cream with my 4th finger, spread it with the 4th finger of my other hand and then tap it around my eye area, concentrating on the under eye and the sides of my eyes. Despite the soft creamy texture, this cream absorbs into skin very quickly without leaving any greasy or oily residue on the skin. I can even use this in the morning and then follow up with using eyeshadow without any problem whatsoever, because it doesn’t make my lids oily, nor does it feel greasy. It just feels lovely. Once absorbed, I find that the skin around the eye area feels and looks soft, smooth and like satin. I’m serious. It feels THAT GOOD!! <- yes caps and 2 exclamation marks were necessary ? Another thing I notice is that my eye area always feel fresher after I apply this. I tend to neglect my eye area as I have often mentioned, and I notice these days, when I use this cream and when I don’t. My eye area always feel fresher and more comfortable and sometimes, if they feel tired, this cream freshens them right up, and keeps the skin well hydrated. I’m almost 3 months into this and although I sometimes forget and don’t use it in the morning, I have worked it into my evening skincare routine. I do still find the scent strong, but it’s nice to round off the day and it doesn’t linger much. My eyes feel good and I may be dreaming, but it would almost appear that my eye area looks better – less lined, smoother and just better. Love this, hate the price but there you go ? In a nutshell The Dior Prestige Satin Revitalizing Eye Creme is a lightweight soft satin cream textured eye cream that absorbs very quickly into the skin without leaving a sticky or greasy or oily residue. I can even use this in the day under eye makeup. It makes my skin feel soft and satiny smooth and I believe that regular use has helped improve the condition of the skin around my eye area. There is a strong rose scent that doesn’t linger, and I like the fresh feeling around my eye area when I use this cream. It’s one of the best I’ve used and that’s saying quite a lot! Pros: Lightweight cream texture, Absorbs quickly into skin, No oily or sticky residue on skin, Skin looks and feels softer and smoother with regular use, Keeps eye area well hydrated, Eyes feel fresher after application Cons: Very Pricey, Strong rose scent Who will like this: Anyone who wants a light textured eye cream that absorbs quickly without feeling oily and greasy and leaves skin looking and feeling smooth and soft, Anyone with deep pockets because this isn’t cheap!

But research tells me that this eye cream retails at RM400 or thereabouts at the Dior counters a year or two ago, although this price might have been revised by now. And we know that it’s always revised upwards, never down ? I do like this eye cream a lot but I can’t say with certainty if I’d repurchase due to the price. All things being equal, I will. It is the only eye cream I am happy using up to the last bit after all. But I’ll make sure I set up an eye cream fund for this ? Have you tried anything from the Dior Prestige skincare range? What’s your current eye cream? I have the serum and face cream from the Dior Prestige range that I’ve been using for a while as well. I like them. But I’m still a little uncertain about them, mostly because they cost so much, it’s so hard to justify using them at all ? They are quite nice though ?

One that you wrinkle up your nose at the first time you take a sniff but give it a few minutes and you feel like its the best thing you’ve worn all week? I was like that with Volutes . Volutes was a new scent released by Diptyque late last year and its taken me a while to warm up to it, as you can tell. It is a rather interesting sort of scent, as is the name (which is a real word btw not made up ? ) ‘Volutes’ as a noun and adjective refers to a coil or the scroll-like swirls that adorn columns. It also refers to whorls, swirls and tendrils usually seen with burning incense or tobacco. Granted, the latter is not very popular these days, but it forms the back story for Diptyque’s Volutes fragrance. The scent is inspired by a transatlantic journey taken by one of the 3 founders, Yves Coueslant from Marseilles to Saigon. There were exotic ports of call at Port Said, Djibouti and Singapore and Volutes draws inspiration from scents experienced during this journey – woodiness of panelled salons, spiciness of the exotic middle and far east, citrus notes of the mediterranean, floral notes of the exotic perfumes, and the distinct tobacco scent of cigarettes. All these meld into a heady, woody, spicy warm scent, evocative of an age of elegance and of exotic travels. It feeds the wanderlust in my soul and since I love travelling so much, the story appeals to me. The scent however, took some time. The opening note of Volutes is of a spritz of citrus fruits underlaid with a rather strong spiciness. On my skin, it smells initially, like wintergreen which is the scent you smell in muscle relaxant ointments. A sharp, spicy scent. I didn’t like it ? It isn’t very strong so after a while when the edge of the sharp scent was gone, I had forgotten about it. Until later that day when I found myself thinking that there was a lovely warm, woody, spicy scent in the air. It enveloped me and made me feel very comfortable. It was then that I realised that it I was still wearing Volutes, but the scent had mellowed dramatically on my skin. I might even say that it has a rather masculine edge to it. The spiciness often found in male fragrances, yet grounded, with a bit of a tobacco that brings with it a smoky feel to the scent. I personally take quite well to masculine spicy scents so this was one that eventually sat well with me. On a separate occasion, I took time to notice the scent develop and noticed that along the way from sharp spicy citrus to mellow warm spicy tobacco, it takes on a powdery floral of iris. Fortunately for me, this powdery scent does not last very long on me before it settles to the scent I prefer. From a scent point of view, I’d say this is one that is hard to like off hand. If you like something citrusy, you will like the opening note but you may wrinkle your nose at how it it goes after that. Someone I know doesn’t like this at all, because it smells too manly to her. It isn’t a male perfume (Diptyque does not differentiate between male and female scents) and is meant to be able to be worn by both, but I can imagine that most women will not go for this one because its just that bit too spicy. With Volutes, the bottle takes on a rounder sihouette. If you see some of the regular Diptyque scents , the bottles have a rather more stiff edge to them. As befits the name Volutes, the bottle is rounded transparent glass with a clear back. From the front (Picture 1 above), you see the name of the scent overlying the swirls and whorls from a steamer ship. Look from the back and you get a line drawing of the city that you approach, or leave, and the swirls of the sea. I like this little hidden treat. It took me a while to figure out if I’d like or hate Volutes but I have decided that I like it. Once I get past the initial note. So, I have to make sure that I spray it on well before I intend to leave the house, and allow the scent to develop as I go through the day. Happily, it lasts well enough into the day despite being the EdT and I get to end the day on a warm, spicy, comforting note. In our warmer climate, I think most will pass over this one in favour of something more refreshing and light. In cooler weather, I can imagine that this will take better, because it seems to almost warm you up. I suppose I’m in the minority when it comes to scents, which is why I never believe in fragrance reviews. Scent is far too personal for anyone to judge if they’d like it, based on how it smells on someone else, or how someone else perceives the scent. But if you think that warm, spicy, woody tobacco is a smell that may appeal to you, then do take a sniff at Volutes for something a little more interesting than the norm ? Have you tried Volutes and is it a scent that appeals to you? Do you have a favourite Diptyque scent? As I said, Volutes is a scent that appeals to me because I like warm spicy scents but the opening note does make my nose wrinkle a bit. I tell myself it’ll be gone soon and that I’d love it after that which I do, but some days, its just too much getting past that top note. Am still looking for a Diptyque scent that doesn’t make my nose wrinkle at the top note and which I will love all the way through. Taking suggestions before I head to the store so share! ?

If you like it, you better put a ring on it ? Its what Bobbi Brown hopes you’ll do with her Luxe Eye Palette launched for the bridal season to help you create your look for your big day. The Bobbi Brown Bride. But you know what? That rather puts me off, if I’m to be honest. Whilst its a great idea for a bride-to-be to consider, what about someone who isn’t a bride-to-be? Does it put some sort of pressure on women who just want to own this palette because they happen to like how it wears? Does even looking at it in store set off the clanging of wedding bells in the air? (If that happens, run – it might be the fire alarm ? ) Well, this were exactly the thoughts that ran through my mind when I read about the palette and also why I set it aside after I received it, not overly keen to look bridal. When I eventually picked it up and tried it, I was quite simply, blown away by how much I liked this NOT for a bridal palette, but for a very lovely, very wearable, very mistake proof eyeshadow palette. If you too feel the same way I do about marking this down for a bridal palette, don’t. You might miss out on a very lovely piece. The Bobbi Brown Luxe Eye Palette comes in a very compact and shiny metal case. There is good heft to the case which does allow it to live up to the “luxe” claims. Open the palette and you have 6 eye colours chosen to be very safe, very neutral colours. Nothing exciting, nothing that makes you go “OMG Look at that!” but at the same time, nothing brown. Nothing makes my stomach turn as much as opening up a ‘neutral’ palette to see 6 shades of brown staring at me in the face. With the Bobbi Brown Luxe Palette you get the following 6 shades which (correct me if I’m wrong) are available as singles. Here’s a quick run down starting from the Left column, running top to bottom. Cream Eyeshadow – Described as a creamy beige this is a matte shade that practically disappears into my skin. This would be the ‘base’ shade that you use all over your lid to create a base for other colours to build on. Pink Opal Shimmer Wash Eyeshadow – A shimmery nude beige with a hint of pink. Not something I’d call pink to its face because I see it as just being a shimmer neutral beige. Oyster Grey Metallic Shadow – I love this shade. Despite the ‘metallic’ tag, its not metallic at all and has a lovely satin finish. It isn’t very grey either and looks to me like a shimmer cream. I like using this one over Espresso for a very simple, very fast eye brightening look. Pink Pearl Metallic Shadow – I don’t know where all these pink references are coming from, but this looks like a lilac to me. Again, unlike the ‘metallic’ tag, its not metallic at all, and like Oyster Grey, has a lovely satin finish. It too works beautifully on its own over Espresso or just on its own with Espresso to line. Pink Lilac Sparkle shadow – Again another pink reference I don’t get. This one is sparkly as the name implies and looks to my eye like a light lilac shade. Strictly highlighter use. Espresso – A matte dark chocolate brown that is almost black. Espresso appears in almost every Bobbi Brown eyeshadow palette as the crease/liner shade. I’ve had a few BB palettes in my time and Espresso features in every single one! Can’t deny that its useful though. Here are the swatches to accompany the description. Swatched from Top to Bottom, Left column first then right column. Left-Right: Cream, Pink Opal Shimmer Wash, Oyster Grey, Pink Pearl, Pink Lilac, Espresso All the colours look light and shimmery which I can imagine will make many of you wrinkle your nose. Espresso felt and swatched a bit dry to me, and even when I use a brush it feels the same – a bit dry and patchy going on. So I have to be careful with how I apply it. Its very pigmented however, and makes a lovely liner or base. I’ve been wearing this palette exclusively for a week and guess what? I’m not tired of it. It says a lot, because these aren’t colours or textures I usually wear. I am in fact, slowly crawling out of an eyeshadow rut where all I’ve been using is just 1 single colour swiped across my lid. No inspiration. So this palette is a good way to ease into things. Here’s an idea of how I usually wear the Luxe Eye Palette. I wear Espresso close to the top lashline and smudged upwards, then I take Oyster Grey and apply it all over the lid and blend with Espresso so it gives a hint of depth as you may notice. I then take a fluffy brush, dip it into Pink Pearl and Pink Lilac, brush it over my lid and up to my brow. Done. I like the gentle shimmer it gives to the eye area and how it brightens the eye area without making it look too heavy with colour. I’ve also learnt that if I really wanted to, I can use Espresso to deepen the base for a stronger evening look. I took it with me for a quick work trip this weekend and it was lovely worn in the evening for a softly smokey look, amd transitioned into a glowy eye for the day.vIt really is quite a versatile palette and a very user friendly one, and importantly, very fast to work with. Sure, you could wear it on your wedding day, I suppose. But me, I just like wearing it everyday because it just works ? Eyes: Bobbi Brown Luxe Eye Palette | Cheeks: Bobbi Brown Apricot blush | Lips: Chanel Rouge Coco Shine Elise | Face Lunasol Skin Modelling Foundation + Nars Creamy Radiant Concealer in Vanilla In a nutshell The Bobbi Brown Luxe Eye Palette is a palette created to entice brides-to-be but I feel that it rather gives a wrong impression because the palette in fact, works very prettily for daily wear. The colours are soft and shimmery but not overly so and if you blend it out, the lids look like they are glowing which is lovely. The use of Espresso is quite important in this palette to tone the shine down and to bring depth to what are otherwise very flighty airy colours. Espresso helps give dimension to the lids and can even be used to create an evening look with this very same palette. I don’t know or think it’d work for the very dark skinned or very tanned so I do believe this palette will work best for light to medium skintones. A lovely palette. Put a ring on it ? Pros: Easy to use, light blendable colours, Gives a glow and fresh look to the eyes Cons: Light shades will not suit deeper skintones, Light colours look too similar on skin Who will like this: Anyone who isn’t keen on bright eye colours, Anyone who wants an easy to tote palette that can work easily and effortlessly for day or night I used to have a number of Bobbi Brown eye palettes and they are really nice if a little boring and I do notice that they are making more shimmer ones these days instead of satin/matte shadows as they used to before. You don’t go to Bobbi Brown for bright, striking colours but when neutrals and daily wear shades call, Bobbi Brown is usually a good place to start. Have you checked out the Luxe Eye Palette? Do you have a favourite Bobbi Brown eyeshadow or palette? I have and love Rockstar, a metallic grey that is just beautiful and super bling! I still pull it out now and then when I’m feeling like a rockstar ? Its the first time I’ve checked out Bobbi Brown shadows in a while and I must say, I better revisit so hit me with your fave shades! What say you – put a ring on it or let it go? ?

Then, a few months later, it was the Matte Balm and again, whoosh! The displays were cleared out faster than you can say “Revlon has done it again!”. Rounding off the trio is the Revlon Colorburst Lacquer Balm . Ostensibly therefore, this is one to pacify the crowd who prefers having a shine on their smackers. As the name implies, the Revlon Colorburst Lacquer Balm is a high shine lip colour that gives your lips a lacquered finish while feeling comfortable, like a balm. To stress this point further, the body of the lip crayon sports a shiny surface, and the colour of the body reflects the colour of the lip colour, which makes it easy to pull out the exact colour you want quickly. I spotted these at a pharmacy a while ago and tested them at the counter but I was not impressed. Most of the shades available, while indeed giving you that high shine and lovely slip expected of something called a “Lacquer Balm”, sported glitter and sparkles and boy! I’ve outgrown all that ? One or two weren’t as blessed by the glitter fairy and thankfully, Flirtatious is one of them. I’ve got some swatches and thoughts on this but more importantly, I’ve also decided to give a quick comparison with the Just Bitten Balm Stain and the Matte Balm just to point out the similarities and differences of each so settle in for a bit of a read ? The colour I have is Flirtatious , which looks to be a rather bright red in tube. My kind of colour! If you look at the crayon bit, you may notice the sparkles which are very obvious. When I wear it however, I find that the sparkles in Flirtatious are small enough so they reflect the shine and gloss but they don’t sit on your skin. That is very important for me, because I just don’t do glitter anymore. If I were younger then yes, it would pass as youthful exhuberance. At my age, it just looks like I’m trying too hard ? Here are some shades I swatched at the counter a while ago. I can’t recall the colour names now, but I wanted to show you the sparkles and chunky glitter in some of the colours. So thankfully, with Flirtatious (4th from left), I can sport a flirtatious pucker without looking like I just raided the makeup kit of a teen. It does have that minty taste now associated with all the Revlon Colorburst balm pencils, and although I’m still not a fan of it, I let it slide. The longevity is pretty good as far as I’m concerned. It does slip off a little more easily than the Just Bitten Balm Stain and the Matte Balm, but it’s good enough to last you through the morning. I do find the colour not as intense, which I attribute to the shine and balm factor. You will see a swatch further down of Flirtatious on my arm (and the colour looks so different as opposed to wearing on my lips!) but here’s how it looks when I wear it. The colour glides on evenly and with a lovely shine. Flirtatious is a bright red with a slight blue base so find it quite flattering on, especially when you keep the rest of your makeup fairly neutral as I have been lately. Not much mood to put on colour, but give me a bright lipstick and I’m set to face the world and slay dragons! ? But despite all this, I don’t know. I’m not feeling this one y’know. I don’t know if it’s the texture but I just don’t feel as much love nor rave for the Lacquer Balm as I have for it’s siblings. I was raving over the Balm Stains and the Matte Balm truly floored me , but this one… hmm… meh. That’s all I feel. Meh. In a nutshell The Revlon Colorburst Lacquer Balm is a high shine lip colour in crayon form. I don’t find it drying and it slicks on well pigmented and delivers the shine as promised. I do however find that with shine comes sparkles and chunky glitter in some of the shades and I’m not a fan of that. On an overall basis, I’m not taken with the Lacquer Balms and I much prefer either the Balm Stain or the Matte Balm both of which I feel are more unique and interesting and truly deserving of their raves. The Lacquer Balm is ok. Nothing to really write home aboue. Pros: Affordable, Pigmented, High shine lip colours, Not drying Cons: Some colours have chunky glitter Who will like this: Anyone who like high shine lip colour with sparkles Comparison: Revlon Just Bitten Kissable Balm Stain vs Revlon Matte Balm vs Revlon Lacquer Balm I contemplated a separate post for this but figured I might as well quickly run down the similarities and differences in the 3 different texture of the Revlon lip crayons available so far. Packaging In terms of packaging they’re all packaged the same way, in a twist up lip crayon style packaging, that is very portable and easy to use. The colours on the body and cap reflects the lip colour in tube, and the different textures sport different looks so it’s really easy to spot the Matte Balm from the Lacquer Balm, for example. Flirtatious Lacquer Balm swatches a berry on my arm but as a red on lips. Very strange! Texture and pigment In terms of texture they all sport a similar balm base so it glides very easily on skin. In terms of how they fare:- Balm Stain (formerly known as Just Bitten Kissable Balm Stain) – More balmy texture compared to the others and has the sheerest pigment of the 3 although it is fairly pigmented on its own. It offers a stain on lips after it wears off and is fairly long lasting. Matte Balm – Not as balmy but still glides on easily and has the strongest pigment and most opaque coverage of the 3. I don’t find these as matte as the name implies and it also offers a stain on lips after the colour wears off so it’s fairly longlasting Lacquer Balm – In terms of balm texture, it fits in the middle and in terms of pigmentation it also fits in the middle. It delivers a higher shine and has the shortest staying power, offering little to no staining on lips. All three have a minty taste and scent although I feel that the Lacquer Balm is the strongest and lasts the longest. As you can see, the Lacquer Balm sort of falls in the middle of everything which might explain why I feel it so be so average and unexciting. If the Lacquer Balm was a colour, it would be beige ? Overall My personal preference would be for the Matte Balm first followed by the Balm Stain . As far as the Lacquer Balm goes, I’d take it or leave it. Mostly, I’d leave it because it just isn’t as special nor as spectacular as the Matte Balm. For someone younger, I think they’d prefer the Balm Stain or the Lacquer Balm as they both are a bit sheerer in terms of pigment and give a nice shine to the lips. For someone older like me, the Matte Balm is one of the best matte lipsticks I’ve tried in a long while that I’m happy to purchase and wear over and over. If you’ve been curious about these, I hope this brief run down helps you decide ? Do you like the Revlon Lacquer Balm? Have you tried all 3 textures and if so, how would you rank them? I’m curious to know if you like the Lacquer Balm, since I’m so ambivalent about it. I just didn’t feel it lived up to its potential. But I personally love the Matte Balm but then it could also be because I haven’t had a lot of luck with matte lipsticks ? You?

How else does it explain how some scents smell like a flower garden on some people yet on me, makes me smell like I fell into a sewer? You see, the scent didn’t choose me ? Which brings me to Penhaligon’s of London , a niche fragrance house that hails from England. I seem to recall seeing the iconic flacons sold at Isetan KLCC but I cannot say for certain because I don’t seem to recall it being very prominent. However, I have always held a fascination for the brand so last year when I was down in Singapore, I decided to pay the Penhaligon’s boutique at Marina Bay Shoppes a visit. To cut a long story short, I ended up walking out with Zizonia from the Penhaligon’s Anthology series. If you’ve never been to a Penhaligon’s boutique, I highly recommend it. I walked in there feeling rather uncertain, knowing the name of only one perfume – the very popular Juniper Sling. I was served by a knowledgeable gentleman who, instead of pushing me fragrances, instead asked me what sort of scents I liked. So, I told him I went for something a little spicy, woody a hint of sweetness but nothing strong or cloying or floral or fruity or sweet. Basically, I avoid most girly scents. Right off the bat he told me Juniper Sling wouldn’t work for me but I had to try it. I mean, so many people love it! So I did, and gag! I smelled like I’d just poured a bottle of gin all over me and had inbibed glasses of alcohol. I reeked of it! Once we got that out of the way, I was open to trying something new and I was handed samples of Zizonia and Malabah. I actually tested quite a few different scents, and I realised that the scents at Penhaligon’s are quite different from those at other niche brands like Jo Malone or Diptyque which I’m a little more accustomed to. They’re quite different from the regular counter perfumes as well and I liked that difference! The flacon is prettily packaged for one. Penhaligon’s fragrances come with a jaunty bow in different colours tied around the neck and the shape of the bottle is quite distinct. When I eventually told the SA that I would take Zizonia, he actually told me that I had expensive taste, because it turns out that Zizonia is part of the Anthology Series, which is a series of classic Penhaligon’s perfumes from their archives and only came in one size – 100ml. Regular scents come in 50ml and 100ml sizes which of course meant also that this was more expensive. The box tells the story of Zizonia which was a perfume originally created in the 1930s and is described as a “nomadic and mysterious oriental, an odyssey of burnt spices, patchouli and pepper, leading to a lush oasis of sweet orange, ginger and vetiver. Heady and exciting” You know what? It is. I had to have it. On me, Zizonia has a very distinct scent that I have not found in any other brand. Despite being an Eau de Toilette, I find it fairly longlasting and it sits well on my skin for almost the whole day. At the end of the day, I still smell whiffs of it which makes me very happy. At the first sniff, I get a sharp peppery and spicy scent that to some hints at masculinity. For me, it hints at warmth. It then settles down quite quickly to a more well rounded, slightly sweet orange and bergamot scent tempered with a woody vetiver and settling down on my skin as a spicy, warm, oriental, woody scent. It’s wonderfully complex and incredibly unique and I love this one! Officially here is the breakdown of Zizonia scent: Head notes: Orange, Bergamot, Coriander Heart notes: Lavender, Nutmeg, Cardamom, Ginger, Geranium, Black Pepper, Cumin Base notes: Patchouli, Amber, Cedarwood, Vetiver, Sandalwood I don’t spray on too much as I feel it to be a bit strong, and since it lasts on me, I’m quite happy to be economical with this. In a cooler environment, this warms me up but even when it’s hot as it is here, I don’t find it too strong nor too heady although those who aren’t fans of spicy scents might. I wear this quite often and it’s quickly become my signature scent simply because it’s incredibly unique. The other nice thing about these niche perfume brands is that the scents aren’t segregated into men or women perfumes. Anyone can wear any scent, so long as you like it! I would peg Zizonia for a slightly more masculine perfume scent but if you like slightly masculine scents and oriental spicy scents then you may like Zizonia. But if you are a girly girl in your perfume preferences then this one will not be for you at all. But then, there’s always a perfume for everyone and as I believe, it will choose you ? One more thing that I loved about the Penhaligon’s boutique. After packing up my perfume, they sprayed their Penhaligon’s tissue paper with my choice of scent i.e. Zizonia, wrapped everything up and placed it in a paper bag. When I got home, I used the tissue paper as liner for my drawers and everytime I open my drawer, I get a whiff of Zizonia. Absolutely wonderful ? I’m happy Zizonia chose me ? Have you tried Penhaligon’s fragrances? Do you have a fave from this brand? I’m very new to Penhaligon’s and since I don’t think we have a boutique here, it’s going to be hard for me experiment a little more but I suppose I could always save it up for the next time I visit Singapore or come across a Penhaligon’s boutique anywhere in future ? If you have a rec, please share. I’d love to check it out! Paris B Penhaligon’s Anthology Series Zizonia Eau de Toilette Price: S$290/100ml Availability: Penhaligon’s boutique in Singapore']"

I quite often feel like a salmon swimming upstream when this happens, beating fruitlessly against the mainstream of raves and rah-rahs coming my way. But swim upstream I shall ? The Bobbi Brown Smokey Eye Kajal Liner was launched late last year in 6 new shades, 2 of which are shown here in that useful Noir (black) and Jade (blackened green). Like most kajal liners, they are soft and very easy to draw a line and smoke out. The sponge smudger at the back of the pencil helps too! I like how a sharpener comes packaged with every pencil. I loved it when Guerlain did it and I love that Bobbi Brown is doing it. It just makes it so much easier to not have to hunt down a sharpener when your eyeliner is getting dull and best of all, you know it’ll fit and reduce wastage. But what’s this swimming upstream business then? Well, these last all of 2 seconds on me. Ok, I lie. They last a little more than 2 seconds. 2 minutes maybe. Bobbi Brown Smokey Eye Kajal Liner Left: Noir Right: Jade If they lasted longer on me, I’d tell you that these are very lovely eyeliners. Noir is a deep rich black that applies so easily on skin, almost as if like it was charcoal. Jade is a very interesting silver-green shade that is quite dark and very interesting. The texture is soft like a kohl pencil and it is about as deep and dark as a kohl pencil. I tried them to line my eyes, tightline, line on my waterline and as a base for a smokey eye. They are great for lining and especially for tightlining, which I do a lot of. But for some reason, they smudge right off my eyes almost immediately. I can’t do anything with them! This is unusual for me which is why it bears mention. As a base for a smokey eye like this tutorial here , it is nice. It gives that depth of colour to eyeshadow and eyeshadow helps it stay on better. However, for some reason, this really moves on my skin so I’m left with a lot of creasing. Again, unusual for me. I like the colours and the depth of blackness Noir gives but I just can’t deal with it slipping and sliding and creasing so I’d have to be that salmon that swims upstream against the tide of raves and say that these Bobbi Brown Kajal Liners, lovely texture as they are, just may not cut it for some. And by some, I mean me. In a nutshell The Bobbi Brown Smokey Eye Kajal Liners are very lovely and soft and line the eyes without tugging on skin. Noir is a very presentable black that is very deep and a true black. They all come with a sponge smudger at one end and a sharpener which makes it very useful. I however find that they smudge and run too much on my eyes. They don’t stay on which it a pity as I like the soft texture and the depth of colour. Pros: Lovely soft texture does not tug nor pull at the skin, Easy to use, Comes packaged with its own sharpener, Easy to smudge for a smokey eye look Cons: Does not stay on my eyes, Smudges for me when used as a liner, Creases for me when used as a base Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for a dark, soft, easy to blend eyeliner Have you tried these Kajal Liners? Did you like them? Instead of using a pencil liner, I’ve been using a dark/black eyeshadow to tightline a lot in recent times, and it’s been working very well for me. I’ll show you soon. As for these, I’m afraid that salmon you see is me swimming against the tide of mainstream opinion that says that these are longlasting, dark, easy to use liners that give you a beautiful line and a soft smokey eye ?

This has been one such post/review in making. It’s taken me 2 years. 2 freaking years to tell you about a blush! Man, I better get lots of good karma after this! ? I bought the Benefit Hervana Box of Powder Blush over 2 years ago and although it took me a while to warm up to it, I actually really like it. I picked this as one of the 5 light pink blushes you can consider if you’re in the market for one because it does give the skin a very pretty flush of pink. And really, who can pass up a chance for some good karma eh? ? This was the Benefit Cosmetics blush that first came with the new flip top packaging. All Benefit blushes now carry a flip top packaging. They used to be lift off covers. If you remember those, raise your hand! ? I remember then being quite pissed with it because if you’re careless or in a hurry, the sides can dig into the box and deface your blush. However, the thing is, in the 2 years I’ve owned this, it’s never happened! So really, you have to quite careless about it and I guess I never have been. Like all Benefit blushes, there is a plastic insert that holds a brush. The Hervana brush is a little different from other brushes because it is an angled brush with white natural hair bristles and it’s not bad. The natural hair picks up the colour much better and although it is a little rough on skin, it does a good enough job in a pinch. I may be ambivalent about most Benefit Cosmetics products, but their Box o’ Powders have a special place in my heart because they were one of the earlier blushes I owned, and they are really quite good. I have almost all of them except the latest Rockateur, Hoola and Dallas because they’re all too dark for me, but the other colours get a lot of wear and that’s saying a lot, considering how many blushes I actually own haha! ? Hervana is also one of the more interesting Benefit blushes that come with different colours in one compact, the other being Sugarbomb . Unlike Sugarbomb which is very light and very shimmery, the cool and deeper lilac tones blend very well with the warmer peach tones to give skin a lovely neutral pink colour without looking like you’ve been glitterbombed. It isn’t quite matte either, but it isn’t noticeably shimmery and it makes a great everyday blush. As it’s so hard to get a good swatch of a colour this light, here’s the comparison swatches from this post . Hervana is No. 4 so you can just imagine my frustration trying to get another swatch as clear as this one was. It’s hard! If you want it deeper, layer it on and it layers quite prettily. I do find the texture of the brush a little harder than say Bella Bamba or Coralista but it also means the margin of error is less if you’re afraid of looking like a clown. There’s almost no fear of that happening with Hervana. You will almost always end up with an angelic glow on skin ? Here’s how it looks when I wear it. I like to use a slightly denser blush brush with this one because of the harder texture. It gives me more colour. If I use a softer blush, the colour is a little more diffused so a lot depends on the look you’re going for. It applies on my skin as a soft very natural pink glow. Very fuss free and very nice. I’m not sure how well this will show up on deeper skintones because it’s so light. You might have to layer it on a little more but if you don’t mind the hassle then it’s a very pretty colour to consider. As a tip, I usually buy my Benefit makeup online from their website or StrawberryNET.com . The local counter prices are generally far too marked up for my tastes although it appears the prices for the blushes have dropped, but you know, old habits die hard and you never know when it will go up again ? In a nutshell Benefit Hervana is one of my favourite blushes which is saying a lot when you consider just how many I have! The packaging is portable, the cardboard is hardy and hasn’t even looked battered despite my taking it on my travels occasionally, the included brush is handy to use and the colour is a very neutral, complexion perky pink. On light skintones, I think this one very lovely but on deeper skintones, you will have to build up colour and not everyone will like that. Absolutely worth taking a look. Pros: Nice natural pink that will suit most skintones, Not powdery, Compact packaging, Included brush works Cons: None unless the price is an issue for you Who will like this: Anyone who likes a fuss-free warm-neutral pink blush, Anyone who wants a portable blush with an included brush that works You know, when a blush tells you that you’ll have “good karma” it almost makes it too hard to pass up ? And I’m glad I finally got this out – it’s been my 5th photo taking attempt! Are you a fan of Hervana? Do you like the Benefit Box o Powders blushes? If anyone’s keen, I’ll do you an overview of the Benefit blushes I have ? So far, I’ve not been disappointed by any of the colours except I know of course, to stay away from the deeper ones. Do you like them too? Paris B Benefit Hervana Box o Powder blush Price: RM110, US$28 Availability: Benefit Cosmetics counters or their website or on StrawberryNET.com']"

Kinda cool, especially here in our warm tropical climate. How about neon MATTE Coral lips? You know, if you’re going to try a bold lip colour, or a new lipstick texture, it’s always great to have an affordable option. Just in case you hate it you know. At least your wallet won’t cry. Well I’m not one for matte lipstick myself. From experience, they tend to make me look older (Heaven knows, I don’t need to actually LOOK my age do I?) and has a tendency to dry out my lips. Well, the Maybelline Coloursensationals Bold Matte lipstick promises not to do all that. The one I have here is Maybelline Bold Matte lipstick in Mat 2 – Sugar Pink. I’ve seen about 5 shades available at the pharmacy when I was last there, but only Mat 2 had a name on the base. The others go by numbers so you have Mat 1, Mat 2 etc. They all come in varying shades of bold reds and oranges. Quite unique for something from the drugstore. Mat 2 Sugar Pink is a bright bright coral in the tube that is almost neon in it’s brightness. I was a little afraid at first. Yeah, I was! You see, colours like this can go one of two ways on my skin – beautifully brighten up my features, or make me look sallow and sickly. No middle ground here. Which was it for me? Ahh…. But first, let me tell you a bit about the texture and to see just how well it lives up to its “bold” and “matte” claims. Here’s Sugar Pink in the tube. Yep, that fulfils the “bold” claim alright. Unlike many matte lipsticks, it doesn’t have a dry look to the texture in the tube, and there appears to be some shine on the product. Swipe it down my arm once, and here’s the colour. Against my skin, Mat 2 Sugar Pink pulls slightly more red than orange (thank goodness!) and it is surprisingly easy to apply, without tugging. Colour is pigmented and bold just as promised. On lips, you may notice a distinct shine. Eh? I thought it was supposed to be matte? Ah with all the hydrating claims that Maybelline promises, the matte texture just got a little lost. It is matte but yet there is some shine so it’s not 100% matte. Did it even make sense? ? I did find that if you have dry bits of skin on your lips, it can catch a little if you apply straight from the bullet, and make the colour look uneven. You may notice some of it in the picture. If you exfoliate your lips and apply some balm and then slick this on, it will apply more smoothly. The colour is as you can see, a very bright, almost neon coral that pulls a little more red on me than it looks in the tube. That made me happy because I can’t wear orange lipstick at all! Longevity is good. It lasted me through the morning although it might start to fade if you eat and drink a lot and it might fade a little unevenly. The best way to touch it up is to wipe it all off and reapply. It didn’t leave my lips feeling drier than normal (not hydrated though, just not parched) but if you have naturally dry lips then be warned that you may need some balm underneath to feel comfortable. Here’s how Mat 2 Sugar Pink looks on me. Nice right? Haha… self praise ahem ahem! But Mat 2 is a lovely bright and brightening colour for lips and despite the little shortcomings, I’m quite liking it because the pricetag is small, it’s a great way to play with new bold colours and who knows, you may even discover a new colour that suits you – I did! ? In a nutshell The new Maybelline ColorSensationals Bold Matte lipsticks are a range of bold and bright coloured lipsticks with a slightly matte texture. I say “slightly matte” because it does have some shine to it that keeps it from looking too dry or being too drying on lips. The lipstick is very strong and very pigmented, and the texture can catch on dry or flaky bits of skin on lips so you have to be sure your lips are smooth or apply a thin layer of balm underneath to have a smoother base. I like the bright bold colours and I think it’s a great way to try something new without hurting your wallet. Longevity is quite good although I find it fades a little unevenly. Best to wipe off and reapply for a more even finish. Pros: Affordable, Bright and pigmented colours, Long lasting, Not too matte Cons: Texture can catch on dry or flaky lips, Not as matte as the name implies Who will like this: Anyone who wants to try a bright bold lip colour without shelling out too much money One note about the packaging. The matte, translucent cover corresponds to the colour of the lipstick inside ( remind you of anything ? ? ) so it makes it easy to pick out the colour you want. Despite looking quite luxe, it does feel rather flimsy. The metal bit is just plastic so it’s very light and if you’re used to the heft of a pricey lipstick then you will feel the difference. Then again, it’s RM29.90 so really, I’d forgive them that ? Have you taken a look at these Bold Matte lipsticks yet? Do you wear matte lipsticks or do you prefer some shine? I personally prefer lipsticks that have a bit more slip and shine. Totally matte lipstick tends to age me and I don’t need that so I go for something with a creamy texture with some shine but not necessarily shimmer because shimmer can look weird once you’re past a certain age too! That said, these aren’t half bad. I’ve always had a soft spot for Maybelline lipsticks. They were one of the first I ever owned ? Paris B Maybelline ColorSensationals Bold Matte lipsticks come in 5 shades locally – Mat 2 Sugar Pink, Mat 4 Vivid Coral, Mat 5 Bold Red, Mat 6 Maroon Red, Mat 7 Nude Beige Price: RM29.90 Availability: Maybelline counters at most major pharmacies']"

You now that feeling don’t you? Ick! So I later turned to using body oil and never looked back. But recently I was introduced to this hand and body lotion from Ecoya that had me a little intrigued. I knew Ecoya was an Australian brand of candles, but I didn’t know they had body care products too! The Ecoya Hand and Body Lotion comes in a few gentle scents and the one I have is Sweet Pea and Jasmine. These are the same scents available in Ecoya’s candle range so yes, you can smell like your favourite candle scent hehe! Now, I was a little concerned when I first saw the name because jasmine isn’t my favourite scent, but I was willing to give it a go for the greater good, as it were. I’m so happy I did! The Ecoya Hand and Body Lotion is, as the name implies, a Moisturising lotion for hands and body. I used it mostly for my body, primarily my arms before I go to bed. Can be treating the face every evening and neglecting the scaly arms now, can we? ? The bottle is an elegant, tall bottle with a pump that dispenses just about the right amount of product. I like the opaque creamy bottle with the delicate lace print on it, and the light coloured label which shows you the name of the scent. It fits nicely in an elegant and contemporary setting. Very nicely done! The lotion itself is quite impressive. It isn’t too runny and light, yet it isn’t sticky or oily on skin at all. For someone who dislikes using body lotion, I did find myself reaching for this one on some nights, by passing the body oils in its way. Sweet Pea and Jasmine is labelled as a floral scent, which had me a little worried. I’m not exactly your biggest fan of floral scents. Thankfully, the sweet scent is quite light and not cloying at all. It is a delicate, gentle scent of flowers, lightly anchored with the heavier scent of jasmine. If you dislike the smell of jasmine like I do, then fear not. This doesn’t make me gag at all so that’s another point in its favour. My skin does feel softer on my arms with regular use but I am not so sure if it was just used for hands. It feels very light and absorbs very quickly into my skin and just doesn’t quite hit the spot for my hands. I also prefer my hand creams not to have too strong a scent, and especially not a floral scent so this isn’t something I’d use as a hand cream, but then I’m not into hand cream so don’t listen to me ? If you do use it just for hands, I can imagine it’ll last you quite a while! The downside of course, is that it’s a little pricey, but with Christmas just around the corner, I can tell you that this will make a very lovely gift ? In a nutshell The Ecoya Hand and Body lotion is a skin moisturising lotion that leaves skin feeling lovely and soft and moisturized with regular use. It isn’t oily nor sticky at all, and leaves skin feeling almost velvety. I like it for use on my arms but I’m not sure if it’ll be good for very dry hands if you intend to use it as a hand cream. The scent is light, thankfully, and despite the floral nature, not cloying nor too strong. For someone who shies away from body lotion like it was a skin stripping acid, I have been reaching for this often for the past 2 months and that tells you something eh? Pros : Light lotion absorbs easily, Not oily, Not sticky, Light scent is quite comforting Cons: Not sure if it’ll serve well as a hand cream for dry hands, pricey Who will like this: Anyone who hates regular body lotion, anyone who likes the lovely light floral scent Here is the ingredient list for anyone interested. I just picked up an Ecoya candle in French Pear and Lemongrass and Ginger and you know what? I think I want to get the body lotions too! Me? A confirmed body lotion hater? Yeah you heard it here first ? Have you tried Ecoya body lotions? Do you like their candles? I picked up 2 candles recently at The Brand Story’s booth and dammit, I want even more! The Lemongrass and Ginger makes my house smell like a spa and immediately makes it feel absolutely wonderful. The sense of smell is a wonderful thing. Try it if you don’t agree! ? Paris B Ecoya Hand and Body Lotion comes in 6 scents Price: RM125/250ml or AU$24.95 Availability: The Brand Story website in Malaysia']"

I have a lot of brands to compare with, and I live in Asia which is like face sheet mask central. I use one almost weekly or twice a week. You guessed it, I have a lot to say about face masks and I have, right here ! The sheet mask brand in question is the Michika Green Tea Face Mask and is sold out of a small set up in Australia. The Michika Green Tea Face Mask, or to give it its full name “ Michika Complexion Synergist Rejuvenating An-Fatigue Face Mask ” comes in a pack of 5 and has as it’s key ingredients, Vitamin C and E, Green Tea extract and hyaluronic acid. The green tea extract is supposed to calm skin and even skin tone without containing harsh chemicals so it suits sensitive skins too. More importantly, I was curious about how it would fare. The packaging is simple. What you get in a box is 5 individually sealed packs of face masks. To anyone already familiar with using face sheet masks, this is the norm. They are all single use packs and contain one cloth mask inside, infused with a serum or essence that contains the key ingredients. I found that the mask itself was made of a relatively thick material so it wasn’t flimsy and did not tear easily. There were also many cut outs along the side of the mask to enable it to fit different face shapes better. This is something I think is important. A mask with multiple slits in the sides allow you to layer and overlap so your mask fits your face. There are also 2 flaps for the eyes so you can relax with it on, or have a nap (although I’d caution against leaving it on too long) The other thing I noticed was that it was fairly large, so it went all the way up to my hairline. So far, all plus points. Some Asian brands have their masks in a smaller size so that bothers me, and fit is always a big issue for me. I was however not very pleased with the way it adhered to my skin, in that it did not adhere very well. The top half was fine. It doesn’t slip. However, the bottom half had a tendency to “flap”. It would not stay wrapped around my chin and this was even when I was lying down. It could be partly to do with the size and partly with the texture of the serum/essence. The essence is very light and comfortable on skin with a faint green tea smell. But because it is so light and non sticky, the mask tends to dry out a little more quickly than one with a stickier texture. It also wasn’t as drenched with essence as some of the ones I’ve used. It was good for about 15 minutes of relaxation but not much more for me because it started to dry out about then. Tip: In warm weather, keep the mask in the fridge for a few minutes before using for a cool treat. In cold weather, dipping it for a minute into warm water e.g. while in a tub may make it feel more comfortable (but beware not to use it while it’s hot because that’s bad for your skin!) The after effects were nice. As when I use most all face sheet masks, my skin feels cool to the touch, I massage in the remainder product into my skin and follow up with my skincare. I do not personally find it much more moisturising than other similar products I have used, but it is comfortable for a quick pick-me-up. On an overall basis, I think this a nice basic sheet face mask. It’s comfortable, does not irritate my skin, is not overly fragranced and leaves my skin feeling nice and hydrated without a sticky after feel. All that said, it would be hard for me to say I’d buy it simply because I have easy access to many brands, which do a very good job and which are more affordable locally. So, I would find it hard to dig into my wallet to pay AU$28.30 + $12.50 international shipping (approx RM84 total) for 5 sheet masks. However, for someone who is based in Australia, who doesn’t have as ready access to sheet masks, or who wants to try one by a local brand or who has never used a face sheet mask, then I think it might be something they’d be more willing to buy, and if so, it is definitely worth a try. In a nutshell The Michika Green Tea Face Mask is a face sheet mask from a company based in Australia. The ingredient list is short and the essence is not sticky nor uncomfortable. I did find however, that because the essence is not very sticky, the mask does not adhere to the skin as well as a stickier one and it does dry out a little more quickly. In terms of providing a boost of hydration to the skin, it does do the job well, and also feels comfortable and cooling on the skin. It does however meet a lot of competition from the Asian face sheet mask brands which are very affordable here where I live hence my note about the price. Pros: Not sticky, Skin feels cool and hydrated, Gives skin a quick calming boost of hydration, Good fit over a large area Cons: Pricey, Dries out quickly Who will like this: Anyone who likes using face sheet masks, Anyone who is based in Australia and who doesn’t have access to other brands of face sheet masks Here is the list of ingredients, for those interested. Has anyone tried this brand by any chance? Do you use face sheet masks regularly? I use them about once a week, usually on a Sunday. It’s my little pampering ritual before the start of a new work week ? Sometimes, I even use it twice a week for a quick pick me up. I find that using a sheet mask regularly does help my skin stay more hydrated but I am a little more partial to the ones out of Taiwan, notably My Beauty Diary and L’Herboflore ?

No one realised it, probably but that’s how I like it! I was there for just a short trip and this trip, I wanted to do something different. I wanted to do something I’ve always wanted to do – go to a cooking school and learn some Thai dishes! Many places offer these short cooking school sessions, where you can join for half a day or so, and learn to cook the local food so you take home more than just memories. You take home a taste of the country you visit. I love the idea and I’ve always wanted to do it so, I did. Before I left, I looked around on the internet for recommended cooking schools in Bangkok and you’d be surprised to know that there are so many! Most of them take you on a buying/familiarization trip to the market as well, which is interesting if you are foreign to the exotic South-East Asian region. I eventually stumbled upon Baipai Thai Cooking School . Reviews were very good, the website was professionally laid out and although it was more expensive than others I surveyed, they offered a hotel pick up and drop off, which I fully appreciated. So, I dropped them an email and it was sorted! Payment is made at the school itself after your class so that was easy! I was notified of my pick up time at my hotel and at the appointed time, a large van with a friendly driver in uniform identifying the name of the Baipai cooking school was waiting for me. We drove around picking up more “school mates” from various hotels in the city before heading off to the school. In our party that day were visitors from Macau, Japan, Korea and Guadeloupe, the last of whom was a chef himself! The Baipai Thai Cooking School is located just after Chatuchak and it is deep inside a housing area, so I appreciated that they offered a pick up service. I don’t know how I’d have gone there otherwise. Along the way, the van dropped off most of the people in the van at the Or Tor Kor Market for their market familiarization trip. I opted out of that because I live in this region and I’m quite familiar with most of the herbs and spices used. I just need to know what goes into the recipe ? Arriving at the school is a pleasure. It is a large spacious wooden bungalow with a large garden and is so serene and tranquil that you are immediately put at rest. A lovely cold and delicious cup of lemongrass tea is served, you are handed your apron and recipe cards and off we went for a trip to the herb garden. As I said, I’m quite familiar with most of the herbs and spices used in the cooking in the SEA region but it was a very good refresher course because this time, I learned what Thais use in their cooking. There were 4 of us in our party for this initial part of the session, and our guide for the day was a lovely girl who spoke fluent, accentless English. Holy Basil – a strong aromatic herb used a lot in Thai food. I’d been wondering what this really smelled like so I was very pleased to find out. The leaf is often used in cooking my favourite meat with basil and offers a peppery taste. Galangal – a type of root similar to ginger with a strong flavour so only very little is needed. Important in making tom yam Different types of chillies – large red chillies offer colour with little heat, green jalapeno chillies with medium heat and offering green colour to cooking and the tiny bird’s eye chilli ( cili padi ), only the 2nd hottest chilli in the world! Yours truly brandishing a stalk of lemongrass, used a lot in Thai cooking for almost anything from soups to steaming fish We were then shown the sauces most commonly used in Thai cooking, including the ever popular pungent fish sauce, and how to choose a good one so we don’t end up gagging from the pong (go for a light and clear coloured liquid) and also how to grate coconut, which was to form the main ingredient in our first dish. I’d actually grown up seeing people grate coconut the traditional way, using a scraper to get the flesh of the coconut into fine strips to make it easier to squeeze out the coconut milk, but this was the first time I had to do it myself! And I did it on a contraption called “The Rabbit” which I was told is very old, and a traditional shape of … erm a rabbit. You sit on the back like so, and scrape the coconut on the scraper to get the fine shredded coconut flesh that you can sprinkle over dessert, or squeeze to collect the fresh coconut cream. So much fun! ? The cooking area is an open area which, despite the heat was surprisingly comfortable. There was a prep area inside and a frying area which was more open, where each of us had our own cooking station. I thought it was very well organized in this regard. It was just a half day course, with 4 dishes to go through so for the most part, the ingredients were prepared for us in the required portions. I read some reviews that said they didn’t like that but I understood the need for it. Time was limited, and not everyone wants to get down and dirty with it. This is like instant cooking school – just add hot water and you’re done. Some ingredients for making tom yam goong (sour and spicy prawn soup) We started out making Coconut-egg Custard dessert ( sangkaya ) which was so crazy easy, I’m going to have to whip it out one day just to show off LOL! ? It isn’t something I’d usually eat, but when it’s something you make with your own hands, you just have to, you know ? I also learned to make Green Curry Paste from scratch, and it was my first time ever, eating the dish much less cooking it. I never used to eat a lot of Thai food until quite recently and it was gratifying to see my paste come together. It was surprisingly quick, but it has to be noted that for the most part, the ingredients were already prepared. We just had to pound them and bind them all together. If I had to make this truly from scratch, I might balk a little, but it’s primarily a matter of getting all your ingredients together and it just flows from there. So, here’s what I cooked with my own hands that day at Bai Pai – we had to eat it, so you betcha it was edible (and delicious, if I don’t say so myself LOL!) Golden Moneybags – fried wontons tied with pandanus leaves. While this isn’t that hard, and I’ve made fried wontons before, none of them have ever looked this good! I finally learned how to make the folds at the top. Yay! Tom Yam Goong – The one dish I specifically wanted to learn. I made mine without adding in milk because I prefer my tom yam to be clear. It was perfect and I’m going to have to practice this one so I can, ahem! show off hehe… Green Curry Chicken – We made the paste from scratch and then cooked the curry. I didn’t realise we needed to use so much coconut cream! I asked if I could substitute it with something else but the teacher made a face and told me to stick to coconut cream LOL Not something I’d make in a hurry but at least I know how to ? Sangkaya Coconut Egg Custard Dessert – served chilled, this was surprisingly delicious. Creamy and smooth and because I made it myself, not too sweet. We were told to eat the first 2 dishes immediately after cooking them and there is a long table provided where all the students could gather and admire each other’s efforts. If you go with friends, this would be a good time to run a taste test! As for the Green Curry Chicken, after cooking it, we were directed upstairs where we could partake of our curries with generous helpings of fluffy white steamed rice, and for dessert, we had our coconut egg custard! ? Those who went to the market had fresh fruits instead so no one felt left out. Chef PB hard at work! I thoroughly enjoyed the half day session and if time had permitted, I’d have come back the next day to learn other dishes. It was a lot of fun, although it was warm as the day wore on and it was tiring (try cooking 4 dishes in as many hours while wielding a heavy mortar and pestle!) but I had a wonderful time. The staff were very friendly, the teacher was fun and spoke English and gave instructions clearly enough. The class costs THB2,200 per person or THB4,000 if you are 2 people. If you go in a bigger group, it costs a little less per person. Not terribly cheap but not terribly expensive either. You get to take home your recipe booklet, you will be emailed some photos and some additional recipes, and you are given a lovely souvenir of a fridge magnet with your photo in it. Add in the transport to and from your hotel and I think it’s a pretty good deal overall. As I said at the top, there are other cooking schools around, some of which are much cheaper at about half the price of this one I picked. I might try them next time. Or I might just end up at Baipai again. I’ll decide when I next head to Bangkok ? Have you been to a Thai Cooking School before? Do you enjoy these sorts of holiday pursuits? This is my first time doing something like this and I had loads of fun. Then again, I do enjoy cooking and preparing food so it suits me. I think there are some similar schools like these locally so I want to check them out as well. If anyone has recs locally or abroad, I’d love to know so I know where to try – I’ve never tried any local cooking school yet! ?

Aptly named Dark Spell , the collection is deep, dark and mysterious with generous lashings of black and glitter infused darkness. Pretty much like this Baked Eye Colour in Mystical . In the Dark Spell collection there are 2 black eyeshadows. One is a Satin Matte Eye Colour in Dark Spirit – a pigmented matte black powder eyeshadow, and the other is the Baked Eye Colour in Mystical – a dark black baked eyeshadow shot through with lots of silver glitter. I’ve got an overall view picture and view of the Dark Spell collection below, but I’d like to go into a little more depth with Mystical, and to show you just how you can achieve a very simple and wearable smokey eye look in just about 1 minute with just one shadow. Which girl doesn’t need that, I ask you? ? The Baked Eye Colour formula can be used wet or dry, and is fairly large in the pan. It is also very glittery. Seen here, it is as if the surface of the moon got dusted with glitter and presented to cast a dark spell. You will see all the fall out in the pan and the shape in pan isn’t very even either. Chalk it up to it being a baked formula. If you use a damp brush you could use it as a liner. Here are the swatches dry on my skin. Laura Mercier Mystical eyeshadow Left: 1 layer, light hand Right: 2 layers, heavy hand As you can tell, you can quite easily build up pigment or use it lightly over a base. It is, as you will note, glittery. Not shimmery but glittery with relatively chunky glitter. Can’t say I’m a fan of that. But I also have to say that I’m not much of a fan of baked eyeshadow formula. From experience, they tend to harden too quickly and have poorer pay off. As you can see, the colour pay off isn’t bad in this one, so that puts paid to my theory ? So what’s this 1 minute smokey eye look then? I found that if you just pick up Mystical and apply it all over your lid and blend it out, you get quite a simple and lovely eye look with just 1 colour. I use a dense brush and start from my lashline, concentrating colour there, then apply more over the lid. I then switch to a blending brush and blend out the edges to soften. Done! And here’s how it’d look. Mystical on the upper lid and smudged on the lower lid. Tightlined and mascara. Use more colour at the base, less as you go upwards but do note you get all that glitter along for the ride. I don’t experience much fall out (or maybe I didn’t look into the mirror during the day) but I didn’t seem to get any glints of colour on my cheeks. No black colour fall out either and I didn’t use a base. If you do, you get more intense colour. Here’s how it looks overall. Not overly done is it? Also featuring: Laura Mercier Silk Creme Foundation in Soft Ivory , Guerlain Meteorites Teint Rose , Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer in Vanilla, Dior Addict Extreme lipstick in Lucky , Bobbi Brown Pink Coral blush For more intensity, pack on more colour. For less, blend it out or use a lighter hand. I won’t say I love this one because I’m not a fan of baked eyeshadows, and you could quite easily achieve this look with another black eyeshadow but the glitter and the buildable pigment in Mystical is what makes it easier to work with than most. Enough perhaps, to put someone under your dark spell ? In a nutshell Mystical is a new and limited edition colour by Laura Mercier for their Dark Spell collection. It is a baked eyeshadow formula and I find the product in pan a little powdery with some fall out. The colour is buildable and can be both sheer or strong. However, the glitter is quite apparent although I did not experience fall out with this shadow when used on my eyes without a base. I like using Mystical alone, for a simple smokey eye look. It is very easily blended out and works very well alone which makes it quite practical. I won’t say it’s a must have nor that it’s a special colour, but if you don’t have one like this, it’s always worth having it. Pros: Easy to blend, Easy to pick up colour with fingers or brush, Colour intensity is easy to build up and sheer out Cons: Glitter in product will not appeal to everyone Who will like this: Anyone who wants a very simple and easy to work with dark eye colour and who isn’t afraid of having glitter Laura Mercier Dark Spell Collection : Fall 2013 Now for the full Dark Spell collection. Missing is one of the eyeshadows in a light glittery shade. 2 things that attracted me were the Kohl Liner Extreme (RM69) which is a kohl pencil that you see with the pointed tip. It is creamy and intensely dark and you can use it as an eyeliner or a base. I’ve never owned one of these before! Also in the collection are 2 limited edition nail lacquers in Forbidden and Bewitched (RM69 each) and a lip plumper in Charmed (RM95). The other item that I was very keen on initially, is the Spellbound Face Illuminator (RM159) highlighter. That’s the pan on your right with the wavy texture. Here, let me show you a close up ? Better now? ? I was very taken with this, which is a shimmery highlighter with rose gold tones. Very pretty! When used on the model, it was applied on the cheekbones and down the nose bridge and also on the collar bones and decolletage. Yes, it can be used on the body too ? It is quite a large pan and I predict this will sell out quickly because it’s very pretty. However, I’ve finally decided I’m not getting it right now because I haven’t been using highlighters a lot, and I’m concerned that a rose gold shade may not sit well on my skin which takes better to champagne tones (also takes better to champage. Period. LOL! :P) Does Mystical eyeshadow grab your fancy? Are you eyeing any product from the Laura Mercier Dark Spell collection? I was quite keen on Spellbound initially, but the feeling has passed. If you like highlighters, it’s worth checking it out because I remember previous Laura Mercier highlighters were in great demand and this will not be an exception.

So having a brand tell you that their interpretation of Summer is for transparent textures with shine to capture the gold of the summer sun, I found it interesting. That is RMK’s interpretation of Summer. I think, if you look at their new Ingenious W Powder Eyes eyeshadow duo, you get an idea of what they’re on about. This is 1 of 5 new eyeshadow duos available from RMK. I believe the colours are permanent except for one EX-01 Gold which is a Gold-Silver duo that I personally wasn’t taken with. Its just pretty much glitter all over and not practical. If I’m to be perfectly honest, I initially passed over this Brown duo too. My previous experiences with RMK eyeshadows haven’t been the best. I found the texture too hard, the formula too sheer and shiny, and the colour payoff too poor. Sure, the Deep Iridescent one was pretty , but the way it was laid out was mind boggling. But the minute I took my finger to swatch this one, I paused, whipped out my camera and had to take pictures before I marred the surface further, because this one is quite quite impressive! Interestingly, I noticed that many of you have noticed how lovely this one looks on eyes in a previous look I showed . That assured me I wasn’t alone – this does pass the test! So while I wax lyrical about this RMK Ingenious W Powder Eyeshadow, I’ll also show you some of the other items available from RMK in their Summer 2013 collection in a quick overview. Like that? Settle in. Let me do the overview first and get it out of the way. There are basically 5 new shades of eyeshadow set in duos. These are the RMK Ingenious W Powder eyes. One side is a pigmented base colour and the other side is a high shimmer highlight shade. I can imagine the glitter-shimmer can and will put people off but this is a trait of RMK shadows and as you will see below, its not that scary. Trust me ? EX-01 Gold (Limited edition) – High shimmer gold and high shimmer silver – primarily highlight shades 01 Green – Deep green with shimmer and light green with silver shimmer highlight 02 Brown – Deep bronzed brown with shimmer and light gold shimmer highlight 03 Purple – Deep navy blue with shimmer and light silver highlight 04 Grey – Deep grey with shimmer and light silver grey highlight There are also 3 new sheer powder cheeks blush, all of which are limited edition. I happen to love RMK blushes. They are quite quite something as the texture is very impressively soft and the colour it gives to the skin is so natural. But truth to tell, none of these grabbed me. I found them all far too warm for my liking (Yeah I know its Summer but I’m not into the whole orange/brown/bronzed look) so felt no tug at the ol’ heartstrings. Also included are 4 limited edition lipglosses. Again, nothing that tugs at the ol’ heartstrings. I’d be more than happy to pass on these (and so will you) because I don’t think they are terribly special. I’d rather get one from Dior ? And that sums up my thoughts on RMK Summer 2013 – look at the eyeshadows (worth checking out) but skip the rest unless you like warm toned blushes, then take a look at the blush. Otherwise your money is safe ? RMK Ingenious W Powder Eyes – 02 Brown But that brings me now to the one item in the collection that I think is worth taking a second look at – the Ingenious W Powder Eyes eyeshadow duo and in particular in the shade 02 Brown . In pan, it looks blah. Come on, you agree right? Its got blah written all over it ? The packaging is the signature shiny RMK packaging and it comes with a very serviceable brush. If there’s one brand I never tell you to throw out the applicators of, its RMK. The applicator in this duo is a lovely firm brush that works so well, I use it. I know, shocker! ? What I think surprised me most about these shadows was the texture and the pigment. This swatch was made with just 1 swipe of my finger over the shadow and down my arm. Its pigmented. Make no mistake! The colour side is a warm toned brown with iridescent golden undertones while the shimmer side is a golden fine milled shimmer primarily for highlighting purposes. What I noticed about the product is how well is “stretches” and applies on skin. Blending is a breeze and if you brush it over your lids and buff it in a little, it almost looks as if your lids have a lovely satin finish. Oh and it lasts. All. Day. Colour me surprised! Here’s how I wear 02 Brown in the easiest manner possible because I’m not a talented makeup artist who has the imagination and time to make something extravagant out of this. I use the brush applicator and apply the brown base colour all over my lid, putting a little more colour nearer to the lashes and blending it outwards so there are no harsh edges. Then, I take a dab of the gold side and apply it over the brown from the middle, blend and I’m done. I told you it was easy ? You might see how the gold sits quite prettily over the brown and highlights the middle bit of the eye. It isn’t super shimmery and if you blend and buff it out a little more, it gives a very lovely golden sheen to the eye that is at once pretty yet natural. Here is how it’d look in an overall look that I did. Also wearing: Guerlain Beauty Booster BB Cream Light, Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer Vanilla Light 2, RMK Blush Creamy Sheer Powder Cheeks 01 Rose , Lipstick Queen Sinner Red , RMK Ingenious W Powder Eyes 02 Brown and lined with Guerlain Kohl pencil in black If you’d like to see another angle of how the eye looks, this is the same look in the Lipstick Queen post and there’s a picture there of the eyes from a different angle. I must say, I was surprised that I liked this particular shadow. Its not a colour I usually go for, its not even a brand I usually look to for eyeshadow, but if you are looking for a neutral shadow with just that pop, take a look at this one. Not too impressed with the rest of the colours to be honest, but the Brown is one I can see most people using ? In a nutshell The RMK Summer 2013 collection boasts a new eyeshadow in the Ingenious W Powder Eyes eyeshadow duo, 3 limited edition blushes and 4 limited edition glosses. I found the blushes too warm for me so they did not attract me. The lipglosses didn’t either and personally I’d pass on both. However, the eyeshadow duos surprised me because the texture was very lovely soft, smooth and incredibly fine milled and it looks like satin on skin once it’s blended. The shimmer side can be a bit bright but if you blend it out it gives skin a beautiful highlight. I personally would pick 02 Brown because it is so wearable and easy to use, and can suit so many people. Deepen it with another dark shadow or liner for an evening look or wear it as is for the day. Worth a second look. Pros: Blushes have a lovely soft glowy texture, Applicators included are of very good quality, The Brown eyeshadow duo is a very lovely pop of neutral colour that is very easy to use for everyone Cons: Pricey, Blush shades are very warm toned, Eyeshadow may be too shimmery for some Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for a neutral warm brown eyeshadow with gold accent, Anyone who enjoys RMK products Have you tried anything from RMK yet? Did anything from the Summer collection catch your eye? If you’re new to RMK, I suggest checking out their base makeup first , their eyelash curler and then their blushes. Eye makeup is mostly a miss unless this new Brown duo catches your fancy, and their lip products aren’t very inspiring. But who knows eh? Some very interesting things are coming out of the brand in recent times ?

No? I have to lay off the caffeine ? But this is how I felt when I tried these new (and limited edition) Estee Lauder Pure Color Sheer Rush lipglosses . I’m not a lipgloss girl at the best of times but you know, when everyone is going “Ooh its summer! Sheer colour is in!” and when I have to shield my eyes against the scorching sun rays every time I step out of a building, suddenly I’ve been globbing on lipgloss like I was born to do it. I was really keen on these Pure Color Sheer Rush glosses because… look at the colour in tube! They look so bright and intense and … BRIGHT! Guess what? They aren’t. They are sheer glosses. The name is a dead giveaway. These glosses are part of the Cello Shots capsule makeup collection which also feature a sheer liquid blush and a lipstick. I wasn’t sure how to group them at first but when I slicked on the lipgloss, I knew I had to tell you about the lipglosses first, because I love them. Its saying a lot you know. I have very set preferences for lipgloss and so far, only 2 brands have managed to keep me loyal – Dior and Guerlain. I had an Estee Lauder Pure Color gloss from a while ago, but I wasn’t enamoured enough to go back to the counter. These Sheer Rush glosses are changing that, pronto! Left-Right: X-pose Rose, Patent Pink, Hot Fuse There are 6 shades in the collection and I’m showing you 3 of them from 3 different colour families. Interestingly, these glosses have corresponding matching colours in the Lip Shine lipsticks and the Sheer Rush cheek colours, if you are minded to go all matchy-matchy. What I think I like most about these glosses is the texture. They apply on lips very sheer in comparison to the intense colour you see in the tube. It is rather deceptive but the texture wows me. It feels like a thick layer of non-sticky, non-goopy jelly over my lips and it makes my lips look like 2 quivering bits of translucent jelly. As you can see, the colour appears as just a tint on the lips and if you don’t wear them side by side, you wouldn’t really be able to tell the difference. The colour that surprised me most was Pink Patent which is a bubblegum pink in the tube and which is never a pink I’d wear voluntarily. Its a colour I run away from at the first sight of it. But it was also the most “intense” of the 3 shades I tried. The texture is a little more opaque and it is also a little more opaque on lips so it does give lips a pink tint that is surprisingly flattering! I was very surprised. Hot Fuse is the bright red shade in the tube which I can imagine sends many people screaming in the opposite direction. But on lips, it is a translucent red that is not too bright at all, yet gives that tint of freshness. Layering it on doesn’t increase the intensity very much. X-Pose Rose was another surprising colour. In tube, it looks like a violet which is again, not a colour I’d voluntarily wear. But on my lips, it became a lovely rosy berry shade that turns out to be a shade I wear all the time. You may also notice how much fuller my lips look wearing these glosses ? Longevity is surprisingly good. I wear this in the morning, have my coffee, have mugs of water and if I’m not too violent about things, the lovely shine and colour remains till I head out for lunch at about 12-1pm. It feels practically weightless and it isn’t sticky. I think I mentioned that but its worth saying again. Its not sticky! You get shine without shimmer and without goopiness! Win! ? (1) X-Pose Rose (2) Pink Patent (3) Hot Fuse These are swatches on my arm where you can see the colour better. When you wear them on lips, they will naturally blend and reflect your natural lip colour so no 2 people will have the same sort of colour on their lips. The applicator is your regular doe foot sponge applicator and I do find that it will apply the product slightly unevenly, as you can see in the arm swatch photo above. The sides will have more product than the middle so you do have to blend it out a little as you go. Not my favourite applicator style (I prefer brush applicators) but it does touch ups very well. I’ve given X-Pose Rose pride of place in my daily makeup pouch, next to my Dior Addict Icone lipstick and a Dior Addict lipgloss. Yes, its earned its stripes ? And here’s me wearing X-Pose Rose in a full face shot. Also used: Kanebo Lunasol Skin Modelling liquid foundation OC-01 , Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer Light 2 Vanilla, Benefit Bella Bamba blush , Giorgio Armani Eyes to Kill eyeshadow #4 Pulp Fiction It isn’t that sheer is it? You still see a lovely tint of translucent colour on lips with a very nice shine. Not too formal, but not too much of a party look either. Love this! ? In a nutshell The Estee Lauder Pure Color Sheer Rush lipgloss has a high shine effect with no shimmer and a translucent jelly texture on lips. I like that it feels lightweight and does not dry my lips out. It almost feels moisturizing when I have it on, like jelly on my lips. The colour is a sheer hint of colour that is very pretty and it does not feel heavy, thick, goopy or sticky at all. The downside is that these are limited edition products and are available while stocks last. Pros: Lovely jelly texture offers high shine and plumps up lips to make them look fuller, Translucent colour and shine gives a fresh look, Not drying, Not sticky, Moderate lasting power Cons: Limited edition – should be made permanent! Who will like this: Anyone who likes non-sticky lipglosses with no shimmer and with a jelly high shine effect I haven’t been wowed by many things recently, but these blew my socks off. I’m not so sure about the Cheek Rush gel cheek colours yet. My socks are still pretty much on when I use those but I’ll share my thoughts on them soon. Tom Pechaux has done for EL what I never thought anyone could do – he’s made their makeup very appealing! ? Have you seen these? Which colour would you pick? I thought these would be the regular EL glosses but I’m glad they weren’t! Sheer lip colours may not be everyone’s cup of tea but you know, when you live in a hot sunny country all year round, its good to have one of these in your makeup pouch for those lazy no-lipstick days ? My fave colour is X-Pose Rose – no surprise its wriggled its way into my daily lipstick pouch ? Paris B Estee Lauder Pure Color Sheer Rush Lip Gloss comes in 6 shades – X-Pose Rose, Hot Fuse, Patent Pink, Plexi Pink, Techno Jam and Poppy Shock Price: RM80 Availability: Estee Lauder counters Limited Edition: Yes, Cello Shots 2013 collection']"

Its debatable how necessary they are for a healthy beauty routine, but I thrive on regular facials and massages. It may not be necessary, but it helps me keep my sanity and that makes it necessary, right? ? So, I’m always looking for new spas and massage places to try out. About 2 months ago, while I was having my haircut, I browsed through a Harper’s Bazaar magazine that had a whole section on spas. I was doing my best to memorize every single one (failed of course – should have bought that issue!) One of the winners of the Bazaar Spa Awards was St. Gregory Spa at Parkroyal Hotel Kuala Lumpur and I was planning to visit but kept putting it off until, as providence will have it, I received an offer to try the award winning “Most Soothing Body Rejuvenating Ritual” ~ A mother’s day special package. It was so good, I signed up for 2 more on the spot! ? St. Gregory Spa is located on the 6th Floor of the Parkroyal Hotel Kuala Lumpur, which is very easily accessible by public transport. Hop on the Monorail to the Bukit Bintang Station and you’re there, just next to the Lot 10 shopping mall. The area isn’t very large, but it is cozy. I found the music, whilst soothing, a little loud which is the comment I left in the comment feedback form so I do hope they turn it down a little next time. I also noticed that they do facials using Thalgo products and from a previous experience, Thalgo products are really nice for the skin. I was given a feedback form to fill to inform them of any ailments I might be suffering from and then, I had a tea menu where I could pick my choice of teas that I could have immediately, or after the massage so I opted for after the massage. The room was fairly large with a very comfortable firm massage bed. Here’s a touch I like. There is a heating pad on it, so when you lie down, your body is kept warm and I like it when spas do that, because sometimes the air-conditioning can be too cold. Keeping warm also means you are more relaxed and there is a very high chance you’d drift off to dreamland. Quite perfect for me – I’d not been sleeping well at all for weeks and my dark eye circles are testament to that! The Most Soothing Body Rejuvenating Ritual (RM260 nett Mother’s Day promo price until 31 May 2013) starts with a Thai Herbal Compress. I’d always wanted to try this! The herbal compresses are kept heated in a steamer and the massage therapist will gently “pound” it all over your back, concentrating on the lower back and shoulder areas which are areas where most of us will experience stiffness, especially if you sit a lot. The compress contains a selection of Thai herbs and the soothing herbal smell relaxes you, while the warm compress relaxes your muscles. 30 minutes of the Thai Herbal Compress (usual price RM140) later, my back is warmed up and relaxed and it was time for the 50 minute Balinese massage (usual price RM230). My masseuse, Mia, had a surprisingly firm touch for her diminutive size. Not too painful though, and she was sure to check if it was, and adjust accordingly. I was off in dreamland at this point, so I can say for certain that it was a very relaxing experience. Is there a difference between a luxury spa and a regular spa at this point? Yes, there is. Its all there in the little touches – warm heating pad on the bed, attentive masseuse, pleasant friendly service that never make you feel rushed. I haven’t been to many luxury spas here in KL, but I suppose there is a reason why the St. Gregory Spa has won the “Best Luxury Hotel Spa” Award (Malaysia) for 3 years running at the World Luxury Spa Awards 2013. Sure, its also pricey but they do consider themselves a ‘luxury spa” and the prices do reflect that ? After I was done, I had a quick shower in the en-suite shower stall, changed and was escorted to a relaxation room where I could have my hot tea that I’d chosen earlier. It was 80 minutes of sheer bliss. In fact, it felt so good, I bought 2 more sessions under the Mother’s Day promotional price of RM260 (only valid till 31 May 2013) so I could return without having to shell out for the much bigger price tag if I buy them separately – I know, I know, sneaky me ? You can do that if you like. Just pay up front for the package, then come back later to enjoy the service. The spa manager, Li Ping is very helpful in this regard and helped me make a note of my purchase so I won’t encounter problems later. In a nutshell The St. Gregory Spa at Parkroyal Hotel Kuala Lumpur is a luxury hotel spa and that is reflected in the prices. The spa area isn’t very large but the rooms are a good size and comfortably lighted. I liked that there was a shower in mine so you can rinse off the oil after you’re done with your treatment. I enjoyed the treatment I had and if you can get any promotional spa packages, I think its worthwhile trying it for the experience. I’ve already got 2 more sessions lined up! ? What I liked: Heating pad on the bed helps you relax, Attentive masseuse, Relaxing environment, Shower in-room What can be improved: Music was a bit too loud, Towels provided were a little inconsistent in quality and could be a bit more luxurious Who will like this: Anyone who appreciates a good relaxing spa and massage experience I learned that the St. Gregory Spa is a regional chain from Singapore so its also available in various luxury hotels in the Region. In Malaysia, you can find the St. Gregory spa at Parkroyal Hotel Kuala Lumpur and Parkroyal Hotel Penang. Have you been to a St. Gregory spa? Have you tried a Thai Herbal Compress treatment? I particularly enjoyed the Thai Herbal Compress which did a lot to relax my tense muscles. I’d been meaning to try one of these for a while but never got round to doing so, so it was a great experience! Are massages your beauty guilty pleasure too? ? Paris B St. Gregory Spa is located at Parkroyal Hotel Kuala Lumpur (Tel: +603- 2782 8356) and Parkroyal Hotel Penang in Malaysia. Spa treatment packages will vary in prices and you can check out their latest promotions at their website .']"

We’re going to be seeing more of these pop up under the many different brands in the market, so let’s just say that BB Creams are here to stay. I can’t escape them either so I will be telling you about the different ones I come across from time to time. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em you know ? Today is the Kiehl’s Actively Correcting & Beautifying BB Cream which has received pretty good press so I have to confess I was quite interested in this one. The Kiehl’s BB Cream (as I’ll call it) is released as a part of their sunscreen range so if you can imagine, this is like a tinted version of the sunscreen. I believe there was a tinted moisturiser available (which was not available in Malaysia, I believe) but that’s been now discontinued. The only tinted item in the Kiehl’s arsenal will be this BB Cream. I played about with this sometime in December 2012 but have only now had a chance to trial run it properly. I have to say that I liked the Kiehl’s UV Defence sunscreen . It was a little heavy so a common complaint was that it would turn oily on most people. I never quite found it very oily but that could be because I’m quite used to oily sunscreens. I was introduced to the Kiehl’s one after using La Roche Posay Anthelios and that one is much oilier (although I do still like it) so perhaps I’m not your best person to ask. Bearing that in mind, and the fact that most BB Creams do tend to have a slightly oilier texture, I was curious to see if this one would combine to be a disaster. Happily, I’d like to report that it isn’t a disaster at all! In fact, I have to say that I do like the texture a lot. It does not oil up on me, and neither does it feel heavy or slip and slide around on my skin. The Kiehl’s BB Cream comes in 3 shades – Fair, Light and Natural – and this is something I appreciate in a bb cream. It is a fact that we do not all have the same skintone (If we did, cosmetics companies would go out of business!) so I can never understand brands that do not cater for different skintones and steadfastly insist that one tone can work for every skintone. Face it, it doesn’t. That said, from recollection, the 3 shades available under the Kiehl’s BB Cream do tend to be for the light-medium skintoned. If you have very dark skin then you will still be hardpressed to find a BB Cream in your shade. I took a look at the international site and saw that their BB Cream comes in 4 shades. I take the shade in Fair, which is a fair, slightly pink toned shade that blends well into my skintone. Here’s a swatch of the product straight from the tube. On left is the swatch applied more heavily and on right, is the product blended. Fair blends right into my skintone. The other shade up in Light, from memory, has a touch more yellow tone. In tube, it does look quite dark which belies the colour when applied on skin. Packaging wise, it has the same packaging as that of the sunscreen, which is a flat, small, wide tube. This makes it very portable, but it also means that it is quite small. Considering the asking price of RM140/30ml tube I’d say its quite high priced, the same way the sunscreen is a bit too pricey even for me. Kiehl’s says that this BB Cream will conceal imperfections with lightweight buildable coverage and correct skintone irregularities with the vitamin C ingredient in there, that helps clarify the skin. It also comes with a high SPF50 PA+++ rating for sun protection, and is paraben free, fragrance free, silicone free and mineral oil free. I think the latter is good news for those who may find that their skin is sensitive to those ingredients. I however, dispute the claims of coverage. I have used this BB Cream off and on for nearly 2 months and I can tell you that I can never get it to go past being just “sheer coverage”. I would say in fact, that it doesn’t even cover much for me, even if I try to build it up. I’ll show you what I mean. On left, with bare skin, you can see the pigmentation on my cheekbones and some redness around my nose area, and blemish marks around my chin. Blergh! ? On the right, with a layer of the Kiehl’s BB Cream, the pigmentation marks is still there but you may notice that the tone is more even. The pink tones also help make skin look a little brighter. All these aren’t noticeable from a photo I’m afraid. Skin in person reflects better nuances than a photograph can ever approximate. I usually go out with this BB Cream on, a touch of blush on cheeks and a light gloss or tinted lip balm and brows. Looks as “natural” as I get. This is what it does best, for me – even out the tone. So my skin looks even toned and a little radiant, as if I walked out the house without any makeup on, yet my pigmentation is still on show, which gives the same impression. That I didn’t bother to cover up ? So don’t get your hopes up. This Kiehl’s BB Cream isn’t as thick or as opaque as many other BB Creams out there. This is why I prefer it to many Korean brands (which I generally do not go for). I do sometimes question the transparency and the need to even wear anything on skin if it isn’t going to conceal my imperfections but I get why I need it sometimes. For me, it just gives a slightly better appearance to my skin without the obvious “makeup look”. I do however, tend to use this only on weekends or if I’m on holiday. I can dab on some concealer to conceal, and apply some powder foundation over for better coverage. It works. But not if I want proper coverage. In the market now are the CC Creams which aim to correct colour and tone without making too many claims about coverage. In some ways, I feel there is an overlap in this area so perhaps this would have been better marketed as a CC Cream (Colour Correcting Cream) than a BB Cream (Blemish Balm Cream). Monikers aside, I consider this a fairly good tinted sunscreen. The high sun protection can absolve you from wearing a separate sunscreen (although I always do so it doesn’t matter to me) and the tint is sufficient to absolve you from wearing foundation (if you have very good skin, or just want to even out your skintone without having to0 much coverage) For an idea of shade, here are some shade comparisons and a quick comparison with some other BB Creams I have. As this is a Western style BB Cream I have only compared it to other Western brands. I do not use Korean BB Creams. (1) Kiehl’s BB Cream in Fair (2) Bobbi Brown BB Cream Extra Light (3) Revlon Photoready BB Cream in Light (4) Diorsnow BB Creme in 010 Light (5) Garnier BB Cream (Asia version) [all links lead to reviews] I found it interesting how the shades vary quite widely in the different BB creams I do use. They all work interestingly enough! You may notice that the Kiehl’s BB Cream and the Bobbi Brown BB Cream are the most similar in texture and tone although the Kiehl’s one in Fair is a bit pink compared to the Bobbi Brown in Extra Light. So, you may want to consider this when deciding. The Revlon Photoready BB Cream in Light has more ochre tones as does the Diorsnow BB Creme which appears to be the “darkest”. The Dior also has the thickest texture but also the best coverage out of the 5 featured here. One of my faves, the Garnier BB Cream (Asia Version) also has a slightly thicker texture compared to the Kiehl’s, and a more neutral tone. In a nutshell The Kiehl’s BB Cream behaves rather like a tinted sunscreen and comes in 3 shades locally – Fair, Light and Natural. I take the shade Fair, which has slighty pink tones that gives the skin a bit of radiance. The texture is quite nice and it spreads easily. I also find that it does not make my skin oily through the day and the high sun protection factors is very impressive. However, to me, coverage is very very sheer. It will even out skintone, cover up a bit of redness but blemishes and pigmentation will still show on skin. If I want a more flawless look, I go for liquid foundation and a concealer. But for a grab and go weekend look, this works very well for me. The high price however will be a major factor to consider. This isn’t a bad product provided you don’t expect too much out of it, but at the asking price, it will be hard to convince people to buy this when they can buy a high quality liquid foundation for the same price, and get better coverage out of it. Pros: Skintone is evened out well without looking thick and unnatural, Skin looks a touch more radiant, Light texture, Not oily and does not turn oily on skin Cons: Pricey, Sheer coverage does not cover skin blemishes Who will like this: Anyone who has good skin and only needs a little tone correction, Anyone who does not want to layer on too many products as this has high sun protection factor and a decent tint Kiehl’s is usually very good at giving out samples and I believe there was a sampling exercise going on a few weeks ago for this BB Cream. I’d get a sample before buying just to see if you like the texture and the sheerness of the coverage. Although there is a money back guarantee now , a sample will save you the hassle of returns ?

I usually use my BB Creams only on weekends or when I’m on holiday and don’t need or want to put on full base makeup. I do use the ones with better coverage on days when I don’t want to wear liquid foundation. I personally treat BB Creams as foundation so perhaps I’m not making as much use of the multi-tasking qualities touted but I can’t compromise on my sunscreen!

This April sees them reformulating the Addict lipgloss, adding more Addict Extreme lipsticks and earlier this year, they quietly reformulated their mono eyeshadows. Now, stop for a moment and BREATHE! Settled? Ok, the mono eyeshadows. I had some of the old Dior mono shadows. I don’t know if anyone remembers them. One of the earliest was in a trapezoid shape, slightly raised from the pan. It reminded me of chocolate. You know those little bars of chocolate wrapped in colourful paper that you get in Quality Street multimix packs? No? Ok, you need to get yourself a Quality Street bag of choccies after this ok? ? They changed the monos after that into an oval shape pan. I didn’t have any from that but it was also because I didn’t like it. I didn’t like the oval pan in a square case. Screwed with my geometrics ? The next incarnation came about as a rectangle pan with the cannage pattern embossed on it. I think I have one from then but it was too glittery so I never actually really used it. Am I talking to myself here? Does anyone remember all these incarnations of the Dior mono eyeshadows? ? Well, nevermind if you don’t remember, because here is the newest design – a square pan with the Dior ‘logomania’ logo imprinted on it. This Dior logo is the one used on all the Dior canvas bags and whilst not as modern as I’d imagine it to be, is quintessentially Dior. Based on my observation there are 3 formula that can be used wet and dry, and I have here, 3 colours to show you, and to tell you what I think about them and also to show you how they look worn together. A bit of ground to cover so settle back ? Fashion tip: If you want to wear anything with logos on them, don’t wear more than one or you risk looking like a billboard. I was sent 2 of them in Choc Clair 564 and Swan 006 but one day while I was at a Dior counter, I took the opportunity to play around with the rest of the colours and eventually settled on picking up Gris City 056 . It must be said that I have a soft spot for grey eyeshadow and a sparkly grey can grab my attention everytime! At RM105 each, it is quite easy to just settle for one. That is, unless I wanted to break my bank. It must be said also however, that I wasn’t quite crazy about the rest of the colours. There are a couple of vibrant purples which I don’t wear, a few bright blues and more neutral greens plus a bright pop of fuchsia pink; but I just wasn’t taken. The only colour that had me, hook line and sinker, was Gris City. I suspect age (and practicality) is catching up faster with me than I like! I noticed that there are about 3 formula in these shadows – matte, satin (a little shimmer) and metallic (glittery). Choc Clair is a satin, while Swan and Gris City are both metallics. I’ve swatched them here, wet and dry. I know many people have raved about how much more intense they look when used wet as opposed to dry but I couldn’t quite see much difference in the ones I had. I personally never use eyeshadow wet but that’s because I just don’t like how it spoils the texture of the shadow in pan, and I believe that using it wet will encourage bacterial growth in what might otherwise be a relatively inert atmosphere. But don’t mind me – just paranoia talking ? Swan 006 in pan is a pure metallic white. It is so metallic that the edges of the logo aren’t even that sharp because of the rough texture of the eyeshadow. Swatched, it is a highly metallic white shimmer that can only be used as a highlight, and even then, only after blending vigorously. Swatched dry (D) it is a metallic white. Swatched wet (W) it looks even more metallic and you can see the slight multi-coloured iridescence. Gris City 056 in pan is a dark grey with multi-colour shimmer. It isn’t as gritty as Swan and the glitter is smaller so the definition of the embossing on the shadow is sharper. On skin, Gris City is a dark grey with shimmer. I find it quite a warm grey, as you can see, almost having a brown undertone. Swatched dry (D) it looks about as intense as it is swatched wet (W). I wear it dry and the best part, it can be worn alone or as a crease shade, or as a liner shade and for some reason, doesn’t look as sparkly on the eyes as it does on my arm. Choc Clair 564 was a surprise for me. I don’t usually like shades like this sort of camel beige brown. The texture is that of a satin with slight iridescent shimmer and on my skin looks like a very neutral camel beige. Its now a fast fave for me used on its own with black liner and mascara, or as a complement to Gris City. You can tell that whether swatched wet or dry, the colour doesn’t look any different. I only tested with regular water, not any of those fancy schmancy wetting agents like eye drops or what have you. Maybe the effect is different then, I wouldn’t know. Here’s a close up of each of the colours for you to see the texture. Choc Clair has the smoothest texture of the three, while Swan has the “roughest”. When blended well, Swan gives a beautiful gentle highlight but if you just plonk it on without blending, you’ll just see a splotch of white shimmer. Ditto Gris City. Blend it out and its quite lovely. Just plonk it on and it is less impressive. And here is all 3 shades used. Gris City on outer part of the lid and on the lower lid, Choc Clair as the main lid colour and Swan to highlight the brow and inner corner. It doesn’t look too bling, nor too shiny. I like how I can wear this to work quite easily because its so easy to use them together. You may notice how the inner corner isn’t very well blended so you see splotches of Swan while under the brow bone, I really blended it and it just looks well-lit. On my non-oily lids, used without a primer, the colours last me all of a full working day without creasing. I get a little fading by the end of the day but its not drastic. I’ve used Choc Clair most often as you can tell from the smudged corner (I tried to keep it as clean as I could but I can’t stop myself taking pictures of used items, nor can I stop myself from using them before taking photos !) and Gris City is next. I can live without Swan (and you can too, sorry Dior!) Here’s an idea of how it looks on a full face. Eyes : Dior Mono Gris City, Choc Clair, Swan | Cheeks: Estee Lauder Tease | Lips: Dior Addict Extreme Plaza With eyes looking this neutral, I like to go with brighter cheeks and lips and this was a great excuse to wear the bright pinks. I have been pulling out this look quite often in recent times. No inspiration and I’m back in my neutral rut. I think the new Dior Mono Eyeshadows are pretty to look at but I would advise you to take a look at them for yourself before you decide if they are for you. Some colours can be worn alone but I feel that many of them while looking vibrant in pan, swatch sheerly when dry. Those who have experimented with using them wet show beautiful results so its a matter of what you prefer. I think the neutral shades are better – its alright if they are slightly sheer because they are easily layered, but if it looks like a vibrant purple in pan and applies sheerly, that’s always a let down. In a nutshell The Dior Mono Eyeshadows are newly formulated eyeshadow singles that can be used wet or dry. Used dry, the colours tend to be a little sheer and used wet, they take on a greater intensity and in some cases, shine. There are different textures as well from matte to very shimmery and many colours to choose from. I personally think the neutral shades perform better when used dry as opposed to the brightly coloured ones which apply a little sheer when used dry. Used wet, they are intense if that’s your thing. As the price per shadow is quite high, I can’t in all honesty tell you to run out and buy them. But if there is a colour you like, the quality is quite good and the longevity is too. Pros: Texture of the satin shades are smooth and very easy to apply on skin, Longlasting, Easy to blend and layer Cons: Pricey, Colours tend to apply a little sheer when dry especially the more vibrant shades Who will like this: Anyone who prefers using single eyeshadows, Anyone who uses their eyeshadow wet and dry Size wise, its small and it comes with 2 sponge tip applicators. I use a brush to apply on normal days, but I have also used fingers and it works. I find the applicators too short to hold them comfortably to apply the colour to your lid but if you REALLY have to use it, it will work. I just never found the need to REALLY have to use it ? Have you checked out any of the Dior Mono Eyeshadows yet? Do you have any and did any specific colour catch your eye? Lily has some swatches of most of the other colours available here . I will recommend looking at Gris City and Choc Clair if you really want a place to start. They are safe colours that can be very easily worn together or separately on their own. I somehow feel that’s what Dior does best – safe colours. People will use it more often, and its surprisingly hard to find a good safe, neutral colour. Leave the experimental brights to brands like Urban Decay and the like. They do it better and Dior’s neutrals can then complement their gorgeous array of bright beautiful lipsticks and glosses, which they do so well.

Pretty Naughty is very pastel, but also a little naughty in a gentle, discreet way.” ~ Tom Pecheux, Creative Makeup Director, Estée Lauder Now, isn’t that an oxymoronic sentence? Pastels are romantic, we’d all agree with that but who’d ever associate pastel colours with sexy? Not me, that’s for sure. Sexy comes across as bold, strong shades, not colours of a macaron. But when I saw the Estee Lauder Pretty Naughty eyeshadow palette for Spring 2013, I suddenly knew what Tom Pecheaux meant. I have to hand it to Tom Pechaux. For me, he has single handedly revamped the Estee Lauder colour makeup turning them around from a brand I’d associate with aunties and more matured women, to something that is actually eye catching and even, exciting. Or maybe its just that I’m at that age when I now am an aunty and therefore would not feel (or look) out of place at an EL counter ? Either way, I like what Tom Pechaux is doing with EL. There are a couple of items in the Pretty Naughty Spring 2013 collection but my eye was not originally drawn to the eyeshadow palette. Oh no, I was irresistably drawn instead to the powder gelee blush. Are you surprised? Me… and a blush? I didn’t think so ? The, to give it its full name, Pure Color Illumination Powder Gelée Blush in Tease is one of the (usually) limited edition gelée blushes, bronzers and illuminators that Estee Lauder launches periodically. I have an illuminator from a previous collection (Modern Mercury) that I never told you about because I wasn’t brought in locally. On hind sight, maybe I should have. The texture is very interesting, being a tri-brid of liquid, powder and gel. In pan, the product looks like a powder but there is a pearlescent sheen to it. Swiped, it feels like gel-cream and it goes on skin and stays on like a cream. The offering under the Pretty Naughty collection is Tease, a sweet golden pink. In my photo, you can see that the middle bit looks a bit grungy and that’s because I’d used it before I took photos. The surface is raised “studs” which to my imagination looks like a field of pyramids. No matter which way you hold it, there will be light and shadow play that throws the design into sharp relief, which is quite artistic. When used, you will notice that the “tips” of the “pyramids will flatten out. The product comes with a sponge applicator but I use my regular blush brush that picks up product very easily, and applies it on my cheeks in a diffused glow. This is quite easily a firm favourite for a quick, simple light pink blush that instantly gives a glow to skin. Perfect for those days when you look at yourself in the mirror and think “God! What on earth did you DO last night to justify looking THIS bad?!” ? I know what you’re worried about – shimmer. Everyone’s always worried about shimmer (well except me because I don’t quite care that I may look like a walking spotlight at times) but it might please you to know that there isn’t shimmer in the true sense in this product. What it is, is superbly fine shimmer that serves to illuminate your skin not make you shine like a diamond. Swatches probably help illustrate what I mean. Left-Right: Pretty Naughty Eyeshadow Palette: Pastel Pink, Pastel Light Blue, Shimmer brown, Shimmer Lilac, Black with silver glitter; Gelée Blush in Tease If you see the Tease blush on the far right, you may notice how it looks like a pink glow instead of a powdery pink shimmery blush. The texture is quite something. As for the shadows in the Pretty Naughty palette, I wasn’t sure how I felt about them. The pastel pink and baby blue are colours I don’t regularly use. The other 3 shades – brown, lilac and black are colours I can work with. When I tried to use them all however, I found that it didn’t look too bad. The light pastel pink is very light but when used as a highlighter for the inner corner of the eyes and under the brow, the very subtle hint of highlight really brightens up the eye area. So, the only colour I’m really meh about is the baby blue. I don’t work well with baby blue. Here is a close up idea of how Pretty Naughty and Tease looks on me. Pretty Naughty on eyes, Tease on cheeks as blush For the eyes, I used the black as a base then layered the brown on the outer half of the eye, and the pale blue in the inner half with a touch of lilac that goes on my skin quite a nice cool purple. The same lilac-purple was used on the lower lid too. Pink was used on the inner corners and under the brow bone. Tease was used as a blush which you can just about see on the apples of my cheeks. It isn’t shiny and doesn’t make my skin look uneven nor does it enhance my pores very much (I have old acne scars on my cheeks) The colour on my skin is a warmed pink that is just a tease of colour on skin. And when you pull back (because few of us really stuff our faces into others in that sort of extreme close up ;)) Here’s how it looks. Eyes: Pretty Naughty palette (all 5 shades) | Cheeks: Tease Gelee blush | Lips: Dior Lip Glow | Face: Lunasol Skin Modelling Foundation I get what Tom Pechaux means now. The pretty sweet pastels of pink, blue and lilac in the Pretty Naughty palette on their own will channel a sweet romantic look. But the brown in the palette earths the colours and the black deepens them to give a sexier vibe. This is a palette for someone who’s feeling pretty… and naughty ? In a nutshell I was very interested in the Tease gelee blush in the Estee Lauder Spring 2013 Pretty Naughty collection and I’m glad that it doesn’t disappoint. The blush imparts a soft sweet pink to cheeks while adding an illuminating glow. If you layer too much on it can look shiny but it gives a beautiful glow to the cheeks. I adore this one. The Pretty Naughty eyeshadow palette at first glance did not attract me. Pastel colours for the eyes do nothing for me but when worn, the black and brown adds depth and grounds the sweet pastel shades, allowing you to deepen them. The pink isn’t very pink and is in fact, a very lovely highlight for the eye area. It isn’t a must have, if I’m to be honest but if cooler tones suit your skin its a pretty palette to own, that can easily transition according to your mood, whether you are feeling pretty or naughty. Pros: Blush is a very lovely golden pink with illuminating shimmer, Blush can be used as highlighter or on its own if it shows up on you, Colours in the eyeshadow palette are not chalky and adhere well to skin Cons: Limited Edition, Pastel eye colours do not suit everyone, The black shade in the eyeshadow palette is a bit crumbly Who will like this: Anyone who wants a soft golden pink blush that adds glow to the skin without looking too shimmery, Anyone who wants to join in the Spring trend for pastel eye shades without looking too pale and washed out While I wasn’t 100% sold on the eyeshadow palette initially, I have to say it grew on me. I still don’t like the baby blue so its the colour I use the least. The other colours in the palette work well together or even on their own, so that makes it quite versatile for an easy to throw on look. You probably couldn’t do a night look with this one but who’s to say otherwise right? Just slap on lots of the black, temper it with a little lilac for punch and you’d be good to go. I’m happy they added the black in there – it just pulls the palette together much better than if it was another pastel. As for the blush, I love it. Been using it for a week straight. I use my regular blush brush with it, and need about 2 layers to get what you see in the photos above. It is, in that sense more pigmented than the Guerlain Sakura Blush G which I do need a little more work with. The latter however does not have the shimmer/illuminating level that this one does and its a cooler pink while Tease is a warmer golden pink. Both are pretty, both are bloody tempting! Did you check out the Estee Lauder Pretty Naughty collection? Does either product here attract you? In this collection also were 4 new Sheer Matte lipsticks and a nail polish that was a greyed lilac (Insatiable). I’m not personally a fan of matte lipsticks or nail polish so those were a pass for me, but fellow blogger Nikki has a review on one of the Sheer Matte lipsticks in Rebel so you can check her thoughts on those ? So, if you can get just one item, I say look at the gelee blush. The texture is lovely, the colour is sweet and you’d look such a tease in it! ?

These purple jars hold the recently launched Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Cream , which targets and proposes to correct all visible signs of aging. Aging! Now, more than ever I feel it haha! So, my interest was piqued. You see, this super cream not only lifts, but sculpts, firms and smoothens skin with their dynamic trio of beech tree extract, jasmonic acid and hyaluronic acid. Wow, wow and wow. Your interest piqued too? This cream claims that you will see results with just 2 weeks of use, and you only use it once a day. Use it at night, because it is a repair cream. But you know what? I took the 2 week challenge and I didn’t think much of it. So, I decided to stretch it out longer. Took it for a one month whirl instead. After more than one month, I can tell you that this is, as the name implies, a corrective cream. Therefore, you young ‘uns with no lines, sagging skin or any visible signs of aging, need not apply. I’m serious. If you want to protect, go use something else. This is for the more mature crowd. Ahem. Moi ? This product isn’t a gel-cream or lotion-cream but is a cream-cream. What this means it that it has a slightly heavier texture which will suit the people in the target age group. Part of the reasons you get fine lines is because skin is dehydrated. The hyaluronic acid in this cream addresses that. The white cream doesn’t have a discernible scent although I’d hesitate to say it’s fragrance free. There is a light scent, just not too troubling. Many creams targeted at the more matured crowd tend to be strongly fragranced, if you notice. I belong in this age category, but I detest strongly fragranced products so perhaps I am the exception. The texture isn’t heavy however and it feels light on skin. I must say though that I am used to applying heavy textured products on my skin and I usually massage it in so I’m not your best person to judge if this is too heavy. I find it light, others may consider it heavy. In an air-conditioned room, it’s ok. I was using this for 2 weeks during which time, I was switching over from using a less than stellar product so my skin wasn’t quite at its best. In the 2 weeks, I noticed no improvements to my skin. I have lines but at my age, if I didn’t, it’s called “Botox” ? So, I set this cream aside and went back to my old faithful night cream . In a week, my skin was back to looking at its best. Then, I went back to this one, and used it for about a month. This time, I did something more. I added in a couple of drops of the Midnight Recovery Concentrate Elixir into the cream before applying to my skin. I believe that was the “secret key” to unlocking the best potential of the Super Multi-Corrective Cream. Used on its own, I found the cream ok. Mixed with MRC, it seems to work better, infusing my skin with more energy. I can’t explain it, but that’s how I see it. My skin feels smoother and looks better generally. I cannot attest to better skin firmness, nor any sculpting of my skin. As for skin texture, it could also be attributed to my face cloth routine which I have found has helped my skin improve by leaps and bounds. But I did not break out, and I wake up to skin that looks and feels smoother. But only when I mix with MRC. On its own, it’s ok and does its job, but I have used better. In a nutshell The new Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Cream targets people who are experiencing visible signs of aging, hence the name. This is a corrective cream, not a preventive one. From my experience, the cream on its own didn’t quite give me the wow factor I was hoping to experience. But when I mixed the cream with a few drops of the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate Elixir, it seemed to give it the boost it needed. It took me more than a month to see results, but I have experienced skin that feels and looks smoother. Firmness and lift are subjective but visible lines are definitely softened a little. Deep lines remain. I’d say it’s worth giving a go, but don’t expect a miracle, and give it some time to do its job. If you have the MRC, try mixing some in. It seems to give it that extra boost. Pros: Lightweight yet creamy texture is suitable for drier skin, No discernible scent, Not oily and absorbs quite well into skin, Seems to work quite well to soften fine lines and make skin look and feel smoother Cons: Pricey, Did not show visible results in 2 weeks as promised but I saw some results over prolonged use Who will like this: Anyone already seeing visible signs of aging e.g. lines, loss of skin firmness etc I won’t use this one in the day to be honest. It feels a little heavy for day use so I’d reserve it strictly for night use. However, I’m going to stick my neck out and say that this seems to be a more affordable option to my prized Dior night cream, for those are are choking at that splurge. I do get a better result with my Dior cream but this one makes a good “maintenance” cream, so I don’t have to use the Dior one back to back all the time, but maybe alternate it. I will not say they are dupes, and I am not giving that one up (It’s my Top Skincare pick !) but I can consider stretching my dollar by using this Kiehl’s cream in between. The clever ones doing the math may say “Oh, but if you mix in MRC the cost goes up!” to which my answer is, I mix MRC or the Estee Lauder Nutritious Face Oil or any other face oil into all my evening creams so that point is moot! ?

Lancome did a collaboration with Lanvin designer Alber Elbaz where selected mascaras and eyeshadow palettes were given the Alber Elbaz makeover with cartoon drawings and lots of hearts. There was also a cute cartoon runway show video. Missed it? Refresh your memory here . Here then is one of the palettes from that collection, the Lancome Doll Eyes Eyeshadow Palette in D05 Gris Fume . Yes, I realise I may be late and that this limited edition packaging may be sold out by now but take heart, the palette itself is permanent! But since we’re at it, here’s the limited edition packaging for the Lancome x Alber Elbaz collection. Wanna know a secret? I don’t like it. Sorry. I much prefer the plain black compact used in Lancome’s regular line. Sacrilege yes? Everyone loved it. Ahem. Well except me, lah ? Oh but there’s something I do like about this palette, and that is that the base is magnetized. So, the cover closes with a magnet, and best of all, the applicators don’t fall out, because they are held on by magnets. Now, when will other brands cotton on that this is a GREAT IDEA? ? See, here I am dangling it a few feet above the ground and everything stays put! In a regular palette, I’d be scrabbling around, collecting the applicators off the floor by now. It would be nice if other brands took note of this innovative design. Despite how I personally feel about applicators, I think they are a necessary evil. They can usually be used in a pinch, and not everyone wants to splurge on a brush (although this isn’t a good idea if you don’t!) Alrighty then, here’s a close up of the colours in the palette D05 aka Gris Fume. It is a very neutral palette, with a mix of light and dark shades and despite what I’ve read, I find the taupes and greys in this one have a warm cast, with a silvery sheen. What this means for the majority is that this is one of those “universally appealing” neutral palettes. It’d look good on most people. I’ve swatched this in a zig-zag fashion, starting from the left, I meant to label the palette but forgot, so I’m sorry but you have to do a bit of work corresponding the swatches. (1) Silvery warm taupe (2) Matte dark grey with a warm undertone (3) Silvery cool medium toned grey-taupe (4) Shimmery light beige (5) Glittery sheer pink highlight That said however, I had a little bit of trouble working with this palette, because I found that whilst pigment was good, the contrast between the light and dark shades were a little too stark. So, I found that for small eyes (like mine) it can muddy if you aren’t too careful. So using all 5 shades on my eyes is a strict no-no. I could do with 2 max for shading my eyes, and maybe one light highlighter shade under the brow bone. The paper insert comes with some pictorial diagrams on how to use this, which is useful but not terribly practical unless you have round eyes with a lot of lid space. So here’s how it looked on me, using just 3 shades – the dark black close to the lashline, the warm taupe blended over as a lid shade, and the shimmery pink as a highlight. I like grey shadow – it works on me but if you have a warmer skintone, don’t fret. The warm notes in this one means it may work for you too! I think it’s pretty, and work friendly. However, don’t be over enthusiastic, and be content with just using one or maybe 2 colours on the eyes. In this case, less is certainly more ? In a nutshell The Lancome Doll Eyes Eyeshadow Palette in D05 Gris Fume is part of the permanent collection. The special cover you see in this picture is part of the limited edition Lancome x Alber Elbaz collection. I’d say that this palette is one that will appeal to many for the simple reason that it is quite user friendly. You can deepen the shades for evening or lighten them for use in the day. However, I also found that less is more with this one. The colours are pigmented and can muddy when blended together. Pros: Pigmented colours, Easy to wear, Single shades apply prettily enough so you don’t really have to blend too many shades to get a polished, pulled together look Cons: If you liked the packaging it is limited edition, Colours can muddy if you aren’t careful Who will like this: Anyone who likes neutral palettes, Anyone who is looking for an easy to wear taupe eyeshadow I have to say that I rather like Lancome eyeshadow palettes. Some are put off because the shades do tend to be a little light or a little too shimmery. If you come from the Japanese makeup school of thought as I do, then you’d enjoy using these. They are very close to Japanese style palettes, down to the gradational tones. However, if you come from the MAC, NARS or Make Up For Ever school of thought, then these won’t be your cuppa char ? Did you pick up anything from the Lancome x Alber Elbaz collection? Have you tried these Doll Eye Eyeshadow Palettes? I have to say, I think these may be a touch better in terms of quality and depth of colour than the Colour Design palettes so if you want something quick, easy and fuss free, and want Japanese looking eyeshadows but want more colour, then consider this range. It bridges that gap ?
