"[""What’s Your Acne Type? Learn the Different Symptoms and Take Charge of YOUR Treatment! 12-15-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When people think of acne, red, irritated bumps often come to mind. What many of us do not know is that there are several types of acne symptoms that fall into different categories. Most people reflexively reach for the pimple cream to zap their zits, or even worse, attempt to squeeze the blemish into oblivion. Take a few minutes to learn about what appears on your complexion, how to avoid making your acne worse and how to take charge of treating your acne in the most effective way . Acne falls into two groups: inflammatory and non-inflammatory. Various types of acne symptoms, such as pimples, blackheads or cysts belong to one of these categories. Here is a closer look at what happens to the body to cause these symptoms, which will also provide insight about the best treatment solutions. Inflammatory acne. Inflammation is a natural response of the body. Sending white blood cells to attack a foreign agent, a clogged pore becomes inflamed either under or on top of the surface of the skin, which results in acne symptoms. Types of inflammatory acne include: Papules. Small red bumps that typically appear on the face, papules appear when the hair follicle breaks and white blood cells rush in to protect the broken skin. Because the skin is inflamed at this point, the treatment plan is to calm the area, rather than dry. Common temporary treatment remedies include a simple application of hydrocortisone cream, and ice compresses. Papules often lead to pustules, therefore they really need your prompt attention from the moment you notice them. Remember...acne is a manifestation of an internal imbalance of the sebaceous glands and the only way to prevent the acne cascade from escalating is by using a safe and effective internal (systemic) treatment (like AcnEase ® ) that removes and controls the reasons that cause acne. Pustules. Pustule is the medical term for what is commonly referred to as a pimple or zit. When the white blood cells from a papule rise to the surface of the skin, a pustule is formed. To treat pustules, cleansing and drying may help as well as spot treatments. However, if you opt for such temporary measures, select products that contain anti-bacterial sulfur or drying camphor. The real treatment for pustules is an internal solution to remove the reasons behind the inflammation, clogged pores and excess sebum. Nodules. A severe form of inflammatory acne, nodules are a type of cystic acne, which form below the skin’s surface, and are often extremely uncomfortable and even painful to the touch. This is often a symptom of hormonal acne. Again, long-term relief may occur only when the hormonal imbalance on the sebaceous glands is contained. Cysts. Much like nodules, cysts form below the skin. However, cysts become pus-filled, often resembling boils. Cystic acne is among the hardest to treat with topical solutions, making a systemic regimen such as AcnEase ® an attractive and practical solution for those suffering from cysts. While some opt for ice compresses to reduce swelling, others with frequent cystic acne may opt for painful cortisone injections from a dermatologist. Treatments other than AcnEase ® do not address the cause of acne, but may temporarily reduce swelling. The second category of acne is called non-inflammatory acne . Sometimes referred to as comedones, non-inflammatory acne is the result of clogged pores, which do not typically result in redness or swelling. The newest research includes oily skin in this category. Non-inflammatory acne can be less bothersome than inflammatory acne, but this is the stage when it is critical to take control of your skins behavior and the internal reasons behind the issue. Taking early action will prevent more advanced, painful and often more damaging (acne scars and marks) inflammatory acne. Types of non-inflammatory acne include: Whiteheads. Sebum and bacteria clog pores under the skin, leading to the formation of whiteheads. Appearing as small white or even flesh-colored bumps, these closed comedones can sometimes be alleviated with deep cleaning facials, intended to remove impurities, followed by a careful exfoliation routine to keep dead skin cells at bay. Again, this is when you should aggressively find a product that may PREVENT the progression of acne internally. Blackheads. Contrary to popular belief, blackheads are not actually trapped dirt, but the result of the oxidation of sebum once the clogged pore has opened and been exposed to air. Since there is no actual dirt or debris to remove, treating blackheads is usually left to preventive measures, such as avoiding the use of pore-clogging makeups or lotions and instead opting for non-comedogenic formulas. Topical retinoids are often prescribed for blackheads but they come with the risk of serious side effects. They might bring temporary improvement but they also dry and sensitize the skin and require that the user adhere to strict sun restrictions and protection. Oily skin. The new perspective on acne includes oily skin as acne. It is the first stage of the acne cascade and includes not only shiny skin (ex. running make-up), but also oily and weak hair. Oily skin is not only a nuisance but also an early sign that an acne problem has arrived. Oily skin may be improved with proper skincare and lifestyle changes but it is also a time when a savvy consumer starts a PREVENTIVE acne treatment. Whatever the type of acne that may appear on your skin, it is always advised to NEVER pick or squeeze at a blemish, as doing so can lead to further infection, and/or scarring. As you can see, acne starts under the surface of the skin, making treatment with topical solutions alone time consuming and ineffective. The cascade of acne begins with the over-secretion of an oily substance called sebum. Along with dead skin cells, sebum clogs pores and leads to the growth of bacteria. In order to prevent acne, the problem must be treated at its source. AcnEase ® is unique in that it is the only non-prescription medicine that intervenes during the first step in the acne cascade and will also significantly improve oily skin. As each of the above-stated types of acne are affected by this, a systemic solution like AcnEase ® , in combination with your current skincare regimen, is an optimal way to achieve long-lasting results, no matter your acne type.

"[""3 Important Ways to Control Hormonal Acne 04-05-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Acne affects nearly half of adult women and almost a third of adult men. Acne can appear at just about any age and 75% of all people suffer from acne breakouts at some point in their lives. Acne usually makes its first appearance during adolescence, however, we’re seeing more and more adults suffering from acne breakouts. Statistical data also confirms that the number of adults affected by acne is steadily increasing. Acne affects people of all ethnic and economic backgrounds, making it one of the most widespread and “populistic” medical conditions in the world. The Culprit Behind Hormonal Acne So what is the reason behind both adolescent and adult acne, and what factors can make them better…or worse? The major culprit behind acne is hormones, and specifically their imbalance and fluctuating levels. Both women and men produce testosterone and estrogen in different quantities. However, when the range of balance between testosterone and estrogen that is expected for men and women is disrupted, more testosterone and its metabolite dihydrotestosterone reaches the blood, causing an over-stimulation of the sebaceous glands. As a result, these glands start producing more sebum (skin oil) that causes the initial clogging of pores. The clogged pores support the growth of bacteria, which is the impetus for the formation of acne pustules (inflammatory pimples). The process above is also known as the acne cascade which clearly indicates a sad truth that when the formation of acne starts, it is very difficult to stop and it can only be done within our body. (Note to AcnEase® users: Make sure you’re using the right treatment for where you are in the acne cascade by clicking here .) Let’s look into a few tips that you can easily incorporate into your daily plan to help you become acne-free. 1 – De-stressing. Ommm When we are stressed, our blood sugar and insulin levels rise to mobilize the body organs to deal with the stress. This “mobilization” is a protection mechanism and while in many situations it helps us to be more efficient in dealing with stress, it also has some seriously negative impacts on our bodies. In short, stress causes a serious increase in inflammatory chemicals at a cellular level, which can exacerbate acne. Since acne is one form of inflammatory disease – stress will worsen acne, sometimes quite dramatically. (Note to those with severe acne – as many of our AcnEase® users know, this can take some time to treat and our severe acne treatment ? takes that into account. It’s critical to know that during the “mobilization” of our bodies to deal with stress, several special hormones are produced to help mediate this process. Some of the most important are cortisol and other hormones released by the adrenal glands that can act as androgens (male hormones) and over-stimulate the sebaceous glands. As previously mentioned, androgens and fluctuating hormone levels will produce more skin oil, which in turn clogs the pores and… leads to an acne flare-up! If you already have acne or just acne prone skin, it is vital that you find ways to eliminate or at least reduce physical and psychological stress that is indeed directly correlated with breakouts. Try to incorporate the following as part of your daily regimen and you should notice a difference in your skin (and overall wellbeing!): Make sure that you get enough sleep – aim for at least 6.5 hours. Limit intake of coffee and tea. Replace them with water (and lemon if you like) and decaffeinated herbal teas. Set aside at least fifteen or twenty minutes a day for de-stressing activities like meditation, yoga, simple walks or reading your favorite book. 2 - Treat yourself to an Anti-Inflammatory Diet The word inflammation is a very popular buzzword these days in the health arena because of how much damage it can do to one’s body in many different ways. When it comes to skin, obviously the old adage reigns true: what you put into your body is going to effect what you see on the outside. Inflammation is a natural response by the body in an attempt to protect itself from irritants that the body may be inclined to reject. An inflammatory response can result in those bumps that you get on your face! Therefore, keeping to an anti-inflammatory diet for acne is key to becoming acne-free. Read more about it here . Adding protein, good fats & fiber rich foods to your diet are essential. This is also key to keeping your sugar levels from spiking, which can be detrimental to becoming acne-free. It is a good rule of thumb to try to have 20 grams of protein with each meal. This way, the protein helps to keep your sugar levels from dipping too low (resulting in cravings for sugar/carbs) and as an added bonus, your metabolism stays at an optimal level. While sugar, chocolate and dairy may not be directly linked to acne, the way our bodies break these foods down may contribute to a spike in certain hormones, such as insulin. When hormone levels are relatively balanced, we give our sebaceous glands the best chance at producing only enough sebum necessary to do its job, hydrate and moisturize the skin, and no more. 3 - Hormones & Acne: Do they affect you? There have been a number of articles in the news lately about milk and dairy products causing acne. Some reports describe how growth hormones, insulin and insulin-like growth factors in milk will cause acne. The statements above are blatantly wrong and create unnecessary stress as well as misinformation. The reason is simple, all these hormones are peptides or proteins that will be digested (and destroyed) in the stomach and will not reach the blood . Unfortunately, even though these issues relating to dairy products and acne are wrong, there are some concerns outlined below. For instance, there are other types of hormones in mother’s milk (human and cow) that are naturally occurring and when consumed, can enter the blood stream. When one considers that mother’s milk is full of nutrients and factors that will help an infant (human or cow) grow, it is not unreasonable to consider that milk may contain certain hormones for example, estrogen and androgens, which may impact acne. Acne is primarily caused by an over secretion of sebum (skin oil) by the sebaceous glands. Androgen-based hormones produced by both males and females are considered the primary culprits in activating the sebaceous glands. What is not commonly discussed is that only about 2% of steroid hormones (estrogen-like and androgen-like) are free in the blood. The remainder is bound to a protein called sex hormone binding protein (SHBP). It is the free form of sex hormones that bind to their respective receptors and induce their biologic response. Now back to dairy products. We all make our own sex hormones in our ovaries (women) and testes (males) as well as in the adrenal glands. There is a delicate balance between bound hormones and “free” hormones, which will be the candidates to activate the sebaceous glands. There are relatively low levels of the sex hormones in mother’s milk but this may be sufficient to tip the balance in free levels to those hormones and for those individuals that are acne-prone, that can contribute to acne formation. What is also interesting about milk is that it contains whey protein, which is known to stimulate insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). Unlike these peptides which are in cow’s milk and destroyed in the stomach, the insulin and IGF-1 stimulated by whey protein and large spikes in sugar consumption are secreted by your own body and therefore biologically active. One of their actions is to activate the androgen receptors some of which reside on the sebaceous glands. Therefore, it is entirely possible that for some, this may be enough to put sebaceous glands “on the alert.” This slight increase may sensitize the sebaceous glands to be more reactive to fluctuations in circulating hormone levels, therefore more ready to produce more sebum thus initiating the acne cascade. Do you want to determine if dairy is affecting your acne? If you notice that your skin looks better when you limit your dairy intake (limit does not mean eradicate), it makes sense to follow a reduced dairy diet. Remember, however, to replace the lost sources of calcium, Vitamin A and D and protein by using almond milk, and other foods such as beans and fish (preferably wild and ocean caught). Also, a note for our AcnEase® users, you’re lucky to already be on an acne treatment with active ingredients that work to reduce the impact of fluctuating hormone levels on the sebaceous glands. In essence, AcnEase® is doing exactly that and can help tip the balance in the favor of avoiding small changes in hormone levels induced by diet. This intervention works to inhibit the negative impact of dairy on acne and thereby blocking the exacerbation of existing acne or stimulating the formation of new acne pimples. So we want to hear from you! How do you control your hormonal acne? Do any of these tips resonate with you?

"[""Acne and the Anti-Inflammatory Diet 11-18-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Is your skin familiar with those red, swollen bumps that are painful to the touch and impossible to conceal? If so, your body’s response to inflammation may be working overtime, and among other things, your complexion is paying the price. What exactly is inflammation? Inflammation is a natural response by the body in an attempt to protect itself from foreign irritants, such as bacteria, chemicals, or even foods that one’s body may be inclined to reject. Inflammation is a common part of the healing process and usually subsides once the foreign element has been addressed. In terms of acne symptoms, an inflammatory response can result in red, swollen bumps on your face that are often painful and irritating. One way to combat an over-stimulated inflammatory response is to consider the foods that we put into our bodies. It’s not uncommon knowledge that dairy, gluten, trans fats, and sugar , among other culprits, can lead to changes in the body, which may aggravate acne symptoms. What many people don’t consider is that, while certain foods are wonderful for detoxifying the system, others are powerful aids in keeping inflammation under control. In terms of diet and inflammation, restricting inflammatory foods is just as essential as adding anti-inflammatory foods, and should be one of the first changes we make to our eating habits. Avoid processed foods which include meats containing nitrates or other preservatives, baked snacks, refined grains such as white flour, and anything with a high sugar content. High-glycemic foods, known for increasing blood sugar and hormone levels, may result in the overproduction of sebum, an oily substance that, in excessive amounts, can lead to clogged pores. The clogged pore can accumulate dead skin cells which may lead to an inflammatory response as the body works to fight off what is essentially a bacterial invasion. The acute response results in pustules and prolonged inflammation and can lead to bumps under the skin called cystic acne. Keeping an anti-inflammatory diet doesn’t have to be difficult. There are endless options packed with flavor and nutrition. Here are a few of our favorites! Wild-caught fish, such as black cod . Having a higher count of Omega-3 fatty acids than salmon, black cod is an excellent source of antioxidants. This is an excellent source of protein with a delicious buttery flavor, providing a versatile menu option for the foodie in you. Ginger . In addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, ginger promotes healthy skin by aiding blood circulation. Fresh ginger is preferred to powdered ginger as the active ingredients benefit acne. Fresh grated ginger can be added to tea, stir fry, salad dressing and countless other options. Turmeric . Containing anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, this rhizome has a flavor profile similar to ginger. A long-celebrated skin remedy, widely used in Eastern regions such as India, this spice can be added to eggs, vegetables, meats, and spice blends such as curries, Coconut Oil. . The anti-inflammatory properties in this superfood improves current acne outbreaks and prevents future outbreaks by regulating hormonal balance and speeding up the healing process. Coconut oil has a high smoking point and can be used in the place of butter and other cooking oils. It is a great addition to sautéed meats and vegetables, desserts, or smoothies Berries. With too many to name, this juicy variety of antioxidants is a great-tasting way to fight inflammation. Extra-virgin olive oil. Studies have found the the compound oleocanthal mimics the effects of certain non steroidal drugs, such as Ibuprofen. In addition to possessing anti-inflammatory properties, e.v.o.o. is also abundant in antioxidants and antibacterial agents. Ginger-Rubbed Black Cod (Sablefish) Recipe Serves 2 (Recipe by Aron Canouse) 2 - 6 to 8 ounce pieces of wild-caught black cod with skin (thick fillet, avoid tail end) 1 tbsp finely grated fresh ginger 1 tbsp low sodium soy sauce Pinch of dark brown sugar 1 tsp Coconut oil, plus more for cooking Mix ginger, low sodium soy sauce and dark brown sugar together, making a paste. Rub flesh side of fish with 1 tsp of coconut oil followed by ginger paste. Let fish sit for 2 hours in refrigerator with flesh side down in marinade. Heat pan over medium high heat. When hot, add small amount of coconut oil to pan, enough to coat the bottom. Add fish, skin side down, and immediately cover pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes and remove lid. Cook for an additional minute or 2, letting skin get crispy. Fish will release itself and not stick to pan when ready. Fish should be slightly undercooked as it will continue to cook when removed from heat. In addition to acne, uncontrolled chronic inflammation has been linked with serious medical conditions, including Alzheimer’s, heart disease, Parkinson’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and arthritis. A good measure to keep skin acne-free, as well as maintaining a generally healthy lifestyle, the benefits of incorporating anti-inflammatory foods into one’s diet can enhance your life. Combining a low-glycemic, anti-inflammatory diet with a systemic solution such as AcnEase ® gives anyone their best chance at achieving and maintaining, clear, healthy skin. AcnEase ® is an all-natural herbal supplement that works to fight acne at its source by regulating the overproduction of sebum by the sebaceous glands. Much like the science behind AcnEase ® , the inflammation response of the body is an inside job, and must be treated as such. AcnEase ® uses all botanical ingredients including Gardenia Fruit, an anti-inflammatory, to create a systemic solution that provides lasting results. We want to hear from you!

"[""Want to Hear The Truth About Acne Scars? BONUS: Acne Scar Softening Mask 08-02-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments It's hard enough to fight acne. But what is a person to do if these breakouts leave long lasting marks and scars on the skin? Acne scars result from constant damage to the skin due to acne pustules and papules, pimples/zits, cysts etc. Each pimple is associated with an inflammatory reaction, which causes local tissue damage when combating bacteria trapped in the clogged pores of the skin. On top of this, if you squeeze or pop pimples, this damage may be even more substantial. When you get a cut on your skin, a scab starts to form, which actually helps it to heal. Acne pimples that become inflamed are like little cuts that need to heal; with chronic acne, repeat pimples and inflammation don't give enough time for the skin to heal properly. Therefore, the FIRST thing that must been done to break the cycle of creating new scars and marks (acne marks are also acne scars but less deep) is to PREVENT acne. This will allow collagen production and new tissue to rebuild your skin (at least partially) and as a result, make scars less visible, and marks vanish. So, PREVENTING NEW ACNE FROM FORMING IS THE FIRST CRUCIAL STEP TO GETTING RID OF ACNE SCARS AND MARKS. AcnEase® prevents pimples from forming and reduces the number of pimples that progress to inflammatory pustules, thereby preventing skin damage. By reducing the new damage to skin, your body can work on repairing the skin and reducing overall scarring. After your skin heals and no new pimples or cysts are forming, there are some options that increase skin turn-over aiding in skin repair and making scars and marks less visible: retinoic acid products, collagen building products, topical ingredients such as vitamin E (softens and moisturizes), zinc supplements, regular OTC scar creams, laser resurfacing. With that said, there is very little hope for improvement if the scars keep forming and your acne remains active. SO, YOUR ROAD TO IMPROVING ACNE SCARS BEGINS WITH ENDING ACNE. Realistically, deeper acne scars are more difficult to get rid of and some may never completely disappear. However they may be made significantly less visible and softer. Then, the proper make-up can do the rest. Different skin types and shades, your overall health, sun exposure and your age are also factors that make a difference in healing acne scars. You may want to consult with your dermatologist or an experienced beautician or esthetician about the specific options for your skin (and wallet!). Acne Scars Softening Mask This mask provides the best results if used once or twice a week and in conjunction with utilizing an acne treatment like AcnEase® that prevents new acne from coming. The mask softens the appearance of acne scars, making them less visible. WARNING: You may want to lick your face while applying this mask, but resist the temptation! Also, this mask is not to be used when you have many active pimples or cysts (lemon juice will sting when applied if so). Ingredients: 3 tablespoons of honey 2 tablespoons of steel cut oats (no instant oats) 1 tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice Preparation: This will get a bit messy! For those with ultra sensitive skin, skip the lemon and put the oats in 2-3 tbs. of organic warm milk overnight (it becomes mush) - if you see that there is too much liquid in it in the morning, poor it out, but do not squeeze the oats. Then, follow from step 2 (minus the lemon of course, and you can skip step 4 if needed). Can be used 1-2 times a week. Blend/grind the oatmeal in a blender to a powdered form Mix in the honey and lemon juice Stir well with a fork or spoon into a smooth mixture Wash your face with a mild cleanser Spread out the mask on your face, avoiding eyes and lips Relax for 20 minutes Remove by splashing luke-warm water on your face (no rubbing) With a promise of clear skin, Dr. A Comments Add New AcnEase Customer Care Hi Heather, What part of milk are you allergic to?

"['4 Fall Foods to Nourish Your Acne-Prone Skin This Season 10-12-2014 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Please note while reading, that we recommend when possible to purchase organic and non GMO food. Fall is here, and that means it\'s time to enjoy some of our favorite seasonal foods again. While dietary choices may not be a primary cause of acne, studies have shown that the things we eat do play at least somewhat of a role in our skin\'s health. For that reason, it\'s important to make healthy choices this fall season-especially since sugary, high-calorie treats lurk around every corner. Here\'s a look at four autumn-inspired foods that will help keep your skin glowing and acne-free over the coming months. Brazil Nuts Nuts are delicious and nutritious year round, but there\'s just something about fall that makes them irresistible. They\'re the perfect addition to any number of treats, like granola or freshly baked bread, or you can simply enjoy them alone. One variety in particular, brazil nuts, are high in a powerful antioxidant known as selenium. Selenium helps promote overall skin health by reducing the occurrence of inflammation, which has been known to exacerbate acne breakouts. While they\'re definitely a skin-friendly and healthy choice to add to your diet, remember to enjoy brazil nuts in moderation, since they\'re relatively high in calories and fat. Squash From butternut to acorn, squash is in season during the fall, and there are lots of great varieties waiting for you to try them. Squash is incredibly high in a nutrient known as beta carotene, which is responsible for regulating the production of skin oil and keeping inflammation to a minimum-so you can see why this wonder vegetable is a must-have for those looking to protect their skin from acne. Interestingly enough, squash can pull double duty when it comes to protecting you from breakouts. It\'s a great ingredient to create delicious fall-themed dishes like soups and pies, but it also works well as a topical treatment. You can even put it on your face! Here is a recipe for a simple, homemade squash face mask to pamper your skin this season. Use organic ingredients when possible. Squash Anti-Inflammatory Mask Ingredients 1 cup mashed squash (preferably butternut or acorn) ¼ cup raw oats 1 tbs aloe vera 1 tbs lavender extract (optional - if you want mask to be scented) Simply combine all ingredients. Apply the mask to your face and let it set for 20 to 30 minutes. Be sure to thoroughly wash your face with warm water afterwards. Sweet Potato Sweet potatoes conjure up nostalgic images of delicious, gooey sweet potato casserole on Thanksgiving Day. While it\'s perfectly fine to indulge in treats like that from time to time, it\'s best to enjoy sweet potatoes as unprocessed as possible during the rest of the fall season. This colorful root vegetable is chock full of skin-friendly antioxidants like vitamins A and C, but it also has a low glycemic index-which means it doesn\'t have a drastic impact on your blood sugar levels. Some research has indicated that spikes in your blood sugar can lead to inflammation, and as you already know, this condition primes your skin for acne breakouts. Sweet potatoes can be prepared in every way that a normal potato can be, so don\'t be afraid to experiment with different techniques. Two of the healthiest preparation methods include baking and boiling. Additionally, sweet potatoes can replace squash in our face mask recipe if you\'ve got some on hand. Pumpkin Seeds When carving a jack-o-lantern most of us toss out the seeds without giving them a second thought. However, pumpkin seeds make a delicious and nutritious snack that can keep your skin looking great. These tiny treats are high in zinc, which is known as an ""essential trace element""-meaning it\'s important for our overall health. Zinc has been shown to regulate oil production in the skin and promote the creation of collagen, which is a protein that\'s responsible for keeping your skin elastic, young looking, and overall healthy. Like brazil nuts, pumpkin seeds are somewhat high in fat and calories, so be sure to enjoy them only in moderation. You should always roast seeds for roughly 40 minutes before eating them, or purchase them pre-roasted at the grocery store. Learn more about breaking your cycle of acne!

"[""5 Simple Ways to Keep Your Complexion Acne-Free this Fall 09-18-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Shorter days and cooler temperatures mark the transition from summer to autumn, and as we prepare to “fall back,” our skincare routine may be in need of adjusting, in addition to our clocks. While the hot, humid summer months are tough on many acne sufferers, the fall season is actually the most common time of year for many people to experience breakouts. During this transitional swing from summer to winter, drier air and harsher winds cause dry, dead skin cells to shed and clog pores, which can lead to blemishes. Why You Need to Step Up Your Skincare Game for Fall Dry skin is the main culprit for seasonal acne this time of year, making it especially important to step up your skincare game. Much like your wardrobe, updating and making changes to your skincare and makeup routines to correspond with the season is essential. Here are our 5 must-do’s when it comes to fall skincare for acne prone skin: 1 – Exfoliate and Moisturize. The simplest solution is to stick to the skincare basics: exfoliate and moisturize. Exfoliation is critical during fall and winter months, as pore-clogging skin cells need to be sloughed away to keep breakouts at bay. The sudsy cleanser needed to keep oil under control during the summer months may be a bit harsh for fall, so be sure to prevent additional drying by indulging the skin with a soap-free face and body wash, that is also non-comedogenic . Lean toward creamy cleansers rather than foamy or frothy options (again, just make sure these are non-comedogenic, which are designed not to clog pores further). Exfoliating is an important step but should only be done if you are not suffering from any open cysts on your face or body. When exfoliating your face, only do so once a week with mild nonabrasive products. This hinders the formation of tiny abrasions and the passing of bacteria into the skin. Body exfoliation can be done every other day without as much concern. Always moisturize after exfoliating and make sure not to do it too vigorously. Just as we need to break out the leggings and layers to keep warm from the crisp, chilly air, our skin also needs an additional layer to stay moisturized. If you use a moisturizer all year, you may need to opt for a thicker formula during fall to keep dry air off the skin, and lock-in moisture. A moisturizing facial mask can be a great way to pack an additional punch during these drier times. 2 – Jump-start your Day (and your skin). If the cooler climates and darker days tempt you to linger in bed for a few extra minutes in the morning, jump start your day, and your metabolism, with hot lemon water to hydrate skin, detoxify the liver, and add a little boost of vitamin C to help knock any redness or dark spots out of your complexion. Oh, and as long as you're spending a little extra time sleeping in, remember to change those pillow cases regularly, keeping you and your slumberous sanctuary clean and bacteria free, reducing the risk of bumps and blemishes. 3 – Good Makeup. When covering up with makeup such as a foundation, BB cream or tinted moisturizer, be especially sure to keep your brushes, sponges, and pads clean, as dead skin can easily collect on these surfaces, leading to breakouts. Look for fragrance-free, non-comedogenic formulas, and resist applying with a heavy hand - the matte look wears well on the lips and eyes in the cooler months, but a soft, natural face is always in style. 4 – For Lasting Results. Finding topical remedies is always a tempting solution for those with problem skin, but for lasting results proper skin care is an inside job. Food, you’ll see below, will be such a great adjunct to your efforts. But when it comes to truly treating acne, meaning, getting rid of it, a treatment is needed. Acne does not go away on its own when its left untreated. No food, topical or DIY treatment can do it. Symptoms might lessen, but they will almost always come back. Why? Acne is a usually the result of a hormonal imbalance. This imbalance then makes your sebaceous glands go haywire. The sebaceous glands control oil production. So if they produce too much oil, here comes acne. Our AcnEase® users are able to experience how a treatment can act as a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands so that the sebaceous glands can return to normal activity. The botanical ingredients that make up the various AcnEase® treatments were selected based on years of research and trials as the safest and most effective combination to not only eliminate acne symptoms but also prevent acne from coming. It is the only natural treatment on the market that PREVENTS acne (with a high user success rate too), which is KEY to the process of breaking the acne cycle. 5 – Food for Thought. The foods that we use to satisfy and fuel us affect so much more than just our weight, and when you are making smart food choices you can bet on wearing those results right on your skin. Orange foods are packed with beta-carotene, a naturally occurring substance that the body converts to vitamin A, or retinol, a requirement for healthy skin, and a common ingredient in many expensive treatment creams and serums. Fall sees no shortage of delicious deep orange treats, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin (even pumpkin seeds are rich in vitamin A,) and squash, the latter carrying an added benefit of omega 3, a fatty acid long used for healthy skin and hair. In-season apples and pomegranates are rich in antioxidants, and high fiber pears also come loaded with vitamin C, all doing their part in delivering a lively, glowing complexion. This Thanksgiving, try adding some more veggies to your plate, because that extra brussel sprout can go a long way in delivering a daily dose of essential vitamins. With so much to enjoy about the changing time of year, you don’t have to let troublesome acne take the fun out of fall. As with any season, always remember to drink plenty of water, and don’t skip the sunscreen, even if the sun tends to be hidden a bit more.

"[""Celebrity Makeup Tips for Covering Acne 06-10-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Our guest today is Kendra Richards , professional makeup artist, whose work has been seen in publications such as Vogue, Vanity Fair and InStyle to advertisers Olay and Paul Mitchell and Target to name a few. Some of her many clients include Cindy Crawford, Hilary Duff, Anna Paquin, Justin Timberlake, James Franco, Martina McBride and Bella Thorne. In addition to her clients, Kendra frequently shares her professional expertise on camera for E! Entertainment, Lancome, PopSugar, CocoPerez and Total Beauty to name a few. Sharing beauty insider techniques is her favorite aspect of reaching people through the media. By Kendra Richards My approach to covering acne and acne scars with make up is this: I begin with a liquid foundation and apply concealer only where needed with a pointed brush for precision. A common mistake that I see people make is thinking that if you have acne or acne scars thick make up piled on heavily will make it less noticeable. The best way to conceal is the method I explained above. Too much concealer or heavy make up only attracts attention. The best way to cancel out redness is by using a concealer that is yellowish/beige to help neutralize the color. If you have dark marks that look more blue or are darker, use a concealer that is more peach/orange tone than yellow to neutralize the blue. If you have ethnic skin, a real orange concealer or cream make up is a great insider trick to neutralize the darkness much more than just your basic foundation color or when added to concealer. That orange helps to neutralize and when blended, enhances the skin tone beautifully. An insider trick if you have a raised pimple to make less noticeable is to apply a lighter dab of concealer just on the bottom side of the raised pimple. That will visually help the pimple not look as prominent. Here is the idea: the shadow created just under the pimple can be visually erased by dabbing a lighter color below it and make it less noticeable or visually disappear. It works! Give it a try. Also, powder lightly and only where needed. If you have been using treatments and your skin is dry having foundation and concealer plus a lot of powder will make the skin look too dry and draw attention. We would like to thank Kendra for taking the time to give us this helpful information, and would also like to note that if you do have dry skin due to your preferred acne treatment, make sure to keep your skin moisturized. Having dry skin can set you back from seeing positive results and also increase the time it takes for you to get rid of your acne. Take a look at options that don't have any setbacks, like our natural medicine, AcnEase® , which is clinically validated for safety and efficacy with up to a 98% user success rate.

"[""Your ALL-NATURAL Acne-Free Daily Skincare Routine 08-09-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Before you begin to enjoy a daily skin care routine designed to provide you with healthy skin, please note the following general guidelines. General Guidelines More is not always better. Don't apply more than ONE mask daily. Always apply a mask to freshly cleansed skin Cleaning your face with products that suit YOU is a foundation of healthy skin NEVER go to sleep with your makeup on After you exercise, clean your skin Exfoliation (peeling) should not be done more than once a week Use your sunscreen especially after using any exfoliating/peeling products Alternate the fruit and veggie DIY moisturizing masks; we provide you with many of them on our blog . The best way to use moisturizing and rejuvenating masks is every other day or every two days; especially before big events - not every day. Observe your skin; if you see that some ingredients don't agree with you (ex. make your skin red, sensitized, itchy), stop using the masks and just use the chamomile astringent only. Even nature isn't always right! Try to use organic, non-GMO products when possible Step 1: Cleansing Use oil and fragrance free non-comedogenic mild cleanser. Stripping your skin from all skin oil will only make it produce more oil. Or try a dab of olive oil, and massage with fingertips over the skin. Wipe with a cotton cloth soaked with warm water (not hot) and a few drops of lemon. Do twice daily, and follow up with astringent. Step 2: Exfoliation Avocado has emulation-like properties, which make this a great moisturizer for acne prone skin. If you have very sensitive skin, skip this step. Avocado Exfoliation Mask Ingredients 2 thick slices of avocado 2 tbs. natural no-flavor yogurt Instructions Blend the slices of fresh, peeled, ripe papaya together with the yogurt. Blend them well until you get a compact compound, but be careful not to overdo it so that it wouldn't be easily spreadable. After cleaning your face, apply this mixture to your entire face avoiding your eyes and eyelids. Leave the mask on for about 5 minutes, and then remove it with warm water. Pat dry. You can then apply the chamomile astringent. The mask will moisturize your skin while getting rid of dead skin cells. Use once a week (not before going in to the sun either). Step 2a: Rejuvenating This step is to be done on a day when you don't do the exfoliation mask. Cabbage is rich in vitamins and minerals. Its deep cleansing, anti-inflammatory and cooling action makes it a valuable mask for acne sufferers. This mask can be used on all skin types. Fresh Cabbage Rejuvenation Mask Ingredients 1/4 small green cabbage 1 large carrot juiced or 2 tablespoons fresh carrot juice 1/2 lemon 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons of green clay powder (available inexpensively on Amazon) Instructions Throw away the outer leaves of the cabbage. Rinse and chop the remainder of the cabbage. Combine the cabbage, carrot juice, one teaspoon of lemon juice and the olive oil in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Mix together three tablespoons of the puree with the clay powder. Use the cabbage mask once a week after cleansing, not on the day when you do the exfoliation mask. Masks are best made and used on the same day; they don't have a good shelf life. To apply the mask Find a calm time when you are not rushed. Protect your hair with a towel or band and remove all makeup. Cleanse the skin with water. Steam your face for 1-2 minutes to open the pores (to do this, put hot water in a bowl, put a towel over your head and put your face over the bowl - be careful not to get too close, you don't want you to burn yourself!) Apply the mask evenly (avoiding the eyes) and leave it on for around 20 minutes. If the mask has more of a liquid consistency, apply using a cotton ball. A second layer can be applied after a few minutes. Lie down and relax - no talking! Keep your face relaxed! Wet the mask to soften the clay first, and then remove the mask with cotton pads or a cotton towel and luke-warm water. Then dry. Close the pores using the chamomile astringent. Step 3: Astringent Chamomile has anti-inflammatory and anti-bacteria properties. When applied topically, chamomile can help reduce inflammation associated with acne, razor bumps or irritation. Chamomile Astringent How to use: You can make your own chamomile astringent by taking 3-4 chamomile tea bags (or 2 handfuls of the dry plant) and brewing it into a very strong tea. When cooled, splash or use on a cotton pad all over your face twice a day. Keep the leftovers in the refrigerator, but use or discard in two days. Azulene This chamomile derivative with anti-inflammatory properties has a long respected history, dating back to the 15th century, and is used to repair and soothe problem skin. You can find after-shave lotions or oil with Azulene (choose the highest content). For the body, use Azulene essential oil which can be found in your local natural food store. How to Use: Add this essential oil to a bath (10 -15 drops). No need to mix any other essential oil with it. Use warm water and soak for up to 30 minutes. Do twice daily, and follow up with moisturizing. Step 4: Moisturizing All acne prone skin needs moisturizing, especially those with dry skin. Milk and honey were actually used by pharaoh's wives in ancient Egypt! Moisturizing Honey Milk Mask Ingredients 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons regular or corn (non-GMO) or potato flour 2 tablespoons milk Instructions In a bowl, mix all the ingredients until a creamy and smooth. With the help of a brush, spread the mask on the skin to be treated (face and / or body). Leave this on for 15-20 minutes and rinse. To be done every other day or every 2 days after astringent (or after your weekly peeling).

"['What you think may be acne scars, may be this 08-27-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Acne, especially large and chronic cysts or pimples and blackheads that we squeeze or pop, may damage skin tissue permanently, forming acne scars. The only real way to make sure that you do not get acne scars is to PREVENT acne from forming and to break the acne cycle . There is however a condition that may follow acne, but is NOT permanent, that sometimes is confused with acne scars ; this condition is known as Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH) . What is PIH? PIH is the medical term for skin discoloration resulting from an inflammatory injury to the skin tissue. It is the skin\'s natural response to inflammation. PIH is a flat area of discoloration on the skin ranging from pink to red, purple, brown or black, depending on your skin tone and depth of the discoloration. How PIH Develops PIH forms when a wound, rash, pimple, or other skin damage causes skin inflammation, which triggers the skin to produce too much melanin. Melanin is the protein in the skin that gives the skin its color. Too much melanin darkens and discolors the skin in the area of former inflammation. This discoloration stays on the skin even after the pimple, cyst or other skin ""injury"" has healed. PIH is very common among acne sufferers, both men and women. It can occur in all skin types, although it is more common with darker skin complexions. PIH is not however a true acne scar. For acne sufferers, PIH can follow both severe cysts and relatively minor pimples and papules, but usually more inflammation produces larger and darker PIH. As we said, picking, squeezing or popping pimples increases the chances of developing post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. How To Tell If You Have PIH or Acne Scars You can identify post inflammatory hyperpigmentation by carefully examining the skin. PIH can be a range of colors, however, the skin will not be wrinkled or depressed. PIH may look like a large freckle or as a large, dark discoloration or spot and sometimes it may even look like new skin. Scars can be recognized for their texture whereas PIH is more about discolorations, and scars also involve indentations. How To Treat PIH It is good to know that PIH is not scarring, and in most cases it will fade away over time, even without treatment, but it can take anywhere from 3-24 months (sometimes even longer) for most of the PIH spots to fully disappear. The time it takes for PIH to fade depends on how dark the PIH spot is compared to your skin tone. The bigger the contrast between the PIH and your natural skin tone, the longer it will take to fade. There are treatment options available to help fade Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation quicker. However, your acne should be under control before beginning any treatment for PIH. Otherwise, each new pimple could cause another PIH, reducing the effectiveness of treatment. So treating your PRESENT ACNE and PREVENTING NEW ACNE from coming are the first conditions to treat and prevent PIH. Whatever treatment option you choose, understand that improvement will take time, requires persistence and patience and may cost a lot of money. Think in terms of months rather than weeks. Also, if you have PIH be especially diligent in applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen daily. The sun may darken the discolorations and increase fading time. Over-the-Counter Treatments Mild cases of PIH may respond well to natural lightening agents such as lemon juice and some over-the-counter ""lightening"" products. Many of them use a combination of alpha and beta hydroxy acids (including glycolic acid), vitamin A, vitamin C, and other ingredients to exfoliate the skin and speed up the growth of new cells. Some products include lightening agents to ""bleach"" discolorations. If you have a darker complexion beware of "" bleaching"" products as they may actually leave you with another type of spots. Also, you don\'t want to expose your skin to all of these chemicals. Hydroquinone Hydroquinone is a common treatment for post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. It is available over-the-counter at 1% to 2% strength, and in 3% to 4% prescription creams. Hydroquinone works by blocking the enzyme responsible for melanin production, thereby lightening the skin. Hydroquinone creams often contain additional lightening ingredients, such as kojic acid, glycolic acid, tretinoin and other retinoids, or vitamin C. These combinations of creams can give you better results than using hydroquinone alone BUT THERE IS A SERIOUS WARNING HERE. Hydroquinone products should be used with caution and sparsely on affected areas only, to prevent the unwanted lightening of your natural skin color. Hydroquinone may also cause irritation in sensitive skin. Topical Retinoids (by prescription) Retinoids that exfoliate the old skin cells are often prescribed to treat PIH. Obvious results may not be apparent for several weeks to several months and topical retinoids may cause excessive dryness, redness, and/or irritation, which may in turn increase hyperpigmentation. Glycolic Acid Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid found in many skin care products. It effectively exfoliates the skin, helping to lighten post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Available in cleansers, creams, and gels, glycolic acid not only helps improve postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, but also leaves your skin smooth and soft. Cleansers, gels, pads, and lotions containing glycolic acid are available over-the-counter. Higher concentrations are available with a prescription only. As, with all products improvement may not be seen for several months. Azelaic Acid Azelaic acid is used in prescription only products that attempt to treat PIH. It works by decreasing inflammation and speeding up cell turnover rates. It is an alternative for those who may be unable to use hydroquinone. Since azelaic acid has not been tested on those with dark complexion so it may actually be responsible for hypopigmentation. It may also irritate, burn and sting the skin. Azelaic acid is available in cream and gel form, and is sometimes used in conjunction with glycolic acid or retinoids. As always, monitor your skin for redness and irritation and let your doctor know right away if you experience these side effects. Other Treatments More persistent cases of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation can be attended to with the use of professionally done chemical peels and microdermabrasion. A series of treatments is needed to adequately fade PIH and some side effects may be associated with those treatments. None of them may be used when you still have active acne . Natural Ways to Fight Hyperpigmentation As always, we support a search for natural ingredients being used to help improve skin conditions. The products mentioned above may take time and patience to help brighten your skin, but they are chemical based solutions you certainly should be careful about. None of those natural ingredients should also be used on skin that still have active acne, and since they all exfoliate the skin, sun protection. Here are some ingredients you need to look out for as they certainly may speed up the healing of PIH: Raw honey, lemon juice (fresh from a lemon contains citric acid that will both lighten the skin and speed up skin regeneration), yogurt (contains lactic acid that works similar to citric acid but will also moisturize the skin), wheat germ oil (natures collegian helper), rosehips oil, aloe vera juice and of course raw sugar cane sugar (produces glycoloc acid, praised by the cosmetic industry now). None of these natural ingredients however should be used on skin that still has active acne and since they all exfoliate the skin, sun protection is necessary. Honey Exfoliating Mask Use organic and non-GMO ingredients when possible . Ingredients 2 tablespoons of raw honey 2 tablespoons of raw sugar cane sugar (show be ground until very fine powder) Lemon juice from half of a medium size lemon (no pits) Instructions Mix well in a small bowl. Use fresh applying on freshly cleaned skin with clean fingers or a clean natural hair brush. Avoid eye area. Keep on for 5-10 minutes. Wash with luke warm water. If stinging occurs, wash off immediately. Use 2-3 times per week. Follow with chamomile astringent and non comedogenic moisturizer . Always follow this with sun protection and do NOT use on active acne or before you go outdoors. Evening is the best to do this. Need to know what type of acne you have?

"['The Easiest Male Acne MakeUp Tutorial 03-15-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments A message from Dr. Agnes: Hey guys. It\'s no secret that male acne is difficult to treat. But while you\'re working on treating your acne with AcnEase®, there are ways to make it look better, and have people focus on you instead of your zits. Maybe you\'ve thought about applying makeup before or maybe the thought never crossed your mind. Either way, know this. These days, makeup isn\'t just for women. An enormous amount of men actually apply makeup to their faces daily, and you wouldn\'t even know! So muster up the courage, and take your buddy or partner with you to the cosmetics counter if you\'re feeling like you need a little cover-up - you\'ll be glad you did (especially when those holiday photos begin to surface!). Please join me in welcoming our guest, Todra Payne, green makeup artist and President of HealthyBeautyProject.com . by Todra Payne Whenever I work with male news reporters showing them techniques for looking great on camera, I\'m always asked, ""Will anyone be able to tell I\'m wearing makeup?"" Because of social stigma, men often struggle with the notion of applying makeup to look better, even for a job that requires it. Men with acne often wish they could downplay their blemishes and outbreaks, but aren\'t comfortable asking about cosmetic solutions. If you\'re a guy who wants to use a little something to feel more confident, rest assured that using concealer in a shade that matches your skin, applied properly, won\'t be noticeable at all. And your skin will look better, giving you more confidence for events like social gatherings and job interviews. These 5 tips will help you get what you need and apply it properly. Step 1: Head On Out! The product you\'re going to need to cover blemishes is what women use for under eye dark circles and skin blemishes. It\'s called concealer, and it comes in liquid and cream. Some cream versions are still rather slippery. You\'re going to want to look for a brand that comes in a thick cream so it\'ll stay put when you apply it - and make sure it\'s simple, containing natural ingredients, is non comedogenic and is preferably pure mineral makeup. Step 2: Choose a Concealer. Ask the sales associate at the store to show you samples of three colors that may match your skin. Apply the samples one by one on different spots on your face where you\'ll need coverage. Step outside the store and look at the options in a mirror (bring one with you shopping) in daylight. This is an important step. What looks great in the department store lighting will not look natural in daylight. Whichever color is not noticeable is the one you want. Step 3: Buy a Concealer Brush. Purchase a concealer brush to apply the concealer. These are usually long-haired, skinny brushes in nylon or natural (animal) hair. I prefer the nylon for better application and as a cruelty-free option. Step 4: The Application. Apply concealer onto clean skin in light, quick strokes until all of your blemishes are covered. Blend the edges so the color blends in with your skin. Step 5: Hands Off! Learn not to touch your face unnecessarily throughout the day. The oil on your hands could contribute to breakouts and smear your concealer. *Tip: If you have very oily skin, you may need to get a translucent (colorless, non comedogenic) powder to go on top of the concealer.

"[""AcnEase® works! My skin is clear! What do I do next? 04-05-2014 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments It has finally happened! You've cleared your skin of acne with AcnEase®! But now what? Can I stop taking AcnEase cold-turkey? Stopping the treatment suddenly may work for some but for some it may also increase the risk for flare-ups to return. So we developed a strategy to minimize this risk. We suggest that instead of stopping AcnEase cold-turkey, you wean yourself off the treatment slowly by going down by one level of treatment over a 1-2 month period.For example, if you are on the severe acne regimen, you go down to moderate acne regimen. Stay on this level for 1-2 months, and if your skin remains clear, go down again to the mild acne regimen for 1-2 months.If you don't see any flare-ups within 1-2 months, then go down to the maintenance treatment. You can stay on the maintenance for a long time as AcnEase is safe for long-term use. Or, if you don't see any flare-ups in 1-2 months on the lowest maintenance dose (2x3 or 2x2 tablets daily), then congratulations! You may opt to stoptaking the product all together. Numerous individuals with chronic acne opt to useAcnEase regularly on a lower regimen for a long time to make sure they maintain clear skin. All of the dosages for the treatments are located on each product page on our website--and all of the dosages also come with your order. What if I decrease my dose and start experiencing breakouts again? Should you see a flare-up at any time when you've taken a step down, go back up to the dose that worked (the level above where you are now) and stay there for at least a month or until the flare-up has subsided. At that time, you can then try to take a step down again and continue to monitor your skin for pimples forming. Please do not forget that you can also help your skin to heal with an appropriate skincare routine and special tips to help to heal the outbreaks. Dab the breakout with a Q-tip soaked in witch hazel 2-3 times a day. Use chamomile astringent twice or three times a day. Try a DIY nourishing mask to make your skin feel extra special. FOR THE LADIES: What if I still break out before or during my period? We know that prior to, or even during your period, you can experience flare-ups. So if this is the case, and you are still on an AcnEase regimen, we suggest that 3 days prior to getting your period, you go to the dosage a step higher thanyour present regimen, and continue this increased regimen for a total of 7 days. After that, you can go back down to your present regular treatment. If you are already on the highest dose (severe acne regimen), DO NOT INCREASE THE DOSE. Instead, utilize our skincare routine and topical helpers to help to control breakouts. This advice is not applicable to those who do not presently use AcnEase® (you need to be on AcnEase® for at least a month to start breaking the cycle of acne. This tip is not to be used as a shortcut, but as an enhancer). Am I going to have to be on AcnEase® forever? No, you do not. We talk more about this over here . We are always here to answer your questions, so don't hesitate to ask!

"['Emergency Tips For Last-Minute Zits 09-05-2012 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments From the change in seasons to the change in schedules, this time of year can cause some major havoc on your skin - and the last thing we need is to wake up in the morning having to deal with surprising and unwanted pimples or cysts. Here are some of my recommended quick fixes to make facial acne look non-existent (while waiting for the more sustained effects following your AcnEase treatment). Emergency Tips for Last-Minute Zits If the pimple is just forming and you need it cleared in a day or two, increase the evening dose of AcnEase® to 6 tablets for one or two days. To speed up healing of sudden and existing blemishes, dip a q-tip in Tea Tree Oil or in pharmaceutical grade hydrogen peroxide and dab it on the pimple(s) 3 times a day. Use sparsely and only on the pimple! Instead of the tea tree oil or hydrogen peroxide, you can dab a small amount of honey on each zit. Leave on the affected area until it dries, then wash with warm water. (NO RUBBING PLEASE) To cover pimples, use a small amount of green concealer on each pimple. Green counteracts the red color caused by inflammation. Then, add a concealer on top of that, that matches your skin tone. Apply sparingly with a q-tip and blend in lightly with the ring finger. Use a ""whipped"" foundation that evens the texture of the skin. *PLEASE NOTE: Good quality, non-comedogenic concealers removed every night in a proper way, as not to cause excess sebum production and dirt to clog your pores, is fine. To really treat acne naturally, efficiently and long term, you need to get to the root of the problem and treat it from the inside out (see more on how to do that) . Yes, you can prevent new blemishes from coming, and don\'t have to worry about doing these quick fixes! Here\'s to no more zits! Love, Dr. A And don\'t forget to come say ""Hi"" on Facebook or Twitter ! «My work in China in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector, and my personal experience while growing up in Europe, inspired me to develop Herborium ® , a novel Botanical Therapeutics ® company, based on a new, innovative healthcare concept that combines science and nature.

"[""I'm Treating My Acne with AcnEase®: Will I Have to Stay on it Forever? 04-03-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments We get this question a lot, so chances are, you're wondering too! Here are the facts: AcnEase® treatment may take anywherebetween one to 6 months depending on the severity of your acne and how chronic it is. If you think this is a long time...think twice. If you use antibiotics, retinoids, oral contraceptives and of course any topical products, a minimum recommended time to see any results is 6 months. And if you stop using them, your acne will return, as none of them actually addresses the causes of acne and breaks the acne cycle. Even generic forms of Accutane with its severe adverse effectsare prescribed for a minimum of 6 months...so AcnEase can really help you not only better but also faster. After you've achieved the desired results that you want on AcnEase®, you do not have to continue taking the pills for the rest of your life if you do not want to. On the other hand, if you want to ensure that your symptoms will not return, you may, without hesitation, opt to use AcnEase long-term. It is completely safe to do because the ingredients are high-quality plant-derived herbal extracts and there are no known side effects. Please keep in mind, however, that since acne is a manifestation of an internal problem and results from an overproduction of skin oil by the sebaceous glands, it is possible that the factors that were responsible for this overproduction of sebum may return. It is also possible that new factors may occur that may disrupt your hormonal system and induce acne formation.

"['Summer Foods Your Skin Will Love. Bonus: Summer Nourishing Mask 07-04-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Summer is a time for the beach, parties, weddings, graduations and barbecues...and with the summer, our acne gets aggravated by sweat, sunscreens, sunless tanning, diet and a number of other factors. So here\'s how to use the bounty offered by the summer to do something good for your skin. Summer foods can actually protect your skin from the inside out. Choose foods with large amounts of omega-3. Omega-3 has anti-inflammatory properties. Grill your wild salmon, and trout. Make yourself a fresh herring salad. The powerhouse of omega-3, the sardine, is even packed with Vitamin D too. Start picking those berries. Strawberries, blueberries and blackberries have catechins that protect skin from UVA rays. So have them as snacks, add them to salads and yogurt, or make a delicious natural sorbet drink blending them with a bit of spring water and ice. Feast on tomatoes and watermelons. Great to eat by themselves or not, tomatoes and watermelons contain lycopene, which protects your skin against UVA rays. Discover broccoli sprouts. Broccoli sprouts have the richest source of glucoraphanin, the precursor of sulforaphane, which is credited with increasing the skin\'s ability to protect itself from cancer. Love the ""fuzzy"" kiwi (not a bird - the FRUIT- silly). One kiwi has more Vitamin C than a lemon; it is rich in many microelements including zinc that is great for acne prone skin and also contains a load of antioxidants. You can add this fuzzy cute fruit to salads, eat it with your cereal, use on frozen yogurt to add a color to your desert or simply eat it as an apple . Summer Nourishing Mask Summer makes your skin work very hard. Sun, wind and sweat may exacerbate symptoms of acne and irritate the skin. Dry skin may actually stimulate the sebaceous glances to produce more sebum; overall summer stress can result in making skin very sensitive. Try this moisturizing mask to help your skin cope with summer stress. What you need: 1 cup plain yogurt 2 ½ tablespoons of unflavored honey ½ to 1 teaspoon of lemon juice (for oily skin only) Cotton pads (optional) Warm water Preparation: In a bowl, mix together the yogurt and honey. For oily skin, you may add ½ to 1 teaspoon of lemon juice to help absorb excess oil. You might want to do a patch-test with the mixture first, behind one ear. Wait one hour, watching for any irritation. How to use it: With clean hands or cotton pads, apply the mask liberally to your freshly washed face and neck (even your décolletage), and leave on for 5-10 minutes. Gently wash off with warm water.

"['The Best Natural Astringent for Acne Prone Skin 06-26-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments A popular way of thinking when you have acne is to scrub your skin as much as possible with products that ""sting"" in order to get rid of acne -Unfortunately, this is not the case. That ""stinging"" feeling doesn\'t mean that you\'re doing something good for your skin. Practices like this actually do more harm than good. The more chemicals, and product, that you put on your skin, the more your skin is striped of its natural oils, and goes into protection mode and actually produces more oils, which can make your acne worse and chronic! We do know that by implementing the proper washing and moisturizing techniques, your chances to get clear skin increases two-fold. And don\'t forget - you have to treat your skin with an acne treatment when you have acne - it will not go away simply by washing or doing DIY treatments. After you\'ve cleaned your skin, and before you moisturize, applying a non-harsh yet effective astringent cleans, tones and firms the skin and also constricts the pores. Most astringents dry out the skin, which again, will make your acne worse. And men, a natural astringent can be a very powerful tool in your arsenal to fight aftershave bumps and pimples, irritation and acne. If you aspire for a healthy and clear complexion, use a powerful natural astringent like Chamomile that can control bacteria, help to prevent razor bumps and even speed up the healing of pimples. Chamomile A stringents Chamomile has anti-inflammatory and anti-bacteria properties. When applied topically, chamomile can help reduce inflammation associated with acne, razor bumps or irritation. How to use: You can make your own chamomile astringent by taking 3-4 chamomile tea bags (or 2 handfuls of the dry plant) and brewing it into a very strong tea. When cooled, splash or use on a cotton pad all over your face twice a day. Keep the leftovers in the refrigerator, but use or discard in two days. Azulene This chamomile derivative with anti-inflammatory properties has a long respected history, dating back to the 15th century, and is used to repair and soothe problem skin. You can find after-shave lotions or oil with Azulene (choose the highest content). For the body, use Azulene essential oil which can be found in your local natural food store. How to Use: Add this essential oil to a bath (10 -15 drops). No need to mix any other essential oil with it. Use warm water and soak for up to 30 minutes.

"[""Acne-Friendly Kitchen: Foods that can help to keep your skin clear 10-08-2013 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Although diet is not the cause of skin problems like acne, it plays an important role in their treatment. A poor diet can exacerbate acne, even if you do everything else right, but a good diet can help fight it. Since acne is an external manifestation of an internal disorder, the right foods can heal, cleanse and nourish your skin from within. Here is the perfect menu to keep your kitchen acne-friendly: Acne-Friendly Breakfast: Kiwi-flaxseed oatmeal and a skin-cleansing raspberry-pineapple-ginger smoothie Why? If you don’t have wheat allergies, whole grains are great for you. They’re an excellent source of fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, thiamine, iron, beta-glucan (which may help regulate blood sugar), vitamin B6, and the antioxidants known as avenanthramides (which may help promote healthy circulation). Flaxseed provides a good dose of vitamins E and B6 as well as essential fatty acids (EFAs). Kiwi is rich in many microelements including zinc, which is great for acne-prone skin and also contains a load of antioxidants. A skin-cleansing raspberry-pineapple-ginger smoothie is a great healing drink that will reduce inflammation, provide a healthy dose of antioxidants and help your skin, and body, to regain a healthy balance. How? Cook whole grain, steel-cut oats, not instant or sweetened. Sprinkle with a serving of milled flaxseed and top with kiwi. If you don’t like oatmeal, try whole-grain toast and an egg , which is full of vitamin E and A. Check out our skin-cleansing smoothie recipe here . Or, if you’re not lactose intolerant, just have a glass of milk! Milk is full of vitamins E and A. Fat free or 1%-2% is great for you. Acne-Friendly Lunch: Chickpea-avocado quinoa, steamed kale, carrots, and broccoli, and a refreshing melon-grape-cucumber-parsley drink Why? Quinoa provides all nine essential amino acids and contains twice the fiber of most grains. It’s also full of iron, magnesium, calcium, and folate. Though it’s technically a seed, it can be prepared and eaten as you would rice. Avocado tastes great with quinoa and is full of vitamin E. Chickpeas (also called garbanzo beans) are high in vitamin B6 and pantothenic acid. Kale provides you with a lot of vitamin E, carrots are full of vitamin A, and broccoli is full of folate. The melon-grape-cucumber-parsley drink is good for calming inflammation and moistening the tissues. Parsley is also rich in nutrients (especially iron) to bring a healthy glow to a pale complexion. How? Cook quinoa and chickpeas. Steam kale, carrots, and broccoli. Mix and add fresh avocado. Check out our Melon Skin Refresher recipe here Acne-Friendly Dinner: Salmon with spinach-tomato-cucumber-sunflower seed salad and carrot-pineapple skin-helping juice Why? Salmon is full of the rights kinds of fats, EFAs, which promote clear and healthy skin and are also good for the heart. If you’re not into salmon, try chicken , trout , sardines , herring or tofu . Spinach is one of those great leafy greens full of vitamin A and folate. Try making a salad out of it, adding sunflower seeds , tomatoes , and cucumbers . Cucumber has 96% water content that is more nutritious than regular water, which helps in keeping the body hydrated and body temperature regulated. It also helps in flushing out the toxins from the body. Cucumber also contains vitamins A, B, and C and minerals like magnesium, potassium, and silica--all are very beneficial for your skin. The carrot-pineapple skin-helping juice is full of beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A. Carrots help to clear spots and blemishes ( will also give you this baby fresh glow) , and help boost the skin’s resistance to UV light. Combined with pineapple, the juice helps to stimulate digestion and regulate the metabolism. How? Make a salmon salad, as mentioned above, or try our salmon kebab and salad recipe here . Check out our Carrot and Pineapple Juicy Skin Helper recipe here . Acne-Friendly Snacks: Probiotic yogurt and berries; whole grain rice cakes with almond butter; or fruit and walnut salad Why? Probiotic yogurt is full of good bacteria that your body needs, and berries are a great superfood for acne sufferers. Almond butter is full of vitamins E and B6. Oranges strawberries , and grapes are full of vitamin C, and walnuts are high in EFAs, as well as vitamins E and B6. Don’t forget to drink up throughout the day! You want to drink plenty of water. For extra vitamin C, add a slice of lemon, orange or pink grapefruit to each glass. Here are some resources on how to find local, fresh food : myskin.com A REFRESHING NEW WAY TO FIND EFFECTIVE SKINCARE PRODUCTS THAT WORK FOR YOU. FarmMatch.com connects consumers with local farmers, buying clubs, farmers markets and restaurants that offer fresh, organic and sustainable food. EatLocalGrown enables you to also find locally grown food, now. Enter your zipcode and hit search. Be sure to take into account how food is cooked. For example, foods that are roasted, curried, barbecued, baked, smoked or deep-fried may exasperate your acne, while steaming, quick boiling, blanching, poaching, braising, stewing or quick stir-frying using very little oil is great for acne sufferers. And remember, even with the perfect diet, treating acne takes time and perseverance, and diet alone cannot treat your acne. In addition to eating right, you need to use a treatment that will help get your sebaceous glands under control. Don’t forget to take your AcnEase® at the appropriate times throughout the day.

"[""Does Acne Prone Skin Need Daily Moisturizing Treatment? 02-24-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The answer to this question is unequivocally YES. If your skin is plagued by acne, blackheads or whiteheads, ranges from dry to oily, part of your daily skincare routine MUST include an appropriate moisturizer 2 TIMES daily - in the morning and in the evening - in order to help the skin stay hydrated and supple. You can start out your daily skin care routine with our recommended washes and astringents , and finish the routine with a moisturizer that can best meet the specific needs of your skin. The 3 Moisturizing Rules for All Skin Types: With Recipes! Rule No 1. Combination Skin: Look for simpler ingredients in moisturizers, particularly in baby targeted products - some of the organic baby moisturizers provide a better choice of ingredients (and those you actually can pronounce!). Rule No. 2. Dry Skin: Yes people with dry and sensitive skin also have acne! Look for emulation-like moisturizers, extracts of olive oil, small amounts of jojoba, almond or grape seed oil, avocado, rose water and oatmeal - these are all good choices for this type of skin. You can also try our special avocado mask, which does wonders for dry skin. Avocado Moisturizing Mask : Start with a fully ripened avocado. Mush it well. Add a few drops of olive oil and make it into a smooth paste. Apply on clean and dry skin. Leave on for 10-15 minutes. Rinse with luke warm water; pat dry. Rule No. 3. Oily Skin : Light weight oil-free moisturizers; water, aloe vera, marine algae, lemon grass extract, willow bark extract and witch hazel provide a good basis for oily skin moisturizers. We also highly recommend trying our aloe vera and cucumber mask, which is lightweight and effective for those with oily skin. Aloe Vera and Cucumber Mask : You need 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel and ½ a cucumber. Peel and seed the cucumber and cut into small pieces. Using a blender or food processor, blend the aloe vera gel and cucumber until it becomes a smooth paste. Apply to a clean face, in smooth gentle motions, being careful to keep the coverage even and avoiding the sensitive eye area. Keep on for 10-15 minutes. Rinse and pat dry.

"['How to REALLY Clean Acne Prone Skin Without Chemicals 02-24-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments One of the most prevailing and potentially disadvantageous myths about cleaning acne prone skin is a belief that you need to use salicylic acid or alcohol based products to do it, and in addition, scrape the skin during vigorous exfoliation. As the intentions behind this belief are good (killing bacteria that thrive in clogged pores), and some may even experience a temporary decrease in pimples, long term effects are certainly not worth it. A few of the adverse effects you may expect from this type of cleaning is dry, irritated, prematurely aged, sun sensitive skin, and an actual increase in inflammation due to skin abrasion. So how do you clean and take care of acne prone skin without harsh chemicals? Here are some basic rules on what to choose, how to do it and a few homemade natural recipes that may help to do it better. If you buy cleaner, toner and astringent - choose those without salicylic acid, alcohol, peroxide or oils; look for those that are non-comedogenic. If you have active acne, do not use harsh exfoliation agents that may further injure or irritate the skin, increasing inflammation. Do NOT vigorously rub your skin while washing or drying - instead use a soft circular motion, and pat-dry the skin with a soft cloth or cotton pads. Avoid very hot water that will stimulate oil production. Try these natural, effective, inexpensive and easy to use alternatives to clean, tone and disinfect your skin; and even get rid of the dead skin cells (exfoliate). Cleaning the Skin: The steps are in chronological order. Make-up Removal : Try baby moisturizing oil (on a cotton pad or ball) Natural Cleanser: Use natural, steel cut oats (oats have anti-inflammatory and protective ingredients). Soak 2 tablespoons of natural oats in 2-3 tablespoons of luke warm water for 3-5 minutes. Use the milky liquid as a homemade milk ""cleanser"" and the soften oats as a delicate ""sponge"" all over the face. It is a bit messy but feels great. Remember to rinse thoroughly with luke warm water. Natural Toner/Astringent: Use Chamomile Tea Astringent twice a day all over the face. Chamomile contains wonderful anti-inflammatory properties. Steep 3-4 chamomile tea bags to brew a very strong tea - when cool, use a cotton pad to apply to acne twice a day. Store in your fridge for up to 2 days. Natural Topical Pimple Treatment : Saturate a Q-tip with Witch Hazel, and delicately clean active pimples 2 times a day. Witch hazel helps in reducing irritation and inflammation. Natural Exfoliator: Try this scrumptious Papaya Mask . Papaya is loaded with Vitamin C, A and E, which are excellent for the skin and contain natural enzymes that will ""dissolve"" dead skin cells without the abrasion. Mush fresh ripe papaya (without seeds!) either in a blender or by fork if very ripe. Warm 2 tablespoons of honey for 5-10 sec in the microwave. Add to papaya. Mix well. Put on dry and clean skin (face, neck, even shoulders) and leave on for 10-15 min. Rinse with luke warm water. Pat dry. MOISTURIZING TIPS for acne prone skin COMING TOMORROW!

"['Fats that You and Your Skin can LOVE! 02-12-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Important Information for Preventing Acne and Acne Scars STAY TUNED BELOW FOR RECIPES THAT ARE SURE TO ""WOW"" ON VALENTINE\'S DAY! In our society, a simple 3-letter word ""fat"" grew to become a notorious villain. The fact is, however, that to live a healthy life and to show off a beautiful complexion, we need to recognize the ""good"" from the ""bad"" fats. Eating right with acne prone skin means a diet with no fat, right? WRONG! Eating the RIGHT kinds of fat is essential for optimal health as well as good skin. Most of our diet is full of too much saturated fat and not enough of essential fatty acids (EFAs). The EFAs (oils) promote clear and healthy skin and are also good for the heart. The BEST Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs): Omega 6 and Omega 3 Saturated and mono-unsaturated fats are not necessary in your diet; t he polyunsaturated fats or oils are essential for your health and to maintain youthful, radiant and healthy looking skin. The polyunsaturated oils provide two essential ""good"" fats: Omega 6 (linoleic acid) and Omega 3 (alpha-linoleic acid). You benefit most from them when they are not processed at high temperatures (ex. fried or cooked/baked for a long time), so they don\'t change to trans-fat and liberate free radicals, which can damage skin and local tissues. The Best Food Sources of EFAs The body cannot manufacture EFAs, so they must be supplied by the diet. EFAs are necessary for the proper functioning of all tissues and for tissue repair, especially the skin, since the EFAs hold skin cells together in a watertight seal and retain moisture. Here are some of the best sources of EFA: Salmon and herring Nuts (especially walnuts) Flaxseeds, pumpkin, sunflower and sesame seeds (and their oils too) Safflower, corn, soybean and wheat germ oils Omega 3 is converted by the body into gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) and provides a foundation for the synthesis of prostaglandins. These prostaglandins lower blood pressure, aid water metabolism (hydrate the skin), decrease inflammation (also in the skin), improve nerve and immune function and help to balance blood sugar. Evening primrose oil and borage oil are the best-known sources of GLA, and may be taken as supplements. Adequate EFAs also help to reduce the dehydrating effects of heat, wind and other environmental factors. Delicious Recipes to Maximize Your EFA Intake If you have a deficiency of EFAs, the health of your skin deteriorates, the skin becomes dehydrated, itchy, dry and inflamed and you will be more prone to skin infections. EFAs help wounds to heal more quickly (ex. acne scars) , strengthen capillary walls and prevent enlargement of sebaceous glands that in turn may become over active resulting in a higher chance for acne. EFAs also help to balance hormones and increase blood flow to the skin. Here are some ways to indulge in an EFA Feast! Salmon Kebab 2 10""-inch bamboo or metal skewers 10 oz. piece center-cut wild salmon fillet, skinned 1 medium orange or yellow pepper (use zucchini as a replacement if needed) 1/4 cup dry white wine (or white cooking wine) 2 tbs olive oil 1 tbs chopped fresh dill 1 tsp minced garlic 6 vine-ripened cherry or grape tomatoes For Salad peach or mango salsa red leaf salad walnuts raspberry vinaigrette Preparation Prepare grill or turn on oven broiler. If using bamboo skewers, soak in warm water for 15 minutes. Pat salmon dry and cut into 8 cubes. Cut pepper into 3/4-inch-thick squares (if using zucchini - they will become rounds of course). In a bowl, stir together the wine, oil, dill and garlic. Add the salmon, pepper (or zucchini), and tomatoes; make sure the marinade coats all the ingredients. Leave to sit in room temperature for 15-20 minutes. ""String"" the salmon, pepper and tomatoes onto the skewers. Sprinkle with sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Grill kebabs on an oiled rack or broil under preheated broiler, turning kebabs until salmon is just cooked through but NOT OVER COOKED, around 6 to 8 minutes. Serve with salad, and ENJOY!

Olszewski 0 Comments After a holiday weekend of indulging in carbs, sugars, alcohol and sun exposure, are you worried that zits and flareups will come fast and furiously? Try this healing drink. It will reduce inflammation, provide a healthy dose of antioxidants and help your skin, and body, to regain a healthy balance. Its anti-inflammatory properties are thanks to the enzyme bromelain in fresh pineapple (only fresh or frozen will do - canned pineapple has no enzymes left) and the gingerols in ginger. Extensive research shows that the compounds in ginger may be more potent than many anti-inflammatory drugs. Raspberries are known to be a great source of Vitamin C, and also have a number of antioxidants as well as fiber that absorbs toxins. Ingredients Please use ONLY FRESH or FROZEN ingredients and organic when possible. Cans/powders will NOT do. 1/2 pineapple, outer skin and core removed 1 1-inch piece of ginger ½ cup of raspberries Directions Put all ingredients through a juicer or blend in a high powered blender with a splash of cold water or ice to suit your preference. Add water and ice slowly, and in small amounts, so you get a consistency you like. Garnish with a spring of mint. Serve over ice or as is, and drink immediately. And please remember to use your AcnEase® to keep your summer skin in shape and acne-free!

"['The Best Everyday Skincare Routine for Your Skin Type 04-27-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments All of us are different: different lifestyles and preferences, different personalities, different skin tones and even different skin types. You might have oily skin, dry skin, or a combination of both with or without a sensitivity factor to mix with it. Your skin type might even change with the age, specific body conditions like pregnancy, very intense exercise, menstrual cycle or even the weather! So how do we sort through this skin-type madness in order to care of our skin the right way? For starters, let go of the misconception that only oily-skin people get acne. ANYONE can get acne, and EVERYONE and EVERY SKIN TYPE needs a proper skincare routine. And most importantly--anyone suffering from acne needs to treat it the same way: from the inside, in a safe and natural way . Step 1: Determine your skin type You might have oily skin if: You notice a visible layer of oil on your skin shortly after cleansing. You have to use oil blotting sheets all over your face multiple times a day. If you ""shine"" too much during the course of a day and especially in the morning. You find yourself reaching for powder (or a tissue) to get rid of that shiny look on your skin. You might have dry skin if: You notice visibly flaking skin on your face or body. If your skin feels ""tight"" or "" stretched"" and itchy You have to use a lot of face and body moisturizer just to keep that ""dry look"" away. You find yourself reaching for moisturizer more than twice a day. You panic at the thought of forgetting moisturizer because you know you might end up with scaly patches on your skin. You have sensitive skin, as sensitive skin and dry skin tend to go hand in hand. Sensitive skin tends to be very responsive: Redness, itching, blotchiness, reactions to cosmetics, redness in reaction to salicylic acid or ingredients, and a general feeling of ""discomfort"" are all signs of sensitive skin. You might have combination skin if: You notice visible oil on some parts of your skin and possibly none of them in other places; sometimes you may see dry patches and/or flakiness in other places. You regularly find yourself using blotting sheets on some parts of your face such as the T-ZONE (forehead, nose, chin) and extra moisturizer on the other parts (for example, on your cheeks). You have sensitive skin. Sensitive skin sometimes goes hand in hand with combination skin. As mentioned above, sensitive skin tends to be very responsive: Redness, itching, blotchiness, reactions to cosmetics, redness in reaction to salicylic acid or ingredients, and a general feeling of ""discomfort"" are all signs of sensitive skin. Step 2: Follow the correct everyday skincare routine For oily skin: Clean: Steer clear of harsh ingredients like salicylic acid, alcohol and benzoyl peroxide. Use a mild, noncomedogenic cleanser. Or, try massaging in a few drops of olive oil or coconut oil and wiping away with a cotton ball soaked in warm water and a few drops of lemon juice. For removing makeup prior to cleansing, try massaging in some coconut oil or olive oil and wiping away gently with a damp cotton ball. If you choose, follow up cleansing with a natural, gentle astringent like chamomile tea. Exfoliate: Never exfoliate more than once a week, and always be sure to wear SPF, never exfoliate after sun or wind exposure and never get sun exposure after exfoliating. We recommend exfoliating gently and naturally with natural ingredients based exfoliating masks using foods, such as avocado or papaya, which contain natural enzymes that will ""dissolve"" dead skin cells without any abrasion. Quick Papaya Exfoliating Mask To exfoliation with papaya, mush fresh, ripe papaya and blend with 2 TBS of honey. Leave on skin for 10-15 minutes, rinse well with lukewarm water and pat dry. Moisturize: Look for lightweight, oil-free moisturizers containing ingredients such as water, aloe vera, marine algae, lemon grass extract, willow bark extract and witch hazel. For dry skin: Clean: Choose gentle products free of harsh ingredients like salicylic acid, alcohol and benzoyl peroxide, any chemicals you cannot pronounce or have the word ""acid"" in the name. Use a mild, noncomedogenic cleanser. Or, try massaging in a few drops of olive oil, avocado or coconut oil and wiping away with a cotton ball soaked in luke warm water and a few drops of rose oil or lavender. For removing makeup prior to cleansing, try massaging in some coconut oil or olive oil and wiping away gently with a damp cotton ball. If you choose, follow up cleansing with a natural, gentle chamomile astringent ; you may also try to use fresh cucumber juice. Exfoliate: Do not exfoliate more than twice a month - never after sun or wind exposure; always use at least SPF 30, and a moisturizer after exfoliating. We recommend exfoliating gently and naturally with food type ingredients such as avocado or papaya, which contain natural enzymes that will ""dissolve"" dead skin cells without any abrasion. To exfoliate with papaya, mush fresh, ripe papaya and blend with 2 TBS of honey and 1-2 drops of olive oil. Leave on skin for 10-15 minutes, rinse well with lukewarm water and pat dry. Moisturize: Look for richer, noncomedogenic moisturizers, ones that contain, for example, extracts of olive oil, small amounts of jojoba, almond, apricot, grape seed oil, avocado, rose water and oatmeal. You can even try a bit of organic raw shea butter. Just do NOT over-do it. And remember, if you think you also have sensitive skin, note that the only way to treat it is gently. No hot water, no ice cold water, no scrubbing or heavy oily make-up. Moisturizing Oatmeal Mask To moisturize with oatmeal, mix 2 TBS of dried lavender, 2 TBS of plain yogurt and 2 TBS of oatmeal, finely chopped or ground (not instant or containing sugar). Spread onto face and neck, recline and relax for 20 minutes. Wash gently with lukewarm water and pat dry. For combination skin: Clean: Avoid harsh ingredients like salicylic acid, alcohol and benzoyl peroxide. Use a mild, noncomedogenic cleanser. Or, try massaging in a few drops of olive oil or coconut oil and wiping away with a cotton ball soaked in warm water and a few drops of lemon juice. For removing makeup prior to cleansing, try massaging in some coconut oil or olive oil and wiping away gently with a damp cotton ball. If you choose, follow up cleansing with a natural, gentle chamomile astringent . Exfoliate: Never exfoliate more than once a week, and always be sure to wear SPF, especially after exfoliating. We recommend exfoliating gently and naturally with foods, such as avocado or papaya, which contain natural enzymes that will ""dissolve"" dead skin cells without any abrasion. To exfoliation with papaya, mush fresh, ripe papaya and blend with 2 TBS of honey. Leave on skin for 10-15 minutes, rinse well with lukewarm water and pat dry. Moisturize: Look for simpler, noncomedogenic ingredients (that you can actually pronounce!) in moisturizers. If you have dry and/or flaky patches that you want to moisturize a bit more heavily, try treating those areas with small amounts of noncomedogenic oils, such as a small amount of coconut oil or olive oil or shea butter. If you think you also have sensitive skin, note that the only way to treat it is gently, and also avoid heavier moisturizers.

"[""Speed Up Getting Rid of Acne with Powerful Astringents! 08-19-2012 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Did you know that a natural astringent can be a very powerful tool in your arsenal to fight acne? In addition to your face wash and favorite natural acne treatment, by using a powerful natural astringent, it can eliminate bacteria, and speed up the healing process of existing acne. Drug store astringents can actually do more harm than good...a natural astringent works even better because it doesn’t strip your skin of all its oil, which it needs, in order to be healthy! And, natural astringents are just as effective as chemicals (such as the overused salicylic acid)...but unlike chemicals, they don’t dry, irritate or age your skin or have sun restrictions. I listed a few natural astringents that are safe, easy to use, inexpensive and can be used every day to get clear skin faster (try them all, and go with the one that works best for your skin –they don’t need to be used together daily): Witch Hazel The bark and leaves are astringent; the extract, also referred to as witch hazel, is used medicinally and helps in reducing inflammation and irritations. How to use: Take a well soaked q-tip and dab on pimples, cysts or any other acne symptoms 1-2 times a day. Chamomile Chamomile causes reactions similar to that of drugs with painkiller and anti-inflammatory effects. When applied topically, chamomile can help the inflammation associated with acne. How to use: You can make your own chamomile astringent by taking 3-4 chamomile tea bags (or 2 handfuls of the dry plant) and brewing a very strong tea. When cooled, use on a cotton pad all over your face twice a day. Keep the leftovers in the refrigerator, but use or discard in two days. Azulene This chamomile derivative with anti-inflammatory properties has a long respected history, dating back to the 15th century, and is designed to repair and soothe problem skin. Azulene essential oil can be found in your local natural food store. How to use: Add this essential oil to a bath (10 -15 drops). No need to mix any other essential oil with it. Use warm water and soak for up to 30 minutes. So now that you have some options for powerful herbal astringents, what are you using as a powerful acne treatment? Many of you know by now (since I’m a broken record!) that acne is an external manifestation of an internal problem and the only real way to treat it is from the inside. Think about it.... The primary cause of acne is an overactive sebaceous gland which causes bacteria to develop, leading to inflammation and scarring – a vicious cycle! You need to use products that will then break this cycle, NOT JUST TREAT THE SYMPTOMS, in order to restore balance and good skin health. Acnease ® breaks this cycle! It is one of the only products that has all the essential ingredients needed to help return sebaceous glands to a normal state of not over-producing sebum, and PREVENTacne. It has over a 96% success rate, has no chemicals, is 100% all-botanical (better than natural!), gets to the root of what is causing your acne, treats it for good, is safe, has no side-effects, results can be seen in as little as 7-10 days and none of the ingredients are on the FDA’s unsafe herb list. There is a 60-day Satisfaction Guarantee if you don’t see the results you want. No. Questions. Asked. So what are you waiting for?? Let’s get you started on the path to clear skin! BUY NOW! Don’t know which treatment is right for you? E-mail me and I will be glad to provide you with an answer. Stay Healthy –Be Beautiful, Dr. Agnes PS –Our studies have shown that customers who are already on AcnEase see even better results by using these natural astringents! PSS – Don’t forget that if you wake up tomorrow morning with a few new pesky visitors on your face, try this . Dr. Agnes Olszewski, CEO of Herborium My work in China in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector, and my personal experience while growing up in Europe, inspired me to develop Herborium ® , a novel Botanical Therapeutics ® company, based on a new, innovative healthcare concept that combines science and nature.

"['The Experts All Agree: There\'s No Quick Fix for Acne 08-22-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments There\'s no denying that waiting around for great things to happen is no fun. It would be much more gratifying if we could get the things we want at the moment we want them, but unfortunately that\'s just not how the world works. Treating acne is no different. People are constantly looking for ""a miracle cure"" that can give them clear skin overnight, but eventually they all learn that a product like that doesn\'t exist. Instead, the trick to beating acne once and for all isn\'t in a magic cream or potion -it comes down to having some good old fashioned patience and perseverance. Things to Remember Your acne didn\'t develop overnight, and it won\'t go away that fast either: Think about your earliest experiences with acne. Did you wake up one morning and suddenly find your face covered in a huge breakout? Chances are you didn\'t. It\'s much more likely that things progressed slowly-starting with a stray whitehead here and there and progressing in severity into the breakouts you have in the present. These problems developed over the course of months and years, not days and weeks, and treating them can take just as long. As nice as it would be to have a quick fix for acne, this is a condition that takes patience and persistence to fight. Products that can quickly eliminate the symptoms of acne rarely address its underlying causes: Sure, using hope is a strong sales pitch; so numerous products therefore promise you quick results. There are even topical creams and cleansers out there that can reduce the appearance of blackheads or whiteheads in a matter of days, but after you stop using them or often even while you are still using them, your acne problems flare right back up. In addition they may dry, sensitize and age your skin or even cause other problems. The reason this is so is because products like these only treat the symptoms of acne-not its causes. While most of the action with acne takes place on the surface of the skin, this problem actually begins much more internally. One of the primary, internal causes of acne is an imbalance in your hormones-specifically it\'s an overabundance of androgens in your blood stream. This imbalance can be caused by a number of different things including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, but whatever the mechanism, it can easily lead to acne breakouts. From this point of view, treating acne with topical medications seems like a superficial fix for a deeper problem. Natural acne solutions don\'t work in the same way as quick topical fixes (nor do they carry the same side effects as pharmaceutical products). All-natural solutions to acne, like AcnEase , aren\'t a quick fix. Unlike things like antibiotics, natural cures aren\'t about getting rid of the problem as fast as possible regardless of the side effects. Instead, they effectively work with your body in a way that\'s not harmful. They aim to bring balance without sacrificing any other aspect of overall health. If you find yourself particularly ""out of whack"" this process can take a long time. However, once you begin to see the powerful results of a method like this, all the waiting will be worth it. Tips for Successfully Treating Acne Follow the recommended treatment regimen: Instructions for acne-fighting products are not suggestions-they need to be followed exactly. For example, AcnEase® has very specific roster about what dose and how many times to use it depending on the type of acne you have and for how long you\'ve had it. These regimens are developed based on research and should be followed to get the most out of the treatment. If you skip or deviate from these recommendations, you are likely to find that you won\'t experience the best and fastest healing results. In short, the best results require your active participation. Supplement your primary treatment with secondary ones: Just because you\'re using a product like AcnEase doesn\'t mean you can\'t supplement your treatment with additional (supplemental) acne-fighting methods. Find a healthy skincare routine that works for you, eat right , and protect your skin from sun damage as well. While these won\'t cure your acne on their own, they can help make things easier and more successful. Focus on prevention. By incorporating preventative skincare methods into your life, instead of ""reacting"" to the roller coaster that you\'ve been on for so long, this will help you achieve and sustain the best results. Even though it won\'t always seem like things are getting better, if you\'re patient and consistent with your treatment you WILL begin to see sustainable results. You will break the cycle of acne!

"[""Improve Your AcnEase Results by 150%! 09-12-2012 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments So let's get in to the basics first. AcnEase® is different because not only does it treat symptoms of acne, BUT IN ADDITION IT GETS TO THE ROOT OF THE ACNE CAUSE to make it go away now and in the future - so it PREVENTS acne from coming again! Benefits? Why, yes. There are a few! 100% all-botanical, better than natural, clinically tested No photo sensitivity, no mess, no chemicals, no bleaching or discoloring skin Up to 96% of users see great results For all ages, teen, women, men, and all types and colors of skin 5 Ways for You To See the Best Results with AcnEase® (1) As a First-Time User, Choose From 3 Types of Treatments As a first-time user, you should start with the treatment phase to see the best results. Each treatment requires a specific number of bottles for one-month: mild acne (3 bottles), moderate acne (5 bottles), severe acne, (7 bottles). We recommend a minimum one-month treatment, and to continue with the treatment even if you start to see results in the average 7-10 days. NOTES: The product is the same for each treatment. There are 72 tablets per bottle. Each treatment requires a different daily dose - instructions come with the order. (2) As a Repeat User, You Can Continue with the Treatment Phase or go on the Maintenance Phase After the recommended one-month treatment, some may choose to continue with the treatment phase until they see the desired results. Or, for those who have seen the desired results after one-month, and want to maintain them, they can decide to enter the maintenance phase. NOTES: One bottle (per month) represents a maintenance dose, and is not for a first-timer entering the treatment phase. One-bottle is only for the maintenance phase after you've been through the treatment phase and have seen desired results. (3) Don't Skip a Dose This is not like a cosmetic or topical product, you have to take it regularly. AcnEase is an easy to swallow small tablet, recommended for first-time users to take for one month. At the end of the first month, depending on the severity of your acne and the desired results, you may be done or decide to continue the treatment phase or go on a maintenance dose.For those with moderate to severe acne, you may need to stay on the treatment phase beyond one-month to see the fully desired results. If by the end of the first month, you don't see the desired results, get another one-month round of treatments. And it is completely safe to do so - it's all-botanical! Instructions on exactly how much you should take are included with your order - the ingredients work the best when taken as scheduled. (4) Patience for Results Easier said than done. I know. Think about this though. Would you rather use a product that promises the world in 2 days, and doesn't work? Or would you rather not have to worry about your skin by using a product like AcnEase that prevents and eliminates acne FOR GOOD? (without side effects or chemicals!) (5) Harness Willpower Acne doesn't develop in 1 day; therefore is is unlikely that it will disappear in 1 day. The more serious your acne symptoms, the longer it may take for your skin to improve. But while sticking to the recommended regimen, imagine not having to always worry about your face when you walk out of the house? How nice would that be? Have questions? I'm only an email away, or come chat with me on Facebook or Twitter . You've certainly come to the right place if you really want to achieve clear, healthy skin for a lifetime. Let's Get You Started!

"['Can I Take AcnEase® while on a Prescription Medicine? 04-30-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments We get this question alot, \' Can I safely (and effectively) take AcnEase ® while taking a prescription medicine?\' Whether your other prescription medicine is for acne or something else, we have all the answers you\'ll need (and if you don\'t see your prescription medicine listed below, please reach out to us and we will get you the answers you need). Can I take AcnEase® while on... ...Accutane (Isotretinoin)? Accutane is presently a subject of a class action suit due to the severe side effects and has been taken off the market. Generic forms of Accutane are still on the market and prescribed. If you decide to stay on the generic Accutane (Isotretinoin), know that it carries the same adverse effects as Accutane. In addition, according to American law, you lose your right to be compensated for any damages caused by the drug if you use the generic form of it. There is no counter indication to using AcnEase® and Isotretinoin together; however, we don\'t recommend using them together since we are very concerned about Accutane and generic isotretinoin products adverse effects and do not want to be associated with them. Additionally, we don\'t know if taking them together would make AcnEase® less efficient because of those adverse effects. Ultimately, we do not want our product to be associated in any way with Accutane and Isotretinoin. ...oral antibiotics? The best approach is to complete your antibiotic treatment before you start AcnEase®. There is NO adverse interaction between AcnEase® and antibiotics, but since antibiotics have a number of adverse effects like increasing sun sensitivity, possible GI (stomach and intestines) issues, allergic reactions, and of course with a long-term use, the possibility of developing resistance to them, we do not want to be associated with those side effects. In addition antibiotics are metabolized by the liver and this may reduce the efficacy of AcnEase® if you use antibiotics long term (over 6 months). If you are to use oral antibiotics for a short term (1-2 weeks) or are weaning yourself off them to start AcnEase, you may use the product together for those last two weeks. AcnEase® has NO known side effects or counter indications. If you have to take antibiotics for a longer period of time for reasons other than acne, you may opt to use AcnEase® anyway. Please advise a physician before taking AcnEase® with antibiotics and observe all the precautions and counter indications associated with antibiotics such as sun restrictions and special diet. ...topical antibiotics? You may use both. In time, AcnEase® should provide satisfactory improvement without any additional prescription products. Be aware however that topical antibiotics may cause a host of side effects including highly increased sensitivity to sun, so you must be alerted to that and follow necessary precautions. ...oral contraceptives (OCs)? Yes, you can take AcnEase® while taking birth control pills. AcnEase® does not directly impact circulating hormone levels in the blood and will not affect the hormones from your oral contraceptive (OC). However, if the ONLY reason why you are taking OCs is to control acne, think twice and familiarize yourself with the potential side effects of OCs including blood clots, more severe acne, weight gain, GI issues, tenderness of the breasts, etc. The ingredients in AcnEase® have natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects in addition to reducing sebaceous gland secretions. This combination of effects is responsible for the ability of AcnEase® to prevent new pimples from forming and treating existing acne. ...Spironolactone? Spirinolactone (Aldactone) is administered to women with ""androgen"" induced acne. Spirinolactone has a dual effect: it inhibits the release of testosterone from the adrenal glands and also has an ""anti-androgen"" effect. AcnEase works to reduce sebaceous gland secretions, which in a way is complimentary to the effects of Aldactone, IF prescribing Spironolactone has been deemed medically safe and beneficial. We have had women with androgen-induced acne switch to AcnEase® only to successfully treat their acne, as well as those that have used it in combination with Spironolactone without any adverse side effects resulting from the combination of both. However, Spironolactone has some warnings and side effects you need to look at to make an educated decision onwhich option you are to chose. ...antidepressant medications such as Paxil? Yes, you can use Paxil (paroxetine), which belongs to a class of drugs called SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and AcnEase together. Paxil increases serotonin levels in the brain. It is a psychotropic drug used for depression, mood swings, bi-polar disorder, etc. As AcnEase® will not prevent Paxil and similar medications from working, please note that studies have shown that antidepressants like Paxil may increase the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults. ...drugs used to treat hyperglycemia such as Metformin? There are no contraindications for drugs used to treat hyperglycemia, such as metformin or other oral hypoglycemic agents. The ingredients in AcnEase® will neither impact blood glucose levels nor interfere with any medicines used for diabetes. ...drugs used to treat hypothyroidism such as Synthroid? There is no interaction between AcnEase® and Synthroid or any other thyroid drugs used to treat hypothyroidism. You can take both medicines at the same time. ...blood pressure medication? Yes, you may take any blood pressure controlling medication and AcnEase® together without any interaction. ...cholesterol medication? Yes, you may take these medications with AcnEase® without any interaction. ... inflammatory disease drugs such as Humira and Remicade? The ingredients in AcnEase® will not interfere with these drugs; the only issue you need to consider is whether your GI system will tolerate the ingredients in AcnEase®. By this we mean that there are some people with food allergies that can develop mild diarrhea when taking AcnEase®. The ingredient most often associated with allergies is the dandelion extract.

"[""Why You Need to Know About Bacteria’s Key Role in Acne 11-13-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Acne, and its associated problems, is probably one of the most discussed and misunderstood health concerns. The reason may be because we typically try to identify ONE factor, culprit or villain responsible for our misery and frustration. We want to understand what causes all those blackheads, whiteheads, pimples and painful cysts, and so we place the blame on our diet, puberty, the environment, etc. If we can just pinpoint the exact problem, then we can cure ourselves of our acne, right? Acne is a complex disease and cannot be attributed to only one factor. What is driving the formation of pimples is more complicated than the physical symptoms that appear on the skin. The common denominator in all cases of acne is the over production of sebum by the sebaceous glands, which can lead to clogged pores. As dead skin cells accumulate around these pores, an ideal environment for the growth of bacteria is generated, often resulting in acne symptoms such as pimples, blackheads, etc. The REAL Key Aspects to the Causes of Acne The cause of this over secretion of sebum, an oily substance created in the sebaceous glands, varies considerably from person to person. For instance, for women with overactive adrenal glands, the cause of their acne can be linked to the elevated levels of testosterone (an androgen) found in the bloodstream. Adolescents undergoing a growth spurt have very high hormonal levels, as do menstruating women, and for some, genetic variation is a large contributing factor-if parents had acne it is likely their children will also have acne. There is simply no single component to easily label as the true cause of all acne. AcnEase ® has mild antiseptic benefits, but its method of action is to mediate the impact of hormones on the sebaceous glands WITHOUT changing or affecting those hormones. This is a safety issue! This is also why it is safe to use by both women and men, from pre-teens to any age. A key secondary aspect, outlined below, is the growth of bacteria in clogged pores and the impact this bacterial growth can have on the progression of acne. The Acne Cascade in Steps - Bacteria’s Role Acne can be divided into several stages of development: Step 1: Acne begins to take form when there is an over-secretion of sebum (skin oil) by the sebaceous glands. Under normal circumstances, sebum travels along the hair follicle to the surface of the skin. Step 2: Pores in the skin become clogged with excess sebum and dead skin cells (seen as whiteheads and blackheads). With acne, the normal transport of sebum out of the follicle is impeded, leading to an accumulation of the oily substance. Step 3: Bacteria (P.acnes) grows in these clogged pores. Excess oil, paired with dead skin cells provide an enriched breeding ground for bacteria. Step 4: The body sends white blood cells (inflammatory cells) to kill the bacteria. Designed to fight off infection, the immune system targets the affected area of the skin. Step 5: The formation of pustules and papules with redness surrounding the pimples occurs. This is the physical symptom of the acne condition. Step 6: Inflammation spreads outside the pore to surrounding tissue to form cysts, the most severe form of acne. Formed under the skin, this painful variation of acne is often the most difficult to treat. When considering treatment options, it is important to understand what stage of the acne cascade they impact. For certain products like the systemic antibiotics (tetracycline, minocycline, and doxycycline) along with topical antibiotics, it is clear that they interfere with Step 3, which relates to the growth of bacteria trapped in the pores. Unfortunately the use of systemic antibiotics is also associated with a growing concern of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Although the primary bacteria associated with acne is P.acnes , the use of systemic antibiotics can lead to the growth of other bacteria that can become antibiotic resistant. There are additional broad spectrum antibiotics like erythromycin and clindamycin that are prescribed for acne, again contributing to the development of “super bugs” that mutate and no longer respond to standard antibiotic therapy. As you can see, while clogged pores play a large part in the formation of acne, the condition of acne is not entirely attributed to the amount of bacteria found on the skin. If it were that easy, the solution would always be to simply wash frequently. For anyone who has spent countless hours and dollars trying out the latest in skincare trends, there is no amount of washing alone that will cure anyone of all acne symptoms, especially in more stubborn and severe cases. Given the overall complexity of acne, it is often useful to consider combination therapy to obtain your desired results. Since AcnEase ® is the only product that prevents new pimples from forming, it should be a member of any combination therapy regimen. Use of topical agents which can prevent bacterial growth or unclog pores are valuable in treating existing acne, but do little to prevent new pimples from forming. Conversely, adding topical acne agents to your AcnEase ® regimen can help treat existing acne by unclogging pores or preventing bacterial growth in clogged pores, which can limit inflammation and subsequent skin damage. Some people look to antibiotics for the treatment of acne. If using an antibiotic becomes part of the treatment paradigm, topical agents should be the first priority, as they are less likely to spawn antibiotic resistant bacteria. It is important to recognize that antibiotics ONLY address the infection and inflammation caused by bacteria. They DO NOT remove the cause of acne that is most often due to a hormonal imbalance. So while antibiotics may temporarily help by killing bacteria, when you stop using them the acne will return, as the source of the problem was never addressed. In addition, antibiotics have been known to cause a number of side effects, from stomach and GI issues to antibiotic-resistant “super bugs” such as MERSA. Additionaly, a dermatology team at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City recently published findings in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that showed doctors kept patients on antibiotics for an average of 11 months before deciding they were not effective and switching to Accutane, a stronger acne treatment. Reasons for the long delay included strict controls placed on Accutane due to its risk of causing birth defects, and concerns about other potential side effects such as depression, according to the research. Accutane has been removed from the market due to a class action suit because of its severe side effects. Its generics are still on the market, and have similar side effects. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) has reported that acne patients are starting to show signs of acne related bacteria that are resistant to standard antibiotic therapy. In all instances, the use of antibiotics, whether topical or systemic, intervenes at a stage of existing acne (step 3) and does not prevent the formation of new acne pimples. The only treatment option that prevents acne pimples from forming is to reduce over-secretion of sebum by the sebaceous glands, the first step in the acne cascade. AcnEase ® is unique in that it is the only non-prescription medicine that interferes with the first step in the acne cascade (over-production of sebum) and therefore really is the only OTC agent that prevents acne from forming. While clean, healthy skin is a big step in the right direction, in order to enjoy lasting results, the source of the problem must be addressed from within. We want to hear from you!

"[""How AcnEase® Helps Treat Adult Acne 02-25-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Acne can be a source of trouble for many people throughout their teen years. With hormones fluctuating, causing oil production to kick into overdrive, breakouts can be hard to keep under control. For many, this problem doesn’t simply go away once they reach adulthood, with some experiencing acne for the first time after they’ve outgrown puberty, which is known as “adult-onset acne.” Or, for some, acne can resurface as an adult. Many acne-sufferers feel frusturated, assuming their acne will go away with time, along with other acne myths . With the right information, however, anyone can have the clear skin they deserve, and it doesn’t have to be as labor intensive as you may have been lead to believe. What is Adult Acne? Adult acne, like cystic, inflammatory, or any other type of acne, is usually the result of a hormonal imbalance, and how those hormones interact with the sebaceous glands. These glands, which are responsible for producing sebum, the oily substance that travels through the pores to hydrate and moisturize the skin, can become over active by certain hormones, causing them to create excessive amounts of the oily substance. When combined with dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, bacteria can grow in the pores, possibly leading to breakouts. How Can Women Treat Adult Acne with AcnEase ® ? With as many as 40% of adults experiencing adult acne, the majority of these numbers are made up of women. Some women try the latest topical cleanser or ointment to treat their acne, which can be harsh and drying (not to mention they can’t get to the cause of the acne). Others may reach for hormonal birth control, such as oral contraceptives (OC), to treat their acne, which can come with dangerous side effects such as blood clots. Discontinuing OC’s may even have users noticing an increase in acne symptoms since this disrupts hormone levels. AcnEase ® was created as a stand-alone treatment that is highly effective in targeting the problem at its source without side effects or the use of chemicals. Overall, AcnEase ® has a 96% user success rate. The results are often dramatic even for those with severe forms of acne, like cystic acne . For women with mild to moderate acne , within 1 month of treatment using a regimen of 4 tablets, 3 times/day, they see a dramatic improvement in their skin condition, with a decrease in the formation of pimples. What Can Men Do To Clear Their Skin with AcnEase ® ? Men and women produce the same sex hormones: estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone (an androgen) but at the very different ratios (levels). Fluctuation in any of these hormones, especially the androgens, or male sex hormones, can lead to the development of acne symptoms, which can be harder to treat since testosterone is more prevalent in males and is a strong stimulator of the sebaceous glands. Treatment options for men are limited to antibiotics, or treatments such as Accutane, which is now well known for its dangerous side effects. No amount of washing will impact the effect testosterone has on the sebaceous glands, which makes a systemic treatment such as AcnEase ® a very smart choice if you want to see real results. Since acne is a bit more stubborn in men, depending on the severity of acne, we normally recommend either a moderate acne treatment , severe acne treatment or body acne treatment . You Don’t Grow Out of Acne - AcnEase ® Can Help The fact that acne is not something most people “grow out of” says a lot about the way acne should be looked at when aiming to treat it. Obviously, keeping the surface of the skin clean is an important part of any skincare regimen, the real issue lies with rebalancing the sebaceous gland activity, which is done from within. AcnEase ® specifically inhibits the impact of fluctuating hormone levels on sebaceous gland secretions, and does not affect hormone levels per se, but rather works as a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, thereby modulating the amount of sebum produced. This helps explain why AcnEase ® is equally effective in treating both adolescent and adult acne in both men and women. We want to hear from you! Do you have adult acne? What do you do to combat it?

"['Fact or Fiction: The Effects of the Sun on Your Acne 07-20-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Unfortunately, there is a large amount of disinformation on the web these days about the sun and the effect it can have on breakouts. As some myths promote practices that are unnecessary but relatively harmless, those related to sun exposure can become downright dangerous. Let\'s take a look at some of these acne ""urban legends"" about the sun and discover what the truth actually is. Myth #1-Sweating is good for your skin. It actually cleans out your pores! Interestingly enough, this myth got its start because of something true - the fact that sweating causes our pores to open up. However, just because your pores are opened doesn\'t mean they will magically become unclogged. In fact, sweating can actually make them more clogged than usual. Sweat, especially the type associated with outdoor activities or exercise, allows dirt and other debris to become stuck to your skin. This can then accumulate and block up your pores, allowing acne-causing bacteria to flourish. So, if you play softball with your friends or run the beach, it is good for your health and life but it will not help your acne. If, on the other hand, you take a steam bath or make yourself a controlled facial steam bath, make sure you rinse your skin very well and use cooler water to close the pores (do not rub, just pat your skin dry), which should be followed by using VERY clean towels and non-comedogenic moisturizers. This will actually clean your skin. Myth #2-Getting a tan is good for acne breakouts. Since acne develops as a result of excess skin oil (sebum) blocking your pores, many people believe that getting a tan and being exposed to the sun\'s rays will help dry up that oil and reduce acne breakouts. Aside from the fact that there is currently no scientific evidence to support such a statement, the potential negative side effects from unprotected exposure to the sun far outweigh any unproven benefits for reducing breakouts. In fact, since a tan or sunburn dries your skin out, this may produce more dead skin flakes and cause your skin to produce even more pore-clogging sebum. In addition, overexposure to sun will cause inflammation that you do not need to add to your acne. Finally, the dangers of skin cancer are real, so if you\'re out in the sun, protect yourself with clothing or sunscreen. Finding the right sunscreen for your skin type can take some time, but it\'s well worth the effort to prevent skin cancer and premature skin aging. Myth #3-Acne treatments can help reduce the sun\'s negative effects. Both over the counter acne products (like those containing ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid ) as well as prescriptive drugs (such as antibiotics, retinoids and isotretinoin) carry a serious warning about sun exposure - they actually amplify your skin sensitivity and may cause serious burns and other side effects such as irritation, inflammation, discoloration, etc. Myth #4-Protecting yourself from the sun can cure your acne. Statements like these greatly overestimate the importance of the sun in the cycle of acne breakouts. While it\'s true that the sun can make your acne problems worse, it\'s not a main culprit. Instead, the only way to effectively eliminate breakouts is to target the underlying and internal causes of them-such as your hormonal imbalance. When your hormonal balance is disturbed (which can be caused by everything from puberty to pregnancy) this may cause your sebaceous glands to overproduce sebum. The excess sebum begins to clog your pores, which leads to the growth of acne-causing bacteria, and the breakout cycle begins. AcnEase is a safe and natural product that can help reduce the effect of hormonal imbalances on your sebaceous glands without actually affecting your hormones and was designed to help you stop your persistent acne. Being smart about your exposure to the sun can help reduce the outward symptoms of acne, but until you\'re doing something about its hormonal causes, then you can expect breakouts to continue in the future.

"['Can Vitamins Help Treat Acne? 07-17-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments The Impact of Vitamins on Skin Health You know the saying beauty starts from with in ? This is not just a reference on morals but a very practical observation about the health of your skin. What we put in our bodies effects how we look, and there are a number of essential vitamins that do wonders for the skin. HOWEVER, they do not TREAT acne. Certain vitamins and minerals may be a great adjunct to treating acne, and help your skin to be healthy and glowing. Acne is a manifestation of an internal imbalance that leads to the overproduction of sebum (skin oil) by the sebaceous glands. This extra sebum together with dirt creates an ideal condition for bacteria, which results in inflammation that presents itself as acne (pimples, cysts etc). The only treatment for acne is to reprogram your sebaceous glands to stop working overtime, which will result in actually PREVENTING new acne from coming. Anything less - topical products and antibiotics - focus on symptoms of acne and address the inflammation rather than the real root cause of acne. To treat acne , you need to rebalance the body and ""reprogram"" the sebaceous glands to produce a ""normal"" amount of sebum. With that said, there are some ""helpers"" that can assist in winning the acne battle. Powerful Vitamin Skin Helpers Vitamin E Vitamin E is the most powerful bioactive antioxidant among all vitamins. It can immediately catch and remove any free radicals that come near your cells - it really is the best antioxidant you can wish for. Since Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, it lasts longer in your body doing much good. It even outlasts Vitamin C, which is also a great skin vitamin. Since Vitamin E increases skin health, it will also help collagen production and therefore may help reducing the appearance of acne scars and marks, stretch marks or age spots. In addition to taking Vitamin E into your body orally, you can also use it topically. Vitamin C Vitamin C is a strong antioxidant that helps to keep your skin cells safer while you are exposed to sun UV rays, pollution and other damaging environmental and stress factors. Adequate intake of Vitamin C can effectively deter the aging process, prevent skin discoloration and brighten your skin tone. Vitamin A If your skin has been feeling scaly and dry, then there\'s a possibility that you might be Vitamin A deficient. Individuals who are suffering from acne are also encouraged to take plenty of Vitamin A or apply products that are derivatives of the vitamin. Since Vitamin A also helps the skin rebuild itself, it is also an essential vitamin when it comes to healing wounds and other damages to the skin. So if you wish to get some help with acne scars and lines, wrinkles, dull skin and other skin aging symptoms, Vitamin A may be a good addition to your daily health routine. Vitamin B6 Vitamin B6 helps your skin by reducing the amount of homocysteines in your blood. Homocysteines affect both your circulation system and endocrine system. Elevated levels of this compound cause cholesterol to form plaque, which impairs your blood flow. High homocysteines levels also trigger stress response, which can cause acne breakouts and hives. Vitamin B6 will also help oxygenate your skin, which in turn will speed up healing of inflammation and will add a healthy glow to your complexion. Folate Folate has the same stress reducing function as vitamin B6, and can also promote better oxygenation for your cells. Folate heightens your red blood cell production too. Higher concentration of red blood cells means more oxygen can be delivered to your skin and other tissue. Abundance of oxygen encourages faster skin regeneration. Eating a variety of dark leafy vegetables, beans and legumes, citrus fruits and fortified cereals is the easiest way to get the Foliate you need for a look of rejuvenation. Pantothenic Acid Pantothenic acid is crucial in helping to prevent acne, dermatitis and skin allergies. This vitamin helps your body break down fat and prevents surplus oil secretion from your sebaceous glands. Increased intake of pantothenic acid can reduce your pore size and improve your skin tone, making it a common ingredient in many skin care products. As helpful as this vitamin is for your skin, it will NOT work on its own - so add it to the acne treatment that works on causes of acne and you get yourself a winning combination. How to Include these Vitamins in to Your Daily Diet The ideal way to get all the vitamins you need is in food. There is NO question about it. All of these vitamins mentioned can be part of your daily diet. So the more color you put on your plate, the better. If you cannot guarantee that your diet contains a sufficient amount of ""skin helpers,"" reaching out for supplements may be needed. Just make sure you read the labels before you buy. With a number of brands and products on the market, you may need to put some effort into choosing the one that is best for you. Try to look for natural, well established sources. And also note too that the more milligrams per day is NOT automatically better. Review the recommended daily dose of a particular vitamin recommended for your age, gender and health status. Vitamin Food Sources Vitamin E Vitamin E is most present in the following foods: asparagus, avocados, nuts and seeds, eggs and dairy products Vitamin C Having 3 to 5 servings of fresh fruits like oranges, strawberries and grapes everyday is the best way to keep you full of Vitamin C. Vitamin A You get a healthy supply of Vitamin A by eating eggs, leafy greens, carrots, pumpkins, liver and drinking milk (fat free or 1%-2% is perfectly fine). Vitamin B6 You will find Vitamin B6 in meats, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Folate Dark leafy vegetables like kale, mustard greens, broccoli rabe, as well as beans and legumes and citrus fruits supply a healthy amount of folate. Pantothenic acid The best dietary sources for pantothenic acid include fish rich in Omega-3, red meat, wheat bran and yeast. You can also get an extra boost of pantothenic acid by taking a royal jelly supplement. Patience is a Virtue We are living in a culture that demands instant gratification. Unfortunately, if you expect an overnight miracle in treating acne, or in seeing instant results by using vitamins, you will be disappointed. Treating acne takes time and perseverance since in addition to these acne supporters, you need to use a treatment that actually helps your sebaceous glands to come back to normal activities. Vitamins, and any other support factors like diet , exercise, stress control and some topical agents have a cumulative effect so they need time to show their ""good side"" - b ut with this patience and perseverance comes results.

"['Is Your Prescription Treatment for Acne Really Safe? 02-27-2014 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When we find ourselves suddenly experiencing acne breakouts, or when we suffer a long battle with acne and nothing seems to help, we may try anything that our doctor will prescribe. What we often forget about is to consider both short-term and long-term health consequences of treatments. Many products used for acne treatment are systemic (taken orally), and obviously they will affect not only our skin but our entire system. So, to be on the safe side, you really need to educate yourself before putting anything in to your body. Learn more about your prescription acne treatment and whether or not it\'s safe for you to keep using, and keep your eye out for part 2 of this hot topic, which will help you decide whether your over-the-counter acne treatment is safe. Retinoids and Retinoid Derivatives, including Accutane (isotretinoin) and its generics Why We Use Them: Retinoids and derivatives of retinoids are systemic or topical products thought to directly affect the over-secretion of the sebaceous glands, which is considered the primary cause of acne. These products are prescribed in abundance to individuals who seek help from a dermatologist in treating their acne. Systemic use of retinoids (Accutane & and its generics) is mostly recommended for severe acne. Common Products: Accutane (Lsotretinoin) helps to decrease sebaceous gland secretions systemically. It usually takes up to 6 months to see the difference and patients are asked to sign a legal release because of severe health risks associated with those products. Retin-A (tretinoin) cream is often prescribed for severe and persistent cases of acne, and it also has to be used for at least 8-12 weeks. Differin (Adapalene) is a retinoid-based topical medication with a recommended treatment phase of 8 to 12 weeks. Exacerbation of the existing skin condition is frequently observed with Differin prior to improvement. Be Aware: Retinoid derivatives have a multitude of side effects, such as dry, red, over-sensitized skin, and all require serious sun restrictions. Accutane is presently the subject of a class action suit due to its severe health hazards and has been taken off the market. Accutane and its generic formulas still available on the market are known potent teratogens (cause birth defects) and are strictly contraindicated in women not practicing a proven method of birth control. Accutane has been reported to cause severe depression, especially in young men. These products do not prevent new acne from forming. Prescription Antibiotics Why We Use Them: Antibiotics are topical or oral products that non-specifically kill part of bacteria associated with acne. Even though these products are prescribed in abundance to individuals who seek help from dermatologists, internists and general practitioners, for all stages of acne, many representatives of the medical profession are now having second thoughts about liberal use of antibiotics in general as it leads to development of new strands of bacteria that are antibiotic-resistant. Common Products: Systemic antibiotics include tetracyclines, minocyclines and doxycyclines. For non-inflammatory acne, anti-microbial cream Azelex or Azelaic acid is often prescribed. It requires at least 4 weeks of treatment. Topical antibiotics such as Cleocin T (clindamycin solution) or erythromycin are often combined with benzoyl peroxide. Be Aware: Antibiotics do not really treat causes of acne, and when you stop taking them, their impact on bacteria stops as well. There are strong warnings against use of systemic antibiotics by young teens and pregnant or soon-to-be pregnant and lactating women. Antibiotics may cause severe GI problems and allergic reactions. They require serious sun restrictions as they may cause burns and are considered unsafe for pregnant and soon-to-be pregnant or lactating women Since these products do not address the cause of acne but rather the bacteria trapped in the excess sebum, the do not prevent new acne from forming once they are stopped. Oral antibiotics in particular are not specific for acne, which means they may kill bacteria that your body actually needs in order to stay healthy. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics is being strongly discouraged in the medical field due to the increasing appearance of bacterial resistance. Oral Contraceptives (OCs) (For Women Only) Why We Use Them: OCs are often prescribed to control acne breakouts as ""off-label"" usage, which means most of them have not even been approved for this use. Common Products: Diane-35 is a hormonal drug (cyproterone-ethinyl estradiol) that was used to treat hormonal acne, especially acne resulting from too many androgens (male hormones). It is also an oral contraceptive (birth control pill) with low estrogen levels. Diane-35 is not approved in the US, but it is available in Canada, and like many other drugs, unfortunately finds its way to US consumers through so-called ""gray marketing."" Ortho Tri-Cyclen is a combination of estrogen and progestin, which is a synthetic form of progesterone. YAZ contains a combination of estrogen and a form of progestin called drospirenone and is now the subject of class action suit. Be Aware: Currently, the FDA is concerned about the side effects of 10 brands of birth control pills sold in the US, and 4 of the pills that are on their list are the subject of a class action suit (Yaz®, Yasmin®, Beyaz®, Ocella®). The FDA has "" black-boxed"" them, which means it forbids any public promotion of those products. Diane-35 is presently being investigated for a number of deaths, possibly caused by blood clots, and for non-fatal cases of thrombosis and arterial thrombosis. Please note the FDA warnings on many oral contraceptives and consider why the FDA has stopped any advertising of these products to the public. Read the reports on the OC Diane-35 that originated in Europe, Australia, and Canada. The pill is strongly not recommended to be used by younger teens or non-sexually active adults due to the long-term effects on hormonal balance and health of the reproductive system. To learn more about the risk of OCs for controlling acne breakouts, check out this article . *** Because of the list of side effects of so many of these treatments, many people come to us because they want a safe, clinically validated, natural treatment that actually works.

"[""The #1 Thing that Is Making Your Acne Worse this Summer 07-28-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments For years, people believed that a good, healthy dose of sun was the answer to their acne-related problems. Doctors in the 1950’s even prescribed sessions under a sun lamp to treat patients looking to rid their complexions of acne, and the idea has more or less stuck, with some looking to more and more DIY options to help symptoms of acne . Many dermatologists are pleading with people to resist the urge to go about treating their skin the old fashioned way with a lengthy sunbath by the pool. The claim nowadays is that the sun’s rays can actually end up making acne worse...but why? To get an idea of exactly what the sun is doing to your skin to make acne worse, check out this quick and easy guide below! Those rays will end up leaving you oilier than ever! People with acne seem to love tanning because many of them notice their pimples drying up after a day or two in the sun. What they don’t realize is that this temporary relief from an irritating blemish is actually triggering even bigger problems to get underway, problems which can actually lead to more acne! That oil your may feel on your skin, especially in the t-zone, nose or chin area, is called sebum, which is produced by the sebaceous glands. Sebum’s function is to hydrate the skin. When the skin becomes too dry, these glands become triggered to produce more sebum to replace the oil that was just removed. Too much sebum can become clogged inside the pores along with dirt and debris to form bacteria, which leads to acne symptoms such as blackheads and pimples. Not only does this counterproductive method of treating acne potentially lead to more acne, it also diminishes moisture from the outer layer of skin, which makes it hard to keep the body hydrated on those hot days, and may lead to early onset lines and wrinkles, in addition to acne. It discourages inflammation, but doesn’t actually work to solve the problem. The decrease in the redness of acne people experience after prolonged exposure to sun rays seems like a quick-fix solution for a spotty complexion, but that’s only part of the picture when it comes to how UV rays are affecting your condition. The reason the redness appears to go away is because the sun actually decreases an inflammatory response produced by the body. The whitehead of a pimple is actually white blood cells sent to “fight” the bacteria formed within a pore clogged with too much sebum, dirt and debris, so when the inflammatory response isn’t triggered, a puss-filled blemish doesn’t form. Seems like the perfect solution to acne, right? Not quite. When you decrease this immune reaction, the entire immune system can eventually become compromised, making it hard to fight off infection down the road. Additionally, this temporary oil zap isn’t actually treating the problem at all! In order to achieve long-term relief, the problem must be addressed at its source - the sebaceous glands, and a systemic treatment like AcnEase does that for its users everyday, regardless of how much sun hits your skin! Sun rays can make existing acne scars even darker. The main reason many people feel that their acne improves after a long day in the sun is because the skin becomes darker, making existing acne and acne scarring less visible. Unfortunately, this cover-up solution is just an illusion. Not only will that acne still be there once the color starts to fade, but the scars left behind can be made even worse through hyperpigmentation. Sun rays can increase the risk of leaving permanent acne scars no matter what your skin type, tone or shade, so in order to prevent an even bigger problem to deal with down the road, be sure to wear sunscreen at all times, even on the cloudy days, and do your best to avoid exposure during the sun’s peak hours, usually between 10am-4pm. If you happen to live in a part of the world that the clouds rarely cover, or just can’t seem to resist soaking up some sun rays, you can take some good preventative measures to assure you that your acne won’t be made worse by those UV rays. You always want to give your skin a nice coat of sunscreen, and cover up as much as possible - that will work wonders on the surface of your skin. Additionally, to stay proactive from within, and to experience long-term results, an all-natural, herbal solution like AcnEase can work to produce real results you can live with, even in the hot and sweltering summer heat!

"['Discover the Truth Behind Food’s Connection to Acne 07-07-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments As there are many ""fake"" diets and myths about how to stay slim and trim, the same applies to the relationship between food and acne. These days, food is not just a source of nutrition but also a source of comfort, a means to socialize, a status symbol, and the subject of vigorous and lengthy discussions, and we would like to add our own two cents to this subject from an acne standpoint. If you’re looking for ways to improve your odds in the battle against acne, making some dietary changes might be the answer you need. We’ll examine the connection between food and breakouts, what you should consider eliminating from your diet, and what foods should be more abundant in your diet. Link Between Acne and Diet In your search to get rid of your acne, you may have come across some articles written by those who promote the belief that poor food choices are a direct cause of acne and proclaim that everything from a chocolate bar to a slice of pizza or a glass of milk is guaranteed to start a breakout. While there is a connection between your diet and your skin’s health, things are more complicated than simply singling out specific foods . There is evidence to indicate that the things you eat have an impact on your skin. However, food can only make your acne better or worse – it is NOT a cause of acne or a treatment for it . The actual cause of acne runs deeper than dietary concerns. At the most basic level, breakouts result from an internal imbalance most often caused by a hormonal imbalance. Until you begin treating your acne internally, it’s almost guaranteed that your difficulties with poor skin health will continue. How Does Food Make Your Skin Suffer? The skin is the largest organ of the body and the old adage ""you are what you eat"" applies in a multitude of ways. If you consistently eat foods that are ""bad for your skin"" – your skin will become unruly. Sugar - Too much refined sugar will speed up the process of glycation. During glycation, the sugar in your bloodstream attaches to proteins and forms harmful new molecules called Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) which damage the proteins in your tissue, including your skin. This speeds up the aging process, the formation of wrinkles and may also increase acne breakouts, as “older” skin is dryer skin and additional dry or dead skin cells will clog the pores. The solution is to replace sugar with fresh fruits and small amounts of organic honey or raw coconut nectar or agave syrup, if necessary. Unfortunately, if clear skin is important to you, seriously consider eliminating all cakes, muffins, white bread, processed food, and sugary summer cocktails (sadly that includes margaritas). Dairy - Dairy products may also have a negative impact on your skin. However, this is not because of the dairy itself, but due to the hormones frequently added to products such as these . As mentioned earlier, acne is strongly associated with a hormonal imbalance, and when these additional hormones are supplied to your body, especially for a longer period of time, it may negatively affect your body’s natural balance and exacerbate acne. Dairy is an essential part of a healthy diet and contains many essential nutrients that are beneficial for your skin. The best way to ensure that it does minimal damage to your skin is to select products that are organic and from cows not treated with rBST/rBGH. These are synthetic hormones that are genetically engineered using e. Coli bacteria and are injected into the cow to increase their milk production in the short term. By choosing products free of these chemicals, you will still reap the benefits of dairy without having to worry about the hormonal effects. If you think that dairy could be having an effect on your skin, try making modifications to your intake instead of eliminating dairy entirely. Acne-Friendly Foods When it comes to acne-friendly foods, the best choices are fresh, organic fruits and leafy vegetables. These are loaded with antioxidants – which are powerful compounds that are able to fight free radicals and help reverse the signs of illness and aging. For example, vitamin A and E, which are found in foods such as avocado, spinach, broccoli, kale and papaya, can help reduce both the size and severity of your acne scars. Additionally, you may want to consider incorporating foods that contain probiotics, which are microorganisms that help promote the growth of good bacteria throughout your digestive tract. Studies have shown that these organisms can help reduce inflammation throughout the body , including the skin. While inflammation is not a direct cause of acne, it does make you more vulnerable to new breakouts. Probiotics can be found naturally in fermented foods such as live-cultured yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso soup, tempeh and kimchi. Eggs contain lutein and choline, which are both beneficial to radiant skin. Lutein is another antioxidant with many benefits and choline is a B vitamin, which is found in the fatty portion of cell membranes and is vital to healthy skin-cell functioning. Foods high in Omega 3 fatty acids play an important role in cell membrane health. The cell membrane is a barrier to harmful substances and also serves as a passageway for nutrients and waste products to travel in and out of the cell. Flaxseed oil, salmon, fish oil, chia seeds and walnuts are highest in Omega 3s. Water Water is the most important thing you can consume for the health of your skin. Use distilled or spring water as any impurities will affect your body. One way to increase your intake of water is a fashionable ""infusion"". Here is the recipe for a refreshing and skin friendly concoction. Mint, Lemon & Raspberry Infusion Ingredients: Make sure all ingredients are washed, and are preferably organic 1 cup packed mint leaves 1 lemon, sliced into thin slices 10 raspberries (or 10 strawberries if you prefer) 1/2 gallon distilled or spring water Pack all ingredients in an infusion or regular pitcher and pour the cold water into the pitcher. Keep in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before drinking. Store the remaining infusion in the refrigerator and replace the consumed water with fresh water. Continue to use the herbs and lemon. How to Make Dietary Changes When it comes to making dietary changes to help treat acne or any other goal, preparation is fundamental to success. It is important to be patient, even if you make radical changes and adjustments. Most ""crash diets"" fail because people abandon them quickly and the same will apply to radical changes to your diet. If you deny yourself something that you are intensely craving, it may be wise to treat yourself with a small portion of that craving to fulfill your desire. Otherwise, your temptation might win out in the end and you might neglect your changes altogether. Your best bet is to make gradual changes to one specific area of your diet and gauge your success. Remember, there are no miracles. Your body needs time to get rid of bad compounds and change how it responds to good ones. Also remember that people are unique in many ways, so what works for someone else may not be as effective for you. Does Preparation Count? YES. How food is prepared and what ingredients and condiments are used is an important part of the scenario. Fried and greasy food or heavy cream sauces are harmful to your skin. Salt and heavy spices may exasperate your acne breakouts by causing inflammatory reactions and water retention. Fresh herbs and organic olive oil will add flavor and antioxidants. Also, remember that fresh ingredients are better than cooked ingredients. If you need to cook your vegetables, do so quickly so that the important nutrients don’t leach out into the liquid you use to boil. We hope you find these tips helpful in your fight against acne. As always, one of the most effective ways to combat acne is to treat it from the inside out. Our products are designed to treat your acne from the inside-out, similar to the notion of healing your skin problems with food. It’ a challenge to deal with acne and here at AcnEase ®, we want to help, offer advice and be part of the solution. Please let us know your comments in the section below.

"[""How to Treat Acne in a World Full of Teen Acne Products 02-28-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Many people associate acne with the teen years, and the constant hormonal changes associated with puberty. Most topical acne treatments, such as facial washes, lotions, and spot treatments, are advertised to appeal to teens, and the products are formulated to treat the type of acne that affects teens the most. However, the average age of those with acne is actually 26! With the teen market front and center, how can you keep a clear complexion in your adult years? For some, acne is limited to the adolescent time of one’s life, but many are surprised to see that they haven’t simply “grown out of” the problem. Some even experience acne symptoms for the first time after they’ve reached adulthood. It’s important to understand what makes adult acne different from teen acne in order to appropriately treat your skincare issue. (*Note to AcnEase® users: Normally those with adult acne are either on our moderate acne treatment or severe acne treatment . Please feel free to consult with us if you think you may not be on the right regimen.) Why do I have acne now? All acne is caused by a hormonal imbalance. These hormones impact the sebaceous glands, which create sebum, the oily substance that hydrates and moisturizes the skin. Too much sebum can combine with dead skin, dirt and debris to clog pores, leading to acne breakouts on the surface of the skin. For teens, the hormonal changes triggered during puberty can cause the sebaceous glands to go a little overboard, which typically results in an oily complexion, especially in the t-zone (forehead, nose and chin.). And in many cases, this hormonal imbalance can affect those sebaceous glands well into adulthood. And for some, you may not have even had acne as a teen but got it as an adult. The medical community is still unclear as to the exact contributing factors, but believe that the following can cause this imbalance which leads to acne in adults: lifestyle, genetics, diet, stress, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, excessive stress or exercise, fitness stimulants, perimenopause, menopause or use of certain medications. The effects happen internally over time, much earlier (and more subtle) than you may think. What can I do to treat my adult acne? You don't have to feel hopeless at this point. Long lasting clear skin can be achieved with the right tools. Most topical acne products are formulated to zap excess oil that tends to collect on the surface of the skin, leaving the source of the problem untreated. Most people with adult acne have combination skin, rather than exclusively oily skin, and the chemicals used to give teens a squeaky clean complexion are often too harsh for adult complexions and result in dryness, flakiness, and an increase in sebum production, all of which can lead to more acne. So here are some important points to walk away with as you begin to adjust your skincare regimen. Cleansing. Making sure not to overdry your skin, limit washing your face to morning and night, using clean hands and lukewarm water. Look for a gentle non-comedogenic cleanser that won’t strip the skin of moisture. Those with mild acne might even be able to skip the acne-formulated wash every other day or two, replacing it with a less abrasive exfoliant that won’t dry you out, such as glycolic acid. Again, the idea here is not to dry out your skin with over-drying products (which can also lead to aging of the skin) - this creates more flaky skin and debris that will get into those pores, creating more breakouts. Moisturizing. Because adult skin tends to run on the drier side, staying hydrated and moisturized will ensure that your skin is properly soothed from the inside, out. Depending on the severity of your acne, you may not need to use a medicated moisturizer every single night, instead alternating with a non-comedogenic formula to properly hydrate the skin and pores. As with any self-care practice, always be sure to drink plenty of water, and get those fruits and veggies in to ensure a healthy glow. Spot treatments. Many over-the-counter spot treatments rely on super-strong acne fighting chemicals such as benzoyl peroxide to banish blemishes, which can be really hard on adult skin. A clay or sulphur based formula may be much less harsh and even healthier for the skin. Please keep in mind however, these products are designed to help with symptoms, not break the cycle! Because acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, the only real way to treat the problem is to target it at its source. This is why our AcnEase® users love our product because it does just that – it breaks this endless cycle and achieves sustained results all while using botanical ingredients without the drying and irritating side-effects that antibiotics and external ointments (often containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid) can contain. If you are experiencing a “return” of an acne problem from your teen years, you may be tempted to treat it the same way as you did in your teen years, and for good reason. But as you can see, understanding the skin you're in, and how it changes over time, is an important part of choosing the right skincare regimen, in order to effectively treat the problem without worsening symptoms.

"[""Top 5 Causes of Adult Acne and How to Control It 02-22-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When you’re still battling acne into your adult years, you’ve probably asked yourself this question many times - WHY?! Because so many tend to view acne as a teen problem , the issues surrounding adult acne aren’t commonly explained as well and addressed. This can be both frustrating and actually jeopardize your efforts to regain clear skin. To choose an effective and efficient treatment for adult acne, it’s important to understand what causes the condition before you can begin searching for a solution. Reason being that acne is an internal issue that manifests itself externally. To help you with this process, we’ve compiled a list of the top five causes of adult acne and included steps that you can take to make sure acne doesn’t become a permanent problem that plagues you, and your skin! Hormone Imbalance. Whatever the type of acne that ails you, be it in adolescence or adulthood, the fluctuation of hormones is almost always the culprit. Female sex hormones can play their part in the formation of acne, yet these are androgens, male sex hormones such as testosterone, that do the most damage. These hormones can affect the sebaceous glands, and push them to over produce sebum, the oily substance needed (in normal quantities) to hydrate and moisturize the skin. Free testosterone in the blood is metabolized to dihydrotestosterone, which causes the sebaceous glands to enlarge and increase sebum production. Normally, about 2% of androgens freely circulate in the blood. When this amount increases, other organs are affected, including our skin. When sebum is produced in excessive amounts, pores can become clogged, which can lead to acne. In acne sufferers, the sebaceous glands over-respond to androgens, sometimes well into adulthood. Androgens can also contribute to acne flare-ups in women, and are commonly associated with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, post-pregnancy and when you stop using oral contraceptives. Because this is the first step in the acne cascade, it is important to address the problem here, at its source, if you want to achieve lasting, acne-free results. (*A note to AcnEase® users-your treatment is already working as a buffer between hormones and sebaceous glands to ensure only the necessary amount of sebum is produced. So rest assured, it does not directly affect your hormones.) While looking for a solution to hormonal acne, steer clear of any products that directly affect hormones. This should ONLY be done under the careful supervision of your doctor and can cause serious damage to your body if not monitored properly. Please be sure that you are educated about all possible side effects. Genetics. Unfortunately for some, acne is a result of genetics, inherited from a parent or grandparent. In this case, it is especially important to treat your problem from within and as early as possible, as no amount of washing will undo a generation of acne-prone genes. If you notice that acne runs in your family, try looking into what exactly causes or triggers theirs. It is important to recognize that oily skin, blackheads and whiteheads are an early stage of acne and the treatment and prevention for those with genetic acne predisposition should start at this phase. Regardless of the reason, there is sure to be an AcneEase® solution for any skin type . Stress. Adulthood comes with its fair share of stressors in all areas of our lives, and this stress can show up on your skin if you don’t keep it in check. Stress can actually elevate the level of specific hormones, including adrenaline and noradrenaline. Working along the pathway of testosterone, these hormones can result in an overproduction of sebum, which can lead to acne. Getting a good night’s sleep, and taking a few moments to alleviate some of the stress of the day by exercise, walking or even reading a good book, can go a long way in terms of how it affects the skin you’re in. Even if you don’t have the time or space to devote to an all-out meditation practice, taking a few mindful breaths can make a big difference, both in your day, and your skin. Clogged pores. Whether you realize it or not, bacteria plays a key role in acne . The bacteria that are present in your pores love when excess sebum meets with dead skin, dirt or debris, and the body naturally treats this bacteria as an infection (inflammation), sending in white blood cells to fight off the disease. Unfortunately for us, this inflammation appears on the surface of the skin as pustules, papules or cysts, otherwise more advanced forms of acne. Treatment for this condition should be addressed as a one-two punch, combining a systemic solution to combat the overproduction of sebum, with a topical cleanser or cream to keep skin clean and pores unclogged and as bacteria free as possible. (P.S. - AcnEase® does just that, working from within to eliminate existing breakouts while preventing new ones from forming). A gentle cleanser with a low-dose of acne-fighting ingredients such as witch hazel or small amounts of olive oil or sulphur can work to lightly exfoliate the surface of the skin, keeping it clean and germ-free. A DIY acne exfoliator papaya mask can also help eliminate dry skin, and a non-comedogenic moisturizer will keep the skin supple and less flaky. Over-dry skin. Most topical acne products are marketed toward a teen audience, and as an adult, if you see that it works for teens, then why wouldn't you try it, right? Wrong move! Many of these products are formulated to address oily skin symptoms in an aggressive and short-term manner and the chemicals used in these items can be harsh and drying on the skin, especially on mature adult skin. When skin becomes dry and flaky, these dead skin cells can begin to clog pores from the surface. Paired with extra sebum, these two factors can meet within the pores where bacteria can form, leading to an inflammatory response, otherwise known as acne. In order to prevent flaky skin, hydration and moisturizing from both within and on the surface of the skin are essential. An acne-friendly diet can be essential in your journey, so always make sure to get enough water, eat fruit and veggies to get your glow on from the inside-out, and use a non-comedogenic, oil-free moisturizer to apply to clean skin morning and night.

"[""Why Combination Therapy is the Best Way to Attack Acne 01-18-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Although the clinical manifestation of acne is quite simple and is seen as pimples on the surface of the skin, acne is actually a complex disease. What drives the formation of pimples is complicated and can be attributed to a number of things. For instance, women with over-productive adrenal glands can experience elevated levels of testosterone, an androgen, in their blood, which causes their acne. For some, a large growth spurt with very high levels of fluctuating hormones during adolescence may cause their acne and for others it is linked to their menstrual cycle. For men, it may be a result of high testosterone, but increased levels of estrogen and other hormones may also be the culprit. Genetic variation is also a contributing factor, and if one’s parents had acne it is likely that their children may also. Finally, even lifestyle habits such as diet or skincare, may not directly cause acne but can exacerbate the existing condition. The Stages of Acne – How this effects your treatment For all of the above scenarios, the common denominator is the overproduction of sebum by the sebaceous glands. This can lead to clogged pores where dead skin cells accumulate, providing an ideal environment for the growth of bacteria. The formation of acne can be divided into several stages of development and this progression is called the “acne cascade.” The cascade begins with the over-secretion of sebum (skin oil) by the sebaceous glands, which manifests itself in oily skin, and oily hair as well. This is the first stage of acne. If you want to prevent more serious breakouts, it’s important to start your acne treatment at this early stage. Pores in the skin become clogged with excess sebum and dead skin cells, which appear as whiteheads and blackheads. This is already acne in progress and the clock is ticking to begin treatment. An additional problem at this stage is the dangerous myth that by squeezing out blackheads and whiteheads you get rid of the problem. Please be aware that although occasional professional extraction may be done, it is not always successful. Popping the whiteheads and blackheads, whether professionally or by yourself, may lead to infection and skin damage which may result in scars, marks, and even more prominent pimples and cysts. Bacteria (P.acnes) begin to grow in the clogged pores. This stage may be sometimes broken or at least made less aggressive by the use of topical or systemic antibiotics. As the overuse and potential future side effects of the systemic antibiotics are relatively well known, sporadic and short term use of topical antibiotics may actually have some benefits here The body sends in white blood cells (inflammatory cells) to kill the bacteria. Please note that at this time the cascade is in a full swing and those pimples will come to the surface no matter what you do. The only course of action at this point is to try to make the symptoms a little milder and PREVENT new acne from forming, which is what AcnEase ® does. The formation of pustules and papules with redness surrounding the pimples appear on the skin’s surface. Inflammation spreads outside the pore to surrounding tissue to form cysts, the most severe form of acne. What Really Works on Each Stage of Acne When considering treatment options, it is important to understand which stage of the acne cascade will be impacted. Certain products such as systemic antibiotics (tetracycline and minocycline) or topical antibiotics will interfere with Step 3, which is the growth of bacteria trapped in the pores. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) also provides antibacterial action; therefore it also affects Step 3 in the acne cascade. BP should be used with caution. According to a recent FDA warning, there have been concerns surrounding the potential connection between BP, sun exposure and skin cancer. BP can also cause serious irritation if used too often, and if used on sensitive skin. Retinoic acid based products such as adapalene may help unclog pores, and salicylic acid can reduce the number of dead skin cells in the pores, therefore both products tend to target Step 2 in the acne cascade. These topical products are considered more effective for treating comedones (whiteheads and blackheads.) Unfortunately, both of these have been linked with irritation as well, including possible allergic reactions, aging of the skin, and other dermatological side effects such as skin discolorations or damage. These chemical treatments are NOT recommended for teens due to the possibility of severe side effects, affecting the functioning of the liver and/or the nervous system. These agents may seriously discolor the skin if you have dark skin. NONE of the above products truly address the cause of acne, step 1, in the acne cascade. Additionally, regardless of where you are in the acne cascade, AcnEase ® can appropriately step in with enough time to prevent future reoccurances and also eliminate the current symptoms. AcnEase ® is unique in that it is the ONLY non-prescription treatment that interferes with the first step in the acne cascade, the overproduction of sebum. Therefore, AcnEase ® is the ONLY over-the-counter agent which PREVENTS acne from forming. The length of treatment and selection of acne products is also dependent on a number of additional factors including: Is your acne mild, moderate or severe? Is your acne chronic? (lasting over a year) Do you have cystic acne? (bumps under the skin) Do you have inflammatory acne? (pustules and papules) Is your acne primarily comedones? (blackheads and whiteheads) Is you acne restricted to your face, or also present on your torso? (back and chest) Are you pre-adolescent, teenage or adult? Your Combination Therapy Options All of these factors, in addition to your own genetic makeup, will contribute to how you select your acne treatment. Given the overall complexity of acne, it is not surprising that it is often useful to consider combination therapy to obtain your desired results. Combination therapy occurs when two or more therapies are used to treat the same condition. Since AcnEase ® is the only product which prevents new pimples from forming, it should be strongly considered as a member of every combination therapy regimen. The use of topical agents can prevent bacterial growth, unclog pores, and treat existing acne. However, they do little to prevent new pimples from forming. Adding topical acne agents to your AcnEase ® regimen can help treat existing acne by unclogging pores or preventing bacterial growth in clogged pores, which can limit inflammation and subsequent skin damage. It is important to select topical agents, which may help your current condition - just also consider the potential side effects. There are many options for those who are looking for a gentle, chemical-free solution to treat the suface of the skin. Any of the following natural topical options are suitable to pair with AcnEase’s ® systemic treatment. Chamomile astringent. Chamomile has been known for its healing properties since ancient times. A naturally calming herb, chamomile is rich with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Chamomile can provide wonderful results for the skin, whether taken orally or used topically. To create an at-home chamomile astringent, brew 3-4 chamomile tea bags in 1 cup of water to make a strong tea. Once cool, soak a cotton ball in the liquid and apply to the skin. You can also add a dash of apple cider vinegar for a double-dose of bacteria fighting ingredients! Naturally exfoliating papaya mask. The creamy pulp of papaya contains many transformative properties that benefit the texture and appearance of the skin. Papain, a protein-digesting enzyme found in the fruit, works to shed the top layer of dead skin cells, revealing a brightened, even tone, while simultaneously deep cleaning the skin. To create an exfoliating mask, mash ½ papaya and mix with one whipped egg white and 1 teaspoon of organic honey. Combine all ingredients until smooth and apply to the skin. Leave mixture on for 10-15 minutes, rinse with warm water, followed by a splash of cold. If the mixture begins to tingles, that is a naturally occurring effect of the papaya. However, if you feel a burning sensation or any discomfort, remove the mixture immediately and cleanse your skin. Pore Closing Yeast Mask. Combining the antibacterial properties of brewer’s yeast with lemon juice will offer the skin a thorough cleanse, purging pores of dirt and bacteria. Mix 1 tablespoon of yeast with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Apply to the face and rinse after 20 minutes. If you have sensitive skin or very severe acne (open breakouts), you may want to stay away from lemon juice! Pore Cleansing Herbal Steam Bath. Clogged pores lead to acne and the combination of excess sebum with dead skin cells contribute to breakouts. The combination therapy of treating your skin from the inside and the outside is the best way to keep pores clean and skin acne-free. Steaming the face will open pores, making it easier for skin to release dirt, oil and toxins. The heat will stimulate your blood flow, leaving you with a healthy glow. Add 4 cups of water to a pot, add a handful of mint (anti-bacterial), a handful of parsley (rich in vitamin C,) and the juice of half a lemon (cuts through oil). Heat the bath to a steam, then remove from the stove and place on a steady surface. Throw a towel over your head and let the steam bath work its magic for 10 minutes. When considering your acne type and the current stage of the acne cascade, a combination treatment should include AcnEase ® since it can stop acne at the first stage in the cascade. This is the only solution that will treat your acne from the inside, working to stop the acne cascade at its onset.

"['4 Acne Skin Care Rules You’ll Want to Follow Today 06-17-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments A good daily skincare regimen is one of the best things you can do for your skin in the fight against acne. However, finding something that works can be challenging. Here are four tips for developing a skincare regimen that will help your skin to become healthy, clear and radiant. Be Consistent. Regardless of the specifics of your cleansing and treatment regimen, it’s necessary that you are consistent! In order to see the results you want, make sure you follow your routine both in the morning and at night. Also remember that seasonal changes and new product updates are a vital part of the normal and needed evolution of your regimen. When you change your skincare products every few days or jump on a new treatment every week, it won’t help your skin and it may actually be detrimental. If creating a routine to adhere to is difficult, create a regular reminder for yourself (create alerts on your phone, or post sticky notes in important places). As long as the reminder motivates you and holds you accountable, it will help solidify the habit in your mind. Psychological studies show that it takes approximately 2 months (66 days) for a new habit to become automatic. So, stick with it and soon, you should be able to start your skincare routine without having to think about it. Cater to your skin type. There’s not one single skincare regimen that will work for everyone, so this is a process that requires trials and lots of personalization. When selecting your own skin-care products, you must first assess and think about your skin type - is it more oily or dry? If your face seems to always have a natural shine, chances are you’re dealing with oily skin. On the other hand, if you’re prone to flaking and your skin appears dull, you probably have dry skin. You may also have combination skin, which is a little bit of both types. Regardless of your skin type, avoid products that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid as well as other ingredients that you cannot pronounce, these are sure to be strong chemicals. These harsh, synthetic chemicals can irritate and inflame your already sensitive skin. For those with oily skin, avoid products with heavier oils and stick to water-based moisturizers. Every skin type, whether oily or dry, needs to be moisturized. Non-comedogenic, water-based products will prevent an unnecessary oil build-up and won’t contribute to clogged pores. Conversely, if you have dry skin, more emollient moisturizers may be used, but be sure to avoid fragrances and complex-chemical ingredients as well. As it may seem counter-intuitive to moisturize acne-prone skin, note that the main reason that pores become clogged is due to dead skin cells. A good moisturizer will keep your skin supple and also prevent flaking or scaling, which may add to clogged pores. Don’t overdo it. When it comes to a daily skincare regimen, there is such a thing as ""too much"". After a certain point, your efforts may start to damage the skin instead of improving it . One of the most common ways that people tend to overdo things is with exfoliation. Exfoliating can help keep your skin looking young by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, and encouraging skin regeneration by stimulating collagen production. The negative side of exfoliation is that it is often done through some type of abrasive process or a chemical reaction and can lead to irritation and inflammation. This can make your breakouts worse by adding to the infection and/or cause your skin to become overly sensitive. If you have cysts or larger pimples, refrain from exfoliation until they heal. With smaller whiteheads and blackheads, limit yourself to one exfoliating session a week, and when possible choose a natural option, such as a papaya exfoliating mask . Also, monitor your skin condition. More sensitive skin should not be exfoliated more than once a month, and always use extreme caution to avoid irritation. Don’t neglect the underlying causes of your acne. Until you address the fundamental cause of your acne, your problems are likely to persist. At its root, acne is not a skin problem, it’s a hormonal problem. Therefore, if your daily skincare routine only treats the outward symptoms, you probably won’t see the results you desire. Male hormones known as androgens (or testosterone) are the most potent stimulators of the sebaceous glands, which produce sebum. Both men and women produce both male and female sexual hormones (testosterone, estrogen and progesterone). What is not commonly understood is that only 1-2% of these hormones circulate freely in the blood. The other 98% are bound to a protein called Sexual Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG). SHBG is made in the liver and transports hormones in the blood. When hormones are carried by SHBG, they are not considered active hormones and will not cause acne. Only hormones that are not carried by SHBG are considered free or unbound. These free hormones are the ones that cause acne. The critical point to understand is that if a person’s SHBG levels are low, there are increased levels of free hormones (usually testosterone), and this leads to acne through an increased production of sebum. To address this problem, products like AcnEase ® help regulate the effects that hormones have on your skin in a way that is safe, gentle, and natural. AcnEase® safely and naturally mitigates the impact of hormones on your skin and sebaceous glands, and it does not directly affect or change hormone levels. AcnEase ® is unique in the fact that it has a buffering effect on the hormones’ stimulation of the sebaceous glands and therefore helps return the production of sebum to a healthier level. AcnEase ® users find it easy to incorporate the treatment into their daily routine. You will notice the change in your skin’s health and appearance,which typically takes between two and four weeks. With a 96% success rate, why pass up the chance? As always, we are committed to you and helping you improve your acne. So let us know what you think in the comments.

"['Acne-Friendly Exercise: How to Get Healthy and De-Stress the Right Way 12-17-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Quick and strenuous exercises are all the rage right now, but these types of exercises, along with too many hours spent in the gym or on the track, may not be the best option for those with acne. Instead, if you have acne-prone skin, you\'ll do better with moderate exercise as part of a healthy, less stressful lifestyle. Exercise, especially intense exercise, is known to stimulate production of testosterone in both women and men. This will help you to build lean muscle mass, but it may also overstimulate your sebaceous glands, which can result in the overproduction of sebum and more clogged pores, leading to more acne breakouts. So the trick is to find a healthy balance between exercising enough to help your body destress and oxygenate, but not so much in a way that may promote inflammation and hormonal imbalances, which may lead to a worsening of your acne. Acne-friendly exercise 1. Yoga Yoga is perfect for de-stressing because it is both exercise and meditation. People have been practicing yoga and reaping its long list of mental and physical benefits for thousands of years. There are many styles of yoga, including the intense ""hot"" yoga, which causes profuse sweating and is quite popular right now. A good style of yoga for those with acne-prone skin might be Sivanada, which is gentle, holistic, and focuses on breathing, meditation and relaxation. 2. Pilates Pilates is a group of exercises that helps you to condition your body in way that enables toning, strength building (especially core strength), flexibility, balance and body realignment. There are five principles of pilates: breath, concentration, flow, control and precision. In practicing pilates, you will learn to put these principles into practice both during exercise and in your everyday life. 3. Qigong Qigong, too, is a meditative practice that has been around for thousands of years. It focuses on the mind-body connection and will help you to take control of your physical, mental and emotional health. It focuses on aligning breathing, movement, and awareness. *** Probably the best way to get acquainted with the above forms of exerciseis takinga few classes.There are also free resources online that may help you take advantage of those exercise styles.And if you\'re convinced you\'ll never be able to fit exercise into your busy schedule, try waking up a little earlier and getting it done first thing in the morning. This is a great way to start your morning off right and to feel strong and stress-free the rest of the day. And here\'s a tip that will go a long way in helping you with your acne when exercising: always exercise without makeup and shower immediately after working out. Use mild cleanser, do not rub or squeeze your pimples, and moisturize after showering with a light, non-comedogenic moisturizer. Remember that moderate exercise is part of a healthy lifestyle that, for those with acne, includes treating acne from the inside .

"[""Sleep Your Way to Acne-Free Skin 11-09-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When we think of the physical effects that a lack of sleep might have on our appearance, most people immediately think of puffy eyes, dark circles under the eye, or a sallow complexion. What many don’t realize is the relationship between a lack of sleep and the health of our skin, including the potential impact on the condition of acne. By avoiding our internal clock and our body’s natural circadian rhythm, we create a condition far more complicated than we may realize. Getting the proper amount of quality sleep is just as important to our bodies as food, water and oxygen. Staying hydrated, maintaining a healthy diet, and cleansing the skin of any dirt or makeup before going to bed are all essential aspects in keeping our skin healthy and looking its best. This is especially important for those who are acne-prone. Not only is an adequate amount of sleep important, but the quality of sleep is equally important in order to maintain normal functioning of our bodies and our mind. Our physical health and brain activity are optimized and recharged and our body repairs itself while we are slumbering soundly. The physical restoration we experience every night is needed in order to maintain manageable stress levels. This has a significant impact on the appearance of our skin as stress elevates the level of specific hormones, including adrenaline and noradrenaline. Both of these hormones belong to the cortisol family, which works along the pathway of testosterone. This can lead to an excess production of sebum, the oily substance that travels along the hair follicle. While healthy sebum production is an essential function of the skin as an organ, overproduction can lead to clogged pores. A drop in blood sugar, which is also maintained by cortisol, leads to slow cell turnover and can aggravate the symptoms and appearance of acne in the form of blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples. Even when using topical acne treatments, not getting enough sleep can sabotage your efforts to clear breakouts and can eventually exacerbate your acne condition. The TRUE causes of acne are INTERNAL, and will be amplified by external factors In addition to achieving stellar skin, the benefits of sleep can be celebrated in almost every aspect of life. Not only does a good night’s rest result in lower stress levels, sleep has also been linked with these benefits as well: Maintain a healthy weight. Research has shown a direct correlation between a lack of sleep and an increased risk for obesity. As you sleep, the body releases hormones that repair cells and control its use of energy. Hormonal changes brought on by irregular sleep patterns can affect your weight. Increase productivity. Sleep loss impairs the ability to pay attention to detail and problem solve, making it harder to stay productive. Strengthen the immune system. Why did our mothers put us to bed whenever we stayed home sick with a cold? Sleep increases our bodies ability to fight off colds and infectious diseases. Additionally, studies have shown that sleep can actually render vaccinations against viruses, such as the flu, more effective. Maintain stamina. The relationship between a good night’s sleep and our overall energy levels the next day are directly related. Allowing the body a restful 7-9 hours of sleep the night before will greatly improve the quality of your performance during the day. Curb inflammation. C-reactive proteins, inflammatory proteins associated with cardiovascular dangers such as heart attacks and heart disease, have been shown to be higher in those getting less than six hours of sleep a night. Inflammation has also been linked to premature aging, arthritis, and diabetes. Live longer! While there is no single solution for living a long life, having a healthy sleep schedule has been linked to longevity. As with any routine, it’s all about balance! Less than five and a half hours has been known to decrease longevity, and oversleeping comes with it’s own set of negative side effects as well. Researchers suggest getting about seven hours a night. If you find yourself having trouble getting a full night’s sleep, try building a routine with these simple tips. At night, keep the temperature in your home between 65-72 degrees F. As the temperature drops slightly, the body is naturally triggered to induce sleep. Pairing a cool, yet comfortable, climate with a dark, quiet room creates the perfect conditions for a quality slumber. Turn off electronics at least one hour prior to hitting the sack. Studies show that the bright, blue light of computer and cell phone screens may be linked to a decrease in melatonin production, the naturally produced hormone that helps regulate sleep. Make sure your body is getting enough exercise during the daylight hours. Doing aerobic exercise about five to six hours before bed is enough to raise your body temperature, allowing it to cool just in time to induce a good night’s sleep. Strive to get in about 20-30 minutes, three to four times a week to keep your body running like a finely-tuned clock. Avoid alcohol and/or caffeine a few hours before bed. Caffeine is a stimulant and most people are aware of the difficulties associated with going to sleep after consuming caffeine. Many people don’t realize the adverse effect that alcohol has on the body’s ability to sustain quality sleep throughout the night. While a drink may help you doze off initially, alcohol actually reduces rapid eye movement, or REM sleep, which is believed to be the restorative period of sleep needed for the brain and body (including the skin) to function properly. Don’t hang out in the bedroom. The bed you sleep in should only be used for two things: sleep and sex. A Harvard Medical study has shown a 90% success rate by implementing a method of stimulus control-if you can’t sleep within 30 minutes of hitting the pillow, leave the room to do a relaxing activity until you feel you can sleep. Have a bedtime. In the process of creating a sleep schedule, we are able to build a natural sleep drive in the brain, which essentially trains our bodies to crave sleep at a certain time every night. Try to follow the schedule on a nightly basis and remember that creating any habit relies on consistency. Pairing a good night’s sleep and your topical solution of choice with AcnEase®, a systemic treatment, is your best bet to achieve and maintain clear, healthy skin. Targeting the problem where it starts, AcnEase® acts as a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands so that sebum production can return to normal levels. AcnEase® is an all-botanical non-GMO ingredient-based formula and you don’t have to worry about side effects due to harsh chemicals, phyto-estrogens, stimulants or animal derived products. AcnEase® is safe and effective for use by anyone, including teens or adults, males or females, and even pregnant or nursing mothers. If you haven’t already, we encourage you to take the skincare plunge and try AcnEase® as your answer to acne-free skin. We guarantee the results. We want to hear from you!

"[""Skin Cancer and Acne? 05-07-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski & Dr. James P. Gilligan 0 Comments May is National Skin Cancer Awareness month, and throughout the month, we will be providing information on skin cancer and acne. Dr. Gilligan, one of our medical advisors and Company directors, joins me to today in helping you learn more about potential issues and prevention. This time of year, the sun gets brighter, our schedule is lighter and we're outside much more. It is so important to realize the importance of having to protect yourself and your skin from the problems that loom with increased sunlight (UV radiation) exposure. By taking some simple precautions, you drastically reduce the probability of dealing with this serious issue. What is Melanoma, and how does it form? The most deadly form of skin cancer is Melanoma. Like all cancers, Melanoma is caused by damage to the DNA inside cells. The damage to the DNA can result in the skin cells growing abnormally, often leading to uncontrolled growth and the formation of a tumor. This damage to the DNA can be inherited in the form of genetic mutations, however in most cases it accumulates over a person's lifetime due to a variety of factors in their environment. Even under normal conditions, the DNA within cells is damaged over time but at a relatively low rate, and the body has mechanisms in place to repair damaged DNA. If excessive damage to DNA occurs, the cells ability to repair this damage is overwhelmed and leads to abnormal cell growth. It is well understood that radiation can damage DNA resulting in mutagenesis and cancer. What is not as well understood is that sunlight is a form of radiation that in excess can lead to an increased risk of skin cancer. Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer due to its metastatic potential (it can spread to other organs such as the lungs or liver). Melanoma is usually caused by damage from UV light from the sun, but UV light from tanning salons can also contribute to the disease. How to Protect Yourself Against Melanoma Cancer Monitor Your Skin The earliest stage of melanoma starts when the melanocytes (the cells that contain the pigment melanin) begin to grow out of control. Melanocytes are located between the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and the underlying layer (the dermis). This early stage of the disease is known as the radial growth phase, where the tumor is less than 1mm thick. Because the cancer cells have not yet reached the blood vessels lower down in the dermal layer of the skin, it is very unlikely that this early-stage cancer will spread or metastasize to other parts of the body. If the melanoma is detected at this stage, then it can usually be completely removed with local surgery. This is why it is very important to check exposed areas of your skin routinely to determine if there are any abnormal dark colored areas on the skin's surface. If there is a suspicious new darkened area on your skin, or there is a spot that has changed, make an appointment to see a dermatologist to have the area checked . A good general rule is to visit your dermatologist atleast once a year for a routine checkup. Protect Your Skin Against UV Radiation The most important protection against Melanoma is to take precautions to limit excessive sun exposure, reducing the likelihood of UV induced damage to the skin. The best sun protection is of course lightweight, loose clothing, but when that isn't an option, choose sunscreens that base their protective properties on these two major ingredients: titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. And remember when you go indoors at night to wash it all off your skin thoroughly. We will go in to further detail about sunscreens this month. Additionally, many acne treatments/products actually increase skin sensitivity to sunlight and UV radiation (antibiotics, retinoids, salicylic acid, different types of chemical peels and sotretinoin, Accutane). So, when you look for an acne treatment, look for a product like AcnEase that does NOT INCREASE YOUR SKIN SENSITIVITY TO UV RADIATION. In summary, we don't want you to think that you have to walk around the beach this summer covered from head to toe, sweating profusely - enjoy yourself, but just remember to take the proper precautions!

"['Sunscreen Protection for Acne Prone Skin: the myths you need to know about 06-29-2013 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Most of us are led to believe that if we lather on sunscreen in the morning and then stay out on the beach all day long, our skin is protected. Unfortunately, this is incorrect. Learning about proper sun protection and sunscreens will not only keep you and your skin safe, but it will also keep you from getting flare-ups. Myth 1: The Sun is Bad for You Fact: No, the sun is NOT BAD for you. In fact, the sun is healthy if you take precautions. Ultraviolet light from the sun comes in two main wavelengths: UVA and UVB. They are quite different in respect of the risk they create for your health. UVB is the ""good"" sunlight and UVA is the ""bad"" one. UVB helps you produce vitamin D that is extremely important for your overall wellbeing, supporting the health of your bones, muscles, skin, eyesight, heart and immune system. UVA can cause free radical damage. Moderation in sun exposure and using proper sun protection are your keys to safety since long-term, excessive exposure to sunlight can increase the risk of certain types of skin cancer. Myth 2: All Sunscreens Are Safe & Effective Fact: According to the Environmental Working Group (EWG), 75% of sunscreens in stores don\'t actually protect you enough. As sun protection against UVA rays is necessary, you need to be educated and watch for those ingredients in sunscreen that can do more harm than good. The main chemical used in sunscreens is octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), which was found to kill mouse cells, even at low doses. OMC is present in 90% of sunscreen products. Another common ultraviolet filter, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, has also demonstrated toxic properties. Take a good look at your sunscreen label and beware of the following chemicals (they come with names you most likely can\'t even repeat) that are not really good for you: Para aminobenzoic acid Octyl salicylate Avobenzone Oxybenzone Cinoxate Padimate Dioxybenzone Homosalate Phenylbenzimidazole Sulisobenzone Menthyl anthranilate Trolamine salicyclate Octocrylene Instead, look for sunscreens that base their protective properties on these two major ingredients: Titanium Dioxide Zinc Oxide When both of those ingredients are at a level of 6% or higher, you are covered. Green tea extract, aloe extract, shea butter as well as some other botanical humectants (moisturizers) will keep your skin from drying. Myth 3: The Higher SPF, The Higher The Protection Level Fact: The level of protection is NOT growing proportionally to the SPF level SPF (Sun Protection Factor) is a measure of a sunscreen\'s ability to prevent UVB from damaging the skin. You can look at it in terms of percentages: SPF 15 filters out approximately 93 percent of all incoming UVB rays. SPF 30 keeps out 97 percent and SPF 50 keeps out 98 percent. They may seem like small differences, but if you are light-sensitive, or have a history of skin cancer, or you are a child, or over 60, those extra percentages will make a big difference. And as you can see, no sunscreen can block all UV rays. In general, an effective recommended SPF is 30. It is also very important that you opt for the sunscreen that actually blocks both UVA and UVB rays. Those types of sunscreens are called ""Broad Spectrum"". Only sunscreens that pass the FDA\'s Broad Spectrum test (providing proportional protection against UVA and UVB rays) may be labeled as ""Broad Spectrum."" Remember there is NO bearing on the DURATION you can put the sunscreen on and expect protection. N o sunscreen, regardless of strength, stays effective longer than two hours without reapplication. In addition ""reddening"" of the skin is a reaction to UVB rays alone and tells you little about what UVA damage you may be getting. Plenty of damage can be done without the red flag of sunburn being raised. And please be aware that if you are on a prescription that causes sun-sensitivity, you cannot extend your sun exposure as long as usual. Using an SPF higher than 30 is not proven to provide more protection, but we do know it only has more chemicals, which are not going to help your acne-prone skin. Myth 4: Applying Some Sunscreen is Better than Nothing Fact: It matters a great deal how much sunscreen you put on. And in this situation - MORE IS BETTER. To ensure that you get the full SPF of a sunscreen, you need to apply 1 oz. (about a shot glass full) at once and EVERY time you reapply the sunscreen. Studies show that most people apply only half to a quarter of that amount, which means the actual SPF they have on their body is lower than advertised. During a long day at the beach, one person should use around one half to one quarter of an 8 oz. bottle. Sunscreens should be applied 30 minutes before sun exposure to allow the ingredients to fully bind to the skin. Reapplication of sunscreen is just as important as putting it on in the first place, so reapply the same amount every two hours. Sunscreens should also be reapplied immediately after swimming, toweling off, or when sweating a lot. YES - it may add up to a quite a number of cans, tubes or bottles, but using a sufficient amount of sunscreen is essential. Want to know how much protection is in the most natural form of SPF (a t-shirt)? If you decide that a t-shirt is your sunscreen today, the color BLACK gives you the most protection. A white t-shirt will only provide SPF 7, and when wet, SPF 3. A dark green t-shirt will give you SPF 10 (when NOT wet); and black t-shirt, especially a thicker shirt, SPF up to 50! It is not so surprising as dark colors absorb sunrays, and thicker materials obviously provide for more barrier.

"['The Current Hazards of Treating Acne with Birth Control Pills 02-07-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Currently, the FDA is concerned about the side effects of 10 brands of birth control pills sold in the US, and 4 of the pills that are already on their list are a subject of a class action suit (Yaz ® , Yasmin ® , Beyaz ® , Ocella ® ) . With the ban of Bayer\'s acne drug Diane-35 in France due to the number of associated deaths and other serious health problems, and a follow up investigation in the UK, Spain, Australia and other EU and middle eastern countries as well as Canada, we feel that as a service to our clients, we need to help them to understand these developments on how this affects their own acne treatment options. We want to ensure our customers that AcnEase® is an all botanical ingredients based product and does NOT include any estrogen or phytoestrogens (plant-derived estrogen-like substance). Phytoestrogens may be considered safer than those made chemically, but they still act in a similar way to estrogen. The decision to use products with these substances should be taken very seriously and heavily researched before doing so, especially if you are a teen or a women trying to get pregnant, who is pregnant or is nursing. What is Diane-35? Diane-35 is a hormonal drug ( cyproterone - ethinyl estradiol) that was used to treat hormonal acne, especially acne resulting from too much androgens (male hormones). It is also an oral contraceptive (birth control pill). Diane-35 is not approved in the US but it is was available in Canada, and like many other drugs, unfortunately found its way to US consumers through so called ""gray marketing."" Diane-35 is presently being investigated for a number of deaths, possibly caused by blood clots, and for non-fatal cases of thrombosis and arterial thrombosis. The story doesn\'t end here. In September 2011, t he U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informed the public that it is concerned about the potential increased risk of blood clots with the use of drospirenone-containing birth control pills. A number of US approved birth control pills are on this warning list. Despite this warning, birth control pills are still liberally prescribed to women with acne even if their sexual life is not a factor. And, not many patients know that most oral contraceptives are not specifically developed and approved for use as an acne treatment but rather for ""off-label"" use! So what do YOU need to do? Be an educated consumer by being informed on the latest news and warnings - do research using verifiable sources Read the labels and fine print - ask your doctor about the ingredients and known side effects of the drug you\'re taking If contraceptive is not your main focus, reconsider using birth control pills for acne treatment by looking for natural options. Do NOT get easily placated by the word ""natural"". Even natural products may contain ingredients (like phytoestrogens) that are not necessarily good for you.

"['Important Tips on How to Fight Whiteheads and Blackheads 07-30-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Do you have whiteheads or blackheads? You may not think about it but - yes, this means you HAVE acne. The first warning sign that indicates you may succumb to acne is actually oily skin. This condition results from over production of sebum (skin oil) by your sebaceous glands. As skin oil is necessary for heathy skin, too much of it may clog your pores (together with dead skin cells, dirt, and other “debris”), and actually become a first step in the “acne cascade”. This first step is marked by the occurrence of comedones also commonly known as or whiteheads or blackheads. When clogged pores became inflamed due to the presence of bacteria, the result is a formation of pimples or even cysts. Actually you can stop the acne cascade, mitigate oily skin and get rid of whiteheads and blackheads and prevent more serious forms of acne such as pimples and cysts as many of our AcnEase customers do. If you do not address the comedones (whiteheads and blackheads) that represent the first stage of acne and leave them untreated, your acne condition may become chronic and in consequence not only lead to more severe stages of acne but also result in damaged skin in the form of acne scars and marks. Why are some comedones white and some black? The pore with the trapped mixture of oil and debris may be open which allows the excess oil to be exposed to the air and therefore become oxidized. This represents a blackhead. When the pore remains closed and it becomes inflamed, it is called a whitehead. When bacteria enters the scene, white blood cells from the immune system come to the rescue - we see the pimple (a pustule), and if the inflammation is deeper in the pore, this is called an acne papule. Sometimes unfortunately the inflammation spreads to the adjoining area outside of the pore and that is known as cystic acne. In summary, as oily skin is the first step or a precursor of acne, whiteheads and blackheads (comedones) are actually acne and must be treated. As an ""ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure"", the key to getting rid of acne is to take steps to prevent over secretion of the sebaceous glands. This is what AcnEase dose by mitigating the impact of the hormonal imbalance (the main reason behind the over stimulated sebaceous glands). By moderating your body’s response to hormones in the blood, AcnEase helps your production of skin oil stay at levels that are beneficial to your skin. Since AcnEase does not affects hormones directly nor changes their amount, it can be used by women and men, both adults and adolescents, and can also be used while you are using oral contraceptives, trying to conceive, are pregnant or just had a baby. 5 Important Tips on How to Fight Blackheads and Whiteheads To complement and enhance the treatment and prevention of acne delivered by all natural, botanical AcnEase, you can follow these 5 tips that can help to keep your pores unclogged and reduce your whiteheads and blackheads. Properly clean your face twice daily with a mild non over-drying cleanser. Avoid drying soaps and products containing such chemicals as salicylic acid, peroxide, alcohol. In addition to irritation and oversensitivity, they may over dry your skin. In response, your skin will produce more, not less, oil. Avoid scrubbing your skin. Vigorous scrubbing may induce more oil production and also cause abrasions that allow bacteria to access deeper layers of the skin, which is exactly what you don\'t want. Do NOT pick, pop or squeeze your whiteheads and blackheads. This may lead to more bacteria to enter the pores, creating a vicious inflammation cycle; it also destroys tissue and leads to acne scars and marks NEVER sleep with your make-up on. If you use makeup, use non-comedogenic products. Also ALWAYS wash it off properly at night. Do not forget your shower. If you exercise, you must clean your skin from head to toe after the session and always change your clothes! Do not use hot water, just warm. Hot water may actually strip too much oil from your skin and your skin’s sebaceous glands will respond by producing more oil! Whiteheads and Blackheads Fighting Cleanser A homemade sugar, honey and lemon scrub can work wonders for your skin. It will help exfoliate your skin to remove excess oil and debris trapped in the pores without causing dryness. Ingredients (use organic when possible) 1 tbs sugar 1 tbs honey 1 tbs fresh squeezed lemon Instructions Mix all ingredients. Apply it on your face and gently massage in circular motions. DO NOT RUB. Leave it on for 5 minutes. Wipe it off using a wet washcloth dipped in a warm (NOT HOT) water, and then rinse your face with luke warm water. Pat dry. Then use a light, non-comedogenic moisturizer. Do this once or twice a week on a regular basis. Let us know if you try these methods and whether they work for you. Did you even know that whiteheads and blackheads were acne?

"['Is Your DIY Acne Remedy on the ""Won\'t Work"" List? green clay extraction mask instead. 2. The ""Caveman"" Skincare Regimen The rumor is that quitting your daily skincare regimen will cure your acne. That means no water and no cleanser for your face. The idea behind this ""DIY practice"" is that once you stop washing your face, your sebum production will start to normalize. First of all, acne is the external manifestation of an internal imbalance . So regardless of what you do to your skin from the outside, the internal imbalance will still exist and will still need to be treated . And while it\'s true that washing your face too often can lead to increased oil production, not washing it at all will allow both dead skin and bacteria to build up faster and further clog your pores and possibly cause serious lesions and cysts. You don\'t have to go caveman to avoid stripping your skin of its natural oils. Simply use a gentle cleanser twice a day, one that contains no over-drying ingredients such as salicylic acid or alcohol. 3. Aspirin Masks Another rumor claims that dissolving aspirin into a salicylic acid paste and applying to your face is a good way to clean out your pores and fight bacteria. The problem is, salicylic acid is a keratolytic and has many negative side effects; there is also a recent FDA warning about it, especially for young teens and pregnant women. Frequent and long-term use of salicylic acid may cause a number of side effects such as skin redness and irritation, dryness and premature aging, and even problems such as dizziness, headaches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. There are also concerns about pregnant women using products with salicylic acid. Medical professionals are divided as to how much the use of salicylic acid can affect an unborn baby. Many health care professionals recommend that pregnant women stay away from any cosmetic products containing this chemical since it will get absorbed into the bloodstream when used on the face and/or body. You\'re better off sticking to a natural skincare regimen and avoiding salicylic acid altogether! That said, there are SOME DIY tips that may actually help you treat existing pimples while you work to treat your acne from the inside. DIY Tips and Treatments that May Help: 1. DIY Exfoliating Mask It\'s true. You really can exfoliate your skin naturally and effectively with food. One of our favorite recipes features papaya. The papain enzyme in papaya is helpful in removing dead skin cells that may mix with sebum and cause acne pimples. Simply puree half a cup of fresh, ripe papaya (peeled and diced), then combine with one teaspoon of honey and two drops of rose, geranium or primrose essential oil. Apply to clean face and rest for 15 minutes. Remove with warm water and pat dry. 2. DIY Chamomile Tea Astringent It\'s true. A fresh pot of strong chamomile tea can do wonders for your skin. After you\'ve cleaned your skin, and before you moisturize, applying a non-harsh yet effective astringent cleans, tones and firms the skin and also constricts the pores. Most astringents dry out the skin, which again, will make your acne worse. But chamomile has anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, and when applied topically, chamomile can help reduce inflammation associated with acne, razor bumps or irritation. Simply brew 3-4 chamomile tea bags (or 2 handfuls of the dry plant) into a very strong tea. When cooled, splash or use on a cotton pad all over your face twice a day. Keep the leftovers in the refrigerator, but use or discard in two days. 3. DIY Witch Hazel Spot Treatment It\'s true. The bark and leaves of witch hazel are astringent; the extract, also referred to as witch hazel, is used medicinally and helps in reducing inflammation and irritations. Simply dip a Q-tip in witch-hazel and apply to pimples. (No rubbing! Just dab on the pimples for 3-4 seconds). *** Remember though, even if you use DIY tips that may help assist your symptoms, you still need to treat your acne from the inside to break the acne cycle once and for all. To figure out the type of acne you have and the best treatment for it, check out this quick and easy system . Our clients find it is an enormous help!

"['Can Probiotics Really Help YOUR Acne? 09-12-2014 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Probiotics have come to the forefront of being an essential tool to helping maintain a healthy digestive and immune system. Despite this popularity, many people aren\'t entirely sure of what they are or what they can do. Here\'s a look at just a few of their great benefits-including a discussion of how they may be able to help you in your fight against acne. What are probiotics? You would be hard pressed to find someone who hasn\'t heard of probiotics and their numerous health benefits, but what exactly are they? The term ""probiotic"" refers to a wide range of microorganisms which can be found in certain foods, drinks, and supplements that help regulate everything from digestion to allergies. Most of these microorganisms are bacteria, and while chowing down on something commonly found in a petri dish may not sound appetizing, you might be surprised to learn that your gastrointestinal tract is already teeming with them! When thinking about bacteria within the body, scientists break them down into two main categories-""good"" and ""bad"". Sometimes things like your diet or other environmental factors can cause the ""bad"" bacteria to overwhelm the ""good"", and probiotics help restore a natural, healthy balance. Keep in mind that the goal is not to completely eliminate the ""bad"" bacteria-our bodies have uses for them as well-but rather, it\'s to merely reduce them to a level where they aren\'t causing unwanted side effects. Probiotics are naturally found in cultured or fermented foods, like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi; however, due to their rising popularity, many food manufacturers add them to other products as well. What benefits do probiotics provide? The most common reason people use probiotics is to promote digestive and immune health. The gut can be a breeding ground for disease to start when not taken care of, so a healthy gut many believe, can be helped by the use of good probiotics. Many people suffering from a range of digestive issues have found success in using certain strains to help manage their symptoms-especially products containing the bacteria Bifidobacterium infantis . If you eat a diet that is mostly processed (which we don\'t recommend), it will barely contain any good bacteria. So adding a healthy dose of good bacteria makes all the sense. Another common use for probiotics is boosting the immune system. According to a recent study from New Zealand published in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport , subjects were 40% less likely to develop colds or digestive infections when they regularly took a probiotic supplement. While several strains showed promise for promoting immune system health, the most beneficial were Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus acidophilus . However, researchers warned that people who already have a compromised immune system may not benefit from these probiotics, and in fact, they may make their problems worse. Can probiotics help with acne? There are several promising studies that have shown that probiotics can help acne sufferers to decrease the intensity and even sometimes the frequency of their breakouts. Scientists suspect that one of the reasons for this positive effect may be that fact that an imbalance between your good and bad intestinal bacteria causes inflammation. As the most prevailing inflammations may happen in joints and tendons, skin is also not free of this danger. It is important to note however that skin inflammation does not cause acne breakouts. Inflammation may however make the breakouts worse than they already are. It is also noted that intestinal health plays an important role in maintaining healthy skin and therefore also has an impact on acne. According to recent studies from both Russia and Italy, subjects who drank a beverage infused with Lactobacillus acidophilus for 12 weeks had markedly fewer whiteheads, blackheads, and cysts than those who did not. In addition, there is early stage research being conducted that is exploring how topical products containing probiotics can perhaps help with controlling symptoms of acne (notice that we said, controlling symptoms, not prevention). If you\'re interested in exploring the effects of probiotics on your acne there is one thing to keep in mind-not all strains can potentially help in fighting your acne problems. So far, only Lactobacillus has been shown to help controlling breakouts. So - as a healthy GI system will help in maintaining an overall healthy body, while focusing on acne, look for products that contain this specific strain. Are probiotics really enough to treat your acne? Even with a regular regimen of probiotics, you may still struggle with acne. While they can help keep your body and skin healthy, the origin of your breakouts are actually much more complex. One of the most common causes of acne is an imbalance in your hormones-specifically the presence of too much androgen in the blood stream. This imbalance can cause your sebaceous glands to overproduce an oily substance known as sebum, which then clogs your pores and allows acne-causing bacteria to flourish. Until this imbalance is addressed, it\'s likely that you will continue to experience breakouts. By now, it\'s obvious that the only way to be truly free from acne is to alter the effect of your hormones on your sebaceous glands. Products like AcnEase can do just that-not by directly manipulating your hormone levels but by mitigating their effects on your skin. It\'s a safe, effective, and natural solution to this internal problem. And yes, you can safely take AcnEase with your choice of probiotics. There\'s no doubt that probiotics can play an important role in your acne treatment, but to see the long-lasting results you really want, you\'ll need to address your breakouts at their point of origin.

"[""How to Really Cope with Teenage Acne from a Parent’s Perspective [EXPERT TIPS] 10-13-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments As a parent of a child who had acne as a teen, and as a natural medicine specialist who has helped thousands of teens overcome acne, I’m very aware of the emotional turmoil that comes with this bothersome skin condition. As adults, we know that acne is temporary but as a teenager, it can seem that the end of the world is rapidly approaching. It is painful to hear and witness the visible effects of teenage acne and how it negatively impacts your child. When it comes to acne, parents often don’t know how to console their child while assuring them they aren’t alone and that the problem is temporary and treatable. Why my teen? During the adolescent years, acne is more than skin deep. The emotional effects of acne on a teenager can impact how they feel about themselves. Acne can result in low self-confidence, negative self image, anti-social behavior, depression and suicidal thoughts. The fragile self esteem of a teenager makes it difficult for them to put their best face forward when it is covered with “imperfections.” In addition to the myriad of negative implications arising from teenage acne, left untreated, acne can leave permanent scars. Acne is the most common skin disease in the U.S. 85-90% of the population between the ages of 12 and 25 will experience acne. Hormone levels, specifically the androgen related hormones, increase during puberty and stimulate the glands that produce sebum. As a result, these glands produce more sebum, which tends to clog the pores of the skin and entrap dead skin cells, supporting the growth of bacteria and initiating the acne cascade of pimple development. Where there is more sebum, there is a higher likelihood of comedones (white heads and blackheads) as well as the development of inflammatory acne pimples. Studies have shown that more recently puberty is beginning earlier than in the past. It is not uncommon for children to experience puberty as early as the age of 7. With the onset of puberty, acne can be expected to make an appearance. Most children begin puberty between the ages of 10-13 with girls developing acne around the age of 11 and boys around the age of 13. Boys produce 10 times the amount of androgen as girls and therefore tend to develop more severe cases of acne. There are many factors that contribute to acne. As a parent, some of these are easier than others to monitor and/or control. Stress: When the adrenal glands are stimulated, they produce more stress hormones, which can directly impact acne. Diet: Teens should avoid high glycemic index foods, which spike blood sugar levels. The body processes these very quickly which increases insulin levels and inflammatory reactions and may lead to breakouts. Dairy products contain hormones and can also be very problematic. Try to eliminate dairy in your child’s diet for a few weeks and see if there is a noticeable change. Dairy can be replaced with non-dairy items such as nut-milk, rice-milk and coconut-milk based products. Try to avoid soy as these products have other impacts on health. After a few weeks, slowly reintroduce dairy and see if there are noticeable changes in your child’s skin. Encourage your teen to wash their face twice a day with a mild cleanser that is non-comedogenic and oil-free. Teach them the basics about washing their face. Wash hands first. Use warm water, your chosen cleanser and your hands. Wash gently, do not scrub vigorously as this can cause more damage to the skins surface. Avoid hair products and cosmetics that contain oil. When shopping for products for them, make sure they are oil-free and non-comedogenic. Encourage them not to pick at existing pimples or try to pop pimples since this will make it worse and elongate the healing time. Show them how to camouflage the area if necessary (see below). The less products they put on the area, the quicker the time to heal. Family history: If acne is in your family genes, this could be something that your child is predisposed to getting. Menstrual cycle: Enough said! Get plenty of sleep! Skin repairs itself during sleep so it is important to get plenty of sleep. Adequate hydration: Girls between the age of 14-18 should consume at least 8 cups of water per day and boys should consume at least 11 cups. Teens can improve their acne by doing the following: Being consistent with their chosen routine, including cleansing and medication. Wash the face twice daily, morning and bedtime and again after sports. Follow the suggested guidelines for face washing. Keep hands off face and other affected areas Wash face and/or body after sports Shower and shampoo daily Guys should shave carefully over breakouts, using an electric razor, and shaving as little as possible. Due to the serious emotional side effects of acne, parents really need to play an active part in their teenager’s daily life. Most teens are more affected by their acne than they verbalize. Depression and/or anxiety related to acne can lead to long-term psychological effects. There are many ways that parents can steer their teen away from negative thoughts and damaging self-esteem issues. Encourage children to take care of themselves by eating healthy, getting ample rest and exercise. This will give your child a reason to feel good and ultimately help with their acne. Ensure that your teen sticks with their chosen acne treatment for at least 3 months (see below for recommendation) to see the results. This can be a long process for a teenager so help them remember to be patient. Hormone levels will continue to fluctuate for years, which can temporarily disturb treatment progress. Remind them to be patient and be their cheerleader. Encourage your teen to participate in activities they excel at and enjoy, taking the focus off their acne. The activity can be anything from a sport or other fun activity. Be mindful and listen when they talk to you about their feelings and/or insecurities. Look for ways to help them get through this difficult time. If your child is a girl, a trip to the makeup counter at the local mall for a lesson on makeup application can go a long way in improving feelings of negative self-image. Or take your son to his favorite store and get him something that will make him feel great. Keep your ears and eyes open for warning signs of depression and isolation. These should be taken seriously. Call your doctor immediately to discuss and determine a plan of action. If your teen feels the need to hide their acne, they can use a BB cream that matches their skin tone to conceal the area. Help them find a product that is oil-free and non-comedogenic. Boys can also use a concealer to hide acne. Remind them not to use too much product as this can make their acne worse. Encourage them only to use this when absolutely necessary. The more products and chemicals that they apply to their skin, the longer it may take for their skin to heal. Treatment Recommendation AcnEase® is an excellent resource for this troubling time for both you and your teen.

"['Are Exfoliations & Chemical Peels Good for Acne-Prone Skin? 03-15-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Skin Exfoliations and Chemical Peels became very popular with Glycolic Acid (and less Salicylic Acid) becoming the toast of the town. There is reason to believe that for most skin types, with the exception of dry and sensitive skin, some level of exfoliation may be beneficial. It can help to remove dead skin cells, helping to unclog pores, remove dry, dark, and flaky skin resulting from photo-aging, and stimulate collagen production to help skin regeneration. As with many things that are ""in"" at the time, we seem to go overboard. T oo frequent and strong chemical peels may lead to sensitized, irritated and over-dry skin. And too vigorous and frequent abrasive exfoliation can lead to skin inflammation. The COST of the procedures can take a toll on you too! Papaya Mask: Papain Enzyme is a Powerful Exfoliate for Acne-Prone Skin Papaya is abundant in antioxidants due to the huge concentration of Vitamin A The papain enzyme in papaya is helpful in removing dead skin cells that may mix with sebum and cause acne pimples - so applying papaya on the skin will exfoliate your skin in the most gentle and natural way Papain accelerates skin turnover so there is an apparent lightening effect with newer, creamier skin on the surface and positive effects on photo-aging signs such as dark spots and discolorations The effects of the mask will be extended with regular use (once a week) and with the use of natural sunblock daily Skin Exfoliating Papaya Mask Recipe ½ cup fresh papaya, peeled and diced (make sure it is a less ripe papaya - it will contain more papain) 1 teaspoon honey 2 drops rose, geranium or primrose essential oil Puree papaya in a food processor until smooth Mix in honey and essential oil (helps to moisturize the skin) If you do not like the loose consistency of the mask, you may add 1-2 spoons of oatmeal (natural and with no sugar) to thicken the mask Cleanse your face and neck with warm water, and gently apply the mask onto your skin.

"[""4 Powerful Antioxidants That Can Reduce the Effects of Acne 03-26-2015 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Antioxidants hold a position of privilege among health conscious individuals. These powerful substances have the ability to locate and destroy free radicals, which are unstable atoms that can lead to illness and aging. Antioxidants are essential for overall health and wellness, but in particular they can promote clear skin and reduce the effects of acne. Here is a look at four particular ones that do just that. Keep in mind that antioxidants do not treat the underlying causes of acne , and therefore cannot eliminate your problems entirely. However, they are indeed powerful enough to help you along your quest for healthy skin. Vitamin C Vitamin C is one of the most well-known antioxidants around, and it can be found in everything from citrus fruits to chili peppers. This essential nutrient helps regulate a large number of the body's activities, including immune system function and cardiovascular health, but most importantly for acne sufferers, it's a great way to help keep the skin looking youthful and free from breakouts. Vitamin C helps stimulate the production of collagen, which is an essential building block for skin, but it also can help reduce inflammation associated with acne and lessen the effects of breakouts. When choosing a source of vitamin C, it's best to get your daily supply from foods that contain it instead of supplements, which may put you at risk for overdose-when taken in large quantities, vitamin C can lead to some unpleasant side effects, like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Vitamin E Vitamin E is essential for healthy skin cell growth because it combats free radicals that threaten to compromise the process. While this particular nutrient may not do much to treat your current breakout, it does work very well at reducing the size and severity of acne scars from previous ones. One way to get a good dose of vitamin E is through your diet-healthy foods such as almonds, dark leafy greens, avocadoes, and broccoli all contain significant amounts of the substance. In terms of treating acne scars, preventing new acne from forming is the first crucial step to getting rid of acne scars and marks. Zinc There is definitely a correlation between zinc and acne-studies show that people who routinely suffer from breakouts have lower levels of this mineral in their blood than those who don't. In addition to these studies, others have shown that acne sufferers who begin taking a zinc supplement have lower pimple counts than sufferers who don't. In terms of skincare, zinc is so effective at combatting blemishes because it kills acne-causing bacteria and reduces the inflammation associated with these bacteria. Foods such as fish, wheat germ, and spinach all contain zinc, but in this case taking an oral supplement might be a better route. Some research has indicated that only particular varieties of zinc contain acne-fighting properties, and it can be difficult to determine whether or not high-zinc foods contain them. Instead, look for an all-natural supplement that contains zinc picolinate or zinc methionine specifically. Omega 3s For many years, scientists did not consider omega 3 fatty acids as antioxidants. However, new research has indicated that these acids do indeed have some free radical-fighting properties. Current studies also indicate that omega 3s are great for dealing with acne-in fact, they can both reduce pimple count and inflammation associated with breakouts. It's possible to get omega 3s from oral supplements, but choosing foods high in this substance (like salmon) may be a better choice, due to the unpleasant aftertaste caused by the supplements. Again, keep in mind that these additions will not treat your acne alone. It is imperative that you chose a treatment first because a treatment is the only thing that will get rid of your acne. These antioxidants will only compliment the treatment. Our AcnEase users have already done so, and have seen a 96% success rate.

"['Understanding the Link Between Dairy Products and Acne 07-01-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Even though food is not responsible for the underlying hormonal causes of acne , there are certain products that have the potential to exacerbate acne breakouts or prime your skin for new breakouts in the future. Dairy products are frequently cited as one of these ""problem foods"", which has caused many an acne sufferer to abandon some of their favorite dairy-based treats in the hopes that this dietary switch would make their acne problems finally go away for good. Unfortunately, these drastic measures don\'t always provide the results that people are hoping for. Furthermore, depriving your body of calcium and proteins contained in dairy WITHOUT a healthy balanced diet may actually cause your body harm (e.g. lack of absorbable calcium and vitamin D may foster osteoporosis and weaker teeth; vitamin A is needed for healthy eyesight). On the other hand, as we are indeed what we eat, we need to understand the potential for a possible link between acne and dairy for some individuals. Before you go on a kitchen-cleaning spree, tossing out all your favorite cheeses and ice cream, take a moment to learn the facts about dairy products. I think you\'ll find that when it comes to these types of food, making modifications to your intake is better than outright eliminating it. Is There a Link Between Acne and Dairy Products? There have been several studies conducted in the last decade that attempted to examine the link between acne and dairy products, and, as you would expect with new scientific research, many of these studies had wildly different findings, and have been creating controversy rather than providing straightforward answers. However, the one thing that many of these researchers seem to agree on is that when dairy products do worsen acne breakouts it\'s because of dairy\'s effect on the hormonal balance of our bodies-the hormones found in dairy may create hormonal havoc and as a result may also impact our skin\'s sebaceous glands, ""pushing"" them to overproduce oil (sebum). This then clogs our pores and allows for the growth of acne-causing bacteria. At this point, you may be thinking that it\'s best to just avoid dairy altogether-better safe than sorry, right? Not necessarily. Different hormones have been added to the cow\'s diet to induce either production of more milk or meat. This practice has been under scrutiny, and the production of organic milk and dairy products is rapidly growing. Interestingly, cheeses imported from Europe are mostly hormone-free because the European Union has stricter food protection laws. Since dairy provides us with important vitamins and nutrients, many of which contribute to healthy skin, it is wiser to switch to organic dairy products and to moderate intake instead of eradicating dairy from your diet (unless you are lactose intolerant, of course). In addition, there are plenty of people in the world who eat and drink dairy products regularly without any acne problems whatsoever-providing evidence that the effects of dairy can vary wildly from person to person. If You\'re Suffering From Acne, What Should You Do About Your Dairy Intake? If you\'re truly worried that the consumption of dairy products could be having a negative effect on the health of your skin and the severity of your acne breakouts, the best thing to do is make step-by-step modifications, checking what works and what doesn\'t, instead of taking an extreme approach and eliminating dairy entirely. Next Steps to Take 1. If you\'re a big milk drinker, one of the first things you could try is switching from regular pasteurized milk to an organic variety. Organic milk does not contain hormones that many believe can contribute to acne, which could help alleviate your problems. 2. Monitoring the amount of dairy products you consume is another wise step. Almost everything is detrimental to your health when consumed in excess, so perhaps your problem is that you\'re simply relying too much on dairy products in your diet. 3. Whatever changes you make, be sure to give your body enough time to adjust to them so that you can accurately gauge their effectiveness. Monitor the quality of your skin over the course of at least a few weeks, and if you find that these changes are helping, then stick with them! If they\'re not helping, take a step back. Whatever you do, don\'t rush into things and make unnecessary and drastic changes to your diet. Finally, when considering the effects of dairy on your skin, remember that there is no dietary change that can completely cure your acne-these changes may only make your fight against it easier. Without addressing your acne problems at their root you cannot break the acne cycle!

"['Can You Over-Clean Your Acne-Prone Skin? 10-11-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Beating acne is not really about what we put on our skin, but about the right treatment that will address the causes of acne (hyperactive sebaceous glands and the inflammation cascade that follows sebum-clogged pores). Since acne is the result of what happens inside of your body, topical products have only a miniscule impact on getting acne under control. Nevertheless, even though the treatment needs to come from the inside, what we do to our skin on the outside may either help or impede the treatment. Cleaning your skin appropriately is recognized as potentially one of the most important ""helpers"" in acne treatment, as it can help remove bacteria-attracting dirt and extra, clogging dead skin cells from the pores. Unfortunately, if done inappropriately cleaning may actually hurt your acne-prone skin. 5 Rules for Cleaning Your Acne-Prone Skin 1. Do NOT over-dry your skin When cleaning your skin, your goal is to remove excess oil (sebum), dirt and sweat from the surface and possibly from the pores to decrease the possibility of infection. However, some skin oil is essential to skin health, and stripping the oil too much can make your skin dry and flaky. Dry skin has tiny cracks in which bacteria can breed, plus excessive flaking can lead to clogged pores. Finally, skin fights over-drying by producing more sebum to compensate for too drastic of a loss. Use mild, noncomedogenic cleansers no more than twice a day. Watch out for those products that contain alcohol or salicylic acid as they may over-dry your skin. Use cleansers that can actually dissolve sebum (coconut oil is one of them) and follow up with mild (preferably herbal) non-alcohol-based astringents . 2. Avoid abrasions Any ""entrance"" that you create for bacteria is bad news for your acne-prone skin. So-as exfoliation is ""in"" and may remove those flakes and dead skin that add to the clogged pores-AVOID harsh exfoliates and vigorous rubbing. Mild peels once a week may be of help, but heavy-duty exfoliation may do more harm than good. Try a papaya mask as a natural exfoliate-the papain enzyme is a powerful exfoliate for acne prone skin. 3. Cleaning does NOT mean squeezing Cleaning should NOT lead to any skin ""injuries,"" so popping your pimples, squeezing your blackheads, and fooling around with your cysts not only increases the probability of additional infection but actually leads to acne scars and marks. Try utilizing some good makeup tips for acne-prone skin - just make sure you use quality makeup that is non-comedogenic. 4. The moisturizing secrets Over-dry and irritated skin is more prone to inflammation, so after cleaning, use a moisturizer to keep your skin supple and happy. Avoid oil-based, heavy creams and opt for light, water-based noncomedogenic products, preferably with little to no fragrance. Use natural moisturizing masks - even spray your face with clean, bottled water. 5. Your skin is unforgivable - so you CANNOT forget We know you are busy, but forgetting to clean your skin is a ""big offense."" As you need to use your acne treatments consistently, you also must remember that cleaning your skin before going to bed is a part of a treatment routine. NO excuses. Make a point to clean your skin and use your AcnEase® treatments, every day, as directed. No skipping days! Your skin will thank you for it.

"['Expert Reactions: FDA\'s New Warning on Benzoyl Peroxide & Salicylic Acid 09-30-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski and Dr. James P. Gilligan 0 Comments The FDA recently issued a warning regarding topical acne products that may have dangerous side effects (copy and paste this URL into your browser to see the announcement: http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/C onsumerUpdates/ucm402441.htm ). We wanted to provide you with a place where you could get the facts in an easy to understand way. When it comes to our health, wellness or beauty, we deal with a significant number of choices regarding products that claim to be able to help us, or perhaps help us meet our personal goals. Considering how complex these decisions can be and how laborious the potential research may be, we often make our decisions based on assumptions instead of on thoroughly collected and analyzed information. One often held assumption for many consumers is the belief that products available without prescription that can be bought over the counter (also known as OTC products) are inherently safe - like most acne products - we\'ll get back to that in a moment. What most people don\'t know is that products such as Advil (ibuprofen) and Tylenol (acetaminophen) were originally available only as prescriptions before being approved as OTC products. Today, certainly consumers understand some of the cardiovascular safety and stomach concerns associated with Advil (NSAIDS/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) as well as the precautions of consuming alcohol with Tylenol. These particular issues had been rather thoroughly discussed in the media. Unfortunately, this is rather an exception not a norm as understanding over the counter products limitations that would allow consumers the ability to use these products safely does not apply to all products. Topical products are especially too often treated with a certain dose of carelessness. After all - they don\'t go inside of our bodies, right? Wrong! Topical products have the potential do us serious harm. For people with acne or acne prone skin, making assumptions about topical, over the counter products is a common occurrence and it may be unfortunately associated with certain unrecognized side effect risks. This is particularly true with respect to acne and oily skin products containing two ingredients: benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. Many consumers assume that topical acne products that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are also inherently safe. After all, these are two of the most common ingredients present in topical acne products. Once again assuming these products used alone or in combination are perfectly safe would be erroneous. In short, the new FDA warning alerts consumers that benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid have been reported to be associated with not so frequent but severe allergic reactions. The FDA warning was meant to alert consumers that the combination of benzoyl peroxide plus salicylic acid may be responsible for these severe side effects, that are mostly allergic reactions. Caution should be used when using either product alone or in combination to make certain an individual does not have such a serious allergic reaction or skin irritation. The key point the FDA is making to consumers is to be cautious and mindful when selecting and starting to use acne medications at large and topical acne products in particular. It is also important for consumers to understand that benzoyl peroxide alone or in combination with salicylic acid does not address the cause (etiologic factor) of acne but only the symptoms (pimples and comedones). The cause of acne is over active sebaceous glands which release too much sebum (skin oil) into the pores of the skin causing them to clog. Clogged pores can manifest themselves as white heads and black heads (comedones). If the clogged pores attract bacterial growth, the pores can become inflamed and the ""symptom"" is now acne pimples and pustules. The only FDA approved drug that addresses the cause of acne is Isotretinoin, but due to the multitude of side effects (some very serious) this drug is reserved for adults only and only for the most serious forms of acne. It is also accompanied by several warnings and the patient must sign a release form before actually receiving a prescription. Its branded form Accutane, which is actually off the market and a subject of Class Action Suite for the heath damages it has caused. We have that safe alternative; AcnEase® is an all-natural (all botanical) herbal medicine that works to reduce sebaceous gland secretions from the inside out. AcnEase® is distinct from topical products such as those containing benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid since the ingredients present in AcnEase prevent pimples from forming rather than simply addressing the symptoms. An added benefit of AcnEase is that it can be used by women and men of different ages (teens and adults), skin types and tones. AcnEase can also be combined with an existing well-tolerated acne improvement skincare and dietary regimen since it prevents new pimples and comedones from forming without interfering with hormones levels and other products.

"['5 Adult Acne Myths that You Need to Know About 05-18-2015 Dr Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Acne is something no adult wants to deal with. For reasons that are still being researched, people are struggling with acne well into there 40\'s and beyond. Acne can take a toll on us emotionally and physically, affecting so many different areas of our lives. Because of this, some people are desperate for any product or any information that can help them eliminate the problem quickly. The difficulty with this approach is that there is a disappointing amount of myths and misinformation about the subject available online. AcnEase users come to us with a multitude of questions about these myths, so in the spirit of setting the record straight, here is a look at five adult acne myths that don\'t withstand scrutiny. Acne is a teenage problem. The biggest myth about adult acne is that it doesn\'t exist! When we hear terms like ""pimples,"" ""zits,"" and ""blackheads"" it conjures up images of angsty and awkward teenagers. However, acne can strike at any age. It\'s true that people going through puberty are predisposed to developing acne because of the hormonal changes they\'re going through, but it\'s important to note that these changes can occur at any stage of life. When it comes to breakouts, androgen is the principal hormone to blame. While many people associate it with masculinity (since testosterone is a form of androgen), women produce this substance as well, albeit in smaller quantities. When the amount of androgen in the bloodstream increases relative to other hormones, this can send signals to your skin\'s sebaceous glands to produce more skin oil, known also as sebum. This excess sebum begins to clog your pores and creates an environment where acne-causing bacteria can thrive. Acne is caused by junk food. For years, researchers have attempted to examine the link between a person\'s diet and their risk of acne. On the one hand, there is some evidence that what you eat can affect your breakouts. For example, milk and other dairy products may negatively affect levels of hormones your body naturally produces. Additionally, there is evidence that excess sugar consumption can lead to skin inflammation-which shrinks your skin\'s pores and makes them more susceptible to clogging. That being said, the link between diet acne is not always that straightforward. If you have a slice of pizza and a bowl of ice cream for dinner one night and wake up with a new pimple the next morning, chances are your unhealthy meal isn\'t to blame. To understand how food affects acne, you have to look at the long-term-what you put into your body on a regular, extended basis. One moment of dietary weakness is not going to throw your skin\'s health into chaos. There are many foods that are known to help keep your body and skin healthy - but they will only assist, not be the driving force behind, truly treating acne. Sunscreen can actually cause acne. This is one myth that is one part truth, one part fiction. It\'s true, choosing the wrong sunscreen can actually make your problems worse. However, there are numerous products that shouldn\'t cause your breakouts to become more severe. It\'s all about avoiding the wrong ones . While the ""wrong"" sunscreen may vary from person to person, most adults find that their acne troubles increase when using chemical sunscreens. As the name implies, chemical sunscreens use chemicals to literally absorb the sun\'s UV rays. Sometimes the substances found in these products can irritate and inflame the skin, and as was already mentioned, inflammation shrinks pores and increases their risk for clogging. On the other hand, physical sunscreens use substances to actually reflect the sun\'s rays so that they cannot penetrate your skin. While it\'s possible for some people to experience an allergic reaction to these products, the risk of skin irritation is much lower. Unfortunately, most companies don\'t market their sunscreens as either chemical or physical. Instead, you\'ll need to take a look at the ingredients list. If you see things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, chances are you\'ve found a physical sunscreen. Conversely, chemical sunscreen ingredient lists will be much longer and contain substances like: Para aminobenzoic acid Octyl salicylate Avobenzone Oxybenzone Cinoxate Padimate Dioxybenzone Homosalate Phenylbenzimidazole Sulisobenzone Menthyl anthranilate Trolamine salicyclate Octocrylene Makeup is a no-go if you have acne. Some wear it every day, and some wear none at all. Unfortunately, some people with acne believe that it\'s off-limits to them because it can clog their pores. As with sunscreen, this is a myth that\'s actually partly true. Heavy, chemical-laden cosmetic products will definitely cause problems for your pores. You can reduce its effects by thoroughly washing it off at night, but that won\'t reverse the damage done during the day. However, there are lighter and more natural alternatives you can turn to. When choosing acne-friendly makeup, always look for products labelled as ""non-comedogenic."" This means that they have been specially designed to not clog your pores. Conversely, avoid products that contain the following ingredients, as they most likely will make your acne problems worse: Cocoa Butter Octyl Palmitate Isostearic Acid Myreth 3 Myristate Butyl Stearate Lanolin Acid Oleic Acid Isopropyl Isostearate Squalene Isopropyl Myristate Myristyl Myristate Acetylated Lanolin Oleyl Alcohol Keep in mind, that even if you\'re using non-comedogenic products, you still need to give your pores some time to breathe. Avoid wearing makeup when it\'s unnecessary (i.e. at home), and always thoroughly wash and cleanse your skin after use. Stress is a main cause of adult acne. Let\'s face it-life can be real tough at times. There is a lot of debate about the link between stress and acne, but the fact of the matter is, it\'s not likely that your stress is the primary cause. Sure, there is evidence showing that breakouts can worsen during trying times. However, it\'s not entirely known why this is. One hypothesis is that people neglect self-care during stressful events. If you\'ve got a million other things to worry about, taking care of your skin is likely to be cast aside. While this proves that there may be a link between the two, the primary cause of breakouts is not stress-instead, stress merely exacerbates a problem that was already there. That being said, cutting out unnecessary stress from your life is always a good thing (easier said than done at times, we know). While it may not eliminate your acne entirely, you could see some improvements.

"['Chronic Acne? 2 Ingredients that Can Make it Worse 03-14-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments For those with acne prone skin - especially with chronic acne (acne lasting 3 or more years, or re-occurrs over the years), what you put on your skin repeatedly and long term is very important. There are two chemical substances that can be found in most topical acne products that need to be used with caution - especially while used longer term to try to control chronic acne: Salicylic Acid and Alcohol . You want to know another secret? Neither of them actually treat acne. No topical ingredient can do it since acne is a manifestation of an internal imbalance that results in the overproduction of sebum (skin oil) by the sebaceous glands; an inflammation that is triggered by too much sebum mixed with dirt, dead cells and bacteria manifests itself as pimples, cysts and lesions. The only real way to treat acne is therefore from the inside out, and by rebalancing the sebaceous glands. Did you know? When you put these ingredients on your skin, your skin goes in to ""protection mode"" and ends up producing more oil, which is the exact opposite of what you want to happen! Why is Salicylic Acid No Good? Salicylic acid is a keratolytic. It belongs to the same class of drugs as asprin (salicylates), and it recently also graduated to the position of a skincare ""fad,"" especially for topical acne products. Almost every ""acne treatment"" or ""solution"", cleanser, toner and many ""anti-aging"" treatments contain salicylic acid. Salicylic acid works by increasing the amount of moisture in the skin and dissolving the substance that causes the skin cells to stick together. So it is exfoliating the skin, and can help to clean the pores off dead cells. Salicylic acid will NOT however get rid of acne CAUSES, as acne is a result of an over-production of sebum by your sebaceous glands. This sebum together with dirt, dead skin cells and, of course, bacteria will provide a basis for inflammation that manifests itself as pimples or cysts. Salicylic Acid Side Effects Frequent and long term use of salicylic acid may actually cause a number of side effects such as skin redness and irritation, dryness and premature aging, and even problems such as dizziness, headaches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Recently there are also some concerns voiced about pregnant women using products with salicylic acid. Medical professionals are split as to how much the use of salicylic acid can affect an unborn baby. Many health care professionals recommend that pregnant women stay away from any cosmetic products containing this chemical since it will get absorbed in to the bloodstream when used on the face and/or body. The Different Names of Alcohol - Good and Bad Alcohol appears in cosmetic products under a variety of names, and can actually penetrate the skin. The ""bad"" alcohols are those with low molecular weight. These include the following: Ethanol Ethyl alcohol Benzyl alcohol Denatured alcohol Isopropyl alcohol SD (specially denatured) alcohol (ex. SD Alcohol23-A, SD Alcohol-40 and CD Alcohol40-B .) They can not only be extremely drying, and irritating for the skin and cause sun sensitivity, but may be cytotoxic and have been suspected to cause contact dermatitis and possibly cancer. The following fatty alcohols are mostly ""good"" alcohols : Cetyl (derived from coconut oil) Stearyl (also a derivative of coconut oil and a firming agent) Cetearyl (emulsified wax) Reading Labels As in all other aspects of life, common sense is a good advisor when you choose products for your skin. Beware of guaranteed cures, miracle skin helpers and ""secret formulas."" Be an educated consumer and read the labels before you purchase ( the FDA requires that label ingredients are listed in the order of highest concentrations - meaning that the highest level of ingredients are listed first).

Apple Juice and Green Clay Revitalizing Mask Ingredients 2 apples or 3 tablespoons fresh apple juice 1 tablespoon wheat germ oil (available in any health food store or even some regular pharmacies) 2 tablespoons of green clay powder (available on Amazon or in any health food store) Method Before starting, sterilize in hot water any utensils used, and don't use metal bowls as they oxidize when in contact with the clay and fruit (it is fine to use a food processor with stainless steel blade). If making your own apple juice, place the apples in a juicer and extract 3 tablespoons. Combine the fruit and/or vegetables (in this case, juice) with the clay powder and a dash of water, cover it and leave to rest without stirring for approximately 20 minutes. Then, mix thoroughly to form a thick paste. If the clay mix is too thin add a little more clay powder. If lumps form, add a dash of water. Keep stirring until a smooth mixture is formed. Now stir in the wheat germ oil. Leave to rest for 30 minutes, and before applying, stir to make sure the paste is smooth. This mask can be used once or twice a week. Masks are best made and used on the same day; they don't have a good shelf life. To apply the mask Find a calm time when you are not rushed. Protect your hair with a towel or band and remove all makeup. Cleanse the skin with water. Steam your face for 1-2 minutes to open the pores (to do this, put hot water in a bowl, put a towel over your head and put your face over the bowl - be careful not to get too close, you don't want you to burn yourself!) Apply the mask evenly (avoiding the eyes) and leave it on for around 20 minutes. If the mask has more of a liquid consistency, apply using a cotton ball. A second layer can be applied after a few minutes. Lie down and relax - no talking! Keep your face relaxed! Wet the mask to soften the clay first, and then remove the mask with cotton pads or a cotton towel/wash cloth and luke-warm water. Then dry. Close the pores using a chamomile tea or rosewater.

"['Selecting the Right Acne Treatment for Your Skin 01-14-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Assessing what type of acne you have can be a difficult task. You want to make sure you get it right so the treatment actually does the trick! So how do you do this? You must be realistic and honest with yourself. It\'s not easy to admit that your problem is actually severe; on the other hand - when you\'re tired of breakouts, you can be overly harsh assessing your condition as severe when it really is mild or moderate. There is no health damage to take more AcnEase® than you need, but you also don\'t want to spend more than you need to; and ""under-dosing"" may result in not getting the full benefits of AcnEase® . Here is a short and simple guide to assess your acne: Mild Acne : Small number of small pimples usually appearing periodically on the face and forehead. Moderate Acne : Large number of inflamed pimples covering larger areas of the face and forehead. Moderate acne is usually more persistent and may be accompanied by blackheads and whiteheads. Severe Acne : Larger pimples and some cysts, many inflamed, covering larger areas of face. If your acne is persistent and chronic, even with a moderate number of breakouts, you may consider classifying it as severe. Body Acne : Pimples appear on the back and chest (may be a part of face acne or appear predominantly on the body). Many may be inflamed or larger, and often persistent. Why do you need different regimens for severe, moderate and mild acne, and how long do you have to take AcnEase for? The answer is rather simple. Since acne doesn\'t develop overnight, there is no overnight cure. So we recommend that you take AcnEase for atleast one month. It takes more of active plant based ingredients to help with a severe and chronic acne problem versus a mild problem, therefore choosing the right regimen is one of the golden keys to your success. With chronic and severe acne, we usually recommend a minimum 2-month treatment (sometimes it will take 3 months). Body acne requires a longer regimen too, and more active ingredients, so we developed a minimum 6-week program for it. Men will also take a higher dose than women since testosterone is a strong stimulator of the sebaceous glands and responsible for their overproduction of oil.

"[""Are your hormones causing your acne? 08-21-2013 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments In short, yes - most acne may be traced to fluctuations in hormone levels, especially androgens (male hormones also known as testosterone), and their power to over stimulate sebaceous glands. As acne results from inflammation caused by sebum clogged hair follicles (pores) and bacteria, ruling out the factors that cause over production of sebum is very important. Treatment will help your body to negotiate or even eliminate the hormonal imbalance. The Truth about Hormones A common misunderstanding is that men have testosterone and women have estrogen and progesterone; the truth is that both males and females have a balance of all three hormones. In fact, one of the most popular causes of hormonal acne in women is having high levels of androgens (male hormones). This type of acne is even called androgenal acne. Men also may have too much FREE testosterone or too much estrogen in their bodies. How do hormones influence acne? The primary cause of the formation of acne is a fluctuation in androgens (male hormones) and in particular testosterone, DHEAS (dihyroepiandrosterone sulfate) and DHT (dehydrotestosterone). Elevation in these hormones work as a force that can lead to over secretion by the sebaceous glands and the onset of acne formation. WOMEN In adult women, the fluctuation of hormone levels may occur both temporarily and for a long period of time. The mid-cycle of the menstrual cycle is often associated with the highest level of estrogen and androgens. After ovulation, progesterone levels increase which can also stimulate sebaceous gland secretions. Your emotional highs (happiness) and lows (stress) can also stimulate the hormones. Hormones are thought to be responsible for acne in a significant percentage of pregnant women during the third trimester when the sebaceous glands are over stimulated, causing oily skin and frequent breakouts. Coming off of oral contraceptives and the post pregnancy period are other times when hormones fluctuate, often leading to adult acne. Some women even experience acne after menopause, when estrogen levels begin to taper off and testosterone becomes the dominant hormone. Having higher than normal levels of androgens (male hormones) may also contribute to hormonal fluctuations. MEN Like the ladies, your hormones fluctuate from the highs and lows of life and are even stimulated by exercise and by your DNA as a man. This fact, coupled with the fact that men simply have more testosterone, means that male acne is harder to treat. On average, guys don't take care of their skin as well as their female counterparts and they also play more sports and sweat more, which may contribute to making male acne more severe, persistent and difficult to treat. Signs That Your Acne May Be Hormonally Induced WOMEN Adult onset acne, breakouts that appear for the first time in adults Acne flare-ups preceding or coinciding with your menstrual cycle or physical activities A history of irregular menstrual cycles (indicating hormonal fluctuations and possibly too many androgens) Increased facial oiliness (sebaceous gland over secretion) Hirsutism (excessive growth of hair, or hair in unusual places which is known to be induced by androgens) Elevated levels of certain androgens in the blood stream (which can be simply checked through a blood by your general physician) MEN Acne flare-ups preceding or coinciding with physical activities Adult onset acne, breakouts that appear for the first time in adults Increased facial oiliness (sebaceous gland over secretion) Hirsutism (excessive growth of hair, or hair in unusual places which is known to be induced by androgens) Elevated levels of certain androgens in the blood stream (which can be simply checked through a blood by your general physician) Treatment Options for Hormonal Acne For women with hormonal acne, one approach that is being prescribed quite often is oral contraceptives (OC) to modulate the endogenous levels of both female and male hormones. Unfortunately, this solution carries several side effects such as potential blood clots, high blood pressure and other potential problems accumulated over time (especially if birth control is used longer term). Obviously, the use of OC is not an option for men or teenagers. For women with androgen induced acne, an alternative approach is the use of Spironolactone (Aldactone®), which is routinely used as a potassium sparing diuretic by inhibiting water resorption in the kidneys. It just so happens that Spironolactone also inhibits aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland and is reported to have anti-androgen effects. Aldactone will only be effective if your acne is androgen induced, and may carry some longer term side effects. Guys face a more difficult situation (often combined with a need to alter their lifestyle and skincare), and are more often targeted with the highly toxic Isotretinoin (Accutane and generics), and broad spectrum antibiotics that carry their own potentially serious short and long term side effects. In addition, antibiotics only actually deal with selected symptoms of acne (they may limit growth of bacteria and inflammation) but do not eliminate real causes of acne. A Better Way for Women and Men AcnEase® is a natural, clinically tested Botanical Therapeutic® acne treatment that can be customized for all types of acne, and prevents acne from coming. Not to mention, we have 751,213 success stories to back us up. As an all-botanical natural medicine, AcnEase ® specifically inhibits the impact of fluctuating hormone levels on sebaceous gland secretions. AcnEase ® does not affect hormone levels per se, but rather modulates their effect on sebaceous gland secretions . This mechanism of action helps explain why AcnEase® is equally effective in treating adolescent and adult acne in both men and women. Cystic acne in women is often associated with increased levels of androgens. AcnEase ® has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of women with cystic acne further supporting the product's ability to inhibit hormonal influence on sebaceous gland excess production of sebum. AcnEase ® is the safe alternative for women that stop taking OC in order to start their families, and experience acne flare-ups. AcnEase has also been recommended for women that have recently had children or those who breastfeed and are experiencing changes in their skin with periodic acne. For men , AcnEase® helps the body to balance free testosterone and to heal and PREVENT both facial acne (including cystic acne), and body and back acne (which are both quite prevailing and severe in males). Most importantly, AcnEase is safe ; and by addressing the causes of acne, it prevents future outbreaks, allowing your skin time to clear and begin the healing process for skin scars and acne marks. It has NO phytoestrogens (estrogen like plant extracts), and is gluten free and chemical free. Don't know what type of acne you have?

"['4 Festive Makeup Tips That Will Transform Your Look and Reduce Acne Breakouts 12-27-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments It\'s natural to want to spice up your look for new year\'s, but it\'s important that you do it in a way that will not make your acne worse or impede the healing effects of your acne treatment. 1. The basics Both women and men should look for non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging) foundations and concealers if they want to cover up their acne or any marks and scars. Make sure your makeup does not contain any of the following comedogenic oils: Cocoa Butter Octyl Palmitate Isostearic Acid Myreth 3 Myristate Butyl Stearate Lanolin Acid Oleic Acid Isopropyl Isostearate Squalene Isopropyl Myristate Myristyl Myristate Acetylated Lanolin Oleyl Alcohol 2. Add color, enjoy sparkle A fun thing you can do to make your usual makeup more festive is to add unexpected bursts of color. or sparkle. Apply that red lipstick you\'ve been wanting to try, or go with a different shade of blush. Finally, add a sprinkle of gold or silver dust on your lids, apples of your cheeks or de\'collete\'. 3. Look at those eyes! Nowadays you can change even your eye color with colored contact lenses, but you can surprise people and accentuate your eyes in a much simpler way simply using makeup. Have you ever experimented with your eye liner? Simply thickening the line and adding some mascara can really change up your look. Have you been wishing you could get the cat-eye or smokey-eye look but don\'t know how to do it? There are hundreds of free tutorials online from beauty bloggers who love experimenting with makeup and want to show you how to do it too. Give these different eye looks a try, but remember that you\'ll probably need some practice to get it right, so maybe try it out a few days before your ""debut."" 4. Last but not least: Cleansing So you rocked your new look all day and all evening, but now it\'s time to wash it off. Always remove your makeup and clean your face and neck (and de\'colletage if you use makeup there). Clean your skin thoroughly before you go to bed but DO NOT over-dry or injure it in the process. Forgetting this step can have very negative effects on your skin.But over-drying your skin with too-harsh cleansers or creating small abrasions that open the skin for additional infection is also very bad for your skin health. So use non-comedogenic, mild cleanser, avoid hot water or scrubs, use herbal non-alcoholic toners ( chamomile astringent ) and light moisturizer. Bonus tip: Make sure you\'re washing your pillow case regularly in hot water to prevent the buildup of bacteria. The same applies to your cell phone. Of course, you will use antibacterial wipes on your phone, not hot water. Your face may be super clean, but if your pillow case or your phone is covered in grime, oil and bacteria, you\'re truly sabotaging your clean skin! Enjoy the big night!

"[""How to Save Your Skin by Reducing Your Sugar Consumption 10-30-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments For those who have food allergies, know someone with them and/or don't want to give out candy this year: paint a pumpkin teal, and put it on your doorstep this Halloween. Why? The Teal Pumpkin Project is a public awareness campaign designed by FoodAllergy.org to raise awareness of food allergies by providing non-food treats for trick-or-treaters. Halloween time is here, and in addition to fun costumes and scary movies, it means lots and lots of candy! While there's nothing wrong with getting in the holiday spirit and indulging in a few sweet treats, lots of excess sugar can be a real terror on your skin. So, before you reach for a handful of candy corn or another mini candy bar, take a look at some of the facts on sugar and how you can keep your Halloween sweet but acne free. How can sugar affect the skin? In large quantities, sugar can damage your skin in two primary ways - inflammation and eventually, glycation . Inflammation leaves your skin feeling swollen, looking red, and prone to new acne breakouts. This condition shrinks your pores (due to swelling) and makes your skin generally more sensitive to irritants, and these are both things that can spur on a breakout. Additionally, when sugar is digested, its molecules attach themselves to the collagen and elastin molecules in your skin. When this process, known as glycation, occurs, your skin's cells become stiff and malformed - and this leads not only to an increased risk of breakouts but also poor skin health in general, including wrinkles and loss of skin elasticity. Here are some of our general tips on sugar intake: Learn to check labels: When purchasing candy for the holidays, always take a look at the label before you buy. Most candy includes GMO's and has high sugar content. We get it - you look forward to those peanut butter cups and candy bars all year long. So if you have to indulge, atleast check the sugar content (which may sway your decision!). Find good substitutes: Visit a local organic market to search for candy that is lower in sugar content, and have an associate help you to choose something without scary ingredients. If you can't pronounce an ingredient, most likely, it's not good for you. If you're thinking, well, maybe I'll just find a sugar-free candy ...think again. The sugar in these treats has to be replaced with something, and most of the time it's replaced with artificial sweeteners, which are in general no good for your body. Know your sugar limits: Many different organizations have established recommendations for how much sugar a person should have each day, and while these figures have some variation, they are generally around the same amount. Most experts recommend no more than 37.5 grams per day for men and 25 grams per day for women. And for kids, depending on their age, this number is even lower at between 12-16 grams. Don't be fooled by fruit: While fruit might seem like a healthy alternative to all the processed treats of the season, too much of a good thing can still be dangerous . Naturally occurring glucose, like that found in fruit, should still be factored into your daily intake amount. While fruit is an important part of a healthy diet, limit yourself to 3, ½ cup servings each day. It's true that too much sugar can cause damage to your skin and overall health, but if you keep your sweet tooth in check most of the year and only splurge on special occasions like Halloween, you're doing ok. Don't let your fear of sugar spook you out of enjoying life! Have a fun and safe Halloween...

"[""AcnEase: The Facts Behind an Acne Solution with 96% User Success 09-19-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Overnight spot treatments, age-defying serums, pore-reducing tonics - In such a consumer-driven culture, it isn’t uncommon to witness claims that promise nothing short of a miracle to eliminate your acne. Designed to encourage buyers to pluck a product off the shelf in an instant, many of these topical treatments are wrapped in packaging ripe with buzzwords, to instill a sense of trust, wonder and hope that this magic bottle might possibly be the answer to their problems! Additionally, many products are designed for teens so it’s impossible to decipher how to treat adult acne in a world full of teen acne products . While some of these solutions may provide temporary relief to your skin, unless the true cause of acne is targeted, it’s only a matter of time until symptoms resurface. One product goes deep to address the problem at its source. What is AcnEase? To put it simply, AcnEase is a systemic solution to treating acne. A blend of the highest quality herbal extracts, AcnEase works to eliminate acne early on in the acne cascade cycle (read: before it reaches your skin!). Both safe and effective, this clinically tested product provides an alternative way for individuals suffering from acne to treat their condition, offering long term solution versus topical products which can provide short term results. AcnEase is gluten-free, dairy free, phytoestrogens-free, animal by-products-free, and chemical and GMO-free. The mission behind AcnEase is a pure and simple one: to bring the healing power of plants into the mainstream of medicinal science. As experts in the field of skincare and acne treatment, we rely on this marriage of Traditional Chinese homeopathy and Western medicine to deliver a solution to anyone looking for real results, without the side effects. How Can AcnEase Help Treat Acne? The herbal ingredients found in AcnEase work synergistically to restore the internal physiologic balance that is disrupted by endocrine changes, mental tension, stress and diet. Acne is actually a visible or external manifestation of an internal disorder. Usually triggered by a hormonal imbalance, acne is caused by an overproduction of sebum by the sebaceous glands. Travelling along the hair follicles, or pores, to hydrate and protect the surface of the skin, this excess sebum tends to clog pores, which then accumulate dead skin cells and bacteria . Once the body sends in white blood cells to attack this bacterial “infection,” this response becomes visible on the surface of the skin as whiteheads, blackheads (comedones,) cysts and pimples. AcnEase works to decrease this excess sebum production by creating a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, thereby decreasing oily skin, and reducing the number of comedones and pimples seen on the surface of the skin. AcnEase is therefore unique in that it addresses the cause of acne and skin related problems, and because it does not affect the hormones directly, comes with no side effects, making it safe for anyone to take at any time. What People are Saying About AcnEase If you’re unsure about the claims that an herbal medicine can effectively treat your acne, we totally understand that. After all, if you’ve struggled with acne for any amount of time, you’ve probably already spent a small fortune and countless hours trying every treatment solution under the sun, which is why we’re here to deliver the facts. In addition to being the only non-prescription acne solution to prevent acne before it starts, AcnEase has received the highest award for clinical efficacy in China, successfully improving acne in more than 95% of patients in controlled clinical studies. Today AcnEase is manufactured in the USA under current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), satisfying the highest standards for manufacturing of herbal-based medicines. Experiential data collected from thousands of customers indicates over a 96% satisfaction rate, making it both a safe and effective way to treat acne. The third party reviews online speak for themselves too. Dr. Christian Jessen (the Dr. Oz of the UK) endorses AcnEase and Cosmopolitan France even chose it recently as a top beauty pick. Aside from clear skin, the appeal of AcnEase lies in the fact that it makes treating acne as easy as ever. With several treatments specifically designed with the severity of your acne in mind , AcnEase delivers a pre-measured dose in an easy to swallow pill, doing the work for you while you go about your busy day. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, AcnEase may produce noticeable results within 1-2 weeks. To achieve general improvement in cysts, whiteheads, blackheads, or pimples, the standard 1-month of treatment must be completed. (*For individuals whose acne is chronic, and was resistant to standard Western medical treatment, an increased dose and duration may be necessary.) You can read about some of our AcnEase success stories to get a better idea of what to expect with this systemic treatment. When it comes to acne treatments, AcnEase does what most acne treatments fail to address: it targets the problem from within, while maintaining a safe experience at every measure, unlike many prescription options, such as Accutane (which is currently off the market due to a class action suit). We’ve combined our expert knowledge with a love for safe, herbal alternative medicines to deliver a truly effective solution to acne, without the side effects. Despite the changes you’ll see on your skin, when it comes to AcnEase, it’s not a miracle, it’s just science! We want to hear from you! Are you an AcnEase user happy with your results?

"[""What Exactly is Sebum? 05-25-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments If you have acne, and have read up on its causes, you will find yourself coming across the word “sebum” quite a bit. We know that too much of it can lead to acne breakouts , but what exactly is sebum? Sebum is an oily substance produced by the sebaceous glands. Our skin needs it in order to function, but too much of it can lead to acne, and an overly oily complexion . Other than the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, sebaceous glands can be found all over the body. They are prominent on the face, especially the forehead and chin, as well as the back. These glands can be directly affected by hormones such as testosterone or adrenaline, and have a close working relationship with the hair follicles, or pores, of the body. These follicles begin underneath the surface of the skin, and reach the outer layer. One end of the follicle meets any of the thousands of sebaceous glands found under the skin, and those glands use the follicle to deliver sebum to the surface of the skin. Despite what you may think, sebum is actually good for your skin, and plays an important role in keeping it healthy. Sebum essentially works like a waterproof shield once it reaches the surface of the skin, keeping too much water from getting in, while trapping and preventing necessary moisture from getting out. It is able to create this protective barrier because it is made up of fats, or lipids, which do not dissolve in water. The skin cannot function without sebum, and too little of it can result in dry or even cracked skin. Like anything, too much sebum is never a good thing. When the sebaceous glands begin to overproduce this oily substance, the pores used to deliver sebum to the surface of the skin can become clogged, as there is simply too much being produced to ensure a smooth flow. The combination of this excess sebum under the surface and dead skin cells on top of the surface can meet in the skin’s pores, clogging them, and causing bacteria to grow inside. The body then reacts to the foreign bacteria, sending in white blood cells to attack it. At this point, nothing can be done to prevent the breakout as the body’s natural defenses have already kicked in. The result is an inflammation around that area of the skin, usually seen in the form of pustules or papules (pimples.) For those with severe or chronic acne, the inflammation can spread to surrounding skin tissue and form cysts . Most people think that washing away excess oil can prevent breakouts, but washing will only temporarily improve the surface of the skin. For those with the condition of acne, no amount of washing will suffice, as washing does nothing to affect the production of sebum, which occurs underneath the skin’s surface. Since the sebaceous glands are responsible for the production of acne, targeting them directly is the only way to prevent new acne breakouts from forming . Just as you wouldn’t simply wash your car to repair engine trouble, the work must be done from within – our AcnEase® users know that all too well! Acting as a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, AcnEase® is a systemic solution that stops acne where it starts: at the production of sebum. Because sebum is necessary, simply eliminating the problem is not an option. Returning sebum production to what is known as a “normal” rate is the only matter of defense. We need just enough to keep the skin healthy and moisturized, but not so much that our pores become clogged, leaving us with breakouts. Using all-natural botanical ingredients, AcnEase® is safe for use by everyone regardless of age, sex, or wherever they are in their hormonal cycle, be it puberty or PMS. Treating existing acne while working from within to address the real problem, AcnEase® is the only product that prevents new pimples from forming. When it comes to sebum, balance is key, and making AcnEase® a part of your skincare routine will make that balancing act much less tricky. We want to hear from you!

"['Are Freshly Made Fruit & Veggie Juices Beneficial for Acne-Prone Skin? 01-18-2014 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Lots of people are drinking fruit and vegetable juices these days that they actually extract themselves to be sure they get the freshest ingredients. So you might be wondering, how beneficial is it for the health of acne-prone skin? Is it the right option for me? 1. What goes into your juicer makes a difference Some of the fruits and vegetables that you\'ll find at your local markets can actually help to heal, cleanse and nourish your skin from within. However, you don\'t want to get too excited and start throwing any fruit or vegetable you can find into your juicer. Some fruits may be better for your acne-prone skin than others. For example, if you have found in the past that you don\'t handle apples well, then you probably shouldn\'t throw them into the mix: juicing fruits or vegetables that aren\'t right for YOUR BODY won\'t magically make them good for you. So stick to the foods you know you can handle, and if you can, work in as many vitamin-packed, acne-friendly , organic fruits and veggies as you can. Here are few ideas to get you started: Avocados are a great source of vitamin E. Oranges, strawberries, grapes, cantaloupe, kiwi, lemon, broccoli, bell peppers and spinach are good sources of vitamin C. But if you are taking blood thinners, beware, as some substances included in avocado (salicylates) actually work as potent blood thinners and can increase the possibility of bleeding. Other veggies with similar characteristics are cabbage and brussel sprouts. Leafy greens, carrots, and pumpkin are full of vitamin A. Dark leafy vegetables like kale, mustard greens, broccoli, as well as citrus fruits supply a healthy amount of folate. Strawberries, blueberries and blackberries have catechins that protect skin from UVA rays. 2. Too much of a good thing is still too much Try not to go overboard when you\'re tossing things into your juicer, especially with the fruits. In juicing, as in most other aspects of life, moderation is key. Fruit and vegetable juice is of course a nutritious source of vitamins and minerals, but it\'s also full of sugar. Even if it\'s naturally occurring, "" good sugar ,"" too much sugar may still exacerbate acne. For example, citrus fruits are a good source of vitamin C, but they are also rich in sugar, and the acid may erode tooth enamel. Grapefruit, in particular, can increase or block the action of a number of medications, especially those related to heart issues, so it must be consumed very carefully. Try our Melon Skin Refresher to get an idea of how to juice in moderation, and let us know what you think! Melon Skin Refresher The combination of fruits in this juice is good for calming inflammation and moistening the tissues. Parsley is also rich in nutrients (especially iron) to bring a healthy glow to a pale complexion. Ingredients: ½ honeydew melon 6 grapes ¼ cucumber 1 sprig parsley Directions: Combine all ingredients together in the juicer and process. Drink the juice immediately after making (the nutrients are most effective and potent at this point, so don\'t let it sit around). 3. Remember the big picture If you juice all your daily servings of fruits and veggies, you\'re likely drinking them down in just a few minutes, whereas you would normally have to chew them and take much longer to get the same amount of nutrients. Chewing is an important part of digestion, so keep that in mind when deciding whether or not to juice. Bonus tip: If you don\'t have a juicer, try using a blender. You may get a more smoothie-like consistency, but you\'ll love the drink just the same, and you may get more nutrients since you\'ll likely consume more fiber and vitamin-rich peels. It\'s important to remember that although juicing or blending may be incorporated into a healthy, acne-friendly diet to act as a natural skin healer by healing the skin from within, it will not miraculously cure your acne. It will, however, only help you to succeed with your AcnEase regimen! With a Promise of Clear Skin, Dr. A Comments Add New Mindy Benkert I enjoy green smoothies as I don\'t own a juicer right now.

"['How to Win the Battle with Cystic Acne and Prevent Acne Scars 06-17-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Acne pimples start to develop in pores that become clogged with excess sebum (skin oil) made by the sebaceous glands. How serious your acne problem is depends both on the length/persistence of acne breakouts over the years and how serious the inflammation is that manifests into different types of breakouts (from whiteheads to serious cysts and lesions). If you suffer from acne for two or more years, you have chronic acne. The most serious form of acne is cystic acne that forms when the pores become clogged with sebum mixed with dead skins cells that normally rise to the surface of the skin to be sloughed off and get trapped in the pore. Bacteria also get trapped in this mix and as the body attempts to kill the bacteria using its immune system, you get a local inflammatory response due to cytokines, chemokines and white blood cells entering the area. Normally the pore is encased by the cells in the lower layers of the skin, but in the case of cysts this inflammation spreads under the top layer of the skin. This influx of cells and proteins causes swelling (bumps under the skin) and can be both very painful and very harmful to your skin. If you try to squeeze these bumps you induce more skin damage, which recruits more immune cells into the area and starts a vicious cycle, which ends up damaging skin and leaving acne scars and marks. The Combination Approach to Treating Cystic Acne To treat cystic acne you need both serious treatment and serious patience and perseverance so you actually get rid of it before major and long-term damage to your skin becomes extensive. The best approach to treat cystic acne is a combination approach that includes a solid acne treatment that prevents new cysts from forming and is actually taken regularly to secure a steady supply of active acne fighting ingredients to your body, and an adjunct skincare routine that ensures you do not further clog pores with inappropriate topical products, nor apply agents which irritate your skin further causing an inflammatory reaction. Please note that your skin is a ""smart organ"" and when under attack with over-drying or comedogenic products, it will indeed respond by protecting itself by producing more skin oil (sebum). Cysts take the longest time to treat, therefore you may need patience and perseverance to stop them from coming. For example you may need to take AcnEase® for longer than the standard 1- month. AcnEase® will prevent more sebum from forming but your body needs to heal from the damaged skin tissue. By preventing more pimples from forming with AcnEase® you can achieve this goal. 4 Do\'s and Don\'ts to Fight Cystic Acne 1. Treating Cystic acne is the most serious type of acne, which needs a serious approach. Use combination therapy by adopting an internal treatment (only internal products can treat internal causes of acne), and topical adjuncts (helpers) and even topical antibiotics for a comprehensive approach. Some recommendations for topical spot treatment are using witch hazel on a q-tip on the larger pimples - after this, dab the same cysts with Neosporin using a q-tip (use this brand, not others) - do not put this all over your face - use it sparingly and on the largest cysts only. Avoid changing products and treatments too fast and trusting ""miracle cures"". Cystic acne requires time to treat. 2. Cleaning By cleaning your skin smartly, it will thank you! Use mild cleansers (without alcohol, salicylic acid or other oil striping agents), not harsh cleansers Avoid hot water and scrubbing. Remember that over-dried skin will protect itself by producing MORE oil, not less. Try a chamomile astringent twice a day and a non-comedogenic moisturizer after washing. Exfoliate CAREFULLY once a week to remove dead skin but not to injure the skin further and open ""the door"" to bacteria. Opt for mild enzyme based exfoliations with papaya or alpha hydroxy based masks that will dissolve dead skin cells instead - nothing with granulates that may cause micro-abrasions. 3. Protect & Moisturize Use moisturizer and sun protection daily. It is a BAD MYTH that acne prone skin does need them. Furthermore, when you have cystic acne you have inflammation. You want to sooth your skin with water based, non-comedogenic moisturizer and protect it against additional inflammation that may be caused by sun radiation. Always chose sun protection with atleast a level of 6% or higher of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. 4. Be Consistent and Patient Treating acne (especially chronic/cystic acne) often requires changing your lifestyle to support healthy skin, not only the treatment of pimples. Find the treatment that appeals to your life philosophy and remember that even prescription is not a guarantee of effectiveness or safety (examples include Accutane, antibiotics, oral contraceptives). And also remember, if it sounds too good, it usually is too good to be true. Beware of ""over night"" treatments for cystic acne (and acne for this matter) as they do not exist. Everything of value requires commitment and effort. This includes blemish free, beautiful skin.

"[""A Quick Guide to Managing Oily Skin 05-12-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments We all like to shine…. but not on our faces. So we often ask, WHY is my skin oily and WHAT can I do about it? The oil you see on your face is called sebum. Produced by the sebaceous glands, sebum is actually a good thing, and is a necessary part of maintaining healthy skin. Sebum travels from the sebaceous glands to the surface through the pores to hydrate, moisturize, and protect the various layers that make up the skin. The face tends to be the oiliest part of the body as that’s where the majority of the sebaceous glands are located, anywhere from 2,500 to 5,500 per square inch! Naturally, oily skin can be attributed to pore size , with some medical sources believing that larger pores can indicate a larger oil-producing gland. Other factors can contribute to the overproduction of sebum as well, such as over-washing or tanning, which tends to dry-out the skin, triggering the glands to create more oil to replace what was just stripped away. Ultimately, the production of excess sebum comes down to a hormonal imbalance, which can trigger these glands to produce more oil. This can result in acne symptoms, as too much sebum can become trapped within the pore, leading to breakouts. (*Note to AcnEase® users: You’re in luck! AcnEase® works as a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, ensuring that the oil being produced is only enough to properly hydrate the skin.) 5 Steps to Manage Your Oily Skin When it comes to oily skin, there are some actions you can take to keep the problem of excessive oiliness at a manageable level. Blotting For a lot of women with oily skin, a shiny t-zone, nose and chin can serve as a constant source of aggravation. Most reach for their compact to erase shine with a powder. However, applying a layer of makeup to an oily complexion doesn’t actually rid the skin of oil, and can potentially lead to clogged pores. Pressing a sheet of blotting paper onto shiny areas of the face will properly absorb oil in a pinch. Don’t have blotting papers in your purse? A single ply of any napkin will do the trick as well, and won’t cost you a thing! Cleansing Keeping the surface of your skin clean is essential, but can be tricky when it comes to oily skin. Many people immediately want to scrub the shine away until they’re left with a squeaky-clean complexion, but this can actually trigger the production of even more sebum in an effort to hydrate, which can lead to more oil, or even acne. Anything labeled “acne-fighting” is typically good for treating oily skin, so cleansers using ingredients such as salicylic or glycolic acid or benzoyl peroxide can help zap oil as a temporary quick-fix. It’s important to find a solution that works for you, as many of these harsh chemicals can irritate your skin. Washing your face with a gentle, foaming cleanser morning and night will usually suffice Masks It is rare to find someone with just dry or just oily skin. Most people actually have combination complexions, with dry areas, usually on the sides of the cheeks and along the jaws, as well as oily areas, typically around the forehead, nose and chin. While applying an oil absorbing clay or charcoal mask can draw impurities from the pores, as well as dry out excess oil on the surface, it’s important to remember only to apply to these oily areas, as a clay mask on dry skin can result in irritation, flaky skin, or once again, the overproduction of sebum. Check out these DIY herbal masks and remedies for oily skin. Moisturizers Many people with oily skin think that moisturizers will only contribute to the problem, but keeping the surface of the skin hydrated is an important part of maintaining healthy skin function. An oil-free moisturizer applied to clean skin can help ensure skin is meeting its potential, looking and feeling it’s best! Treating Oily Skin with AcnEase® All of the above topical solutions are a great way to zap oil that’s already made its way onto the surface of the skin. Keeping your complexion clean and free of excess oil, dirt and debris is a very important part of remaining acne-free. However, none of these tricks will actually address the problem, which is the overproduction of oil created by the sebaceous glands, except a systemic regimen like AcnEase ®. Working as a buffer between hormones and the sebaceous glands, AcnEase® ensures that only enough sebum needed to keep skin healthy and hydrated is making its way through your pores. Regardless of your skin type, it’s important to love your skin! As a consolation, research reveals that oily skin is the best protection against aging, sagging and wrinkles. We want to hear from you!

"['The Scoop on Sugar: Acne-Friendly Sugar Substitutes 12-09-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments If you have acne, you\'ve likely been told to stay away from sugar, and you\'ve likely been confused. Does that mean you can\'t even have fruit? That you should consume sugar substitutes? That you can\'t make any of your favorite recipes this holiday season? Allow us to help you clear the confusion in time for your next holiday party. First, check out your refrigerator. Any mayo or Canadian bacon or soda in there? Now check your pantry. Is it full of cookies and other packaged goodies? Yes? Then it\'s full of sugar, too-and probably not the good kind. The sad truth is that sugar can be found in almost every food these days. When you combine all this sugar with foods that easily and rapidly convert into sugar like potatoes, pasta, crackers and potato chips, your skin may suffer the consequences. What can sugar do to my skin? Sugar can cause two major types of damage to your skin: 1. Inflammation , which may affect your organs, including your skin, of course! 2. Glycation, which is a chemical reaction similar to the one that occurs when you fry meat. Collagen (a building block of the skin) deteriorates, and as a result your skin loses its elasticity and brightness. To put it simply, your skin ages! Not all sugars are created equal. Bad sugars : ""Bad"" sugars are those that are processed, refined, void of nutrients, and have a high glycemic index, which means they rapidly break down into glucose and result in insulin spikes. These are sugars like table sugar and the typical brown sugar (not to be confused with raw sugar that is brown in color) that have more calories, zero nutrients and may even contain harmful remnants of substances that are used in the refining process. Sugar substitutes are no better. Alternative sweeteners such as Splenda have numerous side effects-even if they\'ve been approved by the FDA. The list of bad sugars also includes simple carbohydrate foods like pizza, jelly, white bread, candy, anything fried, ice cream, fruit juice, soda and most packaged foods. These products may not even say ""sugar"" on the label. Sugar often wears the disguise of corn syrup (or any word that ends with ""syrup""), fructose, lactose (or any word that ends in ""ose""), fruit juice concentrate, sorbitol or xylitol. Good sugars : ""Good"" sugars are ones that are unrefined or rather less refined; still contain nutrients such as phosphorus, calcium, iron, magnesium, & potassium; and have a relatively lower glycemic index, which means they take longer to break down into glucose and do not result in big insulin spikes. Stick with sweeteners like organic coconut palm sugar, birch tree extract, date sugar, raisins, honey, natural unsweetened applesauce and unsweetened cocoa powder. Good, unprocessed sugars can also be found in fruits and vegetables, which are full of nutrients. So how can I eat sugar without harming my skin? Too much of ANY sugar may harm your skin and your body. Choose good sugars and eat food containing these sugars in moderation. If you\'re currently eating a lot of sugar every day, you need to decrease your intake. Here are some tips on how to do that this holiday season: Be an educated consumer. Read the labels at stores (keep an eye on your inbox for an upcoming post about how to read those labels) and ask your waitress what is in the food you\'re about to eat. Pay attention to the sugar content but also the carb content. Go for complex carbs with a low glycemic index like vegetables, whole grains, and fruits such as berries, which have less sugar. Figure out which foods contain carbs that have a high glycemic index and try to avoid them or at least limit them. See www.glycemicindex.com for this information. Eat other foods that will help lessen the effects of sugar on your body. Fiber slows the absorption of sugar and will also keep you fuller longer. Choose foods to eat that have a higher concentration of fiber such as nuts, almonds, beans, flax or sesame seeds and bran. Antioxidants and proteins, when eaten before carbs or sugar-filled products, prevent the rapid increase in sugar level in your blood, prevent excessive food cravings, can help you lose weight and will keep your body younger-looking and less prone to inflammation. Eat before you go to that holiday party. Fill up on something nutritious so you won\'t be so tempted to stuff down baked goods. Try a spoonful of natural, low-fat cottage cheese, a hard-boiled egg, or 2-3 slices of home-baked turkey breast. And remember-eating the right sugars might help reduce inflammation, but it won\'t treat your acne. The key to breaking the acne cycle is getting to the root of the problem and treating from the inside .

"[""How to Shrink Large Pores & Live with a Clear Complexion 02-01-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The size of large pores may be a source of aggravation or obsession for those that deal with them on a daily basis. Hard to conceal and often associated with oily skin , the frustrations that come with large pores are more than cosmetic. In fact, large pores and the amount of breakouts that appear on the skin are more related than you may realize. Oily skin: the culprit Naturally oily skin tends to come with larger pore size. Some medical sources believe that a larger pore is in an indication of a larger oil-producing gland, which results in skin that may be more oily than normal. Much of the overproduction of oil can be attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which leads the sebaceous glands to create more sebum, the oily substance that runs along the hair follicle to moisturize skin. When sebum is produced in large amounts, it can clog pores. When combined with dirt, dead skin or other debris, bacteria is created in the pores and can lead to an infection that manifests as acne symptoms such as pimples. Despite claims from countless beauty and skincare companies offering topical solutions, you cannot actually “shrink” your pores as they do not open and close. Pores are necessary for skin to function in a healthy manner. Allowing for the body to flush out toxins, regulate body temperature, and even moisturize dry skin, pores are not all bad, despite the headache they may bring about for those with acne-prone skin. The best thing you can do for pores is keep them clean of dirt, makeup and debris by cleansing the surface of the skin, while keeping the amount of oil produced by sebaceous glands at a normal rate, which can only be addressed internally. (Note to AcnEase ® Users: Your pores have already decreased in size even if you have recently started your treatment, but please continue to heed this advice – it will only make your results that much better). Think CTM! [Cleansing – Treating – Moisturizing] Although not a permanent solution, keeping the surface of the skin clean can go a long way in terms of keeping pores open and unclogged, and is a good practice to keep for overall good skincare. Cleansing. Clean pores are due in part to clean skin, so using a gentle cleanser day and night, and after sweating, to reduce oily build-up, can keep unwanted irritants away from pores. However, cleansing alone will not keep pores clean, as the overproduction of sebum, or oil, meets dirt and dead skin in the pore from within, leading to acne symptoms such as pimples. Remember to choose a non-comedogenic cleanser (preferably without parabens or phthalates). Treating. Some people reach for topicals containing acne-fighting ingredients such as salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide or even retinol to slough away any bacteria or dead skin that might clog pores. While treating skin from the outside can provide a temporary solution, long-term goals can be reached with an internal solution that targets acne at it’s source, working as a buffer between hormones and sebaceous glands to moderate the impact of hormones on sebum production (which is what AcnEase ® does). Because pore size and oiliness are so closely related, real results can be witnessed when we treat one to control the other. Moisturizing. Over-washing or over-exfoliating can irritate the skin, and even result in more oil production to calm the irritation which will only exacerbate the problem, making it important to treat the skin to some moisture after cleansing. When we implement a systemic solution into our skincare routine, the production of oil, or sebum, is targeted at its source before it has a chance to clog pores, giving our skin it’s best shot at remaining acne-free. Let’s Face the Facts [pun intended] Having larger pores does not necessarily guarantee that you will have acne, but treating and managing oil production can affect their appearance in terms of size. Pores tend to appear larger among oily skin as the skin around pores can become swollen when oil and dirt collect on the skin’s surface. Regardless of how much we wash, the production of oil will remain the same, as no topical solution can actually affect the productivity of the sebaceous glands. This is why cleansing alone will not actually solve the problem. In order to experience real results in the reduction of acne symptoms among those with larger pores, the oil production must be targeted from within, in conjunction with keeping a clean surface on the outside. Note to AcnEase ® users: We hear from many of you about how you’ve had success with shrinking your pores, so please feel free to share with those here!

"[""5 Golden rules of Acne covering Make-Up 10-02-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments “Your make-up is worsening the condition of your skin!”, Do not use make -up if you have acne!. These statements are pretty common …. Are they really true? Read on. Beauty (and clear and beautiful complexion is certainly considered an important component of the beauty is of importance to many women, and a lot of effort, time and of course money is invested into achieving flawless looking skin. What many may not know- is that as you can use make-up to cover skin imperfection the very same products that are used to mask those flows ( like pimples or acne scars and marks) if not chosen carefully can also go against a desired effect and actually exasperate the very condition that they should camouflage. Using the wrong makeup or following bad skincare habits could actually accentuate the pimples you are trying so hard to hide. But we are not without a solution. This negative impact can be changed by understanding what’s going on with your skin, reading product labels, choosing righ typeof make-up products and correcting bad makeup habits. Let’s begin! 1. - Read the Labels! Many women visit beauty stores unprepared of what to look for and eventually purchase a product that can ruin a perfect date. On your next visit, take the time to carefully check for products that say paraben-free, sulfate free, oil-free or non-comedogenic. This is a good sign for acne prone skin as these ingredients are likely to clog pores, which can cause acne or irritate it much more. Avoid using anything that contains isopropyl isostearate, isopropyl myristate, myristyl myristate, lanolin oil, coconut butter or lauric acid. If your skin seems sensitive to oils, try silicone-based makeup instead. 2. - Concealer. After laying the foundation, concealers are the answers to ensuring red spots, acne scars and dark circles under your eyes are less visible or even disappear. If you have a pimple or red marks, which is often the case when one has acne, choose a green base. Peach, tangerine, and deeper orange shades neutralize acne scars well. Color correction makeup is advised to cover acne scars and other discoloration. This is a longtime makeup artist secret for film and photo shoot that’s turned into a huge beauty trend. It’s based on the concept of using contrasting hues to “cancel out” discoloration caused by acne, scars, blemishes, birthmarks, and other pigmentation issues. 3. Less is Better! Too much makeup can do more bad than good. Applying think layer of makeup on the skin you draw attention to the bumps, even they are covered. Always begin and proceed with the light touch and thin layer that you may repeat if absolutely necessary. In addition use light strokes instead of rubbing motion while applying make-up. The Makeup and acne specialists suggest selecting a lighter shade of foundation for regions affected by acne and darker shades of foundation for the cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin. 4. – Always Clean it Right.. Dispense baby oil or jojoba oil on a cotton pad or cotton ball. Use pad or ball to remove makeup. To avoid irritation, do not scrub other areas of the face with the cotton ball or pad. When using dark eyeshadows or pink blush, it is advised to first apply concealer to decrease irruption of blemishes. 5. – Acne Make-up Survival Routine: Before applying makeup, make sure the skin is prepared. Wash your face well with a suitable product, then moisturize with a light, on comedogenic moisturizer Avoid touching poking and popping your pimples as this can increase access for bacteria to enter deeper into the skin and cause ore serious inflammation including cysts and scars. Make sure your beauty tools are always clean and not neglected. Using a mixture of baby soap and water, gently clean your make-up tools every week. Switch brushes with disposable applicators, think cotton swabs or puffs. Store beauty tools in a case so they stay fresh then restock them often. Remember to ditch old and unused products. Falling asleep with your makeup on is the biggest mistake someone with acne or acne prone skin may make. Sleeping with your make-up can lead to infection and clogged pores, which lead to acne. Always wash your face before bed! Worst case, if the residue stays on your pillow, it can also make you sick. Make sure you change your pillowcase at least once every two weeks. Purchase products over the counter with ingredients that clean your skin but do not strip it from essential oils nor clog pores. . So the truth is that mixing make-up with acne may be tricky, there is no need to avoid makeup all together if you need it for your self-confidence. It is important however to choose the right products and practice the right make-up routine so you do not maneuver your slef into the trouble.

"[""What You’re NOT Being Told About the Ingredients in Your Skincare Products 07-30-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments If you have acne-prone skin, it’s vital that you avoid products that contain comedogenic ingredients. Comedogenic ingredients clog pores, it’s as simple and as complex as that! Skin oil, known as sebum, is produced by the sebaceous glands to keep our skin moist, but it also can get mixed with a number of “skin debris” such as dead skin cells, make-up, dirt and different ingredients of skincare products. When skin oil is produced in excess, the mix of sebum, dead skin cells and all other “ingredients” become too much to be naturally disposed by the pores and they get clogged. When a pore becomes clogged, the sebaceous glands still produce oil but there is no way to remove the excess oil and dead skin cells. This can happen by internal buildup and/or be exasperated by external factors such as makeup or skincare products. There are specific ingredients that are more likely to clog pores and these are labeled as comedogenic. It is especially important for someone with acne-prone skin to avoid these ingredients. The Unregulated Industry and How it Affects You The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a comedogenic ingredient as one that is known to clog pores. However, the FDA does not define a list of ingredients that are considered “non-comedogenic.” Therefore, it is possible that some companies can claim that their product is non-comedogenic while in fact it is not, and it still falls within the acceptable guidelines of the FDA. There are no clear and standardized guidelines or testing within the industry. Some products may be labeled as “non-comedogenic”, or even “dermatologist approved” and “oil free” regardless of the ingredients or lack of testing. So – it is up to you to become an educated consumer and read the label before you make a purchase. Just one ingredient that is comedogenic can throw your skin further off balance and cause an acne outbreak to be more severe. Comedogenic Ingredients to Avoid It is important that you know what is best for your acne-prone skin so that you can make the right choice when selecting skincare products. This is a lengthy list of hard-to-pronounce names (which is a red flag in itself), and it might be helpful to use as a reference when you are selecting your skincare products. Here are some most often used ingredients to avoid: Isopropyl isostearate Isopropyl myristate Myristyl Myristate Laureth-4 Oleth-3 Coconut butter/oil Acetylated lanolin Acetylated lanolin alcohol Lauric acid Isopropyl palmitate Isostearyl isostearate Myristyl lactate Stearyl heptanoate Cetearyl alcohol + ceteareth 20 Cocoa butter Mink oil Soybean oil Shark liver oil D&C red #30 Stearic acid:TEA Myristic acid Buytl stearate Decyl oleate Isostearyl neopentanoate Glyceryl stearate SE Wheat germ glyceride Laureth-23 Non-Comedogenic Ingredients There are certain ingredients that are known not to clog-pores, so if these ingredients are on a product label, you’ve found a product that won’t add to your breakouts. Keep in mind when you’re testing what works for you, don’t add too many new products at once because you’ll never know what truly works – test one for a week or so to see how your skin responds. If you’re adding (or using) too much of the same thing (two cleansers, two astringents, two moisturizers), this may have a negative impact on your skin. And remember, less is always more and…if you really cannot pronounce more than 3 ingredients in a product, it is time to keeping moving down an isle. Here are some of those good ingredients (Please note, we are talking about small amounts, not over use, as even the best ingredient may fail you if abused): Oils: Almond, Apricot Kernel, Argan, Avocado, Baobab, Borage, Calendula, Camphor, Castor, Emu, Evening Primrose, Grape Seed, Hazelnut, Hemp Seed, Jojoba, Neem, Olive, Peach Kernel, Peanut, Pomegranate, Pumpkin Seed, Rosehip, Safflower, Sandalwood Seed, Sea Buckthorn, Sesame, Sunflower, Tamanu Petrolatum (if clean, as used in Aquaphor) Shea Butter Beeswax (in small amounts) Candelilla Wax Carnuba Wax Ceresin Wax Aloe Vera Calendula Chamomile Chamomile Extract Cold Pressed Aloe Ascorbic Acid Black Walnut Extract Tocopherol (Vitamin E) Vitamin A Palmitate Panthenoo Beta Carotene BHA Flowers of Sulfur Precipitated Sulfur Talc Zinc Stearate Carbomer 940 Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Kaolin Magnesium Aluminum Silicate Glycerin Glyceryl Stearate NSE Glyceryl Tricapylo/Caprate Isopropyl Alcohol Oleth-10 Polyethylene Glycol (PEG 400) Polyethylene Glycol 300 Propylene Glycol SD Alcohol 40 Sorbitan Laurate Sorbitol Good Daily Skincare Regimen It is extremely important to keep the pores free of clogs to prevent acne and the best way to do that is to follow a good daily skin care regimen. These methods are in addition to our usual daily skin care regimen for acne-prone skin. Steam Facial Steaming the face is an inexpensive and highly effective remedy for clogged pores. This should be done 1 to 2 times per week. Avoid splashing the hot water (which can burn your skin). Fill a pot with water, cover it with a lid and heat the water on the stove. When the water is hot enough to produce steam, remove the pot from the heat. Place a towel over your head and lean over the steaming water. Allow the steam to soak into your face for 10 to 15 minutes. Then pat your face dry and use a toner (to balance the skin’s pH) and mild moisturizer (to protect your skin from drying out). Steam your face twice a week to keep your pores clean and rejuvenate your skin. Cucumber Toner After the steam bath, try this cucumber toner in order to close up those pores. It is also antibacterial and moisturizing, and is also designed to make acne scars lighter. You can do this daily or every other day. (Note: In our daily skin care regimen , we suggest using the chamomile astringent every day. If you would like to use the astringent, we suggest alternating the cucumber toner with the astringent every other day.) Ingredients 1 cucumber 1 lemon Peel, cut and remove seeds from the cucumber. Puree it in a blender. Strain the mixture to collect the juice, and add the lemon juice from half the lemon. Use organic vegetables when possible. Dip a cotton ball or cotton pad into this cucumber tonic and pat on your skin. Allow to air dry. Help Yourself, End the Cycle of Acne Even though over-the-counter products can assist us in our journey to get clear skin, remember, the only way to fully treat acne is to end the cycle of acne. Taking action from within is the best step you can take. Most of you are already doing that with AcnEase®, and if you haven’t tried it, today is a great day to start! As a botanical ingredient based acne treatment, AcnEase® is designed to treat acne from the inside out by limiting your body’s response to hormones in the blood and keeping your production of skin oils at a healthy level that is beneficial for your skin. AcnEase® can be used by anyone, men or women, adults or teens, women taking oral contraceptives, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding mothers. It’s free of sugar, gluten, nuts and milk derivatives and doesn’t contain any chemicals, GMO’s or phytoestrogens. Don’t take our word for it...read the ingredient list and see for yourself.

"['How to Control Oily Skin to Reduce Breakouts 03-01-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Sebaceous glands are present throughout the skin on our body with the exception of our palms and the bottoms of our feet. These glands produce skin oil known as sebum which keeps our skin, soft, protected, and elastic. Without sebum, our skin would look like alligator skin...scaly and overly dry. But sometimes these glands produce too much skin oil and our skin becomes too oily. Our face, and sometimes our body, shines in all the wrong places leading to melting make-up and an unhealthy appearance. But very often, too much oil also leads to dreaded breakouts and unsightly pimples. Indeed oily skin is known to be a precursor to acne and even though some individuals with dry skin also get acne, the majority of acne sufferers have oily skin. So, if you want to prevent an acne breakout and get rid of your oily complexion, you need to control the excess oil being produced by your sebaceous glands. But, how? Read on. Basic Causes of Oily Skin 1. Genetics. When oily skin runs in the family, chances are that every member will have sebaceous glands that produce excess oil. Any skin that\'s genetically oily is more likely to lead to clogged pores and breakouts. 2. Over use of skin care products. We all want to look young forever. In the quest for the ""fountain of youth,"" people often over cleanse, over exfoliate, over scrub and use too many oil based products. All of the above will only increase the symptoms of oily skin. 3. Using the wrong products. Have you read your product labels recently? Using oil-based products will only add to the problem. Instead, choose non-comedogenic products, which are designed to not clog pores. 4. Seasonal changes. A rise in heat and humidity during spring and summer can cause skin\'s oil production levels to increase. In contrast, when the air becomes dry in the winter, skin can get dehydrated, and excess oil may occur when it overcompensates for what\'s missing. 5. Medications. Hormonal birth control and hormone replacement medications can cause an increase of sebum production. In addition, many medications can cause dehydration and lead to a production of excess oil when skin overcompensates for the lack of oil. 6. Hormonal changes. In women, fluctuations of hormones (androgens) throughout life (i.e., pregnancy, peri- and pre-menopause) can kick sebaceous glands into high gear. In addition, pregnancy and stopping or starting oral contraceptives also changes hormonal status quo and may lead to excess oil production by the skin glands. 7. Stress. In response to stress, the body produces more androgen hormones, which may over stimulate the sebaceous glands and lead to more skin oil production. 8. Sun tanning. Tanning is BAD for reducing oil. In fact, this is one of the most prevailing myths that sun helps to fight oily skin. Although sun exposure may temporarily dry out the skin, it actually triggers an injury response (inflammation), which causes the sebaceous glands to surge production of oil in order to protect the skin\'s surface. So, in addition to premature wrinkles and the possibility of skin cancer, you may also get more oily skin. When in the sun, chose oil-free sunscreens . Traditional sunscreens tend to be quite thick and may block pores. Sunscreen gels may be better for oily skin. Some of the newest products, including facial powders, and very light mousses or thin lotions, offer good protection against sun damage without clogging the pores. The Most Recommended Oily Skin Care Regimen Cleaning The most effective way to manage oily skin is to cleanse your face both morning and night using a mild, non-alcohol or non-salicylic acid based cleanser. Harsh soaps and cleansers can trigger the skin to increase oil production. The same applies to a facial brush or buff. Use mild, non-comedogenic facial care products. Watch for products containing glycolic acid, or beta-hydroxy acid that may in small doses help to cut oil but may also irritate the skin. Use warm water, not hot, because temperature extremes can irritate skin and over stimulate the skin. Toning If you really like using toners, stay with moisturizing, not drying products. Please beware of harsh toners - upon application, stinging on the face is NOT a good sign. If you insist on using astringents, apply them only on oily areas of the skin, such as the forehead, nose, and chin. Avoid using them on areas that tend to be dry, or you\'re likely to create dry patches on your skin. One of the most prevailing myths about the skin is the belief that each person has a specific type of skin, whether that is dry, oily or combination. The reality is that most people have combination skin (oily in some places, dry in others) and your skincare must recognize this duality. Masks Applying masks and clays to the skin helps draw out oils and cleanses pores, but there is also concern for over drying. Limit masks and clays, and don\'t do one of each more than once per week. If you notice continual oil or dryness, you may want to consider limiting further. Moisturizing People with oily skin often think that moisturizers are not for them since they believe their skin will look even shinier after applying a moisturizer. This is not true. Oily skin needs to be moisturized to stay healthy and look its best. Choose an oil-free moisturizer. Water base products will serve you the best. Applying the moisturizer after each cleansing should become a routine. Returning Your Skin to a Healthy Balance Now you\'re on your way to cleaning your skin the proper way, and you may be thinking, Wow, this is great, all I have to do is follow this skincare regimen and my oily skin will be gone! Right? WRONG! The only real way to control oily skin is to return your sebaceous glands to their ""normal"" state and to stop the over production of sebum. This is what AcnEase users get to enjoy. AcnEase works as a buffer against substances in our bodies that make sebaceous glands over stimulate sebum production. It is important to understand that these botanical ingredients will not directly affect hormones levels, so the product can be used by both women and men of all ages. This action allows oil production to return to healthy levels and consequently not only improves the appearance of your skin but also PREVENTS breakouts and acne. Let us know what has or has not worked for you. We\'re here to help you see the best skin you\'ve ever had. PS - We\'ve only helped hundreds of thousands before to do the same!

"[""Post-Holiday 3-Day Detox For Acne Prone Skin 01-04-2014 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Okay, let's be honest: we may have succumbed to temptation (some more, some less) over the holidays, and now we need a decisive action to repair potential damage we did to our regimen for acne-free skin . Follow these 3 essential steps to get back on track. The best scenario involves combining all 3 steps in a 3-day super detox. If you cannot do it all together however, do it in 2 or 3 consecutive mini-detox periods. 3-Day Easy & Healthy Cleansing: Eat 1/2 of your normal food portions. Drink twice as much water or mint or chamomile tea as you usually drink. Do not consume any desserts, cookies, sugar or any sugar substitutes .

"[""5 Ways to Keep Your Acne Under Control This Summer 07-18-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments No one likes dealing with the summer heat, and for acne sufferers it's not just a matter of staying comfortable-they're also worried that the hot weather may negatively affect their breakouts. Thankfully, there are steps you can take to protect yourself and your skin during the dog days of summer. Don't let the heat get you down-use these tips to keep yourself safe from the sun. Try to Limit Sun Exposure During the Hottest Times of the Day If you're able to avoid sun exposure during the hottest times of the day, which are later afternoon in the summer, then by all means do so because you'll be missing out on both the heat and UV rays that can negatively impact your skin. We're not saying that you have to stay indoors, that would be impossible, but you may try to limit your time outdoors during these peak hours of heat. However, keep in mind that our heavy dependence on air conditioning during the hot summer months has a tendency to dry out the air in a building, so you might want to consider purchasing a humidifier for your home if you've got dry skin and are worried that your AC will make things worse. Carry a Towel Outdoors If you are going to be outside during hot times of the day, make sure you've got quick access to a towel. Sweat can make your acne problems worse. Sweaty skin has a tendency to attract dirt and other small debris that can cause your pores to become more clogged than they already are, so be sure to towel off periodically. However , don't forget to wash and change your towels frequently because dirty ones can help contribute to the accumulation of irritants on your skin. Block the Sun's Rays Sunscreen and other forms of skin protection are a must for acne sufferers. Sunburns promote inflammation of the skin, which makes it more susceptible to acne breakouts, so you'll want to take steps to avoid them. Many topical acne products such as those containing benzoyl peroxide, salicyclic acid or retinoids must be used in conjunction with sunscreen. If you're worried about having a negative reaction to the ingredients in sunscreen, you can first test the product on your skin to make certain the sunscreen or the sunscreen plus your acne treatment does not irritate your skin. When all else fails, you can always protect yourself quite well with an oversized hat and long sleeves. However, choosing a sunscreen brand that works with your skin and not against it will help prevent irritation and will keep you from having to endure the heat from all that excess clothing. Make Changes to Your Skincare Routine During the summer months you may find that your skin begins to behave in unexpected ways. Sometimes people with normally dry skin will find that the heat makes them more prone to oiliness. Conversely, people with typically oily skin may find that it becomes dried out in the sun. These potential changes are things to consider when designing a summer skincare routine - what works well with your skin during the rest of the year may not be the best thing during June, July, and August. Be flexible, and look for ways to make adjustments if necessary. Don't Ignore the Root Causes of Your Acne While protecting your skin from external contributing factors is a good way to reduce the outward symptoms of your acne, if you're not also working to treat the inner causes of acne then these summertime tips will do you little good. Acne is not primarily caused by heat or sweat-rather, it's often the result of a hormone imbalance, in the form of free-floating androgens in your blood stream, which send signals to your sebaceous glands (located beneath your skin) to overproduce oil (sebum). While these other tips will help mitigate the impact of acne, or help prevent worsening of existing acne, without addressing its internal origins you can never be sure that your acne is gone for good. The best approach to obtaining clear skin is to prevent acne from happening rather than treating it once it occurs. AcnEase is a product that has been designed to moderate the response of your sebaceous glands to this hormonal imbalance in a way that is both safe and natural. AcnEase unlike topical acne products has NO sun restrictions. So don't let your acne hold you back this summer - beat the heat with AcnEase! [BONUS:After-Sun Calming Masks] Sun exposure may cause inflammation. The masks below calm and moisturize the skin. You should do one after the other. Please use organic ingredients when possible. Quick Cucumber Mask Ingredients: Fresh, washed, unpeeled cucumber Instructions: Slice cucumber into round ¼ inch slices. Wash your face and pat it dry. Lie down and put the cucumber slices all over the face and décolletage. The last 2 or 4 slices may go on the closed lids of your eyes. Rest for 10-15 minutes. Take cucumber slices off and discard. Your face will be wet from cucumber juice. Do not rinse it off but massage gently into the skin. Cucumbers contain large amounts of water, and are rich in vitamin C so the mask will enhance the skin's ability to regenerate. Super Rejuvenating Green Tea Mask for Acne Prone Skin Ingredients: 2 tablespoons of green tea powder (anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory), use organic Matcha Tea if possible 2 tablespoons of cold press olive oil (moisturizes, firms and heals) 2 tablespoons of honey (soothing, cleaning, firming) 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt (regular) (moisturizes, evens the skin, closes pores) I nstructions: Mix all ingredients well to achieve the consistency of paste. Spread on a clean and dry face. Massage gently and then leave as thick of a layer as possible on the face for 20-25 minutes or until semi-dry. Remove with lukewarm water and a cotton cloth. Skin will feel cool, refreshed, and the look of acne marks will be less prominent.

"['Is Your Zip code Effecting Your Skin? Where you live may be causing your breakouts! 03-05-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Although there are many factors that can contribute to acne, little do many know that where you live not only contributes to skin problems, but it requires a personalized skincare regimen. Depending on where you live, there are some important steps that you can take to greatly improve your skin\'s health. But in general, no matter where you live, it is imperative to learn how to really clean acne prone skin without chemicals and how to moisturize acne prone skin if you want clear skin for good. Warmer Climates Endless summers seem to be almost everyone\'s dream, but the truth is that it can take a toll on skin and hair. More sweat, more frequent exposure to outdoor pollutants, extreme humidity or dirt and dust carried by frequent winds may actually increase acne by the fact that more clogged pores provide a more fertile ground for bacteria, and with it, an increased chance for inflammation that presents itself as acne (pimples, ""zits"", cysts, blackheads, and whiteheads). Even though acne is a manifestation of an internal imbalance that leads to the overproduction of sebum (skin oil) by the sebaceous glands, and is NOT CAUSED by climate, the above listed environmental factors can add to the clogged pores and with that increase the frequency and/or severity of the symptoms. Wash your face (and body) twice a day with gentle cleansers Wear loose clothes Use water (not oil) based moisturizers, and non-comedogenic cosmetic products Learn about the myths for warmer climates and specific tips on How to Care for Your Skin in Warmer Climates . Also note that in a hot climate, you usually wash your hair more often. Shampoos and conditioners containing panthenol , an ingredient that nourishes and strengthens the hair, might also worsen the problem. This is because when the product is rinsed out of the hair, it can clog pores contributing to acne. Last but not least, an ""endless summer"" means more sun. Most of the products used to control acne including antibiotics, retinoids and all those using salicylic acid or peroxide can increase sun sensitivity. So if you use any of them, you need to avoid sun exposure as much as possible. Choose an Acne Treatment Without Sun Restrictions Avoid oil based sunscreens laced with many chemical ingredients Opt for sunscreens with micronized zinc oxide and titanium dioxide , which will help absorb oils without getting absorbed by the skin. Make sure to reapply sunscreen every three hours in order to get adequate protection. Colder Climates The cold and wind outdoors, along with the heat from indoors, dry the skin. Dry, flakey skin may actually exasperate acne as dead skin cells clog the pores and invite bacteria. Additionally, if the skin is too dry, it will produce more oil, which is not good for acne skin. Therefore, moisturizing in this instance is key. Here are some of the most effective ways to moisturize acne prone skin . A good rule of thumb too is to add moisture to the air indoors. Learn more on How to Care for Your Skin in Colder Climates . Food by Region At last - some food for thought. Different regions pride themselves with some signature diets. Unfortunately delicious fried foods of the South and spicy creations of Louisiana or New Mexico, and the red meat focused feast of Texas are not skin friendly and may again exasperate acne. So remember- as home is always sweet home- it may have a few features that are not skin friendly and while we all want clear skin, we may have to do different things to get it depending on where the home is - but it can happen, and we\'ve helped hundreds of thousands to do just that!

"['What Exactly is Sebum? 05-25-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 1 Comments If you have acne, and have read up on its causes, you will find yourself coming across the word “sebum” quite a bit. We know that too much of it can lead to acne breakouts, but what exactly is sebum? Sebum is an oily substance produced by the sebaceous glands. Our skin needs it in order to function, but too much of it can lead to acne, and an overly oily complexion. Other than the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, sebaceous glands can be found all over the body. Read More Fad or Fave?

Sebum travels from the sebaceous glands to the surface through the pores to hydrate, moisturize, and protect the various layers that make up the skin. The face tends to be the oiliest part of the body as that’s where the majority of the sebaceous glands are located, anywhere from 2,500 to 5,500 per square inch!

"['Hidden Skincare Dangers. 8 Things that May be Making Your Acne Worse 05-27-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Sometimes, skincare dangers are in the places we least expect. Read on to learn how to save your skin. The dirty towel How many times do your use a towel on your face before you grab a new one? If your answer is anything other than ""once,"" you might want to rethink your habit. Even if you only ever use the towel on freshly cleaned skin, there\'s a chance your skin isn\'t 100% free of bacteria. Any residual bacteria can transfer to the towel, and if you use that towel again you\'re putting it right back on your face. The point is, if you want to keep your face as clean as possible, and thus your skin as clear as possible, err on the side of safety and use a fresh towel every time. The dirty brush If you use makeup brushes on a regular basis, you should be washing them regularly to avoid bacteria on your face. Try wiping them with a gentle makeup remover cloth after each use, and deep clean them once a week. For the deep clean, mix some gentle shampoo into the brush head under lukewarm water. Rinse well and allow to air dry. Old products It is recommended that all color cosmetics such as eyeliners, blushes (both powder and gels), foundations, powders, lipsticks, bases, etc. are exchanged at LEAST every 6 months after being opened as ingredients in them may change due to oxygenation and become more prone to creating clogs, irritating and even causing allergic reaction. Your hair (and what goes in it) Dirty, greasy hair can contribute to your breakouts, as your hair is close to acne-prone areas. Make sure to also keep your hair brush clean for this same reason. Also, if you\'re using heavy shampoos, pomades, hairsprays or other hair products, especially ones with comedogenic (pore-clogging) ingredients, that may be exacerbating your acne. The tanning bed (or too much sun) There\'s an unfortunate, and dangerous, rumor that tanning, whether in a tanning bed or under the sun, will help to treat your acne. You might be convinced that the appearance of your acne gets better when you tan, but in reality, you are only making your acne worse. Tanning dries out the skin, so while your acne may be temporarily ""dried up,"" dry skin ultimately produces more sebum (skin oil) to counteract the dryness. So then, you have dry, cracked skin and a whole lot of extra sebum on top of it: the prime conditions for acne. Tanning will only keep you stuck in the cycle of acne, not to mention increase your risk of skin cancer and lead to far more wrinkles than you\'ll get if you avoid tanning. The bad ingredients You might think you\'re free to use whatever you want on your skin, so long as it\'s noncomedogenic, but in reality you need to pay attention to every single ingredient in every product you use. Why? Put it this way: that ingredient listed in fine print on the back of your SPF moisturizer? You could be sensitive to it, even if you\'re not necessarily allergic to it, and any ingredient that you are sensitive to has the capability of making your skin dry, irritated and more prone to acne. If you suspect you might be sensitive to an ingredient or product, try removing it from your routine for a few weeks, and see what happens. Pay special attention to the ingredients in your SPF, as this is an often overlooked source of sensitivity, and many ingredients in sunscreen do more harm than good. The main chemical used in sunscreens is octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), which was found to kill mouse cells, even at low doses. OMC is present in 90% of sunscreen products. Another common ultraviolet filter, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, has also demonstrated toxic properties. Take a good look at your sunscreen label and beware of the following chemicals: Para amino benzoic acid Octyl salicyclat Avobenzone Oxybenzone Cinoxate Padimate Dioxybenzone Homosalate Phenylbenzimidazole Sulisobenzone Menthyl anthranilate Trolamine salicyclate Octocrylene Two ingredients that are better for you are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. The harsh scrub Many skincare professionals recommend exfoliating with abrasive ingredients, for example, raw sugar, in order to remove all the dead skin cells. It\'s true this will effectively remove dead skin, but it will also sensitive the skin and possibly lead to more oil production, or even create abrasions into which bacteria and excess oil will accumulate, leading to more acne. Avoid these scrubs at all costs! Exfoliate gently, and never more than once a week. The exercise mat After a good exercise, you might be tempted to stretch, hit the showers and load up on protein and carbs before you go on with your day. But, there is one other thing you need to add to your post-workout routine: cleaning your exercise mat. Before you roll it up, wipe it down with a cleansing wipe or some soap and warm water. Your back-and any other body part that touches that mat-will thank you for it.

"[""Summer Series #2: 2 Sun-Protection Myths You Need to Know About 06-13-2012 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments This is the second article in our Summer Series , so stay tuned for many more summer tips to keep your skin clear! Also, check below for a SPECIAL FATHER'S DAY DEAL! Most of us are led to believe that if we slather on sunscreen in the morning and then stay out on the beach all day long, our skin is protected. Unfortunately, this is incorrect. Learning about proper sun protection and sunscreens will keep you and your skin safe! Myth 1: The sun is bad for you Fact: No, the sun is NOT BAD for you. In fact, the sun is healthy if you take precautions. Ultraviolet light from the sun comes in two main wavelengths: UVA and UVB. They are quite different in respect of the risk they create for your health. UVB is the “good” sunlight and UVA is the “bad” one. UVB helps you produce vitamin D that is extremely important for your overall wellbeing, supporting the health of your bones, muscles, skin, eyesight, heart and immune system. UVA can cause free radical damage. Moderation in sun exposure and using proper sun protection are your keys to safety since long-term, excessive exposure to sunlight can increase the risk of certain types of skin cancer. Myth 2: All Sunscreens Protect You Effectively and Safely Fact: The FDA takes the position that “To date, there are no clinical studies demonstrating that use of any sunscreen alone can prevent skin cancer.” (FDA 2011) According to the Environmental Working Group (EWG), 75% of sunscreens in stores don’t actually protect you enough. As sun protection against UVA rays is necessary, you need to be educated and watch for those ingredients in sunscreen that can do more harm than good. The main chemical used in sunscreens is octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), which was found to kill mouse cells, even at low doses. OMC is present in 90 percent of sunscreen products. Another common ultraviolet filter, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, has also demonstrated toxic properties. Take a good look at your sunscreen label and beware of the following chemicals (they come with names you most likely can't even repeat) that are not really good for you: Para amino benzoic acid Octyl salicyclat Avobenzone Oxybenzone Cinoxate Padimate Dioxybenzone Homosalate Phenylbenzimidazole Sulisobenzone Menthyl anthranilate Trolamine salicyclate Octocrylene Instead, look for sunscreens that base their protective properties on these two major ingredients: Titanium Dioxide Zinc Oxide When both of those ingredients are at a level of 6% or higher, you are covered. Green tea extract, aloe extra, shea butter as well as some other botanical humectants (moisturizers) will keep your skin from drying. At this point you can probably guess what the healthiest sun protection is, right? Clothing! Yes, using light cover-ups, protective hats, t-shirts etc provides us with the best protection against sunburn and unhealthy chemicals. Happy Father's Day to all the Dad's!

Lots of people suffer from acne as adults, even if they had perfectly clear skin throughout their teenage years.

Acne is a result of a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job it is to create sebum, (skin oil) which travels along the pores to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum is produced, it clogs the pores. A mixure of the skin oil, dirt and dead skin cells invites bacteria to form , triggering an inflammatory response from the body.

To put it simple, dermablading is a procedure that rids the surface of the skin of dry, dead cells. Using a surgical scalpel, a licensed aesthetician or dermatologist removes these dead cells by essentially scraping them away, applying short, light strokes to the surface of the skin after washing the face and applying an alcohol solution. The result? A pile of dead skin, a renewed and youthful glow, and a complexion free of pore-clogging debris.

Many acne sufferers complain of increased breakouts during the warmer spring and summer months, when our skin gets hit hardest with a catastrophic combination of skin-damaging factors – the drying effects of the sun , extra dirt and debris buildup from the outdoors…all of this “attacks” our skin.

"[""Are Lasers and Light Therapy Effective Treatments for Acne? 05-05-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments People are always searching for the next big thing in skincare, from anti-aging technology to treatments that leave you looking like you’ve just returned from a relaxing vacation. For those with acne-prone skin, most are up for trying anything in the hopes of finding some sweet relief from stubborn breakouts. Treatments involving both lasers and light therapy operate under the premise of diminishing the level of acne-causing bacteria, P. acnes, on the skin and in the pores. Acne is caused by the overproduction of sebum, an oily substance created by the sebaceous glands, and dead skin cells, dirt and debris found on the skin’s surface. Sebum travels along the pore from the inside, mixing with dead skin found on the outside the pore. This mixture is a fertile ground to grow P. acnes bacteria that will cause inflammation as our body to tries to fight it. Acne symptoms, such as pimples and pustules, are the result of an inflammatory reaction of the body when the body sends white blood cells to fight off these infectious bacteria, now living within this clogged pore. Light therapy works to rid the skin of this bacteria by exposing the skin to certain types of light. Hopefully, this therapy prevents at least some inflammation to arise and possibly temporarily diminishes the number of pimples. Relying on Pulsed Dye, InfraRed, or Fractional lasers, to name a few, these treatments are usually done over the course of multiple visits, and can cost up to $500 per session. Light therapy treatments have recently offered economical at-home devices, but their results have been described as mild and unpredictable. Light therapy does not show any results in treating non-inflammatory acne symptoms such as blackheads and whiteheads and possible side effects for both treatments include pain, irritation and redness. While the use of certain lights and lasers have produced some positive results in working to eliminate acne bacteria, this bacteria is known to grow back fairly quickly, making it an ineffective means of treating acne and breaking the cycle of acne once and for all. Certain laser and light therapy treatments work to reduce the size of the sebaceous glands themselves, limiting their sebum production. This sounds like it should eliminate acne, but tampering with the sebaceous glands can create potentially devastating changes within the body. Some patients report prolonged stinging or burning sensations, over-sensitivity to sun or indoor bright light, and over dryness, redness and peeling of the skin. Although sebum is often regarded as the “cause” of acne, this oily substance is necessary in order for the skin to function properly. It is only when a hormonal imbalance triggers the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum than is necessary that pores can become clogged which leads to acne. Sebum works not only to moisturize complexions, but to lubricate the pores, and help the outer layer of the skin to protect the body from microorganisms and water loss. If you want to impact the amount of sebum produced by the sebaceous glands, targeting the imbalance is done from inside. A systemic treatment like AcnEase® actually works as a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, preventing the overproduction of sebum without directly affecting hormone levels. In summary, the results from laser and light therapy treatments are temporary, with symptoms eventually recurring. This is because pimples, pustules, whiteheads and blackheads are merely a symptom of acne. Laser and light therapy does nothing to treat the actual cause of acne. Real change must be made from within, and AcnEase® does just that. Working from the inside-out, AcnEase® targets acne at it’s source, limiting sebum production to just the necessary amount for the skin to function in a healthy manner. We want to hear from you!

"[""Fad or Fave? Can Applying Oil Benefit Acne? 05-17-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When most people think of oil in relation to acne, their first impulse is usually to steer clear of the slick stuff. In fact, much of the topical skincare industry owes it’s success to stripping skin of oil, promising hopeful acne-prone consumers a squeaky-clean complexion through a course of scrubs, wipes and treatments. Lately, a new trend is shaking things up in the area of acne treatment, using the very thing we’ve been taught to fear to treat our stubborn blemishes and breakouts. While a recent trend in the American skincare market, the use of oil as a skincare treatment dates back thousands of years, as ancient Egyptians, Romans and Aboriginal tribes have been slathering their skin with oils indigenous to their region in order to sooth, hydrate, and hide fine lines and wrinkles. Because the overproduction of oil is known to lead to acne breakouts, many with acne-prone skin are careful to not just jump on this bandwagon. Understanding the difference between internally occurring oil, and topically-applied oil treatments is important when looking to treat acne-prone skin, and when you know what to look out for, not all oil is necessarily a bad thing. The cause of acne can be linked back to an internally-occurring hormonal imbalance , one that affects the sebaceous glands. When certain hormones, such as adrenaline, testosterone and insulin, to name a few, become affected by outside sources, they can trigger the glands to kick into overdrive. The function of the sebaceous glands is to produce sebum, an oily substance that travels along the hair follicle, or pores, from the gland to the surface, where it is used to protect and treat the skin, keeping it hydrated and allowing for its healthiest function. Our skin needs a certain amount of oil to remain healthy. When the sebaceous glands overproduce these oils, however, the pores can become clogged, and when combined with dead skin cells and debris from the skin’s surface, this can lead to breakouts. For this reason, many people want to remove the skin of its oils, which can actually result in an adverse effect, causing more sebum to be created in an attempt to replace the oils that have just been stripped from the skin’s surface. When we treat our acne-prone skin with harsh, drying chemicals, the skin can become dehydrated, making it difficult for sebum to reach the surface, thereby resulting in a clogged pore. Of the many benefits associated with oil treatments, hydration always tops the list. Additionally, oil can be used to smooth fine lines and wrinkles, treat sun damaged skin spots, and improve the overall tone and condition of the complexion. The right oils can make for a great, all-natural alternative to chemical acne treatments, and can even work to soothe angry red spots, and treat the scarring these bumps can leave behind. When it comes to oil, it’s important to know what to look for, as certain oils, especially synthetic types such as lanolin, can clog pores and lead to breakouts. Because the skin needs oil in order to function, finding the right essential oil for your specific skin could possibly yield wonderful results when applied correctly. Here are just a few of the best oils for acne-prone skin. Tea tree. Tea tree oil tops the list in terms of skincare benefits offered. Naturally antibacterial, tea tree oil works to unclog pores from the surface, and can commonly be found in infused astringents. Lavender. Just as the scent of lavender is known to calm nerves, essential oil of lavender can also be used to calm skin, especially skin irritated with breakouts. Neem. Popular in India, the oil of the neem plant is both anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial, offering irritated skin a gentle dose of hydration. Argan. Now widely used in many skincare and haircare lines available almost anywhere, argan oil is especially great for treating acne scars, brightening the pigment and evening out skintone. Rosemary. A natural anti-inflammatory, rosemary oil can calm skin, easing away redness. Rosemary can be used to stimulate the pores and improve circulation, resulting in a healthy glow. While certain oils can be used to treat the condition of acne as it appears on the surface of the skin, the true cause of acne starts within, and must be treated as such if one expects to witness lasting results . AcnEase® is an all-natural and effective way to treat acne at it’s source-at the overproduction of sebum by the sebaceous glands. Working as a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, AcnEase® uses safe, all-botanical ingredients, to ensure that just the right amount of sebum is produced-enough to maintain healthy skin function, but not so much that pores can become clogged. Not all fads are meant to stand the test of time, so if you find an oil that works wonders on your complexion, pair it with AcnEase® to ensure lasting results! We want to hear from you!

We’re going to chat even more now about how we can help you get rid of your acne long term, and how you will also be able to help others who you don’t even know with getting rid of their acne – it’s all about paying it forward. #acnechat The goal here during the next month is to create awareness behind the fact that acne can be a real problem and encourage you to inform, ask questions, share information with others, and figure out what is the best acne treatment for you for the long term. It becomes crucial to recognize acne as a disease to take seriously. Some people suffer tremendously physically and psychologically. They don’t even know why they have acne, whether it’s a hormonal imbalance or genetics, adult onset acne , what the different types of acne are and what is best for it. We’re here to foster these conversations in order to show that this is not a taboo topic! Let’s talk about it! #acnechat #acneawarenessmonth There are over 60 million people in the US alone who suffer from acne and who need real help and support of getting rid of it, and in part, how to live with it. . Therefore, AcnEase is proud to create more awareness to make the acne challenge easier for those who live with acne daily, and to help as many as we can to beat it (after all we are successful in over 96% of acne cases!).

Kids as young as 9 years old are affected, and the average age of an adult acne sufferer has increased to 26.5 within 10 years. Those without acne might not understand, but acne can have a real psychological and social impact that affects them over the years, and that becomes a serious concern. Emotional side effects can be serious short and long term. People can experience: A loss of self-esteem A negative body image Social withdrawal Depression Behavior change Mood changes Decreased motivation Loss of appetite ... Emotional side effects can sometimes have devastating consequences like suicide. In addition, our appearance is an essential component of the perception of self and a condition of our social integration. We have all experienced at least once social pressure by others or even by ourselves. It’s time to take action together and make an integral change to the perception of acne by others, but also ourselves. It’s time to learn about the right and wrong way of treating and preventing acne. It’s time to fight it effectively and safely. It’s time to show off a clear and healthy complexion. Together we can participate in this movement to help each other and improve both our skin, and the image that people may have about acne.

"[""9-Pro Tips on How to Fight Body Acne for the Summer 07-01-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Body acne most frequently appears on the back and chest. You may not realize the prevalence of body acne since most people are normally wearing clothes, but more than half of people with facial acne have some amount of body acne. The reasons are simple. Both the chest and back have plenty of sebaceous glands and therefore can over produce sebum (skin oil). Skin on the back is harder to reach with your daily hygiene routine. Your backproduces more sweat thereby fostering the growth of acne-associated bacteria. Body acne develops in a similar way to facial acne. However, the skin on the body can be thicker than that on the face and often has larger pores causing more severe acne breakouts that are also more difficult to treat. Since we understand the causes of acne, we also know what can make it worse.So let’s get right into it. Avoid irritation One of the factors that can make acne worse is physical irritation of the skin. This is so well accepted in scientific literature that it has its own name acne mechanica . Anything that rubs against your skin can cause irritation. While sweat itself should not cause acne, damp, sweaty clothing combined with irritation tends to exacerbate irritation and further aggravate existing acne.Try this: Wear breathable cotton clothing when possible. If you get sweaty, try to change your clothing when you can. Time your workouts so that you can shower and treat your skin. Our AcnEase users really like our anti-acne daily skincare regimen to combine with their daily natural acne treatment. Be aware of what might be irritating your skin in areas where you regularly experience acne breakouts and make changes where you can. Look for a body cleanser that contains fruit acids. Fruit acids have been shown to help with acne, so choosing a mild soap or cleanser that contains one of these acids may help to control your body acne. For example, you could look for a cleanser that contains citric acid, which comes from citrus fruits. Other fruit acids include glycolic, gluconic, malic and tartaric acids. Wash your skin no more than twice per day. Shampoo daily if your acne appears along or on your hairline. Cleanse your entire skin surface Wash your skin any time it becomes sweaty. Avoid scrubbing, which may irritate your skin. Use your hands or a soft washcloth to wash your skin. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel after you finish. Do NOT rub. Tone your skin with witch hazel. Witch hazel has powerful astringent properties, so it may help with body acne. It is also safe to use on your skin.After cleansing, try wiping your body acne with a cotton ball soaked in witch hazel. Then, follow up this treatment with a light moisturizer. Use aloe vera to moisturize your skin. Aloe vera can help to keep your skin moisturized and it may also provide some anti-acne benefits.Try using aloe vera as a daily moisturizer for your skin after cleansing. For example, you could replace your usual body lotion with a layer of pure aloe vera gel. Try tea tree oil gel. A five percent concentration of tea tree oil gel may help as a topical application for symptoms. Its effects have been compared to benzoyl peroxide, which is a medicine that is included in some topical acne-fighting skin products. Apply the gel to your skin daily. Make sure that your skin is clean and dry before you apply the gel. Tea tree oil has a strong smell. Some people experience redness and irritation from tea tree oil. Test it on a small patch of your skin before more general application. You may replace tea tree oil with homemade “green tea” astringent. Brew a strong cup of organic green tea. Use it daily either splashing on your skin or with the help of a saturated cotton pad after cleansing your skin. Spend a little time in the sun. Yes. A little sunlight exposure may help to combat acne by killing bacteria with UV rays. HOWEVER, remember to use acne friendly sun protection (based primarily on zinc) if you plan to be outside for more than 10 minutes. Too much sun exposure or tanningincreases your risk of developing skin cancer, and will also age your skin. At the end of the day, know that you need to treat your acne, and not just eliminate symptoms. Some people assume that just because they adopt a great daily skincare regimen or DIY method that this will somehow get rid of their acne eventually. And many have tried countlessprescriptions only to have their acne return. This is why hundreds of thousands have chosen AcnEase to help break the cycle of their acne long term. Body acne is one of the toughest forms of acne to treat, and AcnEase has a mechanism of action that enables the sebaceous glands to return to their normal activity, not only eliminating symptoms but most importantly, preventing acne from coming.

"[""How to Treat Acne Now So That it Won’t be Back This Fall 08-09-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments If you live in an area of the world that experiences seasonal changes, you probably know this situation all too well: you find a nice solution to help keep your acne symptoms at bay, and just as you finally start to notice results, the weather changes and you have to start all over again with some entirely new routine! And the more severe the acne , the worse it can be. While treating acne can come with its own source of headaches, it doesn’t have to be a devastating ordeal each time the climates change. By taking just a few preventative measures, you can treat your skin NOW, and set yourself up for a flawless fall face at the same time! Here are just a few of our favorite tips to help take your summer acne treatment to fall without a hitch! Protect Your Skin When the cool, dry autumn air hits the surface of your skin, you might notice a drying effect in a matter of weeks, or even days. It is always suggested to stay on top of your moisturizing game in the cooler months, and the best way to make the seasonal transition as simple as possible is to get an early start with some SPF! Overexposure to sun can damage the skin and foster premature aging or even skin cancer, but it will also cause additional irritation and even inflammation ,which can exasperate breakouts. Sunscreen works to create a protective layer on the surface of the skin, which not only keeps harmful UV rays from burning your complexion, but also works to trap moisture, which can prevent fine line, wrinkles, and skin cancer, in addition to acne. Hydrate Your Skin: Inside Out. Much like how the surface of your skin needs some help staying moist and protected with sunscreen and moisturizer, the inside of your body requires a cool drink as well to keep that complexion hydrated from within . Drinking between 8-10 glasses of water per day is what’s recommended, but if you can’t seem to guzzle nearly a gallon a day, try adding some seasonal fruits and veggies to your diet, like apples, strawberries, grapes, or cucumbers. This quick snack can go a long way in keeping your skin and pores moisturized, leaving less of a scramble to stay hydrated when the skin really needs it - fall. And again, don’t forget that external moisturizer as well. Banish the Dead Skin: Exfoliate Dead skin cells mixed with sebum are the major clogging factor in the process of developing acne breakouts.Exfoliating dry, dead skin cells is essential in keeping skin acne-free in the fall. The symptom of acne we recognize as breakouts usually starts when a hormonal imbalance triggers the sebaceous glands to produce too much sebum, the oily substance created to hydrate the skin. Sometimes this excess of oil can travel through the pores with no problem, but when it meets with dirt and debris, such as dead skin cells, bacteria can form, which usually results in blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, or other acne symptoms. Because we sweat so much more in the summer months, and our skin is, hopefully, remaining covered in sunscreen most of the time, treating the surface with a gentle exfoliation can make for a smooth transition when the dry fall air starts to dry skin up. Whether you find a grainy scrub or a gentle gel works best, find what suits you and take just a couple extra minutes a couple times a week to wash away that sticky summer sweat! Respect Your Skin:Become makeup savvy. Hot and oily versus cool and dry - these two differing climates can call for some very different makeup formulas, depending on your skin type, so be sure to make the appropriate adjustments as needed! Don’t worry, this won’t require a major makeup overhaul, just switching up the cakey foundation with a BB or CC cream, or tinted moisturizer will do the trick. If you have some left over after the warm weather fades, you don’t have to toss it - simply wear a light layer under your fall foundation to build up your look! Break the Acne Cycle If your acne flares up with every seasonal change, finding new soaps, scrubs and makeup will go a long way in giving you flawless skin, but these tricks will only take you so far. For real results, you’ll do best to treat the problem at its source, which is exactly what AcnEase does. Botanical, safe and effective, the ingredients that make up the various AcnEase® treatments were selected based on years of research and trials as the safest and most effective combination to not only eliminate acne symptoms, but also prevent acne from coming. No need to worry about how your skin is going to react to a change in temps when you take preventative measures in self-care with AcnEase. Remember, the seasonal changes don’t have to get you down. By making just a few simple adjustments to your summer skincare routine, you can take your skin from a dewy day to a crisp, cool night, all while looking your absolute best! We want to hear from you!

"[""6 Things To Do Now To Get Clear Skin In Time For Back To School 08-22-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The start of a new school year can feel like a clean slate for a lot of people. New teachers, new friends and new opportunities all present themselves without fail, but for some who are self-conscious about their acne, back to school season can be a stressful and triggering time. Treating acne is both an internal and external endeavor. Acne symptoms known as pimples begin forming from within weeks before symptoms appear on the skin, and are believed to be caused by an excessive amount of sebum , or oil, produced by the sebaceous glands. This sticky substance travels along the hair follicles, or pores, to reach the surface, and when too much is produced, it can become clogged within the pore. When combined with dead skin cells and debris collected on the surface of the skin, this pairing can lead to the growth of bacteria, which then appears as acne once the body’s inflammatory response kicks in. Because acne can hold both internal and external forces to blame, the best way to go about treating it is to keep both aspects of skin and body care in mind. Luckily for anyone with acne, the best way to treat symptoms is to get a head start, and with a few weeks of summer left, there’s no time like the present to begin preparing for a healthy and clear complexion! Just follow any (or all) of these simple tips to find yourself bringing your best face forward on those first days of classes, and beyond. Keep your skin clean, day and night. Most people wash their face upon waking, but if you’re the type to fall asleep in a face full of makeup, you could be making your acne worse! Keeping a clean surface is half the battle when it comes to acne, and washing with a gentle cleanser followed by a moisturizer suited to your skin type before bed can go a long way in keeping those pores clean and unclogged, which can result in fewer breakouts. Exfoliate. Exfoliating is an important step, and should be approached differently depending on the season, and sensitivity of your own skin. While fall usually calls for a grittier exfoliant to help wash away the dead skin cells that contribute to acne, summer usually requires a lighter hand, so a gentle chemical exfoliant once or twice a week should do the trick. For anyone looking to exfoliate naturally, just create this simple yogurt and honey mask to gently scrub away any dead, flaky skin with no risk of side effects. Keep stress levels low with a good night’s sleep. Summer vacation usually allows for at least a bit of a later wake up time for some, and that’s a good thing, as a good night’s sleep is an important part of maintaining healthy skin. Increased sebum production is linked to hormonal imbalances, and by simply snoozing around 8 hours a night, your body will better be able to balance certain hormone levels which may trigger sebaceous glands. Eat your way to a clear complexion. What you put into your body is going to affect what you see on the outside, and the right diet is essential in managing acne-prone skin. If you think this requires a huge dietary overhaul, don’t worry - just a few simple tweaks can go a long way! By doing your best to avoid processed foods, baked snacks, refined grains, and anything high in sugar, and replacing them with naturally effective options, you’ll give your skin a good shot at remaining acne-free in time for school. The easiest foods to add to any diet include antioxidant-rich strawberries and blueberries, or protein-rich nuts such as almonds or walnuts. Basically it’s important to stick to an anti-inflammatory diet for acne . So if you like getting your hands dirty in the kitchen, adding anti-inflammatory garlic to as many recipes as possible can work wonders on problem skin. Shop smart when it comes to makeup . When covering up with makeup , be especially sure to keep your brushes, sponges, and pads clean, as dead skin and old oils can easily build up on these surfaces, leading to breakouts. When shopping for skin makeup such as foundation or BB cream, look for fragrance-free, paraben-free, non-comedogenic formulas, which won’t irritate skin. Attack acne from within. Keeping the surface of your skin clean will go a long way in remaining blemish-free, but washing your face is only part of the solution. The real way to fight acne is to target the problem at its source - the sebaceous glands, to ensure that only the necessary amount of oil is being produced, no more, no less. AcnEase is an all-natural solution that does just that, and because it works to create a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands, it will not affect hormone levels at all, making it safe for anyone to use. When it comes to bringing your best face forward, prevention is always the best measure to take, and with a few weeks of summer remaining before it’s time to head back to school, the choices you make now can go a long way in achieving clear skin when it counts! Implementing a systemic solution such as AcnEase can help take any of the above-mentioned tips for clear skin over the top, and since it works to prevent acne before it starts, can actually help reduce the amount of time you may spend scrambling to get flawless skin before that first day back. There’s still plenty of summer left, so free up your time with a solution that does the work for you! What do you do to ensure a clean and clear complexion for that first day of school?

"[""3 Ways to Zap a Zit in a Day 09-14-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments For anyone with acne, the universal question still remains - how do I get rid of it?! We all want to get rid of our pesky pimples ASAP, but in order to understand the best way to treat the problem, it’s important to understand the cause of our concern. The term acne is generally used to describe those red or white swollen bumps that appear on our skin, but those are actually just the symptoms of acne, which is technically a skin disease. Usually caused by a hormonal imbalance, acne can affect anyone at any age, though some people are more genetically predisposed to experience acne than others. Acne can appear in a variety of forms, from whiteheads to cysts, each requiring their own level of care, and approach to treatment. Because not all acne is the same, treating acne will vary depending on what you’re working with, which makes it very important to learn your acne type , in order to determine the best course of treatment. With all that in mind, we’ve come up with a three-step plan to zap just about any zit from your skin in no time! 1. Dry it out. The acne condition is most often blamed on an excessive amount of sebum. Produced by the sebaceous glands, sebum, or oil, travels through the pores to hydrate and protect the skin. When too much sebum is produced, which can usually be attributed to a hormonal imbalance of some sort, the narrow pores can become clogged, which can lead to breakouts. By the time a blemish has formed on your skin, it has filled with pus and harmful bacteria, which is why many topical treatments aim to dry those bad boys out. Finding an overnight mask or spot treatment designed to dry out acne will draw these impurities to the surface of the skin, making their departure that much quicker. Sulphur is known for its drying properties, as are charcoal and baking soda. Lemon juice, which is rich in vitamin C, can also be used to dry pimples by applying directly onto the affected area - just make sure it’s squeezed fresh, and not store bought, to avoid any added sugar. 2. Kill bacteria. Excessive amounts of sebum are only half of the problem when it comes to acne. Those red or white bumps we know as pimples are actually a response to a bacterial infection that occurs within the pores . When sebum combines with, dry, flaky skin cells, it produces bacteria. The body then naturally sends in white blood cells to “fight off” the infection, in a process known as inflammation. In order to keep acne from spreading, this bacteria must be eliminated. We can turn to simple ingredients you can find in almost any kitchen. Honey and garlic remain the main contenders in terms of homeopathic, anti-bacterial treatments, both of which are also naturally anti-septic, and anti-inflammatory. You can apply directly to the skin, or for a longer-term change to your skincare regimen, incorporate into your existing diet for a systemic solution to your acne. Tea tree oil also works well to eliminate bacteria, and can also be added to shampoos to reduce oils on the scalp. 3. Eliminate excess oil. Now that the blemish has begun drying out, and harmful bacteria has been wiped away, we’re left to keep oil production at a minimum if we want to prevent new acne from forming. Gently steaming the face is a great way to loosen up clogged pores and flush oils away, and a mask made of egg whites can help keep skin squeaky clean. Aloe vera also does a good job at sopping up extra oil, and because of its naturally soothing and hydrating properties, won’t further dry the skin. For a long-term approach to keeping oil production in check, addressing the problem at its source, (the sebaceous glands), is the best way to keep anyone from scrambling to zap a zit in a hurry :- and AcnEase does just that. Using safe and effective herbal ingredients, AcnEase works to create a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the amount of oil needed to properly hydrate the skin is produced - no more, no less. Combined with any of these topical treatments, a combination therapy with AcnEase will be sure to have you resting easy, and waking up every day to a clear complexion. When it comes to eliminating acne overnight, perhaps the most important tip is to remember this: be patient! Acne starts forming days before it reaches the surface of the skin, so giving it the time it needs to die a natural death (read: no popping!) will be the best way to ensure clear skin free of scarring, marks, or more breakouts!

"[""A Look At Chronic Acne, And 5 Rules For Stopping The Cycle 10-20-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Persistent breakouts damaging your skin? You may have chronic acne, which is more common than you may realize. Acne is a disease which affects the skin, and is the most common skin condition affecting people of all ages. Caused by a hormonal imbalance which triggers an excessive amount of sebum, or skin oil, to be produced by the sebaceous glands, acne symptoms appear on the surface as red, swollen bumps often referred to as pimples. There is a common misconception about chronic acne in that some people think if they’ve had it for more than 2 years, it may not be chronic. Or if they have a mild case of acne, yet they’ve had it for over 2 years, then it’s a less severe case. Both of these cases are wrong! Chronic acne is typically meant to refer to anyone who has had acne symptoms for atleast over 2 years. This type of acne is usually just as difficult to treat as adult, or hormonal acne, which are caused by the always fluctuating hormonal levels that are known to affect the production of oil. While chronic acne may be difficult to treat, it isn’t impossible. With a few tips, tricks, and rules to live by, you can learn to work with your chronic acne, and find some relief along your journey toward clear and healthy skin. Rules To Live By When Seeking Relief From Chronic Acne 1. Stay Alert. When it comes to treating acne, prevention is key. You can take steps to put a stop to chronic acne before it becomes incessant, leading to frequent breakouts, and possibly resulting in scars. If your acne is mild, or if your notice it fluctuating at certain times, do your best to make note. Are you noticing breakouts just before your period? After you eat dairy? Just before a major seasonal change ? If you can spot what’s triggering your pimples you can take appropriate measures to possibly avoid them the next time around. 2. Stay Smart. Like any type of acne, chronic acne begins from within, and starts forming weeks before you see a breakout on the surface of your skin. In order to truly stop acne you must address it at its source - the sebaceous glands. AcnEase works to do just this. Using safe and effective herbal ingredients, AcnEase works to create a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands, assuring that only the amount of sebum needed to hydrate and protect the skin is produced - no more, no less. 3. Stay Vigilant. Once you have found a solution that works for you, your lifestyle, and your skin, it is important to stay on top of your treatment, and never wait for symptoms to appear before attacking your acne. A combination therapy approach of both systemic and topical treatments is the best bet for treating any type of acne, as pimples are formed when excess sebum combines with dead skin cells within the pore to form bacteria. It’s an inside, and outside job, and once you find a solution that works for you, keeping up with your skincare routine will run like clockwork. When you properly treat acne from within, you can spend less time worrying about pimples on the surface. 4. Stay Patient. We realize that this one is easier said than done, but patience is key in order to experience real relief from acne. It’s an unfortunate yet true fact that the longer you have acne, the longer you will have to treat it, so it’s important to never give up, and when you find something that works - don’t stop! Both you and your skin deserve to be as healthy as possible, so a change or habit created with maintaining clear skin in mind is a form of self-care that will show from the outside. 5. Stay open-minded. Chronic acne, as with all chronic ailments, may be difficult to end and control, and might require a few tries and tweaks before you find a fit that works for you. You might even need to change up that routine after a little while, because like anything, our bodies and environments are always changing. Keeping an attitude of open-mindedness will help you go with the flow and remember, especially when times are tough, that this too shall pass, as long as we do what we need to take care of ourselves in the moment. As mentioned earlier, finding a combination of treatments to address the inner and outer issues of the disease will be your best bet. AcnEase combined with a topical wash and non-comedogenic moisturizer are a great place to start. If your severe acne is in need of more help, you may want to consider a dermatologist who can prescribe a topical antibiotic or medicated treatment to add to your combination regimen. The important thing is that you find what works for you. 96% of AcnEase users say that AcnEase works for them. We hope you’re next! We want to hear from you!

"[""What oils can I use on my skin? Do they even help? 11-04-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments A: A few years ago, oil-free moisturizers were all the rage. People thought that oily skin would break out if more oil were topically applied. I remember seeing lots of skin that was dehydrated with red inflamed breakouts from this method of hydration. Certain oils can be your friends! It is just important that you use the right oil for your skin, because the wrong one can absolutely lead to more breakouts, while the right one can balance your sebum, making it less hard, sticky and pore clogging. So what makes oils different? It all comes down to oleic acid vs. linoleic acid. Oils heavy in oleic acid have monounsaturated fatty acids and omega-9 fatty acids while oils high in linoleic acid are comprised of unsaturated fatty acids and more omega-6 fatty acids. There are many studies done with acne skin that reveal lower than normal levels of linoleic acid in the surface skin lipids. When linoleic acid levels are too low, it causes the skin's sebum to become stickier and pore clogging. Linoleic acid added to your skin can change your sebum into more fluid, hydrating, healthy sebum that doesn't get stuck inside of your pores. Water is ultimately what is hydrating your skin, but oil is the means for trapping the water in your skin. So which oils should you stick with? Lets start with coconut oil - I love coconut oil and it does have many antibacterial and healthy properties to it. Some other good oils for acne skin are safflower, evening primrose oil, tamanu oil, pumpkin, rosehip and even grape seed oil. I am particularly partial to the evening primrose and the rosehip. Evening primrose oil is particularly good for women as it contains essential fatty acids. Rosehip is amazing because of its high concentration of vitamin C (a powerful antioxidant). AcnEase users, remember you can safely add oils to your daily skincare regimen – try it and see if it makes a difference for you! Embrace this season by keeping your skin hydrated with nourishing oils that are the right kind for your skin, and watch how they can help your skin come into balance. Yet again, PLEASE remember, oils are not going to treat a skin issue like acne – they’ll only assist in helping in the journey! If you know someone who can benefit from this information, please of course share it! And if you have any questions, please feel free to ask right here. And let me know if you try any of these oils or even use them in your daily regimen. Would love to hear from you. - Courtney Comments Add New No comments found × Close Leave Comment https://www.acnease.com/acne-treatment-blog/what-oils-can-i-use-on-my-skin-do-they-even-help.htm?params[comment_submitted]=1#comments Value entered for e-mail is invalid Passwords don't match Please fill up missing fields below Name * Email * Website Comment * Submit Close""]",e443a5b1390b02cabcc7a615922a5ddc3da58e78,61b6-48a2-9078,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.acnease.com/acne-treatment-blog/what-oils-can-i-use-on-my-skin-do-they-even-help.htm,['2016-11-04 00:00:00']
"['5 Ways AcnEase Works to Treat Adult and Cystic Acne Naturally 12-04-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Now more than ever, people seem to be looking for safe, natural and effective ways to treat anything that ails them, from pain to digestive troubles to addressing their skincare needs, but how does a natural acne solution really work? In order to understand how acne can be treated, it’s important to become familiar with how acne works in the first place. Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States, and affects people of all ages. It is usually the result of a hormonal imbalance, which goes on to affect the sebaceous glands. These glands produce sebum , or oil, which travels along the hair follicle, or pore, to protect and nourish the skin. Some imbalanced hormones can trigger the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum than necessary, which become clogged within the pore on its way to the surface. When combined with dead skin cells, bacteria forms, which sparks an inflammatory reaction, resulting in symptoms called pimples. Although acne is known to affect all types of people regardless of age, sex or race, there are different types of acne that affect certain people specifically, and can all be classified as either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory. Certain acne types are generally harder to treat than others, especially the adult and cystic varieties. In order to begin an effective acne solution for your skin, learn your acne type now to take charge of your treatment. The most effective way to go about doing this is by implementing a combination of approaches, targeting the problem from within, and taking care to practice proper hygiene with topical treatments on the surface. AcnEase works internally to treat the problem at its source, and here are five reasons why it’s so effective! AcnEase, A Natural Solution to Preventing and Treating Acne It uses the highest quality herbal ingredients. The mission behind AcnEase is a pure and simple one: to bring the healing power of plants into the mainstream of medicinal science. The formula created by AcnEase achieves sustained results all while using botanical ingredients, and without the drying and irritating side effects that antibiotics and external ointments (often containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid) can contain. Take a look at our plant-based ingredients and see the benefits for yourself! It creates a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands. AcnEase does what most acne treatments fail to address: it targets the problem from within, while maintaining a safe experience at every measure, unlike many prescription options, such as Accutane. AcnEase works to decrease this excess sebum production by creating a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, thereby decreasing oily skin, and reducing the number of comedones and pimples seen on the surface of the skin. AcnEase is unique in that it addresses the cause of acne and skin related problems without affecting the hormones directly, and produces zero side effects. It ensures that only the necessary amount of sebum is being produced. Despite the bad wrap it gets, sebum is actually a necessary part of maintaining healthy skin function, as it works to hydrate and protect the skin from within. Many topical or prescription treatments either strip the skin of necessary oils, which only triggers the body to produce more to make up for what was just lost, or limit the function of the sebaceous glands directly, which can dehydrate the skin, resulting in awful side effects. AcnEase ensures that only the amount of sebum necessary to hydrate and protect the skin becomes produced, without affecting the hormones or the sebaceous glands, making it safe for anyone to take at any time. It uses traditional Chinese medicine and alternative medicinal practices to offer a solution safe and effective for anyone. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been practiced for centuries, and the inherent wisdom found within it relies upon identifying patho-physiologic patterns to determine the appropriate treatment. The goal of TCM is to restore balance and thereby ""cure"" the disease. This approach gives TCM a special advantage over certain western medicine therapies that focus on merely providing symptomatic medical relief. As experts in the field of skincare and acne treatment, AcnEase relies on the marriage of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to deliver a solution to anyone looking for real results, without the side effects. It treats the problem at the source. Because acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, the only real way to treat the problem is to target it at its source. This is why our AcnEase® users love our product because it does just that – it breaks this endless cycle , eliminating existing acne symptoms while preventing new ones from forming. The only real way to fight acne is to go within to address the internal problems our bodies face, and AcnEase makes this easier than ever, with formulas created for any type of acne from mild to severe .

"[""Predictions for How Acne Skincare Will Change in 2017 01-12-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Out with the old and in with the new! This year is sure to come with a lot of new treatments, techniques, and trends in skincare. We sure are looking forward to seeing all that 2017 has to hold. Yes, in science we are making strides daily across multiple platforms. And as the landscape changes over the years with safe and effective emerging practices (like functional medicine), we will continue to promote the importance of using a combination of different methods as a long lasting solution to eliminate and prevent acne. Acne is an external manifestation of an internal issue. And just because something is new, and may sound like “the latest and greatest”, doesn't necessarily mean that it is safe and will provide you with long-term results. We get it. We work with hundreds of acne sufferers who just want relief, and didn’t do much research on what they’ve used on their skin. So ask yourself these acne treatment questions as you’re pondering your next move, and check out what our experts think some trends in acne skincare are this coming year. Acne Skincare Predictions for 2017 The total number of acne sufferers will increase. Especially adult, hormonal, male, and pre-teen varieties. With more and more topical acne treatments on the market, it’s tempting for anyone with acne to reach for the medicated formulas, but what most people don’t realize is that these washes, creams and spot treatments will only provide temporary relief. In some cases, over washing, over exfoliating, or using a formula too harsh for your skin can even exacerbate acne symptoms by triggering the body to produce more oil to make up for what was just washed away. Until this cycle stops, we will only see more symptoms on our skin. More people will look toward natural solutions. With each passing year, it seems more people are looking toward holistic solutions in healthcare, and that includes treating the skin. With meditative workout practices such as yoga becoming more popular, people are beginning to look inward, rejecting typical, chemical solutions for Eastern medicinal treatments such as Traditional Chinese Medicine , and herbal healing. With popularity comes information, and we predict, and hope to see, more people leaning toward natural remedies to assist in their treatment. Less people will buy into conventional methods or new prescription drugs. It isn’t uncommon for someone with severe or chronic acne to seek help from a physician or dermatologist to help treat their condition. Many women have turned to hormonal birth control to keep their symptoms in check, while others rely on prescription antibiotics or medications such as Accutane. While these may provide, again, temporary relief for some, it’s becoming clear that these solutions are not without their share of harmful side effects, from blood clots and potential fertility issues to depression, over drying of the skin and scalp, and resistance after prolonged use, depending on the treatment. Accutane has been taken off the market due to a class action suit, and the generics have similar side effects. Furthermore, once the treatment has discontinued, the hormonal imbalance which lead to acne in the first place is likely to return, leaving people more frustrated than ever. More people will look toward additional lifestyle changes that can benefit skin care. Acne-prone people, especially anyone with adult or chronic symptoms, seem to be shifting their attention toward a mind-body connection. We hope to see more of this with every passing year, as the relationship between our internal and external selves is something that affects a myriad of things in our daily lives, including our skin’s health. More people seem to understand that a combination therapy approach to treating acne both systemically and topically will lead to long-term results, and as more people become educated on just how acne forms, we hope to see less impulse purchases and more changes to lifestyle habits than ever before. Of course, it’s impossible to predict exactly what the world of skincare will reveal this year, but one thing is for certain - if acne isn’t treated at its source, it will almost always come back. Why? Acne is a usually the result of a hormonal imbalance, which occurs from within. These hormonal shifts can trigger the sebaceous glands to create excessive amounts of sebum, which can become clogged within pores. When combined with dead skin cells, bacteria can form, leading to acne symptoms such as pimples and cysts. Our AcnEase® users are able to experience how a treatment can act as a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands so that the sebaceous glands can return to normal activity. The botanical ingredients that make up the various AcnEase® treatments were selected based on years of research and trials as the safest and most effective combination to not only eliminate existing acne symptoms but also prevent new acne from forming, no matter how severe . When treating your acne, it’s best to skip the trends and stick with a treatment that will truly work for you both in the new year, and beyond! We want to hear from you!

And even though emergency tips to quickly get rid of those breakouts always come in handy, we like to pose the question, “why work to fix a problem when you can take measures to avoid it all together?” (This is what our AcnEase users get the benefit of doing actually.) The Importance of Dealing with the Underlying Cause Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job it is to create sebum, or oil, which travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes clogged within a pore and pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria forms, triggering an inflammatory response from the body. The result of that response usually appears as red, swollen bumps known as pimples, a symptom of acne. It’s important to understand that acne starts forming long before we witness a pimple on the surface of our skin, which is why treating the problem internally and externally is our best bet at achieving real results (again, hats off to you AcnEase users!). When preparing for a big event, the idea is to spread your external skincare regimen out over the course of a couple weeks so as not to bombard the complexion with harsh treatments, which could possibly lead to irritation or even more breakouts. Like most things, even skincare is better in moderation, and so here are some of our top tips to get your skin in great shape for Valentine’s Day. What to Do Next Today : Set yourself up for success. This doesn't have to be a major overhaul of every detail, but doing your part in eliminating the risk of harmful bacteria forming in those pores requires a clean surface, and we’re not talking about skin! Makeup brushes and sponges can be a breeding ground for bacteria, and those dead skin cells that contribute to clogged pores can easily collect on pillow cases, towels, and scarves. Give any items that come in contact with your skin a wash, and continue with the twice-daily washing and moisturizing routine that works for you. One Week Before : Exfoliate. The overproduction of sebum is partially to blame for breakouts, but what’s the other? Dry, flaky skin. By treating the surface of your skin to a nice, deep exfoliation, you can rid your complexion of pore-clogging skin cells while simultaneously stimulating blood circulation, which can help rid the body of harmful toxins. Whether you choose to implement an exfoliating scrub, a less-harsh cream, or a clay mask is up to you (here are some of our acne exfoliating favorites). To make the most out of your pore-extracting treatment, treat yourself to a healthy steam to really open up those pores . Four Days Before: Moisturize. Many people might assume that in order to get the freshest-looking complexion that they should deep clean right before the big event, but over-exfoliation can actually result in inflammation if bacteria gets pulled up to the surface. Since you’re still a few days away from the big night, you do have time to indulge in a moisturizing mask, or even a full-on DIY spa day to help you relax and get into the spirit of the season. Don’t forget to cleanse and hydrate daily and remove that makeup at night. The Day/Night of: Hydrate. Here we are, the day you’ve been working toward! At this point all that we recommend you do is take it easy, stay hydrated with water and indulge with a nice misting of hydrating chamomile toner , and get ready to enjoy yourself. If you have a breakout in need of hiding, you can always reach for the brushes and sponges to camouflage those pesky pimples . There are also some emergency tips for those last minute zits that can come in super helpful too. While treating the surface of the skin plays a big part in keeping acne symptoms at bay, the most effective approach to keeping oil production in check is by addressing the problem at its source - the sebaceous glands, and AcnEase does just that, no matter how mild or severe the symptoms . Using safe and effective herbal ingredients, AcnEase works to create a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the amount of oil needed to properly hydrate the skin is produced - no more, no less. The best part? It does the work for you, so if you don’t have time to indulge in a DIY treatment every week, you can rest assured that the condition of your acne is being treated regardless. Think prevention so you don’t have to continue this endless cycle! We want to hear from you! What is your tried and true way to prepare for a big date? Gave any tips to share with our readers?

"[""AcnEase: A Good Practices Guide to Keep in Mind While on Your Treatment 03-16-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When many people begin a new acne treatment, the goal of obtaining clear skin is the main thing on their minds, but in addition to keeping all eyes on the prize, it’s important to understand just how to make the most out of your new skincare regimen. The condition of acne actually begins forming beneath the skin long before we witness symptoms on the surface, and is actually attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands. These glands work to create sebum , or oil, which travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. A hormonal imbalance or fluctuation can cause the sebaceous glands to go haywire, producing more sebum than is necessary, which can become clogged within a pore. When this sebum pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria known as P. acnes can become formed, which triggers an inflammatory response from the body. The result of that response usually appears as red, swollen bumps such as pimples or cysts, although symptoms of this condition can come in many forms, including whiteheads, blackheads, comedones, or even just oily skin. Although the symptoms of acne are what we aim to treat, it’s important to keep a routine in motion to prevent the formation of new blemishes in addition to eliminating existing ones. Here are some great tips to keep in mind to stay on track with your AcnEase treatments, which will ensure the best results! Best Practices to Make the Most of Your Time With AcnEase Don’t stray from the recommended dosage. Every AcnEase treatment is designed to treat a specific type of acne, which is why making sure you’re on the correct dosage is super important, otherwise the outcome can be severely affected. If you’re not sure what type of acne is affecting you, check out this helpful link to narrow it down, and if you have any questions regarding dosage instructions, please don’t hesitate to contact us ! Our goal is to deliver clear and healthy skin to you as quickly as possible, so please reach out if we can help you meet your skincare goals! Commit to success. The time it will take to witness results will vary depending on the person - it really depends on the severity and chronic nature of acne. AcnEase treatments are sold in monthly regimens, and the recommended time to take it for a first-time user is AT LEAST one month, so if you want to see real results, stick to your treatment plan and do your best to not skip doses. Like any medication, adhering to the recommended guidelines is crucial, and AcnEase is no different! Be patient! If you’ve had chronic acne, whether mild or severe, it just isn’t going to go away overnight. Healing the skin is a process that takes time, and could take anywhere from 1-3 months (if not longer) to see results, so allow yourself some room and time to improve. If you feel that the dosage you’ve been taking is too low for you, please contact us and we will be happy to help guide you in the right direction. Weaning off. When you see the desired results and want to come off of AcnEase, our suggestion is to ween off of it slowly. Stopping abruptly could cause a change that your system doesn’t like. So you would go down gradually, for example, from 6 x 3/day, to 4 x 3, then 4 x 2, then 2 x 2 - and you can do this over a 1-2 week period or longer depending on how your body reacts. If you see that your skin reacts negatively, you just go back up to the dosage that didn’t give you that type of reaction. If you’d like to stay on a maintenance dose (2 x 2) after you wean off, you can do this too – we have many clients who do so. So just how does AcnEase work to treat acne from within? By using safe and effective herbal ingredients, AcnEase works to create a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the amount of oil needed to properly hydrate the skin is produced - no more, no less. This means no harmful side-effects as the function of the hormones will not become affected by treatment, and because it limits the amount of sebum produced to only what’s needed, you won’t have to play those frustrating guessing games with a topical wash that may overdry the skin. AcnEase is formulated to treat all types of acne , from blackheads to bacne to cysts, mild or severe, and with a 96% user success rate , it can make for a great solution for anyone with especially stubborn symptoms who have struggled to find relief elsewhere. AcnEase works to treat existing symptoms while preventing new acne formation before it starts, so think prevention to eliminate the endless cycle once and for all. We would love to hear from you!

"[""Are Your Skincare Products Causing More Acne? 03-26-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Washing acne-prone skin plays a big part in maintaining its health and happiness, but if you’re using products that don’t work with your particular skin or acne type , those twice-daily reprieves may be doing more harm than good. When most people notice acne symptoms such as pimples or blackheads, they naturally reach for a medicated facial wash marketed to “fight” acne. When considering a cleanser for acne-prone skin, it’s important to remember that the things we choose to treat our body’s largest organ, the skin, can yield differing results from person to person. Many acne-fighting topical treatments are intended to zap any of that excess oil created by the sebaceous glands. This oil is called sebum, and plays a necessary part in maintaining healthy skin by protecting and hydrating the complexion, keeping skin looking youthful and supple. While too much oil can lead to clogged pores, sebum is actually good for your skin , and plays an important role in keeping it healthy. Sebum essentially works like a waterproof shield once it reaches the surface of the skin, keeping too much water from getting in, while trapping and preventing necessary moisture from getting out. It is able to create this protective barrier because it is made up of fats, or lipids, which do not dissolve in water. While keeping our oil levels in check is important, it’s equally imperative we not over-dry, as that can not only lead to more breakouts, but advanced signs of aging as well. Finding a skincare product that won’t overdry is essential in maintaining a healthy complexion. What you should and shouldn’t use Because everyone’s skin, and the severity of its acne symptoms, varies from person to person, it’s hard to say exactly what to avoid, which is why it's important to get to know your skin and be mindful of how certain ingredients affect your complexion. A good rule of thumb is to lean toward products labeled non-comedogenic (especially makeup and moisturizers,) and items that are oil-free. In terms of what to avoid, keep these three ingredients in mind when reading those labels: Alcohol . This is a tough one to avoid in a lot of acne cleansers but an important one to be aware of, as it can dry your skin to look ahead of its time. When researching your topical skin care treatment, keep a special eye out for ethanol, methanol, benzyl alcohol, isopropyl, and ethyl alcohol, and do your best to steer clear - your skin will thank you for it! Mineral oil . A common ingredient found in many topical acne washes and creams, mineral oil is derived from petroleum, and can lead to clogged pores, which may result in acne. This alone can lead to inflammation, irritation and/or redness, which can result in fine lines. Sulfates . Another ingredient commonly found in hygienic and cosmetic products is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, or SLS. During the manufacturing process, SLS is contaminated with a carcinogenic byproduct, and can irritate the skin and eyes. Toxic to body organs, sulfates can be linked to cell mutations and cancer, as well as increased dryness, which can result in fine lines and wrinkles over time. Many shampoos and conditioners contain sulfates, which tend to over-dry the scalp, leading to flakes, and may trigger an overproduction of oil. The last thing we want to do when treating acne is to create even more problems for our skin, and because topical treatments don’t even address the root cause, it hardly seems worth the risk of advanced symptoms of aging just for temporary relief. Our AcnEase® users are lucky to have total peace of mind and the opportunity to get the best complexion possible because they are on a treatment that actively works from the inside 24/7 to get rid of their acne naturally. The herbal ingredients used works to effectively create a barrier between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, resulting in zero side effects, and a gentle treatment that delivers real, long-lasting results, regardless of the severity of symptoms .

"[""How to Give Your Acne-Prone Skin a Good Spring Cleaning! 05-04-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Spring has been well under way for a few weeks now, but even if you’ve already cleaned your house and home, there’s always time for a thorough skin cleansing ritual as well! Many acne sufferers complain of increased breakouts during the warmer spring and summer months, when our skin gets hit hardest with a catastrophic combination of skin-damaging factors – the drying effects of the sun , extra dirt and debris buildup from the outdoors…all of this “attacks” our skin. In order to coexist with the change in weather, it’s important to keep a few key issues in mind when looking to maintain an acne-free complexion, taking care not to neglect your self-care, and skin care, when spring cleaning this year. Before treating acne, it’s important to understand just how this condition affects the body, and skin. Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job it is to create sebum, or oil. This oil travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes clogged within a pore and pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria forms, triggering an inflammatory response from the body. This process is known as the acne cascade , and usually results in red, swollen bumps known as pimples, a symptom of acne. Steps to Spring Clean Your Skin Outside and Inside Because acne symptoms are caused by both internal and external factors, your best bet for achieving results is to treat the condition accordingly. Luckily, the natural bounty that comes with budding plants and warmer days provides a wealth of organic yet powerful ingredients to work with, and can make for a blissful, blemish-busting spa day at home that’s both affordable and effective. Cleaning the surface: Clogged pores lead to acne and the combination of excess sebum with dead skin cells contribute to breakouts. Steaming the face will open pores, making it easier for skin to release dirt, oil and toxins. The heat will stimulate your blood flow, leaving you with a healthy glow. To create your own DIY herbal steam for spring , simply add 4 cups of water, a handful of mint (anti-bacterial), a handful of parsley (rich in vitamin C,) and the juice of half a lemon (cuts through oil) to a pot. Heat until steaming, then remove from the stove and place on a steady surface. Throw a towel over your head and let the steam bath work its magic for 10 minutes. Once your pores are opened and clean, you can proceed with the easiest mask you’ll ever use: a tomato mask for oily/acne-prone skin . Tomatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals, antioxidants which fight off free radicals, and promote cellular turnover, which can diminish the appearance of acne scars over time. To create, simply slice a ripe tomato in half and rub onto the skin, rinsing away with lukewarm water after 15-20 minutes. To tighten up that freshly-cleansed skin, top off with this easy apple cider vinegar toner to reduce inflammation and further cleanse the surface of your complexion. Cleaning from within: There’s no better time than spring to implement some fresh fruit and veggies into your diet, and certain varieties can actually reduce the body’s inflammatory response, which can reduce acne symptoms such as pimples and cysts. Antioxidant-rich berries such as blueberries and strawberries make for a wonderful seasonal choice, as do leafy greens such as spinach, and parsley. If you’re on the go, you can mix any or all of those items into a smoothie with a dash of ginger or turmeric for a nice bit of added, anti-inflammatory spice. For heavier fare, look to fresh fish such as this ginger-rubbed black cod to get your omega 3 and protein fix in one tasty dish! While spring cleaning can make for a wonderful ritual, you’ll need to go a little deeper if you wish to treat acne and achieve lasting results. One way to be sure that your acne won’t go haywire is to maintain a treatment that is always working, no matter what the weather is outside, and AcnEase, a systemic solution to treating acne, does just that. Creating a buffer between the sebaceous glands and hormones to ensure that only the amount of sebum needed to maintain healthy skin is being created, AcnEase works to prevent acne before it starts, while simultaneously treating existing acne symptoms. Since AcnEase is always working for you, no matter how mild or severe your acne symptoms may be , it can actually help ease the seasonal transition’s effects on your skin, allowing you to enjoy your warmer days worry-free, and acne-free as well!

"[""Why Topicals Alone Will Never Get Rid of Your Acne 05-14-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When most people think of treating acne, zapping away oil and dirt with a medicated cleanser is usually the first thing that comes to mind, but unless you have something working from within, chances are those pimples will return in no time. When considering a cleanser for acne-prone skin, it’s important to remember that the things we choose to treat our body’s largest organ, the skin, can yield differing results from person to person. Many acne-fighting topical treatments are intended to rid our complexions of excess oil created by the sebaceous glands.

Why Topicals Alone Won’t Get Rid of Acne Although keeping proper hygiene is an important step in any skincare regimen, especially for anyone with acne-prone skin, the complexity of this condition requires more than just a facial wash to treat, which is why a combination therapy approach is the most effective one to take.

When paired with a twice-daily face wash, a systemic acne solution, such as AcnEase, or prescribed medication, will give your skin the best shot at remaining acne-free. Additional measures you can take to keep your system in check is to implement naturally anti-inflammatory foods to your diet, such as honey, berries, turmeric, and spinach, to curb an overactive inflammatory response on account of our immune systems. Keeping stress levels as low as possible will also go a long way in preventing from hormonal fluctuation freak-outs, and can be improved by regular, quality sleep, as well as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga or qigong exercises as often as possible. .

"[""How to Get the Best Results with AcnEase 01-12-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments If you have just started taking AcnEase ® , congratulations! You’ll be comforted in knowing that we’re not just another trendy acne treatment that may only provide temporary results, at best. With zero side effects and a 96% success rate, this systemic answer to your acne is built on a relatively simple principle: Fight acne causes, not just symptoms. The cause of acne is inside your body- so take your fight inside. However, there are a few things to keep in mind that will ensure that you have the acne-free skin you deserve. How AcnEase Works Acne is viewed as the external manifestation of an internal disorder. AcnEase ® works to restore the internal balance that may be disrupted by any number of factors, including stress, diet, environmental factors or even certain medications. Not only treating the symptoms of acne that appear on the skin, such as pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads, AcnEase ® works to address the underlying cause and targets the source of the problem. Simply put, AcnEase ® treats existing breakouts, and works from within to prevent new ones from forming. Working as a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, which produce the oily substance known as sebum, AcnEase ® treats the problem at the source. Because the AcnEase ® regimen is a treatment, it should be handled as such. It’s important to remember that seeing results means putting in the legwork and because each tablet is made with the same amount of active ingredients, that work has been made pretty easy! Important Steps to Follow to See the Best Results of AcnEase ® Choose the right treatment. AcnEase ® regimens are personalized to target specific types of acne such as mild, severe, hormonal acne, or body acne. Therefore, choosing the right regimen for you is the FIRST step in getting the best results. We’ve created an easy way to do this that takes less than 30 seconds! Take the recommended dose consistently. The second very important step is to take AcnEase ® as recommended, and regularly, without missing or combining the doses. Being consistent will make all the difference, and the results can be seen on your skin in as little as one month if taken correctly. Like learning a new language, or staying in shape, consistency is key if you want to experience real results. The same holds true for your AcnEase ® regimen. A steady supply of the superior herbs that make up AcnEase ® is needed to give your skin it’s best chance. The compliance dose ensures that active ingredients are delivered to the body in an uninterrupted manner, otherwise the improvement can’t really take hold. Sticking to a schedule and taking your dose at or close to the same time every day will ensure that you get the most out of your treatment. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, and resume your normal schedule if possible. If not, take the missed dose two hours after your last dose of the day. The best results come with consistent effort, so maximize the effectiveness with regular doses. Follow instructions! If your recommended dosage is 4 pills 3x/day, this dose was developed and tested to deliver the most effective regimen for your type of acne by delivering a steady stream of ingredients to the body over a 24 hour period. Any more would go out with the waste and any less will not deliver results. So, it is important to follow the dosage instructions and take daily, as recommended. Those with chronic or severe acne may need to increase their dosage, but taking the tablets 3x/day is critical to allow AcnEase ® to work day and night. Take the tablets before a meal if possible or with a meal, but NOT after a heavy meal. The ideal way to take AcnEase ® is with a glass of water about 10 minutes before a meal. This will allow for optimum absorption of the ingredients by the body. If you do not like to take the tablets before meals you can also take AcnEase ® with meals, ideally with a lighter fare such as toast and juice or yogurt. If you take your dose with a fattier meal, the delay in gastric emptying causes more enzymes to be released which can break down the active ingredients in AcnEase ® . So, if possible, it is recommended to take your dose on an empty stomach. However, if doing so does not agree with your body, or if you have a problem with swallowing tablets with water, you can take them with yogurt, cottage cheese, apple sauce, jello or warm cereal. Anything that will disguise the tablets and make them easier to swallow! Adjust your outlook. For us to tell you to be patient and stay optimistic is easier said than done. We know you wanted your acne to be gone as of yesterday. Yet, since acne doesn’t develop in a day or even a week, the chance that it will disappear completely (without the chance of reoccurrence) in a week or two is unlikely. Maybe you’ve tried a ton of treatments that haven’t worked, maybe you’re tired of spending time and money on products, maybe you’re on AcnEase ® right now and are pushing through to get the results you want – it’s important to remember that PREVENTION of acne is what will fix this issue. Prevention fixes the underlying cause, completely breaking the re-occurring cycle. If you continue to have the same outlook of wanting the problem to go away quickly, the cycle may just continue. Focusing on correcting the root cause is what will promote advancement and long-term results . Knowing that AcnEase ® does this without side effects, drying or irritating the skin, or sun restrictions, making it completely safe for anyone with any type of acne to use, usually helps ease tension. So make this an achievement you can be proud of, and do the best you can to stick with the treatment, knowing you whole-heartedly gave it your best effort.

"[""Top 6 Triggers That Can Contribute to Breakouts 06-05-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Most people attribute their breakouts to an overly oily complexion, and they aren’t entirely wrong to do so, but did you know that it takes more than just oil to form a pimple on your complexion? Acne is a disease that affects the skin, and is the most common skin condition in the United States, and does not discriminate based on age, sex, race, or any single identifier. It is normally caused by a hormonal imbalance that triggers an excessive amount of sebum, or skin oil, to be produced by the sebaceous glands. Too much of this oil can become clogged within pores, where it travels from the sebaceous glands to the surface of the skin. But the formation of acne doesn’t stop here! When combined with dry, dead skin cells, bacteria known as P. acnes forms, and triggers an inflammatory response from the body. This process is known as the acne cascade , and often leads to acne symptoms that appear on the surface as red, swollen bumps that we refer to as pimples. As you can see, acne is the result of internal and external contributors, and must be treated with these aspects in mind. We know that too much oil, and dead skin cells from the harmful bacteria that can lead to acne symptoms, and we’ve targeted six triggers that can The Top 6 Triggers Can Contribute to Breakouts Hormones.

Some hormonal activity can’t be immediately changed, but there are some things we can do to keep them under control. Sleep is a major game-changer in this regard because it can affect the adrenal hormone cortisol, which runs along the pathway of testosterone (known for triggering sebaceous glands.) Hormone levels can be negatively impacted by trigger #2. Stress. Stress is known to disrupt a normal hormonal balance, leading the adrenal hormone cortisol to be kicked into overdrive during the day. It causes a serious increase in inflammatory chemicals at a cellular level, and since acne is one form of inflammatory disease, stress will worsen acne, sometimes quite dramatically. Stress can be lowered in a number of ways, from regular, quality sleep to daily meditation practices, to exercise. You can de-stress in an instant by simply allowing yourself to stop and take a couple of slow, deep breaths. It sounds like a little, but it will go a long way in lowering stress levels and ultimately, acne! Diet. When it comes to skin, obviously the old adage reigns true: what you put into your body is going to affect what you see on the outside. The foods we eat can’t cure acne alone, but certain items can work to curb the body’s Inflammatory response. Pimples occur when the body sends in white blood cells to “attack” the bacteria that forms within a clogged pore, therefore, keeping to an anti-inflammatory diet for acne is a crucial step in becoming acne-free. Our favorite anti-inflammatory go-to foods include turmeric, garlic, and ginger. Dry skin. We’ve said it before but it’s always worth repeating: it's not just excess sebum that clogs pores and causes acne. Dead skin cells pair with the sticky, oily substance to form bacteria deep within the pore, so eliminating that will give you a good chance at remaining acne-free. Regular exfoliation, moisturizing, and staying hydrated both on the surface of the skin and from within can go a very long way in keeping your complexion smooth and flake-free. Pore-clogging makeup. The term “non-comedogenic” stems from the word “comedones” which are a type of lesion (or pimple) that can form on the skin. Formulas labeled non-comedogenic are specifically designed to prevent blockage of the pores, an important part of the acne formation process you definitely want to avoid. Taking a few minutes to scan labels for the non-comedogenic seal of approval will be well worth the effort, and additional words to look out for include oil-free, paraben-free, and sulfate-free. Dirty surfaces. While acne is the result of a hormonal issue that must be treated at its source, taking measures to keep the surface of your skin clean will go a long way in preventing breakouts. Getting into the habit of keeping those fingers and hands off the face will help prevent bacteria from settling on the complexion. Changing out those bath towels, hand towels, and pillowcases every week can result in measurable improvements in the texture and appearance of your skin. Resisting the urge to pick or pop will also help prevent the spread of contamination, as the contents of that blemish you’re extracting can spread into surrounding pores, possibly leading to more acne! While the external factors listed can certainly contribute to acne symptoms, acne must be treated at its source in order to experience real results. Finding a combination of solutions to address the inner and outer issues of the disease will be your best bet, with a topical facial wash to cleanse the surface on the outside, and a systemic treatment solution to target the problem from within. AcnEase, a safe and effective herbal treatment, is designed to treat all acne no matter how mild or severe the symptoms. In fact, 96% of AcnEase users say that AcnEase works for them.

"[""The Facts Behind The Acne Statistics 2017 06-05-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Whether you’re just at the start of your acne journey, or have been navigating these waters for a while now, the information you see online and elsewhere may leave you feeling confused. In order to treat your condition, it’s important to understand just how acne affects your skin and body, and what’s really going on when you read those numbers. What is Acne? Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States, and can affect anyone regardless of age, race, or sex. Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands , whose job it is to create sebum, or oil. This oil travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes clogged within a pore and pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria known as P. acnes forms, triggering an inflammatory response from the body. This process is known as the acne cascade, and usually results in red, swollen bumps known as pimples, a symptom of acne. With so much information out there, we know how overwhelming treatment can be, which is why we decided to back up the stats with some real facts to help you stay informed and on the path toward clear and healthy skin! The Statistics Behind Acne 60 million people in the U.S. have acne. This number includes all grades of acne, from the mild, occasional breakout to more severe conditions such as cysts, but of those 60 million, 20% have some form of acne bad enough that it results in scarring on the skin. According to research conducted in 2016, 85% of people surveyed have experienced acne at some form or another at some point in their lives, which makes for an overwhelming majority. Women made up for 80% of adult acne cases studied. Over the past 10 years, the average age of an acne sufferer has increased from 20.5 years old to 26.5 years old. Acne can be very harmful for mental health. Of those surveyed, a staggering 96% of people with acne have reported feeling depressed over their condition. This has lead 46% to develop self esteem issues over their complexions, and has caused 31% from declining to participate in social activities, instead opting to stay home. 14% of acne sufferers have even reported feeling suicidal over their skin, a pain that no one should have to face. As you can see from the numbers listed, acne affects a large amount of people, and while it is still certainly stigmatized and the source of embarrassment for many, please know that you are not alone in feeling frustrated or hopeless. If you are overcoming acne, you are embarking on a journey, a process that can take time, but can absolutely improve. If you are feeling suicidal for any reason, please do not hesitate to speak to someone at The National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255. The breakdown: where do most people experience acne? 99% of people get breakouts on the face. 60% see spots on other parts of the body (most usually the back and butt), and 15% have clogged complexions on their chests. People with active lifestyles tend to see more breakouts on their bodies, but additional factors can play a big part in the formation of pimples as well, such as stress, and hormonal fluctuations during menstruation, pregnancy, or puberty. 30% of acne sufferers rely on over the counter products to “treat” their condition. Americans spend over $3 million dollars a year on acne treatments, and 3 out of every 10 people looking to treat their condition reach for the over the counter topicals to do the trick. While an important part of keeping the surface clean, topical washes and creams, even when medicated, do nothing to actually treat the problem itself, which requires going to the source - the sebaceous glands. When it comes to acne treatments, AcnEase does what most acne treatments fail to address: it targets the problem from within while maintaining a safe experience at every measure, unlike many prescription options, such as Accutane (which is currently off the market due to a class action suit). AcnEase has shown to successfully improve acne in more than 95% of patients in controlled clinical studies because it treats the problem at its source - the sebaceous glands, by creating a buffer between them and any haywire hormones that might trigger excessive sebum production. Combining our expert knowledge with a love for safe, herbal alternative medicines to deliver a truly effective solution to acne, without the side effects, AcnEase is designed to provide relief for any one of the 60 million people living with active acne, no matter how mild or severe their symptoms may be.

"[""The Benefits of Using Honey to Help Your Acne, From the Inside, Out! 06-14-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments There are countless creams, lotions, serums and spot treatments out there to help anyone with acne-prone skin improve their condition, but there’s one natural ingredient that can be effective without worrying about what you’re putting on your body, and it may already be your kitchen. The Sweet Truth About Honey Honey has been used to help with various skin conditions for years, including acne. It is naturally rich in anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, and when used in its raw form (which is how all use of honey for skin care is recommended,) delivers a healthy dose of vitamins, enzymes and phytonutrients that can strengthen the skin. Raw honey is mainly used to moisturize and soothe dry, damaged skin , and its osmotic effect on the skin, which draws out excess fluid in a wound or irritation, can provide temporary relief for inflammatory acne, while reducing redness and even scarring. How Can Honey Benefit Acne-Prone Skin? When it comes to honey and acne, understanding how the inflammatory response of the body affects the skin is knowledge worth knowing. Inflammation is a natural, internal response of the immune system in an attempt to protect itself from foreign irritants, such as bacteria, chemicals, or even foods that one’s body may be inclined to reject. In terms of acne, inflammation can occur when a pore becomes clogged with too much sebum, or oil, and dead skin cells, which combine to form a bacteria called P. acnes . This response can result in red, swollen bumps on your face (pimples) that are often painful and irritating. In order to treat acne, the amount of sebum being produced must be managed, but one way to combat an over-stimulated inflammatory response is to consider the foods that we put into our bodies, and the hygienic practices that affect the surface of our skin. Raw honey can be used to help with this process both internally and externally, through diet or DIY skincare remedies. What are Some Ways to Use Honey to Help Alleviate Acne? Internally - If you’re looking to experience the natural benefits of honey, the best place to start is from within, by adding the sticky treat to your diet. You can take advantage of its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties by simply adding one part raw honey to two parts lemon juice for a quick drink that will help boost the metabolism and detox the body. To add some honey to lunch or dinner dishes, check out these fall-themed acne-friendly recipes that call for the sweet stuff in place of sugar for a healthy option. Like acne or anything else, not all honey is created equal, so you’ll want to take care to reach for raw varieties over the processed stuff you’ll find in that cute, plastic bear. Manuka honey is one type of raw honey that is loaded with health benefits, including amino acids, as well as vitamins and minerals such as manganese and zinc, both of which are known to improve acne-prone skin. Externally - You can also get a lot out of raw honey by putting it directly onto affected areas of the skin, and there is certainly no shortage of DIY recipes out here to choose from, depending on what you hope to achieve. Honey is most often used as a hydrating cleanser or moisturizing mask, but can also work to speed the healing process on broken skin, which can reduce scarring while brightening and lifting existing scars and marks. To create your own exfoliating mask, simply mix equal parts honey and brown sugar into a paste, gently apply to the affected area, and rinse away with warm water after about 10-15 minutes. While honey and other natural ingredients can make your skincare journey toward an acne-free complexion a little easier, the only way to truly treat and prevent acne is to treat the problem at its source - the sebaceous glands. AcnEase® works from within the body to help prevent the sebaceous glands from overproducing sebum, an oily substance that can clog pores in excessive amounts. Using all-natural, herbal ingredients, AcnEase® is gentle on the skin and body, and is safe for use among people of all ages, no matter how severe their acne symptoms , with no side effects! When combined with a topical face wash and a DIY raw honey treatment, AcnEase® will be your skin’s best bet remaining acne-free! We want to hear from you!

"[""Makeup Guide for Acne Part Two: Application 10-20-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Now that you have found the right makeup for your skin, using the Part One of the Makeup Guide , it’s time to get to the fun stuff...applying makeup! Whether you are looking to conceal blemishes and achieve a natural finish, or go all out with a dramatic look, these basic application techniques are practiced by some of the most popular makeup artists and are a cinch to master with some patience and practice. First things first: cleaning your brushes. No great work of art was ever created without the use of proper tools. Applying makeup is no different. Be sure to select the appropriate size and shape brush for each step and product. Using a clean brush to apply concealer, foundation, and powder is absolutely essential for those who live with acne. Dirty brushes are a breeding ground for bacteria. Ideally, clean your makeup brushes at least once a week. The process is simple and brief. Rinse brushes in lukewarm water, being sure to wet only the bristles. Pour a small amount of baby shampoo, or other gentle cleanser such as mild dish soap, into the palm of your hand, swirling the wet brush bristles. You will see makeup and build-up beginning to remove itself from the brush. Run under lukewarm water, repeating the previous step until the brush is clean. Squeeze any water from the bristles, reshape the brush and lay it overnight on a paper towel to dry. This technique will keep your brushes clean, keep bristles healthy and soft, and help avoid any unnecessary irritation of the skin. Application Once your face is clean and you have applied moisturizer and/or sunblock, you are ready to apply your makeup. The four items listed here are only intended to conceal any blemishes and create a smooth canvas. This will allow you to proceed with any blush, contour, or highlighting should you choose to venture into that arena. Primer. A primer does just that-it primes bare skin to be covered with additional layers of makeup. After washing your hands, squeeze a small amount of primer onto the fingertips and apply to the skin, rubbing in gently. Primers can work wonders, forming a lightweight bond between the skin and any foundation you may apply later, but can also be heavy at times. When possible, opt for a water-based primer over a silicone option. Concealer. Concealer can be found in the makeup kit of just about anyone looking to cover red, irritated pimples. For covering inflamed spots, opt for a concealer with green or yellow undertones to combat any redness. Using a small concealer brush, apply a thin layer of concealer to the pimple, and surrounding area. Be sure not to get heavy handed as concealer tends to cake and crease when too much is applied. Dab into the skin with a beauty blender or other makeup sponge. The beauty blender is the secret weapon of many acne-prone makeup wearers and makeup artists. If it does not appear to be fully concealed at this time, just sit tight-more can be added over the next layer. Foundation, tinted moisturizer, BB cream, or CC cream. Any of these creams can be applied to achieve a fuller coverage look on a larger area of the skin, depending on what works best for you and what you are trying to achieve. Tinted moisturizers offer very light coverage, while foundation is used to reach a fuller effect. The emergence in popularity of BB and CC creams in recent years provide additional options, and come with added skin care benefits such as SPF coverage and anti-oxidants. Heavier than a tinted moisturizer yet lighter than a foundation, these creams are perfect for those looking to achieve an everyday look. Use a foundation brush to apply any of these formulas onto the face, then dab into the skin using your beauty blender or makeup sponge, making sure to blend into the hair and jawlines to create a seamless finish. Concealer touch up. After your product of choice has been applied to the rest of the face, go back over any visible red spots using the same technique from Step 2. Powder. Powder is the final step in achieving a flawless finish on the face. Loose mineral powder tends to be best for acne-prone skin, as the opportunity for bacteria to linger on the surface of a pressed compact of powder is more prevalent. However, as with anything, go with what works best for you. The importance of starting with a clean make-up free face will help you achieve maximum results. While concealing existing blemishes is much easier through the power of makeup, treating the source of the problem is the only way anyone with acne will enjoy a real change. Certain types of blemishes such as cystic acne and whiteheads are impossible to cover even with the most professional makeup formulas. Targeting and treating the source of your acne with AcnEase® will save you precious time, money, and trouble in the long run. Although it can take as long as a few months for AcnEase® to yield the desired results (most users see results within the first month), simple makeup tricks and techniques such as these are intended to hold you over in the meantime. AcnEase® is your best defense for healing your skin and eliminating future acne. It addresses the direct causes of acne, counteracting the effects of hormonal imbalance and the overproduction of sebum, stunting the acne cycle.

"[""The Real Deal Behind Hydration and Breakouts 12-04-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Proper hydration is one of the fundamental components of health and most people are aware of the importance of drinking enough water. The vast benefits of water on the various systems of the body range from regulating a healthy weight to reducing muscle cramping, and so much more. One of the greatest benefits hydration has to offer is the role it plays in the healthy functioning of the skin. The largest of the body’s organs, the skin is made up of billions of cells. Like any other type of cells, skin cells require a certain amount of water in order to function properly and staying hydrated yields many benefits for the skin. In terms of appearance, fine lines, wrinkles and pores are more apparent on dehydrated skin. Drinking water hydrates and plumps skin cells, which can appear to fill in any lines. Because water increases circulation and blood flow, hydration aids in proper kidney function, which flushes impurities from the body and results in the ‘rosy glow’ associated with hydration. Getting enough water is an essential part of maintaining a healthy body, and the benefits can certainly be measured on the condition of our complexion. A wealth of health benefits are associated with the consumption of water, however, this alone will not actually affect the formation of acne. The source of acne is linked to a hormonal imbalance that affects the sebaceous glands, which produce the sebum, or oil, necessary to moisturize the skin. The solution for acne can be found in a systemic treatment such as AcnEase ® which targets these over-productive glands and restores the balance of oil secretion. Because water cannot cure acne, a solution that reaches the source of the problem is necessary in combating breakouts. Our bodies are made up of approximately 60% water, and because we are constantly losing water throughout the day, it is important to replenish the supply as needed. Many people are not aware of just how much water they should be intaking on a daily basis. A safe suggestion has always been eight, 8-ounce glasses per day. However, it is important to consider other factors that may require you to drink more or less, such as your weight, the climate in which you live, and how often you exercise. A general rule of thumb is to drink a half ounce to an ounce of water for every pound you weigh. There are also several apps available to help calculate the right amount for you and remind you when to drink. It’s important to note that you should NEVER WAIT until you’re feeling thirsty to hydrate your body, but to maintain a continuous intake of water throughout the day. Most people aren’t aware of how little water they drink, which is why it’s important to keep track until you are in the habit of drinking consistently. One way to build a healthy habit is to get in the practice of drinking water as soon as you wake up. A cup of hot lemon water will not only hydrate your skin, but can jumpstart your metabolism and aid in detoxifying the liver. Lemon is a great way to add flavor and a boost of vitamin C , which can help reduce redness or dark spots on your complexion. Planning a new routine is most successful when we alter it to fit within our lifestyle. If you find yourself on the go often, carry a refillable sports bottle, or if you work from an office chair for a solid 8-hour stretch, be sure to keep a glass at your desk so it’s within easy reach. Like any other healthy routine, balance and consistency are the keys to success, so be sure to set yourself up to succeed with reasonable changes you’ll be sure to keep! As you can see, taking care of yourself from the inside out can result in changes that affect all areas of the body, including the skin. Among countless other benefits, drinking enough water can offer soft, supple skin, and even possibly reduce the flaking of dead skin cells that can clog pores. However, in order to experience long-term results, acne must be targeted at its source, and AcnEase ® , is the best natural way to eliminate acne and break the acne cycle. An all-natural, herbal acne treatment, AcnEase ® works from within, stopping acne before it starts by counteracting the effects of hormonal imbalance and the overproduction of sebum. Designed to work together to address and treat the cause of acne, all herbs used to make AcnEase ® are of the highest quality, and have been extensively tested and proven safe in clinical trials.

"[""Try this tonight if you want to help your acne go away! 04-03-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Reduce Oil, Shrink Pores, Get an Even Skin Tone, Brighten Skin Spring has sprung (sort of!) and with that renewal, our skin also needs some assistance as it begins to get used to the different climate. New issues may arise or not, however, adding a new revitalizing mask to your skincare regimen can be a simple and effective way to help you in your journey to treat acne. Please note that this mask WILL NOT TREAT your acne (you need a TREATMENT to do this) so do not use it as a replacement for a treatment. It will however provide you with another highly effective skincare tip as you're on your way to an acne-free life. Egg White and Lemon Spring Mask Benefits Egg has been used in many cultures and traditions as a symbol of renewal, spring and new life. The egg white reduces excess sebum by shrinking the pores. It will also give your skin a firmer and more even look by greatly reducing larger pores. Lemon brightens and exfoliates. It is a natural source of vitamin C and rich in alpha hydroxy acids. Many of our AcnEase® users use this spring mask around this time of year with great results. So if you're looking for a bit of help before the holiday weekend, here it is . Not only is the mask great for those with acne prone skin of any type, but it's also great for those with: mature or aging skin sun spots uneven skin tone Egg White and Lemon Spring Mask Ingredients: 1 egg white Lemon juice from ½ lemon (remove pits) - If your skin is VERY dry and sensitive , you may add ½ teaspoon of organic olive oil to the mixture. - If you have open cysts on your face , you may want to wait to try this until the cysts are closed and dried up (don't want the lemon juice to sting - this should be an enjoyable experience, not a painful one!). - If you want to use this on other acne effected areas other than your face , you can certainly do so, but just beware of sensitive areas (eyes, mouth, etc). Directions: Beat the egg white first until it turns a bit frothy. Add the lemon juice to your egg white. Apply the face mask on your face with your fingers (make sure your hands are washed), avoiding the eyes and mouth area where the skin is dryer and more sensitive. Leave your face mask on your skin for about 20 minutes. Gently rinse it off with warm water; pat dry and apply a non comedogenic moisturizer. You can do this 1-2 times per week, however, if you are doing an exfoliating mask during the week, do this once per week (and don't do it on the same day that you do the exfoliating mask). Let us know how this works for you. Happy Spring!

"[""Top 5 Ways to Keep Winter from Harming your Acne Prone Skin 02-18-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments For anyone with acne, you probably know by now that treating your skin is a job that needs to be done 365 days a year. However, many people don’t realize that as the weather changes with the seasons, our bodies do too, and this includes our skin. Our skin is the largest organ on our body, and because it is exposed to the world, it also feels the effects of the elements, whatever they may be at any given time of year. During the cold months, the surface of the skin tends to dry out due to freezing temperatures, harsh winds, forced hot air, and an overall decrease in hydration, as people tend to need less water when they’re not sweating as much. Much the same way as how our diet affects acne from the inside, the condition of our skin can trigger certain responses from within the body. When skin becomes too dry, the surface can become flaky, or even crack and break, exposing our bodies to harmful bacteria. The dryness can also indicate to the sebaceous glands that they need to produce more sebum (an oily substance needed for skin to stay moisturized and protected). When these glands produce too much sebum, it can become trapped within the pores, and when paired with dry, dead skin cells or debris on the surface, the pore can become clogged which leads to acne breakouts. Keeping your skin acne-free this winter is not impossible, as long as you have a solution to combat the cold, dry air. These are our top tips for keeping winter from harming your acne prone skin. Note to AcnEase ® users: Some people have asked if they should change their dose during the winter months. Remember, AcnEase ® works 24/7 for you, so you don’t have to change anything if you’re positive that you’re taking the correct regimen for your skin. To be on the safe side, if you haven’t already, you can always check here to see what type of acne you have and which treatment is the best for it . 1. Moisturizing inside and out. By moisturizing the skin with a non-comedogenic moisturizer, the surface of your complexion will keep from flaking and triggering the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum, the oily substance needed for skin to maintain a healthy function. If you can’t resist cranking the heat, try adding a humidifier, at least in the bedroom while you sleep. A lot of moisture can be lost from the skin by lingering in a hot shower on a cold morning, so try keeping the temperatures warm, and shortening the duration. Also, make sure you’re hydrated and if anything, drink some more water! 2. Switching up your formulas. For anyone with acne, finding the right topical solution for your skin usually isn’t something you want to stray from, but finding an alternate to take over once the seasons change might be more beneficial than you think. Harsh chemicals found in many topical acne treatments , such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will often dry even the oiliest complexions to the point of flaking, which will only exacerbate the acne condition. If you can’t live without a wash intended for acne-prone skin, consider switching to a creamy or soap-free formula, and find a fragrance-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer that works for you. If you already have dry skin, reach for a thicker formula until some humidity finally returns to the air. 3. Keeping skin covered. Between the dry, whipping winds outside, and the dry, stagnant air inside, the winter can be a hard time for skin to stay hydrated. In the same way that moisturizing lubricates the skin (be it with a lotion, cream, or tall glass of water), keeping that skin covered allows for a barrier which keeps moisture in, and dry air out. Wearing natural, breathable fabrics such as cotton, hemp or silk can protect the skin indoors, while a scarf made from alpaca, cashmere or pashmina can keep those cold winds off of your face, and lock moisture in. 4. Keeping linens clean. This applies to anything that could possibly come in contact with your face (or chest and back, for those with body acne). Towels, pillow cases, shirts, bras, and scarves should be washed in warm water just as often in the winter as in the warmer months. Bacteria, dead skin cells and other dirt and debris can build up on these surfaces, contaminating skin and possibly clogging pores, which can lead to acne breakouts. 5. Working out. It might be a little tougher to get off that warm and comfy couch and into a gym when temps are near freezing, but working up a sweat is an important aspect in keeping skin healthy. Increasing your heart rate gets your blood pumping, which circulates oxygen to the skin’s cells, and allows the liver to flush waste and cellular debris from the system, detoxifying the body. As always, remember to shower, wash your workout wear, and drink LOTS of water to stay hydrated. Your skin, body and brain will thank you for it! We want to hear from you!

"[""5 Best Ways to Use Aloe to Improve Acne-Prone Skin 06-18-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments You probably know that aloe is the go-to for many when it comes to repairing cut, scraped, or burned skin, but did you know that it can also be used to help improve acne? What is Acne? Before treating acne, it’s important to understand just how this condition affects the body, and skin. Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job it is to create sebum, or oil. This oil travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes clogged within a pore and pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria forms, triggering an inflammatory response from the body. This process is known as the acne cascade , and usually results in red, swollen bumps known as pimples, a symptom of acne. While excess oil certainly needs to be kept under control, stripping the skin of too much can result in dry, flaky skin, which can lead to acne by contributing to the formation of bacteria. This is why it’s important to reduce the hormonal impact on the sebaceous glands from within, while staying clean and hydrated on the surface, the latter of which rings especially true in the summer months, when temps run hot and sun can zap moisture from the complexion . To reduce the risk of external dehydration, aloe can make for a great way to keep your acne-prone skin bump and blemish free, and if you don’t have a live plant on hand, you can find aloe vera gel at most groceries and drug stores. Why Aloe for Acne-Prone Skin? Like many naturally occurring ingredients, aloe can work wonders on the skin for its healing properties. Aloe contains a naturally occurring plant growth hormone known as gibberellins, as well as glucomannan, a polysaccharide, or natural sugar, that improves collagen production when applied topically. Naturally anti-inflammatory and antibacterial, aloe is also rich in vitamins C, E, and zinc, can prevent the clogging of pores by absorbing excess oils, debris, and dead skin cells from the surface of the skin. The Best Ways to Use Aloe for Acne-Prone Skin Facial wash. To remove oil, dirt, and grime from the surface of your skin, simply mix equal parts aloe vera gel and raw honey, adding a few drops of a carrier oil such as jojoba, sweet almond, or even extra virgin olive oil. Mix well, and wash and rinse as you would your regular cleanser. Exfoliant. This scrub will be sure to wash any dead skin cells away while stimulating circulation. Simply mix a tablespoon of sugar in a teaspoon of milk, then add about 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed aloe or aloe vera gel. Stir well, and rub gently in circular motions onto clean skin. Rinse away with lukewarm water, and pat dry with a clean towel. Toner. You can really kick inflammation to the curb by creating an acne-friendly toner with apple cider vinegar (ACV.) To make, mix a splash of ACV with a splash of water, and add about a tablespoon of aloe vera gel, mixing all together well. Dip a cotton ball into the solution and dab over clean skin, rinsing away after about 15 minutes. Mask. Unlike the typical drying clay mask, this acne-fighting treatment will moisturize while it improves, using the power of antibacterial and antifungal tea tree oil. To create, combine a few drops of tea tree oil with about a tablespoon of aloe vera gel, apply to skin, and rinse away after 25 minutes. Acne scar treatment. This trick doesn’t require anything more than going straight to the source - the leaf of an aloe plant. Simply snip off an end with clean scissors or a knife, and rub aloe gel directly onto acne scars before bed, leaving on overnight, and rinsing away with cool water in the morning. While aloe and other topical remedies can go a long way in keep in the surface of our skin clean and soothed, it will do little to treat the condition of acne as it fails to address the root cause - over-producing sebaceous glands. Showing your complexion some love is a skincare step that should never be skipped, but real change occurs from within, and requires a systemic solution if you want to achieve real, lasting results. Luckily, our AcnEase® users are able to have total peace of mind and the opportunity to get the best complexion possible. Why? Because they are on a treatment that actively works from the inside 24/7 to get rid of their acne naturally and with zero side-effects. The herbal ingredients used work to effectively create a barrier between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the amount of sebum needed to protect and hydrate the skin is being produced, making for a gentle treatment that delivers real, long-lasting results, regardless of the severity of your acne symptoms .

"[""Everything You Wish You Knew Before Beginning Your Acne Journey 06-14-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments If you’ve had acne for even a few months you probably already have some experience with the trial and error method of finding the right treatment for your skin. No matter where you’re at on your skincare journey, there are a few things that can help you make some smart choices, and steer you clear of the wrong ones. Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job it is to create sebum, or oil. This oil travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes clogged within a pore and pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria forms, triggering an inflammatory response from the body. The result of that response usually appears as red, swollen bumps known as pimples, a symptom of acne. This process is known as the acne cascade . Therefore, the only REAL way to attaining a clear and healthy complexion is from inside. Most people think that topicals will do the trick when it comes to getting rid of acne. For most, however, treating acne this way comes with years of guessing and wasted money, with little to no real results to show for it. In order to get the skin you dream of, it’s crucial that you understand just what you’re dealing with before going in with a plan of attack. A Few Things to Keep in Mind When Seeking to Treat Acne-Prone Skin Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance. We said it before but it’s definitely worth saying again - while other factors like diet and hygiene can certainly affect acne symptoms, the cause of acne is due to a fluctuation in hormones. The formation of symptoms can be temporarily maintained with washes and spot treatments, but in order to truly prevent acne from returning, you’ll have to target the problem at its cause. (A note to AcnEase users: your treatment is that barrier that prevents hormones from affecting the sebaceous glands, stopping acne before it starts!) There are different types of acne. Like most things in life, no two acne symptoms are created equal, which is why learning and understanding your acne type is an important first step in achieving results. While all acne is caused by an imbalance of hormones, what that means for your skin will mean different things for different people, depending on whether your symptoms are inflammatory (such as pustules, nodules, and cysts,) or non-inflammatory (like blackheads, and whiteheads.) The type of breakouts you have are also a good thing to be aware of. Many people with mild breakouts think that they have mild acne, and might need a mild treatment to combat it, but quite the contrary is true. If you’ve had chronic acne (acne for atleast 1-2 years) you actually have a more severe form, even if you classify the acne as mild. To get an idea of what various symptoms look like, check out this helpful guide to aid you in finding a treatment suited to your needs. A combination approach is the best way to treat acne. The formation of acne is attributed to a process known as the acne cascade , where internal and external factors contribute to the skin condition. It’s important to implement a blend of treatments which target acne from the surface, and from within. A systemic acne treatment, hormonal birth control, and prescription medication is often used to target the insides, while a topical wash, exfoliation regimen, and moisturizer work as an adjunct to the treatment. Here’s a great guide to how you can effectively use a combination approach to getting rid of acne . Different seasons call for different measures. If you live in a climate that experiences four distinct seasons, there’s a very good chance that this change in weather is having a negative effect on your acne-prone skin. Skin tends to dry out in the fall and winter, and become oilier in the spring and summer months, which is important to consider when shopping for a topical acne face wash. Most cleansers are designed to zap oil, which can be harmful in the cooler months when skin is already parched, so you’ll probably want to opt for a gentler formula when the temperature drops. Prescriptions can be very dangerous and should be used as a last resort, and under the direct care of a doctor. Even if they may work to provide short-term solutions, the long-term costs may be very significant, as many prescription medications come with extensive and harmful side-effects, and are not to be used for anyone pregnant or nursing. That being said, prescriptions may be a good fit for someone suffering from severe, chronic acne for years with no relief, just always be sure to do your research beforehand, and let your doctor know if side-effects start acting up. Perhaps the best thing to keep in mind for anyone with acne, regardless of where they might be in their journey is to keep trying. Acne doesn't form overnight and it won’t go away that quickly either, so in the meantime, do your best to find kind and loving things to do for yourself and skin, such as the occasional all-natural pampering , or a momentary meditative reprieve . And if you decide to become an AcnEase user, just remember that it works to deliver lasting results safely and effectively, with no harmful side effects. Using a powerful herbal formula, designed to treat all types of acne , no matter how mild or severe the symptoms may be, AcnEase eliminates existing acne symptoms while preventing new ones from forming before they start.

"[""A Complete Guide to a DIY Spa Day for Acne Prone Skin 01-24-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Now that the hustle of the holidays is behind us, many are left with our energy, complexions and bank accounts drained. Fortunately, treating ourselves to a little rest and relaxation can be as easy as wrapping up in a robe and heading to the bathroom or kitchen. Creating an at-home mini spa session can be easier than most people realize. It only takes a little creativity, a few basic household items, and less than an hour carved out of the day. You’ll experience bliss on a budget and give yourself the gift of some much needed “me time” before tackling all that 2016 has in store. Any or all of these easy, at-home remedies can make for a relaxing experience, perfect for calming the mind, body, and skin. NOTE: AcnEase ® users, keep in mind these tips are not going to get rid of your acne, but will assist while you’re on your treatment. Soak your skin and achy muscles with a salt bath. Epsom salt has long been used to treat sore and achy muscles and joints, and the healing properties of magnesium sulfate apply to the surface of the skin as well. Naturally anti-bacterial in its ability to purge moisture from bacteria, Epsom salt can also dry the skin of excess oils, which is especially great for anyone experiencing breakouts on the back or chest. A handful also works as a wonder exfoliator, and at only a few bucks a bag, you can afford to give your skin the extra attention. Clean pores with hot steam. Creating a mini DIY steam room is as easy as boiling a pot of water! Bring four to eight cups of water to a boil and empty into a large bowl. For a more aromatic experience, consider adding dried lavender or your favorite herbs or essential oils. Drape a large towel over the back of your head and bring your face as close to the water as is comfortable for about five minutes (please be careful and make sure you don’t get so close that the steam burns your skin). The steam from the water will begin to open your pores, which can help loosen clogged debris (which can lead to acne). Purify with a calming treatment mask. As we have stated in earlier blog posts by answering the question is chocolate bad for acne , not all chocolate is bad for an acne-prone complexion. Dark chocolate can provide a wealth of benefits both inside and outside the body. In addition to the antioxidants found in cacao, which can result in a healthy glow in the skin’s appearance, the sweet scent of chocolate can actually trigger the release of serotonin, producing a calming effect on the brain and alleviating stress from the entire body. Creating an at-home chocolate mask is simple and when paired with the lactic acid found in organic yogurt and cream, you can satisfy your milk chocolate craving too, even if it is on the surface of the skin! Please note that if you have a dairy allergy or are trying to temporarily eliminate dairy from your diet, using milk topically on your skin will not affect your condition. Antibacterial honey and exfoliating oatmeal provide an added bonus for acne-prone skin. Milk Chocolate Mask ? cup cocoa powder, unsweetened 3 tbsp organic milk or heavy cream 2 tbsp organic plain yogurt ¼ cup organic honey 2 tbsp raw oats Mix ingredients in a bowl until a smooth, thick consistency is reached. Apply to skin, removing with a warm washcloth after 15-20 minutes. Tighten up with an herbal astringent. When most people think of calming agents, lavender and chamomile immediately come to mind. Both can be used to calm the skin, and help temporarily tighten pores. Calming Chamomile/Lavender Toner 3-4 chamomile tea bags 4 ounces hot water 2-3 drops lavender essential oil Steep tea bags in water, adding oil once bags have been removed. Allow to cool, and then dip a cotton ball in the solution, gently dabbing on clean skin. How to Set the “Spa-like” Stage Emulating a spa-like setting is all about the atmosphere. Opting to treat yourself to a DIY spa day is extra relaxing in a quiet home, so try to make some time when you won’t be disturbed. Soft music or freshly scented candles can transform any bathroom into a temporary tranquil paradise, and hot herbal tea or a tall glass of cucumber water can serve as a hydrating treat to enhance the experience. All of the recommended DIY spa treatments can be done together or separately. They are all mild and should not cause any discomfort to your skin. However, if you should experience any discomfort, stop the treatment immediately and gently wash your skin to remove any residue. Treating acne from the inside 24/7 Whenever we post our tips designed to provide you with a little extra pampering, most of our AcnEase ® users say they don’t have the time to fit this stuff in! It’s important not to stress about trying to find time but to try to keep this top of mind so that if you can squeeze in an hour of pampering, you’ll remember to do so. Our AcnEase® users are also lucky to have total peace of mind and the opportunity to get the best complexion possible because they are on a treatment that actively works from the inside 24/7 to get rid of their acne.

"['Do\'s and Don\'ts to Fighting Acne with Spa Treatments 03-31-2015 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments You\'d be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn\'t enjoy a relaxing day at the spa, and because of this, these facilities are more prevalent than ever. While spa treatments are a great way to get away from it all, they may also be able to help in your fight against acne - as many promote healthy, clear skin. However, finding a treatment that works for you is not as simple as choosing the first thing you see. If you play it smart, though, you may just find something that works as a good supplement to your normal acne-fighting routine. Just remember however, these treatments DO NOT treat acne - they assist an acne treatment. NOTE: AcnEase users see some excellent long term results when they use these tips. Here are four do\'s and don\'ts to consider when choosing the right spa treatment for you. Read up on new spa trends (PS - we\'ve done the work for you!) It seems like every week there is a new spa treatment available for giving customers the best skin quality of their lives. With so many options available, it can be difficult to make a decision about what will work best for you. No worries, though! There are a few spa treatments that stand heads and tails above the others. When in doubt, try one of these: Light Therapy: Anyone who has spent a summer day in the sun knows that light can have a major impact on the skin. However, even artificially generated light can cause changes, and that\'s why spas across the country have begun to offer light therapy to address a number of different problems, including acne. However, light therapy is not as simple as just turning on a desk lamp and waiting for your zits to magically disappear-different wavelengths and different application techniques address specific aspects of a breakout. For example, blue light is a popular choice for reducing the inflammation associated with acne, although a combination of blue and red is sometimes used as well. Are you looking to destroy the bacteria that clogs your pores and spurs on breakouts in the first place? Then you\'ll need rapid bursts of light and heat energy, instead of one long, continuous exposure. Like most good things, light therapy isn\'t an instant fix. Instead, you\'ll need to schedule several follow-up visits to the spa in order to see real results. Microdermabrasion: Microdermabrasion is the perfect spa treatment for helping minimize the appearance of acne scars, but it\'s also great for reducing pores, wrinkles, or other skin blemishes you may be trying to hide. Most generally, microdermabrasion uses a small wand to remove dead cells from the upper layers of the skin in order to allow new, healthy ones to emerge. However, there are two options to consider when thinking about this treatment. The most common and oldest form of microdermabrasion uses a wand tip covered in aluminum oxide crystals, which are heated and blown onto the face. This technique causes dead cells to become loosened, which allows them to be suctioned off the face using the wand\'s vacuum. On the other hand, wands tipped with diamonds work like sandpaper, buffering off the dead skin cells, thanks to the toughness of the material. Regardless of the materials used, you should begin to see a reduction in scarring after a few microdermabrasion treatments. There\'s no need to empty your bank account Spa treatments can get pricey very quickly, especially if they\'re popular and in high demand. So before you invest a significant amount of money in the process, be sure to compare the costs to the benefits you\'ll receive. Additionally, you may not even need a visit to an actual spa to pamper yourself and treat your acne! There are a number of DIY spa treatments you can try right at home that are likely to be less expensive but just as effective. Exfoliating masks are some of the easiest and most common of all the at-home spa projects. From raspberries , to pumpkins , and even cabbage , there are affordable mask recipes that can suit every skin type and leave you feeling rejuvenated and refreshed without emptying your bank account. But why stop at exfoliation when you can have the full-blown spa experience? A mini DIY steam room is only a pot of boiling water away! Bring four to eight cups of water to a boil and empty into a large basin. For a more aromatic experience, consider adding dried lavender or your own favorite herbs or essential oils into the mix. Drape a large towel over the back of your head and bring your face as close to the water as is comfortable for about five minutes. The steam from the water will begin to open your pores, which can help loosen debris clogs that can lead to acne. This approach may not be the same as spending an hour in a real steam room, but it can still make a difference-and it costs a lot less! Do enjoy yourself Going to the spa is not merely a utilitarian activity. You don\'t just visit for skincare - you do it for the luxury and pampering as well, and there\'s nothing wrong with that! Even if you find that your spa treatment does nothing for your acne, it can still be an experience that boosts your morale and self-confidence, which are two important emotional aspects of the fight against breakouts. Even though your life may be dominated by acne, it\'s the only life you get, and it\'s important to enjoy and cherish it to the fullest extent possible. Spa treatments can help make that process easier. How not to overdo it There\'s a reason that the phrase ""everything in moderation"" is so popular - because in most cases it\'s true! This goes for spa skincare treatments too. For example, exfoliation is a common procedure in many spas. When used sparingly, it\'s a process that can help remove dead skin cells, which allows newer, healthier ones to rise to the surface. However, frequent exfoliation can actually make your acne problems worse, since fast cell turnover can lead to irritation and inflammation. Similarly, microdermabrasion can leave your skin feeling raw and sensitive, so it\'s best to give yourself plenty of time in between treatments to recuperate. If you find it difficult to resist the allure of the spa, consider mixing things up every time you visit. Exposing your skin to a variety of different treatments increases your chances of finding something that works, but it also keeps things balanced and reduces the risk of negative side effects from any one given treatment.

Because water increases circulation and blood flow, hydration also aids in proper kidney function, which works to flush impurities from the body, ultimately resulting in the ‘rosy glow’ associated with healthy skin. Wear sunscreen. This should be a daily do for everyone, and if you’ve got acne to contend with, this is a non-negotiable. While natural light does contain essential D vitamins, and can be enjoyed in small doses, too much of those strong UV rays can lead to sunburn, dehydration, hyperpigmentation, permanent scarring, and even skin cancer. With plenty of acne-friendly SPFs on the market these days, there’s no excuse to miss this one -- your skin, and health, will thank you for it. Just make sure you use a sunscreen with the main ingredient being zinc. Very important! Stick to non-comedogenic makeup formulas . All makeup-wearers should be familiar with the terms non-comedogenic, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and oil-free, especially anyone with acne. Makeup can be worn during the summer months, but it may take a little switching up from fall, winter, or even Springtime formulas to prevent clogged pores (and runny looks.) Applying with a light hand will be your best bet this summer, as will the use of a primer before applying foundation, concealer, or heavy powders. Exfoliate with ease. Removing dead skin cells from the surface of your complexion is a must-do for keeping pores clean, but those gritty formulas you may have relied on to get you through the winter may be a little too harsh for sun-kissed summer skin. Sticking to gentler formulas, such as a gel or enzyme-based variety can make a major improvement in your exfoliation game, or you can create your own gentle exfoliant by mixing beta carotene-rich apple cider vinegar with naturally exfoliating baking soda. Simply mix equal parts ACV and baking soda until a paste-like consistency is formed. Apply to affected areas of the skin, and rinse away with warm water after about 15-20 minutes, patting the skin dry with a clean towel. Make your snacks work for you! Summertime usually has people on the go, doing more outdoor activities while the weather is nice and warm enough to permit it. Oftentimes, when we’re running around, our nutrition can fall to the wayside, but certain snacks can not only fill us up, but work with our skin type. Keeping anti-inflammatory snacks on hand throughout the day can keep us hydrated on those hot, active afternoons, and also assist with curbing the inflammatory response of the body that happens when harmful bacteria forms within a clogged pore. Easy options include berries of all kinds, cherry tomatoes, nuts, and green juice, or any snack containing leafy green veggies. Easy changes that can have a positive impact on acne-prone skin for the summer, but in order to truly treat acne, you’ll need to address the root cause - over-productive sebaceous glands. Staying smart about what we’re putting in, and on, our bodies and skin is a skincare step that should never be skipped, but real change occurs from within, and requires a systemic solution if you want to achieve real, lasting results. Luckily, our AcnEase® users are able to have total peace of mind and the opportunity to get the best complexion possible. Why? Because they are on a treatment that actively works from the inside 24/7 to get rid of their acne naturally and with zero side-effects. The herbal ingredients used work to effectively create a barrier between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the amount of sebum needed to protect and hydrate the skin is being produced, making for a gentle treatment that delivers real, long-lasting results, regardless of the severity of your acne symptoms, including breakouts that appear on the body .

"[""Can Using Systemic Antibiotics for Treating Acne Endanger Your Health? 06-28-2017 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski & Dr. James P. Gilligan 0 Comments The majority of people at some point in their lives experience acne. Acne is not confined to puberty or teenagers, but impacts adults as well. In fact, during the past decade the average age of the acne sufferer increased by 5 years from 21 years old to 26 years old. Treatment options vary from a wide spectrum of topical products to systemic drugs including broad-spectrum antibiotics. Since there is much discussion about the over-use of antibiotics and since prescribing antibiotics for acne sufferers is quite prevailing, we decided to explore in more details and in a more friendly way the rationale for the use of systemic antibiotics and the potential perils associated with wide spread use of these compounds for acne. In order to understand the rationale for the use and usefulness of different acne products to actually help the acne problem, a better understanding of what causes acne is in order. Although the clinical manifestation of acne is quite simple, acne is actually a rather complex disease and cannot be attributed to a single factor. What is driving the formation of pimples is more complicated than the physical symptoms that appear on the skin. The common denominator in all cases of acne is the over production of sebum by the sebaceous glands, which can lead to clogged pores . As dead skin cells accumulate within these pores, an ideal environment for the growth of bacteria is generated, often resulting in acne symptoms such as pimples, pustules and cysts. The cause of this over secretion of sebum, an oily substance, varies considerably from person to person. For instance, for women with overactive adrenal glands, the cause of their acne can be linked to the elevated levels of testosterone (an androgen) found in the bloodstream. Adolescents undergoing a growth spurt have very high hormonal levels, as do menstruating women. For some, genetic variation is a large contributing factor. If parents had acne, it is likely their children will also have acne. There is simply no single component to easily label the definitive cause of all acne, however, again, one common denominator is the over production of sebum by the sebaceous glands. Once pores are clogged and bacteria is growing, this stage may represent a time when antibiotics may be helpful in treating existing pimples but certainly has no impact on new pimples forming. To better understand a logical approach to treating and preventing acne, we can divide acne into several stages of development: First is the over-secretion of sebum (skin oil) by the sebaceous glands. Under normal circumstances, sebum travels along the hair follicle to the surface of the skin. With acne, the normal transport of sebum out of the follicle is impeded, leading to an accumulation of the oily substance in the pores. Pores in the skin become clogged with excess sebum and dead skin cells (seen as whiteheads and blackheads.). Bacteria ( P.acnes ) can begin to grow in these clogged pores. Excess oil, paired with dead skin cells makes for an enriched breeding ground for bacteria. The body sends in white blood cells (inflammatory cells) to kill the bacteria. Designed to fight off infection, the immune system targets the area of the skin that is affected. Formation of pustules and papules with redness surrounding the pimples. This is the physical symptom of the inflammatory acne condition. Inflammation spreads outside the pore to surrounding tissue to form cysts, the most severe form of acne. Formed under the skin, this painful variation of acne is often the most difficult to treat. When considering treatment options, it is important to understand what stage of acne they impact. For certain products like the systemic antibiotics (tetracycline, minocycline, and doxycycline) along with topical antibiotics, it is clear that they interfere with the third step which relates to the growth of bacteria trapped in the pores. They DO NOT change the sebum production and therefore they really address the part of the symptoms (potential inflammation resulting from the clogging) not the original cause of acne. This also means that they need to be most likely used for a long time – that is until such an overproduction exists. Unfortunately, the use of systemic antibiotics (including some heavy lifter like Cipro) is also associated with a growing concern of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Although the primary bacteria associated with acne is P.acnes , the use of systemic antibiotics can lead to the growth of other bacteria that can become antibiotic resistant. There are additional broad-spectrum antibiotics like erythromycin and clindamycin that are prescribed for acne, contributing to the development of “super bugs” that mutate and no longer respond to standard antibiotic therapy. For individuals with severe acne characterized by pustules and papules caused by growing bacteria, a short term use of a systemic antibiotic might be justified, however the chronic use of antibiotics to treat acne appears to be ill advised. The lack of rationale stems from the fact that the use of antibiotics will not prevent new pimples from forming but rather is only effective once acne pimples have formed. The second reason for limiting chronic use of antibiotics is the danger of developing antibiotic resistant bacteria. Clearly a more rational approach to treating acne is to prevent the over secretion of sebum and thereby prevent pores from becoming clogged and pimples forming. The all-natural herbal ingredients present in AcnEase help reduce sebum production and prevent new pimples from forming. Sparse use of topicals and over the counter antibiotics, that have antibacterial activity, represent a good combination to help with treating existing acne pimples. Bottom line message is that systemic antibiotics intervene too late in the acne cascade to serve as a reliable safe method to prevent acne from forming . A more logical approach is to intervene earlier in the acne development process with a product such as AcnEase that will prevent the formation of both comedones (white heads and black heads) as well as pimples.

"['Can Essential Oils Help Fight Acne? 11-15-2014 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Essential oils - the fragrant essences extracted from plants - have long been a staple of aromatherapy, but is it possible that they could help improve your acne as well? As you\'ll see, the answer to this question is not so clean-cut. It\'s true that they can be an effective supplement for your skincare routine, but there are also a few precautions to keep in mind when using them. The Potential Benefits of Essential Oils for Acne Treatment Many of the commonly used essential oils have powerful antibacterial properties - including tea tree oil, lavender oil, and bergamot oil. Since breakouts partially occur because acne-causing bacteria become trapped inside our pores, you can see why these might be useful. Additionally, many other oils also have a drying effect on the skin, which is perfect for those who are constantly battling oily skin. Some popular choices for this include rosemary oil, geranium oil, and rose oil. The advantage to taking an essential oil-based approach to acne treatment is that many of these can be mixed and matched until they\'re tailored to your own unique skincare needs. So, for example, if you\'re looking for a treatment that is both antibacterial and has a drying effect, you might find success with a combination of the oils listed above. The Drawbacks of Essential Oils for Acne Treatment If you\'ve been dealing with acne for any length of time, then you\'re already familiar with the burdens of sensitive skin. Unfortunately, when used carelessly, essential oils can make these skin sensitivity problems even worse. Since essential oils contain highly concentrated plant extracts, many times they\'re simply too powerful to be applied undiluted to the skin - and this is especially true for oils that are highly acidic or astringent, such as lemon tree oil or bergamot oil. When exposed to substances such as this, it\'s not uncommon to experience painful rashes, itching, and burning. So, in order to safely use them for a skincare regimen you will first need to dilute them with a ""carrier"" oil, which is used specifically for this purpose. Luckily, there are several skin-friendly options to choose from, such as grapeseed or olive oil. Both of these provide your skin with an array of nourishing nutrients and will protect you from the potency of essential oils. If possible, choose an organic carrier oil to ensure that the product you\'ve chosen is really natural and not filled with additional chemicals. You might be surprised to learn just how little of an essential oil should be used when creating a mixture. Most experts recommend that essential oils comprise no more than 2% of your final concoction - which means you should use about 12 drops of essential oil for every ounce of carrier oil. However, if your skin is particularly sensitive, you may want to begin with as little as 1% (or 6 drops). A Final Consideration While you may find success in treating current breakouts with essential oils, it\'s important to remember that they do not address the primary causes of acne. Because of this, it\'s best to think of them as a means of ""damage control"" and not a permanent solution to your acne problems. In order to truly be rid of your breakouts, you must focus on the unseen, internal origins of acne. For many people, the trouble starts with their hormones. When high levels of androgen are present in the bloodstream, it can send a message to your skin to begin producing more oil. This excess oil (also known as sebum) clogs your pores and allows acne-causing bacteria to flourish. Thankfully, products such as AcnEase have found a way to address this problem in a safe and natural way. AcnEase is not a hormone replacement, and neither is it a way to manipulate your hormone levels - instead it prevents androgens from sending its signals to your skin with a proven blend of plants and other all-natural substances. So, while essential oils may be an effective and sweet-smelling way to reduce damage from breakouts, until you start to treat the primary causes of acne it\'s very likely that your problems will persist.

"[""Does Blue Light Therapy Really Work to Get Rid of Acne? 05-17-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments People are always searching for the next big thing in skincare, from anti-aging technology to treatments that leave you looking like you’ve just returned from a relaxing vacation. For those with acne-prone skin, most are up for trying anything in the hopes of finding some sweet relief from stubborn breakouts. Lately, acne sufferers are looking to blue light treatments to clear their complexions, but does it really work? What is Acne? Before treating acne, it’s important to understand just how this condition affects the body, and skin. Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job it is to create sebum, or oil. This oil travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes clogged within a pore and pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria forms , triggering an inflammatory response from the body. This process is known as the acne cascade, and usually results in red, swollen bumps known as pimples, a symptom of acne. What is Blue Light Therapy, and How Does it Work to Fight Acne? Blue light is, quite simply, a type of visible light. It can be found in sunlight, and provides that glow on those phones and computers we all tend to spend a little too much time on. Unlike red, orange, yellow and green lights, blue light rays have shorter wavelengths, making them stronger and more energy-packed than those lights at the opposite end of the light spectrum. In terms of acne, treatments involving light therapy operate under the premise of diminishing the level of acne-causing bacteria known as Propionibacterium acnes, or P. acnes, on the skin and in the pores. This bacteria often results in swollen pimples after the body sends in white blood cells to fight off the “infection,” so blue light works to rid the pores of such bacteria, thereby preventing the inflammatory response that can result in breakouts. Blue light is said to be capable of killing 99.99% of acne causing bacteria with multiple professional treatments, and can usually work to provide temporary relief from milder acne breakouts. Because this treatment is rising in popularity, several at-home kits have since been developed to allow for a less expensive alternative to the treatment that won’t require a doctor’s appointment. These kits, however, not only rely on the use of blue light, but also infrared light, which has been known to temporarily shrink the size of the sebaceous glands - and with it, oil production. This sounds like it should eliminate acne, but tampering with the sebaceous glands can create potentially devastating changes within the body. Some patients report prolonged stinging or burning sensations, over-sensitivity to sun or indoor bright light, and over dryness, redness and peeling of the skin. Infrared (IR) radiation is an invisible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum adjacent to the long wavelength of the visible light range and extends to the microwave range, and it needs to be said that there is a profound difference between using infrared light under medical supervision as a part of cosmetic surgery, to stimulate collagen production, for instance, and using it to treat acne symptoms using at-home devices. If you are considering exploring what blue light at-home, or in office, treatments can do for your skin, it is advised that you consult a medical professional first to become aware of the possible side effects of such devices. The Verdict Blue light treatments can allow for a temporary improvement of the condition of acne, and have produced some positive results in working to eliminate acne bacteria. This bacteria, however, is known to grow back fairly quickly, making it an ineffective means of treating acne and breaking the cycle of acne once and for all. While it may improve symptoms, it can’t technically treat the medical condition of acne, which is caused by a hormonal imbalance that causes the sebaceous glands to overproduce sebum. Light treatments can make for a helpful addition to existing acne treatments, particularly for anyone attending an event that might seek to banish a last-minute blemish, but certainly won’t make for a replacement for an internal acne treatment. The only way to attack acne is by going to the source - the sebaceous glands - and this is what our AcnEase users enjoy. A systemic solution, AcnEase works by creating a buffer between the sebaceous glands and hormones to ensure that only the amount of sebum needed to maintain healthy skin is being created, AcnEase works to prevent acne before it starts, while simultaneously treating existing acne symptoms. Since AcnEase is always working for you, no matter how mild or severe your acne symptoms may be, it can actually help ease the seasonal transition’s effects on your skin, allowing you to enjoy your warmer days worry-free, and acne-free as well.

"[""Makeup Guide for Acne Part One: What to Look For 10-19-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Shopping for makeup can be overwhelming. There are so many options to consider such as color, coverage and feel. When you tack on the added pressure of finding a formula that is suitable for acne-prone skin, experimenting with makeup can end up doing more harm than good. While makeup shopping for acne-prone skin can seem daunting at first, it is certainly not impossible, especially when you know what to look out for. Whether you prefer to reach for high-end brands, or stick with the more economic formulas, you definitely have many opportunities to find the right solution for you. The first step in shopping for the right makeup for acne prone skin is becoming familiar with some key terms. Non-comedogenic. The term “non-comedogenic” stems from the word “comedones” which are a type of lesion (or pimple) that can form on the skin. Formulas labeled non-comedogenic are specifically designed to prevent blockage of the pores, an important part of the acne formation process you want to avoid. Combined with an excessive production of sebum, an oily substance formed at the base of the hair follicle, a pore clogged with anything from dead skin cells to makeup creates the perfect environment for acne to form and spread. Paraben-free. Parabens are used as preservatives, and intended to give longer shelf lives to everything from makeup to toothpaste, and a whole lot more. Parabens have been known to irritate the skin, especially if it is already sensitive, and have even been linked to breast cancer. Sulfate-free. Another ingredient commonly found in hygienic and cosmetic products is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, or SLS. During the manufacturing process, SLS is contaminated with a carcinogenic by-product. SLS can irritate the skin and eyes, is toxic to body organs and can be linked to cell mutations and cancer. (Please note that many shampoos and conditioners still contain sulfates!) Oil-free. For those who already have oily skin, this term should be a no-brainer. The cause of acne is due to a hormonal imbalance which triggers the sebaceous glands to produce more oil and the last thing those with oily skin want to apply to their face is more oil. It is always important to check the ingredients on these labels just to be safe. Much of what is marketed to consumers is just that-marketing buzzwords-but the declaration of any of the above stated terms is a good sign that you’re on the right path. Perhaps more important than knowing what to look for, is knowing what to avoid, and unfortunately for consumers that list is seemingly endless. To keep it simple, it’s best to remember a few common terms, and look for them either in the prefix or suffix of ingredients. Paraben. Parabens are easily identified with names like methylparaben, propylparaben, isoparaben, or butylparaben. Used to prolong the shelf-life of cosmetics, these ingredients are essentially useless, as you really shouldn’t be using any products that are more than a year old. Isopropyl. Also known as stearic acid derivatives, isopropyl ingredients are esters of isopropyl alcohol, which dry out the skin and are known to clog pores. Oil. Again, oily products are easy to spot as the name is clearly listed. These are not recommended for use by people who already have oily, acne-prone skin. Lanolin. Although not so obvious, lanolin is an oil derived from lamb’s wool. Lanolin can irritate sensitive skin and lead to clogged pores. Sulfate. Used for its soaping agencies, these products tend to build up on the skin, clogging pores. D & C Red dyes. A pigment derived from coal tars, these dyes have been known to cause acne. Tips for Acne Make-up: Avoiding further damage. If you have been using a product, any product - and your acne seems to be getting worse, discontinue use and make a note of the main ingredients. To make sure you recognize the WRONG product ALWAYS introduce new products one at the time with at least 3-5 days in between adding another one. This is a period that is needed to clearly identify if a particular product is a “ friend or foe”. Knowing which ingredients to look for and which to avoid gives you a solid base for selecting the best products for you and your acne-prone skin. Generally speaking, we recommend that those with acne-prone skin stay away from heavy, chemical-based products. How to conceal acne , there are four common techniques used to camouflage the face with minimal irritation. Please experiment with the products and steps below and determine what is best for you. Primer. Like any canvas, priming the surface allows for a smooth application of the product, and results in optimal staying power. Choose a primer without the color but ultra-smoothing texture such as YSL’s Touche Éclat Blur Primer or one with light-diffusion properties in a shade tone lighter than your skin such as L’Oréal’s Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream. Concealer. Used to cover redness or scarring. Choose a lighter texture and remember to blend it well. Select a shade that is half a tone lighter than your skin and foundation works better than darker concealers. For red marks, rosacea and active acne breakouts, you may try a concealer with green tones that will camouflage the red overtone of the skin. Many concealers that are intended for acne-prone skin are also designed to treat breakouts with a low dose of salicylic acid. Be mindful when using products with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide as they tend to dry out the skin, causing the skin to produce more skin oil which leads to additional breakouts. They are also known to cause allergic reactions. Foundation, tinted moisturizer, BB cream, or CC cream. These are for overall coverage, and day or evening make-up needs. Select a product with medium coverage for evening and light coverage for daytime. You can always layer them and re-apply the foundation to obtain more complete cover without a heavy or cakey look. Contouring and blush. Use lightly and avoid spots not affected by acne breakouts so you do not underline them. Focus on the apples of the cheeks. Powder. Applying loose or pressed powder with a clean brush will set the aforementioned products, keeping everything in its place. More on how to apply these products in Part Two of this article! You can get the maximum results out of your products by starting with a clean palate and tools. Always be sure to wash and moisturize your face before applying makeup, using a gentle, non-comedogenic cleanser and moisturizer. Wait few minutes after you moisturize so it has a chance to be absorbed into the skin. Remember to ALWAYS remove all makeup before going to bed. By keeping your makeup brushes clean and changing them often, you greatly reduce the chance of old makeup, dirt, bacteria or oil buildup clogging the pores and leading to breakouts. In addition to these tips, the most important way you can contribute to the health of your skin is to stay consistent with your skincare routine and pairing it with a systemic treatment like AcnEase®, which combats both the symptoms and causes of acne. AcnEase® addresses the underlying cause of acne and neutralizes excess hormones, leaving your skin clean, healthy and acne-free. Our all-botanical ingredient based formula doesn’t contain any harsh chemicals and there are no side effects. AcnEase® is recommended for people of all ages, complexions and gender and can even be used by pregnant and nursing mothers. AcnEase® will not react with any type of make-up so it can be used with any brand or type you choose. What are your makeup tips?

"[""If You Really Want to Get Rid of Acne, Start Doing These Two Things Now 05-19-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When most people think of treating acne, facial washes and spot treatments are often the first, and sometimes only, things to come to mind. Because acne isn’t just the result of a dirty complexion , however, it’s important to look to the source, stay informed, and keep your head in the game in order to witness real results. What is Acne? The condition of acne actually begins forming beneath the skin long before we witness symptoms on the surface, and is actually attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands. These glands work to create sebum, or oil, which travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. A hormonal imbalance or fluctuation can cause the sebaceous glands to go haywire, producing more sebum than is necessary, which can become clogged within a pore. When this sebum pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria known as P. acnes can become formed, which triggers an inflammatory response from the body. The result of that response usually appears as red, swollen bumps such as pimples or cysts, although symptoms of this condition can come in many forms, including whiteheads, blackheads, comedones, or even just oily skin. So now that we know what acne is and how its symptoms are formed, what can be done to treat this condition? Before you even start thinking about your skin, the first thing anyone with acne should be doing is looking within, in more ways that one! First thing’s first, it’s time to focus. A positive mindset can be your best friend along this skincare journey, which can last anywhere from months to years, depending on the type of acne you’re dealing with. For example, if you’ve had chronic acne, whether mild or severe it just isn’t going to go away overnight, which is why it’s important to be as patient as possible, and do your best not to cut yourself or your progress down before you’ve made progress. Healing the skin is a process that takes time, and could take anywhere from 1-3 months (if not longer) to see results, so allow yourself some room and time to improve. Finding an approach that works for you will be the best way to stay the course, and you’ll likely be less tempted to make excuses to skip on your routine, so if a 10-step nighttime ritual is likely to cause you to fall off of your path, limit topical treatments to just the essentials and just do your best. Working toward a goal takes a certain amount of willpower, and by setting yourself up to succeed by taking small, manageable steps, you’re more likely to end up where you want to be while still feeling good about the work you’re doing along the way. In addition to keeping your head in the game, combating acne will take work on the surface of the skin, as well as from within, which is why a combination therapy approach to treating acne is the only real way to witness long-term results. Keeping your complexion free of dirt, excess oil, and dead skin cells will go a long way in the prevention of clogged pores. This can be done with twice-daily cleansings, moisturizing, and possibly some additional exfoliation, depending on your skin type. Because acne starts from within, however, the problem must be targeted at it’s source in order to experience real results, and AcnEase does just that. So just how does AcnEase work to treat acne from within? By using safe and effective herbal ingredients, AcnEase works to create a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the amount of oil needed to properly hydrate the skin is produced - no more, no less. This means no harmful side-effects as the function of the hormones will not become affected by treatment, and because it limits the amount of sebum produced to only what’s needed, you won’t have to play those frustrating guessing games with a topical wash that may over-dry the skin. AcnEase is formulated to treat all types of acne , from blackheads to bacne to cysts, mild or severe, and with a 96% user success rate , it can make for a great solution for anyone with especially stubborn symptoms who have struggled to find relief elsewhere.

"[""Acute vs Chronic Acne: How to Identify in Order to Treat 05-23-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When most people experience a breakout, the only thing on their mind is getting rid of it as soon as possible, whatever it takes. While we all want to experience our clearest and healthiest skin possible, the best way to get those results is to find a treatment that’s right for your skin, and that starts with identifying just what type of acne symptoms you have. Acne is a disease that affects the skin, and is the most common skin condition effecting people of all ages. It is normally caused by a hormonal imbalance that triggers an excessive amount of sebum, or skin oil, to be produced by the sebaceous glands. Too much of this oil can become clogged with pores, where it travels from the sebaceous glands to the surface of the skin, and when combined with dry, dead skin cells, form bacteria. This bacteria, known as P. acnes, triggers an inflammatory response from the body, which lead to acne symptoms that appear on the surface as red, swollen bumps often referred to as pimples. For some, their symptoms come and go in short spurts, while others experience breakouts over a longer period of time. These two types can be classified as acute, and chronic acne, and understanding the difference between the two might make for better results on your acne-prone skin. Acute vs Chronic : How to Tell the Difference, and What to do About It First thing’s first: what’s the difference? To put it simply: when we refer to acute acne, we’re speaking of shorter-term breakouts, while chronic acne typically refers to acne symptoms that last for two years or more. Both types begin forming days before a breakout will appear on the surface of the skin, and can often become triggered by certain types of food, seasonal changes, and especially hormonal fluctuations, such as pregnancy or menstruation. Some people may even have certain genetic predispositions such as higher levels of testosterone that may trigger the formation of acne. Despite what’s going on under the surface, acute symptoms may appear suddenly and without much warning, while chronic symptoms can seem to stick around way past their welcome, whether mild or severe. Whatever the underlying cause, the best way to see results is to treat each type accordingly. Steams, toners, and drying masks tend to be good choices for anyone experiencing acute acne symptoms as they work to clear pores while shrinking pimples without over drying. Chronic acne can really benefit from longer-term lifestyle changes, such as implementing an acne-friendly diet , making hygienic practices a priority (this means resisting the urge to pick or pop, keeping pillowcases clean, and showering after exercise or working up a sweat,) and sticking to your skincare regimen no matter what. Of course, different types of acne will require different types of treatment, which is important to keep in mind so you don’t become frustrated if your skin takes a little bit longer to heal. If you’ve had chronic acne, even if it’s mild, it’s more of a moderate to severe case. Healing the skin is a process that takes time, and could take anywhere from 1-3 months (if not longer) to see results, so allow yourself some room and time to improve once you’ve found a treatment that works for you. (AcnEase users: check out this easy guide for making the most out of your AcnEase treatment! ) Whatever your acne type, and however seldom or frequent your symptoms may appear or last on your complexion, all acne must be treated at its source in order to experience real results. Finding a combination of solutions to address the inner and outer issues of the disease will be your best bet, with a topical facial wash to cleanse the surface on the outside, and a systemic treatment solution to target the problem from within. AcnEase, a safe and effective herbal treatment, is designed to treat all acne no matter how mild or severe the symptoms . In fact, 96% of AcnEase users say that AcnEase works for them.

"[""Does Dermablading help Acne-Prone Skin? 05-29-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Regardless of the season, some people with acne-prone skin look to shed a few layers for the good of their complexion with a process called dermablading. To put it simple, dermablading is a procedure that rids the surface of the skin of dry, dead cells. Using a surgical scalpel, a licensed aesthetician or dermatologist removes these dead cells by essentially scraping them away, applying short, light strokes to the surface of the skin after washing the face and applying an alcohol solution. The result? A pile of dead skin, a renewed and youthful glow, and a complexion free of pore-clogging debris. What is Acne? Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States, and can affect anyone regardless of age, race, or sex. Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job is it to create sebum, or oil, which travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes produced it can become clogged within a pore, and when paired with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria known as P. acnes can form, which triggers an inflammatory response from the body. The result of that response usually appears as red, swollen bumps such as pimples or cysts, although symptoms of this condition can come in many forms, including whiteheads, blackheads, comedones, or even just oily skin. Many topical treatments are aimed at eliminating oil, but because the formation of bacteria relies on those dead, flaky skin cells to occur, exfoliation should be just as high of a priority in anyone’s external skincare regimen. Dermablading takes the removal of these cells a step further, and because it is performed by a professional, often reduces the further spread of acne-related bacteria. How Can Dermablading Benefit Acne-Prone Skin? Exfoliation. Out with the old and in with the new - this is exactly what exfoliating will do to your skin. By removing old skin cells, new, healthy skin cells are able to rise to the surface and replace them, which is especially important for anyone with super oily skin that may hold onto dead weight. This cellular turnover can also work to reduce the appearance of dark spots and scarring over time, and most importantly, reduces the risk of pores becoming clogged, which can lead to breakouts. Increases circulation. By increasing blood circulation under the surface, the body is better able to break down harmful toxins that may harm the function and appearance of our skin. Allows topical products to penetrate more effectively. Whether it’s a sunscreen, night cream or topical acne medication, the removal of dead skin through dermablading allows for the active ingredients of these products to penetrate the surface of the skin easier, which can ultimately mean less use of product with more immediate payoff. Dermablading is definitely not a procedure for everyone, and for those with particularly severe or painful breakouts or cysts, it may cause even more discomfort. Because exfoliating is an important part in maintaining healthy skin it isn’t a step that should be skipped, and luckily there are several gentle and all-natural remedies you can whip up from the comfort of your own home. Our favorites include this cranberry facial scrub , which can even calm redness and irritation, and this apple cider vinegar and baking soda mask for those days when you may have a few extra minutes to indulge in some good skincare. The verdict! While keeping the surface of our skin as clean and free of flakes as possible can go a long way in helping keep your complexion clear, treating the source of the problem is the only way to truly rid yourself of the issue. Think about it! Acne is an internal issue that manifests itself externally. So even if you made dermablading or deep exfoliation a regular part of your skincare routine, unless the condition is treated at its source, the sebaceous glands, acne symptoms will always return. The only long-term solution that will keep your skin looking and feeling its best is to prevent acne before it starts, which means breaking the acne cycle, and this is exactly what AcnEase® does. No matter how mild or severe your symptoms may range , our users are able to experience clear skin (long term!) knowing that there are no chemicals that will alter their hormones, and that they won’t experience side effects.

"[""The 4 Most Detoxifying Exercises for Acne-Prone Skin 05-29-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Anyone with acne knows that clear, healthy skin starts with clean pores. While there are plenty of products out there to cleanse from the surface, there are a handful of exercises that can work to stimulate the detox process from within in the body, making for a gentle way to take care of yourself and your skin! It probably goes without saying, but when the body is healthy, everything benefits, from our immune systems to our mental condition to our complexions. Working up a good sweat can cleanse pores of excess sebum and debris, and getting that heart rate up will not only increase blood flow, delivering oxygen to your cells - skin cells included - but can also encourage the function of the liver, eliminating harmful toxins from the body, from within or on the surface. Additionally, regular exercise has been known to lower stress levels, which means good things for anyone with hormonal acne. The Best Exercises for Detoxifying Acne-Prone Skin Yoga. Yoga makes for a great way to stretch, tone, and build lean muscle, and when it comes to your skin, the benefits go even deeper. Because yoga focuses on the breath it has been known to lower stress levels and stabilize blood sugar and insulin levels, which can make a big impact on anyone experiencing hormonal acne. Most communities offer donation-based classes too, so if you’re looking to explore the benefits of this ancient practice just look around your neighborhood for a studio near you! Pilates. Pilates is a group of exercises that helps you to condition your body in way that enables toning, strength building (especially core strength), flexibility, balance and body realignment. There are five principles of pilates: breath, concentration, flow, control and precision. In practicing pilates, you can learn to put these principles into practice both during exercise and in your everyday life to keep stress levels low, inviting patience and acceptance in. Qigong. Much like yoga and pilates, qigong works to connect the body and mind through the flow of the breath, and because of the meditative element involved it is a great way to lower stress. Widely accepted as an important form of alternative medicine, qigong is known to enhance the immune system by working to improve the cardiovascular and digestive systems, both of which aid in detoxifying the body. Light cardio. It’s no secret that cleansing the pores of excess sebum and harmful debris will go a long way in maintaining a bump-free complexion. By getting the blood circulating with some cardiovascular exercise, you can work up a sweat to eliminate harmful waste and toxins from the body through the pores. If you’re going to run or bike it out, however, don’t push it too hard, as too much intense exercise has actually been known to stimulate testosterone production , a hormone that can affect the sebaceous glands. If cardio just isn’t your thing, you can still purge those pores with a nice, gentle steam, which makes for the perfect prep before treating the skin to a clay or DIY facial mask. You can find our favorite, simple and effective pore cleansing herbal steam bath recipe here ! If you’re going to add a gentle workout to your skincare routine, it’s important to take a few simple preventatives and post-work out measures to ensure the best results for your complexion . Always be sure to remove makeup before you get started, and do your best to avoid touching your face or hair with your hands while working up a sweat. After you’ve finished, take care to wash your face, body and workout clothing to reduce the risk of clogging the pores. And as always, stay hydrated! Drinking water can also promote detoxification, so be sure to drink up! It’s important to keep in mind that tips such as the ones listed above can go a long way in alleviating symptoms, but don’t actually do anything to address the cause of acne - which starts from within. The only way to truly treat acne is to target the problem at the source, which is the impact of the hormones on the sebaceous glands. Fortunately, this is exactly what AcnEase works to do. Acne is a usually the result of a hormonal imbalance, which occurs from within. Our AcnEase® users are able to experience how a treatment can act as a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands so that the sebaceous glands can return to normal activity. The botanical ingredients that make up the various AcnEase® treatments were selected based on years of research and trials as the safest and most effective combination to not only eliminate existing acne symptoms but also prevent new acne from forming, no matter how severe .

"[""5 Ways To Ensure Your Hair Care Routine Doesn’t Aggravate Your Acne 03-30-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The formation of acne is usually attributed to either excessively oily or way-too-dry skin, but there’s another culprit that may be contributing to your symptoms - your hair or more precisely – your hair care routine. Acne is a result of a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job it is to create sebum, (skin oil) which travels along the pores to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum is produced, it clogs the pores. A mixure of the skin oil, dirt and dead skin cells invites bacteria to form , triggering an inflammatory response from the body. This response usually appears as red, swollen bumps known as pimples, a symptom of acne. So where does your hair really fit into this? Hair can’t actually cause acne, but the products that you use, the condition of the hair and, how often you touch it etc. may make for some less than ideal conditions for maintaining a clear and healthy complexion. Here are some safe measures to help ensure you sport not only beautiful hair but also an acne free complexion. How To Keep Your Hair Care Process From Adding to Breakouts! Go easy on the hair care products . Less is more, or at least better. Not only does product buildup result in limp locks, but that excess product can end up on your skin, especially if you have long hair, or just completed a hard workout, so try to go easy. In addition to limiting the amount, take care to read up on what’s in those products, and do your best to steer clear of anything containing mineral oil, sulfates, or silicone. If you experience body acne on the chest and back, you might want to look toward your hair care to see if you can change up your formulas. Choose the right products and right routine. Keep your hair clean and beware of heavy hair oils and build-up. Dirty hair or hair covered with oils and/or chemicals easily transfer from your strands to your fingertips. Even clean hair can pick up residue left behind from a recent shampoo or conditioning, so always try to choose clean,and natural products and rinse your hair really well. Keep your hands off of your face . This is a good rule of thumb to live by for anyone with acne, and the exact reason why you should abide by rule #2. All of that residue you’ve collected builds up, and when in contact with the skin can lead to clogged pores, which can lead to breakouts. If you must touch, give your hands a washing or disinfecting first. Soak those strands after a workout . The right kind of workout can be a great way to detox the skin of pore-clogging residue, but if you don’t take proper hygienic measures after you’ve worked up a sweat, you may be doing your skin more harm than good. In addition to washing your face, body, and clothes after exercising, giving those strands a quick washing can help wash away oils and sweat that have been flushed from the pores and have collected on the hair. Beware of the beard! If you find yourself smooching with a guy who happens to be bearded, or even stubbly, you might be creating friction on the skin, which can either stimulate oil production, lead to over drying, or both! So just be sure you take some action after the smooch session by washing and moisturizing your skin as soon as possible. For the guys with acne, please note that the beard may actually create more acne for you, so again, beard and acne do not mix well! While keeping clean hair habits plays a big part in keeping breakouts at bay, the most effective approach to keeping acne formation in check is by addressing the problem at its source - the sebaceous glands - and AcnEase does just that, no matter how mild or severe the symptoms . Using safe and effective herbal ingredients, AcnEase works to create a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the amount of oil needed to properly hydrate the skin is produced - no more, no less. And the best part is, it does the work for you, so if you don’t have time to lather, rinse, repeat after a session at the gym, you can rest assured that the condition of your acne is being treated regardless.

"[""5 Ways to Make a Huge Difference in Clearing Acne TODAY! 02-28-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments For anyone with acne-prone skin, who doesn’t want to get rid of the issue overnight? Many people have patience, but many don’t. And unfortunately, our judgment can get cloudy and we only look for a solution without looking at the underlying cause. So instead of focusing your search today on the next best thing that is guaranteed to help you whether it be in a day or 6 months, it’s important to understand two things: how and why acne forms, and how important it is to develop ongoing healthy lifestyle habits. Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job it is to create sebum, or oil. This oil travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes clogged within a pore and pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria forms, triggering an inflammatory response from the body. The result of that response usually appears as red, swollen bumps known as pimples, a symptom of acne. This process is known as the acne cascade . It’s important to understand that acne starts forming long before we witness a pimple on the surface of our skin. This is why treating the problem internally and externally is our best bet at achieving real results. In addition to the topical face wash most acne sufferers use morning and night, finding a systemic solution to target the problem from within, as well as developing healthy skincare habits every day, will be anyone’s best bet at achieving results that last. Skin Care Tips For Clearing Acne NOW Reduce the spread of bacteria. Doing your part in eliminating the risk of harmful bacteria forming in those pores requires a clean surface, and we’re not just talking about skin! Makeup brushes and sponges can be a breeding ground for bacteria, and those dead skin cells that contribute to clogged pores can easily collect on pillow cases, towels, and scarves. By giving those items that come in contact with your complexion a regular wash, you can greatly reduce the risk of spreading bacteria back onto the skin. Don’t over-dry. Because the overproduction of oil plays such a big part in the formation of acne, many people are quick to zap that shine from their skin, which many medicated topical face washes already do. You want to keep the surface of the skin clean without over drying, which can actually trigger even more sebum to be produced – this helps the cycle of acne 0continue! It’s all about finding the right balance. Limiting washes to twice daily, morning and night, is a good measure to take, and switching out those harsh or gritty exfoliants, which may include facial cleansing brushes depending on the sensitivity of your skin, for a gentle formula, such as this baking soda mask , will ensure a healthy clean. Don’t skimp on sleep. The physical restoration we experience as we sleep at night is needed in order to maintain manageable stress levels in the body. This has a significant impact on the appearance of our skin as stress elevates the level of specific hormones, including adrenaline and noradrenaline. Both of these hormones belong to the cortisol family, which works along the pathway of testosterone, an androgen known to lead to an excess production of sebum. Stay hydrated. The largest of the body’s organs, the skin is made up of billions of cells. Like any other type of cells, skin cells require a certain amount of water in order to function properly and staying hydrated yields many benefits for the skin. In terms of appearance, fine lines, wrinkles and pores are more apparent on dehydrated skin. Drinking water hydrates and plumps skin cells, which can appear to fill in any lines. Because water increases circulation and blood flow, hydration aids in proper kidney function, which flushes impurities from the body and results in the ‘rosy glow’ associated with hydration. Getting enough water is an essential part of maintaining a healthy body, and the benefits can certainly be measured on the condition of our complexion. Feed your skin from within. The old phrase “you are what you eat” couldn’t ring more true than when it comes to the health and function of our skin, and by implementing an anti-inflammatory diet , we can help give our skin those powerful probiotics and antioxidants it needs, from within. While developing good habits plays a big part in keeping breakouts at bay, the most effective approach to keeping acne formation in check is by addressing the problem at its source - the sebaceous glands, and AcnEase does just that, no matter how mild or severe the symptoms . Using safe and effective herbal ingredients, AcnEase works to create a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the amount of oil needed to properly hydrate the skin is produced - no more, no less. And the best part is, it does the work for you, so if you don’t have time to catch a full eight hours of sleep, or eight ounces of water, you can rest assured that the condition of your acne is being treated regardless.

"[""The Pocket Guide to Eliminating Cystic Acne for Good 01-12-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States, and many people have experienced symptoms that appear on the skin as breakouts. Some types of acne are harder to treat than others, and cystic acne is among the most stubborn, but with the right approach, even cysts can be eliminated for good. In order to begin treating cysts, it’s important to understand exactly what makes them different from other forms of acne. First things first, acne is typically classified into two groups: inflammatory and noninflammatory. Various types of acne symptoms, such as pimples and cysts belong to the inflammatory class. What is Inflammation? Inflammation is a natural response of the body. In the same way the body will work to repair itself following a cut or scrape on the surface of the skin, the inflammatory response we see in this type of acne is just the result of body fighting to keep a foreign agent from infecting it. In the case of acne, this foreign agent is the bacteria which forms within a clogged pore when too much sebum combines with dead skin cells. Sending white blood cells to attack a foreign agent, the clogged pore becomes inflamed either under or on top of the surface of the skin, which results in acne symptoms. In the case of cysts, these symptoms form below the skin. However, cysts become pus-filled, often resembling boils, making them as uncomfortable as they are stubborn. What Makes Cysts So Hard to Treat? Because cystic acne forms underneath the surface of the skin, topical solutions such as a medicated face wash, lotion or even a spot treatment can only help so much with symptoms but can't help truly treat. Furthermore, the spread of bacteria responsible for inflammation, called P. acnes, tends to spread much more easily in the case of cysts should one become ruptured or popped, and the painful swelling often associated with these symptoms can make for even more frustration. While some opt for ice compresses to reduce enlargement, others with frequent cystic acne may opt for painful cortisone injections from a dermatologist. Any treatments that don’t work to address the source of acne do not address the true cause, delivering temporary relief, at best. How Can Cystic Acne be Eliminated for Good? Just because cysts occur under the skin does not make them impossible to treat. After all, acne starts forming below the skin as well, long before symptoms appear, beginning with the over-secretion of an oily substance called sebum. This is why targeting the problem at it’s source is the only way to eliminate acne. So what’s the best way to treat cystic acne? A combination therapy approach that includes both topical and systemic solutions to addressing various steps in the acne cascade . It’s very important to keep the skin clear of dirt and debris, and removing any dead, flaky skin cells, which can contribute to the clogging of pores, As anyone with cystic acne should be careful not to rupture their symptoms, a gentle non-comedogenic wash free of gritty exfoliants should be used. Even though we don’t necessarily condone the use of products with acid in them, in this case, it may be necessary if only used temporarily, so you may want to try a formula featuring glycolic acid (you need to moisturize with this!), or play around with natural options such as baking soda or even milk to slough skin without the irritation. The next step: attacking from within with a systemic solution like AcnEase. AcnEase® is unique in that it is the only non-prescription medicine that intervenes during the first step in the acne cascade, significantly improving oily skin in the process. Using safe and effective herbal ingredients, AcnEase works to create a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the amount of oil needed to properly hydrate the skin is produced - no more, no less. A systemic solution like AcnEase®, in combination with your current skincare regimen, is an optimal way to achieve long-lasting results, no matter your acne type or severity of symptoms . The most important thing to remember is to have patience. Acne doesn’t form overnight and it won’t disappear in that amount of time either.

"[""How to Eat Chocolate and Keep Skin Clear! 12-18-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments For those with acne, there are certain foods we have been warned to stay away from since our teen years to avoid making the problem worse. The main culprits on the list are usually dairy, greasy foods, like pizza and fries, and sugary foods, including chocolate. At the same time, we have learned over the years that certain types of chocolate have a number of health benefits, so how true is the myth that your candy bar is causing your acne? With the holiday season in full swing, temptation in the form of sugary sweets can be found just about anywhere. Just because you have acne does not mean you have to miss out on all the fun. First things first, it is important to understand that no single food is the cause of acne. Acne is the result of a hormonal imbalance occurring within the body and certain foods can affect the rate at which certain hormones are produced and/or affect different organs. Therefore, it is logical to deduce that what you eat can exacerbate acne, and this includes sugary foods and certain chocolates. Before you decide to give up chocolate to achieve healthier skin, it is important to understand the connection between chocolate and acne. Chocolate does not actually cause acne, though the high sugar content found in certain chocolate treats can make breakouts more aggressive and can age your skin faster through the process of glycation. Many store-bought sweet treats are highly processed to lower production costs and ensure a longer shelf life. They are often loaded with large amounts of sugar, or even worse, corn syrup, as well as many other chemicals that are indigestible and cause damage to our bodies. These foods, known as high GI foods for their score on the glycemic index, are absorbed into the bloodstream very quickly. This is believed to affect hormone levels such as insulin, which can trigger the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum, the oily substance that can clog pores and contribute to acne breakouts. Dairy found in milk chocolate can also lead to changes in our metabolism if the processed milk is loaded with extra hormones. As a rule of thumb, common sweets to steer clear of include cakes, cookies, candies and ice creams that are made with artificial additives and sweeteners, and chocolates or treats that contain chocolate with a high sugar content. White chocolate, which is made almost entirely of sugar and milk solids, is one treat to keep out of the kitchen if you are acne-prone. On the other hand, we are lucky to have a delicious cocoa-bean product rich with health benefits called dark chocolate. Dark chocolate contains 60% or more of cocoa solids with little or no added sweeteners. Full of antioxidants, dark chocolate has been widely celebrated for its ability to reduce blood pressure and decrease the risk of heart attacks. The flavonoids found in chocolate have been known to increase the production of nitric oxide, which helps to moderate insulin sensitivity, keeping sugar levels in check. Dark chocolate can even contribute to lowered stress levels, a function of the body directly related to acne, as adrenaline has been known to affect the sebum-producing sebaceous glands. Dark chocolate is also much more filling than its milky counterpart, and a taste of it can lessen cravings for other sweet, or even salty, snacks. Pure dark chocolate (80% and up) is even recommended to heart patients and those with depression. So – there is clearly a way to eat chocolate while maintaining clear skin. The only thing you need to do is look for a healthy alternative to satisfy your chocolate cravings. Fruit is a healthy and creative way to satisfy your sweet tooth while taking the natural route. Dark chocolate-covered dried blueberries or cherries can provide the body with a double dose of antioxidants and are great for snacking on the go. And remember - when shopping for sweets, look for foods sweetened with honey or agave (over sugar – and no corn syrup!). Acne begins from within and what we choose to put in our bodies can directly affect what appears on the surface of the skin. In addition to treating yourself with healthy food choices, a systemic acne treatment can work 24/7 from the inside out, in case you find yourself tempted to enjoy a sugary sweet this holiday season. AcnEase ® works as a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands to moderate the impact of hormones on sebum production. By targeting the problem directly at the source without affecting actual hormone levels, it is safe for use among people of all ages. Comprised of all-natural herbal ingredients, AcnEase ® works from within to prevent new breakouts from forming while treating existing breakouts on the surface.

Apply the mask evenly (avoiding the eyes). If the mask has more of a liquid consistency, apply using a cotton ball. A second layer can be applied after a few minutes. Lie down and relax for twenty minutes. It\'s best to keep your face relaxed, so try to avoid talking for now and listen to the music instead! After 20 minutes or so, wet the mask to soften the clay first, and then remove the mask with cotton pads or a cotton towel and lukewarm water. Close the pores with chamomile tea. 2. The Refreshing Chamomile Compress Make your own chamomile astringent by taking 3-4 chamomile tea bags (or 2 handfuls of the dry plant) and brew it into a very strong tea. When cooled, splash or use on a cotton pad all over your face twice a day. Keep the leftovers in the refrigerator, but use or discard in two days. 3.

"['The Power of Pumpkins & Your Acne - Menu Ideas & Mask Included! 10-29-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Pumpkins. We can\'t get enough of them during the Halloween and Thanksgiving season. We carve them, we stick them on our porches, we wait on line for once-a-year lattes, we make pies and soups and then we forget about pumpkins until next year. So let\'s talk about why pumpkins should be on our minds all year round if you have acne. Pumpkins are rich in nutrients and microelements that our skin and body can benefit from: Like carrots, sweet potatoes or oranges, pumpkins have an antioxidant power and are loaded with beta-carotene (arytenoids), which neutralize free radicals. This helps keep our skin healthy and young and may prevent cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. Pumpkin seeds are rich in amino acids and Vitamin B that are great for the skin. They are also rich in a special amino acid called tryptophan - that is important in the production of serotonin (our good mood player) so you don\'t only get healthy skin but are also happy! Feel a cold coming on? Rich in Vitamin C, pumpkins may help to boost your immune system. One cup of pumpkin soup has 20% or 60 mg of the daily-recommended dose of Vitamin C (15% of the amount recommended for men as they need 75 mg). The generous amount of fiber in pumpkin helps your GI system to keep healthy and helps in controlling sugar levels and a healthy weight. So on one of these beautiful weekends, indulge in some of these ideas: Baked and Stuffed Pumpkin Cut it into slices, brush a little bit of high quality (undiluted!) extra virgin olive oil over it, put in a roasting pan covered with aluminum foil and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes to an hour. Serve warm on its own or stuffed with quinoa or rice and cooked mixed vegetables. Pumpkin Soup Bake pumpkin in the same way as indicated above. Scoop out the cooked flesh, add two cups to a blender with some organic vegetable or chicken stock (to desired thickness) and a teaspoon of cumin, a teaspoon of unrefined sea salt, a pinch of black pepper and a teaspoon of honey or other sweetener. Serve hot. Pumpkin Ravioli Puree roasted or baked pumpkin, season with sea salt, fresh pepper, sage and nutmeg as a filling for ravioli. Drizzle with olive oil and your favorite spices. Pumpkin Pie If you have acne prone skin, sugar is not your friend. So when baking your famous pumpkin pie, use organic coconut palm sugar. Its glycemic index is half of sugar and it is more nutritious, especially since it is completely unrefined and not bleached so it retains the vitamins and minerals. It is also high in amino acids, which is actually great for the skin. Now even with that said, we\'re not saying to run out and put this sugar in everything you cook or bake - we\'re just giving you the facts behind why it is a much better alternative to refined white sugar. Acne Skin Pumpkin Face Mask And after you\'re done cooking, enjoy a little ""me"" time with our Acne Skin Pumpkin Face Mask, which gently moisturizes, nourishes and conditions your skin Ingredients Always use organic ingredients when possible 2 tsp. freshly cooked and pureed pumpkin ½ tsp. honey A few drops of whole milk (For dry skin, exchange milk for one-quarter teaspoon heavy whipping cream or, for extremely dry and sensitive skin, extra virgin olive oil or for oily skin, one-quarter teaspoon of cranberry juice) Directions Combine the ingredients, mix gently, wash your hands and apply to your face avoiding the eye area. Rest and relax for 10-15 minutes. Rinse with warm water; pat dry (do not rub!). Then, apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer. Don\'t know what treatment would work best for YOUR acne? All of this may sound great, but don\'t think that just because you eat more pumpkin or slather it on your face that your acne is all of a sudden going to clear up. How nice would that be! Pumpkin can assist in helping you live an acne-free lifestyle, but it won\'t treat it.

"['Raspberry Oily Skin Face Mask: Get Less Breakouts and Less Shine 08-13-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Oils produced by your skin\'s sebaceous glands are necessary to keep your skin healthy and supple. We would all be scaly and more like alligators without these oils! But as often in life, too much of a good thing is not good either - like the over-production of sebum (skin oil), which may lead to acne. Additionally, being too shiny is also a beauty problem that affects the way we look and our confidence. And since we often use make-up to camoflage blemishes, having very oily skin can interfere with make-up application and coverage. Dermatologists agree that the most effective way to manage oily skin is to cleanse your face both morning and night, and to use oil absorbing masks. You need to use a gentle cleanser since harsh soaps can trigger the skin\'s protective reaction, and can increase oil production further. For the same reason, stay away from rubbing and buffing your skin; use a pat and dry system to limit the possibility of stimulating more oil secretion. If a basic facial non-comedogenic cleanser doesn\'t help with oil, take a look at products containing low grade beta-hydroxy acid. BHAs are lipid soluble, which means they\'re able to fully dissolve in oil (or fat). This makes BHAs better at penetrating pores while they are ""over-stuffed"" with sebum. The following mask will also help to dissolve more skin oil (helping with breakouts), and will keep your skin less shiny. Ingredients 1 tablespoon of sugar 1 tablespoon of lemon juice 1 egg white 5 raspberries Instructions Blend until smooth. Apply on a clean face with your fingers in circular motion. Leave on for twenty minutes, and then rinse with lukewarm water. Do not use if you have open cysts.May use twice a week, especially right before any big events.

"[""5 Things That May be Contributing to Your Acne 01-19-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments If you’ve noticed acne symptoms on your skin for any amount of time you probably have a routine for dealing with the damage, but are you aware of some common factors that may be contributing to your condition? What Is Acne? Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States, and can affect anyone regardless of age, race, or sex. Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job is it to create sebum , or oil, which travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes produced it can become clogged within a pore, and when paired with dead skin cells from the surface forms bacteria known a P. acnes, which triggers an inflammatory response from the body. The result of that response usually appears as red, swollen bumps such as pimples or cysts, although symptoms of this condition can come in many forms, including whiteheads, blackheads, comedones, or even just oily skin. Many people look only toward topical washes to help treat their acne, not realizing that since acne is an external manifestation of an internal issue, the core issue has to be addressed internally. Yes of course an effective acne skincare regimen is important, but there are several additional factors that may keep acne coming back to your complexion if left unaddressed. 5 Things That May be Contributing to Your Acne A hormonal imbalance . We may have said it before but it’s always worth saying again - acne is in most cases the result of a hormonal imbalance, and if this source of the condition isn’t addressed, you can pretty much guarantee a return of symptoms, even if you’ve found a way to experience temporary relief. Depending on who and where you are in life, you may be able to attribute your hormonal fluctuation to menstruation, puberty, pregnancy, or even just stress or lack of sleep. To help keep your hormonal acne in check, in addition to implementing a systemic solution to treat the problem, check out this quick guide to controlling hormonal acne . Dry, flaky skin. While the hormonal imbalance that sends our sebaceous glands haywire, triggering the production of too much oil is partially to blame, there’s another step involved in the formation of acne, and that involves dry, dead skin cells. The cooler fall and winter months typically tend to zap moisture from the skin , as will the forced heat that comes with those times, long, hot showers, or sunburns during the warmer months. To avoid excessively flaky skin, implementing a gentle exfoliation routine is recommended, as is keeping showers short and on the cooler side. If you can’t stand to turn down the heater, try adding a humidifier to your room while you sleep to replenish lost moisture to the skin. Harsh chemicals. Keeping oil under control is important for anyone with acne, but combating it with a harsh topical once it’s already reached the surface of the skin may actually do more damage than good. When necessary oils are stripped from our bodies, the sebaceous glands become triggered to create more oil to make up for what was just lost, which can possibly exacerbate acne symptoms. For good measure, exercise caution before using salicylic acid-based acne treatments, as well as alcohol-based cosmetics, and formulas containing sulfates. Dirt, grime, and residue. Those dead skin cells responsible for the formation of bacteria can live on items our faces come into contact with every day, including pillow cases, towels, and even scarves. Throwing these items in with the wash once a week will go a long way in the prevention of acne symptoms, and always remember to clean any skin-touching items that may come in contact with sweat, such as workout gear. An undiagnosed health issue. We don’t say this to alarm anyone because for the most part, many with acne don't have an undiagnosed health issue. Sometimes we can make minor adjustments to help alleviate or even prevent our acne symptoms, while other contributors are medical in nature, such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, or PCOS. If your acne is chronic in nature, be sure to mention it to your physician, and stay on top of annual physical examinations and blood work. In some cases, there may be a reason for your acne that requires additional resources. While addressing contributing factors can go a long way in helping keep your skin clear, treating the source of the problem is the only way anyone with acne will enjoy a real change. The only long-term solution that will keep your skin looking and feeling its best is to prevent acne before it starts, which means breaking the acne cycle, and this is exactly what AcnEase® does. No matter how mild or severe your symptoms may range, our users are able to experience clear skin (long term!) knowing that there are no chemicals that will alter their hormones, or that they won’t experience side effects.

"[""3 Acne “Fighting” Ingredients that Can Increase Signs of Aging! 01-26-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When it comes to addressing acne, many will go to great lengths to treat their condition, but did you know that certain ingredients commonly found in many topical acne treatment can age your skin quicker? We all know that what we put into our bodies can have a big effect on our health, and the things we choose to treat our body’s largest organ, the skin, can also yield differing results. Many acne-fighting topical treatments are intended to zap any of that excess oil created by the sebaceous glands. This oil is called sebum , and plays a necessary part in maintaining healthy skin by protecting and hydrating the complexion, keeping skin looking youthful and supple. While keeping our oil levels in check in important, it’s equally imperative we not over-dry, as that can not only lead to more breakouts, but advanced signs of aging as well. Whether you’re a teen treating their acne for the first time or an adult working to keep their skin condition under control, it’s important to understand what ingredients to look out for to ensure the healthiest, happiest clear skin possible! Common Ingredients To Look Out For Alcohol. This is a tough one to avoid in a lot of acne cleansers but an important one to be aware of, as it can dry your skin to look ahead of its time. When researching your topical skin care treatment, keep a special eye out for ethanol, methanol, benzyl alcohol, isopropyl, and ethyl alcohol, and do your best to steer clear - your skin will thank you for it! Mineral oil. A common ingredient found in many topical acne washes and creams, mineral oil is derived from petroleum, and can lead to clogged pores, which may result in acne. This alone can lead to inflammation, irritation and/or redness, which can result in fine lines. Sulfates. Another ingredient commonly found in hygienic and cosmetic products is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, or SLS. During the manufacturing process, SLS is contaminated with a carcinogenic byproduct, and can irritate the skin and eyes. Toxic to body organs, sulfates can be linked to cell mutations and cancer, as well as increased dryness, which can result in fine lines and wrinkles over time. Many shampoos and conditioners contain sulfates, which tend to over-dry the scalp, leading to flakes, and may trigger an overproduction of oil. Gentle Skincare Tips To Keep Your Complexion Healthy and Clear Tone with a gentle astringent. If you aspire for a healthy and clear complexion, use a powerful natural astringent like chamomile, which can control bacteria, help to prevent razor bumps and even speed up the healing of pimples. Chamomile has naturally soothing and antibacterial properties, and when applied topically, it can help reduce inflammation associated with acne. The best part? It’s easy to make and won’t cost you more than a few pennies! To create your own DIY chamomile astringent, check out our favorite recipe here! Moisturize. If you have an oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer that works to hydrate your acne-prone skin, we recommend sticking to it in addition to your skincare regimen. To add a little acne-friendly pampering that can also improve the condition of aging skin, try whipping up a gentle mask made of antibacterial honey and lactic acid-rich organic yogurt for a weekly treat! Resist the urge to over-wash. Over-washing can lead to over-drying, and this dehydrating effect can result in enlarged pores and flaky skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles. Finding a gentle formula that works for your skin is a crucial part of treating acne, and limiting your washes to twice daily will ensure that too much sebum isn’t being stripped from the skin’s surface (which can actually trigger even more sebum to become produced, potentially resulting in more acne!). Keep water lukewarm, and always gently pat skin dry with a clean towel after cleansing. The last thing we want to do when treating acne is to create even more problems for our skin, and because topical treatments don’t even address the root cause, it hardly seems worth the risk of advanced symptoms of aging just for temporary relief. Our AcnEase® users are lucky to have total peace of mind and the opportunity to get the best complexion possible because they are on a treatment that actively works from the inside 24/7 to get rid of their acne naturally. The herbal ingredients used works to effectively create a barrier between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, resulting in zero side effects, and a gentle treatment that delivers real, long-lasting results, regardless of the severity of symptoms .

"[""5 Ways to Get Rid of Your Acne For the Holidays 12-07-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Family, travel, feast with friends - the holidays are a time of celebration for many, and great way to relax and recharge for the new year ahead. For anyone with acne, however, the stress and hustle of the holiday season can prove to be tough on skin. What Is Acne? Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States, and comes in many forms. Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job is it to create sebum , or oil, which travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes clogged within a pore and pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria forms, triggering an inflammatory response from the body. The result of that response usually appears as red, swollen bumps known as pimples, a symptom of acne. It’s important to understand that acne starts forming long before we witness a pimple on the surface of our skin, which is why treating the problem internally and externally is our best bet at achieving real results. We still have a few weeks before the whirlwind of holidays hits us and by taking any of these steps early on, you can help reduce acne breakouts in time for those festive functions! How To Improve Your Acne Symptoms NOW Keep clean. While the production of excess sebum is, in a large part, to blame for acne, that’s only half the battle. Keeping the surface of the skin clean with a powerful anti-inflammatory agent is key – we like to suggest a powerful acne fighting chamomile astringent that is very easy to make at home. Exfoliating is especially important right now in these cooler months, as dead skin cells which collect on the surface can contribute to the formation of acne, so implementing a gentle, twice weekly treatment to your routine can help matters for the better. Kill bacteria. Those red or white bumps we know as pimples are actually a response to a bacterial infection that occurs within the pores. When sebum combines with, dry, flaky skin cells, it produces bacteria. In order to keep acne from spreading, this bacteria must be eliminated. Luckily, we can turn to simple ingredients which can be found in almost any kitchen. Honey and garlic remain the main contenders in terms of homeopathic, anti-bacterial treatments, both of which are also naturally anti-septic, and anti-inflammatory. You can apply directly to the skin, or for a longer-term change to your skincare regimen, incorporate into your existing diet for a systemic solution to your acne. Reduce inflammation. Of all the acne types, inflammatory acne is the most prevalent, and many topical washes and spot treatment creams are designed specifically to treat these symptoms. What many people may not realize is that the harsh chemicals used in these formulas may actually end up making acne worse by triggering the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum in an effort to make up for what was just washed away! One effective way to reduce an inflammatory response is through diet, which is typically low in sugar and high in foods containing naturally occurring anti-inflammatory properties, such as turmeric, ginger, and coconut oil. You can learn more about introducing an anti-inflammatory diet for your acne, here . Reduce stress. While the holidays are meant to be a time to enjoy family and reflect on the blessings of our lives, let’s be honest - it can get stressful. From travel to shopping to everything in between, the holiday season can take a real toll on our bodies, and that can show up right on our skin. Taking a few minutes for self-care can help keep both stress and hormone levels in check , even if all we can muster are a few deep breaths in between eventful outings. Prevention. For a long-term approach to keeping oil production in check, addressing the problem at its source, the sebaceous glands, is the best way to keep anyone from scrambling to zap a zit in a hurry, and AcnEase does just that, no matter how mild or severe the symptoms. Using safe and effective herbal ingredients, AcnEase works to create a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the amount of oil needed to properly hydrate the skin is produced - no more, no less. The best way to ensure clear skin this holiday season, or any day of the year is to implement a method of prevention with AcnEase - just think of it as a gift to your skin! We want to hear from you!

"[""Q: I want that “holiday glow” this season but my skin is not cooperating. What should I do? 12-08-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments A: It’s the most wonderful time of the year, but not for your skin unfortunately! Parties with sugary treats and alcohol, late nights, cold temperatures, drying winds and dry indoor heating systems can wreak havoc on your skin and call for some emergency updates in your skincare routine. The best way to achieve glowing skin for the holidays is simple: keep it hydrated and exfoliated whenever you can. And don’t forget the old adage, “you are what you eat… and drink” as well! And since many of our readers have severe acne, exfoliation needs to be done with extreme care or not at all until the major lesions and cysts heal. So keep reading and get glowing! Exfoliation… During this time of year, for normal and oily types of skin (without severe blemishes), I kick up exfoliating for my clients (and even myself!). I tend to favor enzyme exfoliation over face scrub, especially if there is active acne present. For acne prone skin, the best choice is enzymatic exfoliation based on fruits like papaya – AcnEase actually has a great acne exfoliation recipe for this, which will chew the dead skin cells and leave the live ones alone. And please make sure to avoid any abrasive methods that may result in inflammation. Feel free to use an enzymatic exfoliation up to three times a week (but again, not if you have open cysts), but always listen to your skin, and if it feels like it’s getting too dry or irritated, pull back. Hydration… The next step in ensuring a holiday glow is bringing more moisture into the skin. Hydrated skin is a happy skin! To get your skin happy, adjust your cleanser. Gone are the days of summer sweaty, sticky, SPF skin and for some, the days of chapped, dried out and irritated skin are here. Get ahead of this change by switching your gel, or foaming cleanser to a milky or oil cleanser (non-comedogenic of course). These cleansers will clean your skin without stripping it from necessary essential skin oil. If you can’t let go of your foaming cleanser, then try to use it just once a day at night, and use the gentler one in the morning when you truly don't need the extra cleaning. Don't be afraid of oil! Many recent studies show that using the right oil can help control your own body's oil production and help build your own skin’s immune system. Look for oils high in linoleic acid like sunflower and rosehip oil – you can even try the latest craze of coconut oil, which works for some people. Switch your lighter moisturizer to oil, or even add a layer of an oil-based serum under your moisturizer. Oil, helps to trap the water in your skin that would otherwise evaporate into thin air. Using an oil-free moisturizer all year round, especially in colder climates, may promote dehydrated skin. What you need to use is products that contain some healthy oils but are lightweight and non-sticky to help to grab moisture, and not dead skin cells and dirt. Moisturizing… Indulge your skin by using a hydrating mask a few times a week. I like to put a mask on after the shower, or in the morning while I am making coffee and getting ready. You can even try this soothing and anti-inflammatory moisturizing oatmeal mask . After using a mask regularly, I noticed the hydration levels in my skin increase dramatically. It’s a simple and easy way to bring more moisture to your skin, especially if you don't want to use a richer cream for fear of getting more breakouts while using heavier moisturizers. Additional tips… Use a brightening eye cream in the morning too. Most people use their eye cream at night, if they even use one at all. Use one! And use one in the morning instead of at night. If you wake up puffy, it could be because of that third glass of wine or because of your eye cream. While you sleep, the lymph fluid can pool under the eye area, especially if an active or super hydrating eye cream is applied. If you wait until the morning, and put it in the fridge, not only will you be less puffy, but the cool eye cream will help to bring down any inflammation. Look for an eye cream with vitamin k, which is the best for fighting dark circles. And don’t forget to take your AcnEase every day to control your acne! (PS – to those already on it, you can increase the dosage during the holidays for some extra acne-fighting power). Enjoy the holidays and your extra glow!

"[""Holiday Recipes That Won’t Make You Break Out! 12-14-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments With the holiday season here, both our time and our dietary care can slip away from us, which can lead to acne for some people. Food isn’t responsible for acne, however there are some foods that are more disruptive than others, which is why it’s important to recognize how our diet can affect us and our skin. The Relationship Between Food And Acne When it comes to diet and acne, understanding how the inflammatory response affects the skin is knowledge worth knowing. Inflammation is a natural response by the body in an attempt to protect itself from foreign irritants, such as bacteria, chemicals, or even foods that one’s body may be inclined to reject. Inflammation is a common part of the healing process and usually subsides once the foreign element has been addressed. In terms of acne symptoms, an inflammatory response can result in red, swollen bumps on your face that are often painful and irritating. One way to combat an over-stimulated inflammatory response is to consider the foods that we put into our bodies. In terms of diet and inflammation, restricting inflammatory foods is just as essential as adding anti-inflammatory foods , and should be one of the first changes we make to our eating habits. Avoid processed foods, which include meats containing nitrates or other preservatives, baked snacks, refined grains such as white flour, and anything with a high sugar content. High-glycemic foods, known for increasing blood sugar and hormone levels, may result in the overproduction of sebum, an oily substance that, in excessive amounts, can lead to clogged pores. The clogged pore can accumulate dead skin cells, which may lead to an inflammatory response as the body works to fight off what is essentially a bacterial invasion. The acute response results in pustules and prolonged inflammation and can lead to bumps under the skin called cystic acne. 5 Skin-Saving Sides For Holiday Meals It’s not uncommon knowledge that dairy, gluten, trans fats, and sugar, among other culprits, can lead to changes in the body, which may aggravate acne symptoms. What many people don’t consider is that, while certain foods can contribute to the formation of acne, others can effectively work to avoid an imbalance of hormones, lowering the possibility of an impact on the sebaceous glands. Here are some of our favorite food items to add to your side dish selection this holiday season. Mashed Sweet Potatoes Like many orange foods, sweet potatoes are rich in vitamin A and manganese, which can both work to help improve acne, and make for a tasty and healthy alternative to the traditional mashed potatoes that are full of sugary starches. To make, simply boil until soft, then mash with non-dairy milk and a little butter and cinnamon – add salt as needed too. Green Beans with Toasted Slivered Almonds This simple side serves as a double-dose of acne-fighting vitamin C and E, and makes a tasty addition to any plate. To create, simply place beans in a large pot and cover with water, cooking on a stovetop until you reach a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cooking for another five minutes. While the beans are cooking, combine some olive oil, diced onions and garlic, broth (whatever you have in the house) and slivered almonds in a pan over low heat for approximately five minutes or until the almonds are golden and the onions a bit translucent – add a little salt & pepper if needed, and combine with strained green beans in a dish to serve. Cranberry Sauce with Honey This traditional side calls for honey for two reasons: to avoid added sugar, and to implement a healthy dose of naturally occurring anti-inflammatory properties. Pick up a bag of fresh cranberries (which usually have instructions on the back of the bag), par boil in water first, then transfer to a pan with some water and honey (and orange for a little zest). As an added bonus, you can use any uncooked berries to create an exfoliating cranberry scrub to be used as a facial mask for a quick pick-me-up amid all the commotion. Roasted Squash with Herbs Another orange delight, squash is loaded with pretty much all the essential nutrients healthy skin needs, and when enhanced with rosemary, sage and/or garlic, can work to improve circulation and combat inflammation from the inside, out. You can use any variety of squash, but we like winter squash for this particular dish. To make, toss cubed squash, minced garlic, chopped sage and chopped rosemary with a bit of olive oil. Spread evenly onto a baking sheet and cook at 350F for about 90 minutes or until squash feels tender in the center before serving. Walnut Stuffed Apples in Honey For anyone with a sweet tooth to satisfy, this healthy dessert is a must-have for anyone with acne-prone skin. Using seasonal fruit, Omega 3-rich walnuts and antibacterial honey, check out the original recipe here ! Making healthy eating choices to benefit your skin can be easy with a little insight and time for planning. The best rules of advice to follow are to avoid high-sugar items and ingredients when possible, and making sure to choose the right fats to cook with, such as coconut or olive oil. When it comes to holiday mealtime, sometimes things aren’t always as easy as sticking to our game-plan, especially if we’re invited as a guest, which is why it is so important to have a plan that is always working from within, regardless of what you have on your plate. AcnEase® works from within the body to help prevent the sebaceous glands from overproducing sebum, an oily substance that can clog pores in excessive amounts. Using all-natural, herbal ingredients, AcnEase® is gentle on the skin and body, and is safe for use among people of all ages, with no side effects!

"['Q: I want to be pimple free before my holiday parties and even new years eve…how!? 12-15-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments A: Why is it that people often get a huge pimple before a special event? We know there are many potential causes that can exacerbate acne, and one that can do a number on you is stress. The holidays can be a great time, but also stressful…stress hormones can trigger excess sebum and before you know it, you’ve got some nasty breakouts right before a fun night out. Before your NYE party or any special event you are looking forward to, it’s so important to add in a few important things you can do to give your skin its best chance of shining! - Wash your pillowcases regularly! Doing this before your event can help to ensure you don\'t expose your skin to any extra dirt and bacteria. The same goes for keeping your cell phone clean and away from your face. - Speaking of keeping things away from your face, make sure not to touch your face throughout the day . Even resting your hand against your face invites more oil and bacteria to that area. - Wash your hair regularly , or keep it in a ponytail a week before the event. The oil from your hair, or even the silicone based hair care products, can cause congestion in your pores. - Go makeup free. The week before your event, try to wear as little makeup as possible so you can let your skin breath and lessen any chance for your makeup to mix with dirt and oil from your skin to clog your pores. (Here are some tips for that party night on applying makeup the right way when you have acne) - Try increasing your AcnEase dose at least one level about two weeks in advanced. If you don’t know how to do this, contact us NOW! This will ensure that you are giving your body some extra fighting power from the inside, which we all know is the only way to treat acne! - Do gentle exfoliation . I just talked about this topic of exfoliating for acne recently. You can use a very gentle enzyme exfoliate or scrub daily to keep your pores clear. Also, you may want to add a few extra clarifying and hydrating masks (only if this is part of your skincare regimen already). The week before is for gentle pampering, nothing extreme or new. This is not the time to deep clean your skin or try new products. Stick with the routine you know works and give your skin some extra attention, but of the gentle persuasion. And always remember to take extra care if you have open cysts. - Get a facial 1-2 weeks before the event. Again, with severe acne this is not a good idea, but you may want to try some professional extraction, which will also deeply hydrate your skin as well. Also, if you get one at least a week before, you will have some time to recover if your skin purges after, which is quite common. - Try lessening your dairy intake . Dairy can trigger acne flair ups for some, so try to lessen the cheese, butter and/or milk or hold it all together starting NOW. - Amp up the exercise! When you exercise, you sweat out toxins in your body, stimulate the lymph system and oxygenate your tissues. Your skin glows from happiness – with exercise, you’re enabling it to be ""well fed"". Make sure to wipe the sweat off immediately after though (and if possible, take a shower), as sweat can dehydrate your skin, and the toxins can cause inflammation. - Increase your water intake! This should actually be at the top of the list because this is the easiest way to detoxify your body. Most people do not drink enough water. I have seen incredible changes in people’s bodies when they take this advice seriously. Water will flush out your system by moving along toxins and waste, and hydrate your body. Drink half the amount, in ounces, of your body weight. If you weigh 120lbs, try to drink 60 ounces of water daily. So drink up and be merry! And above all, enjoy the season! ? - Courtney Comments Add New No comments found × Close Leave Comment https://www.acnease.com/acne-treatment-blog/i-want-to-be-pimple-free-before-my-holiday-parties-and-even-new-years-eve-how.htm?params[comment_submitted]=1#comments Value entered for e-mail is invalid Passwords don\'t match Please fill up missing fields below Name * Email * Website Comment * Submit Close']",434b139f44c5f673c767c8e8be361b4b7ae0d549,61b6-48a2-9078,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.acnease.com/acne-treatment-blog/i-want-to-be-pimple-free-before-my-holiday-parties-and-even-new-years-eve-how.htm,['2016-12-15 00:00:00']
"[""3 Skin Dangers to Avoid At the End of the Holiday Season 12-25-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The office, the family, the dinner with friends - the holiday season can certainly be a time for celebrating, and for anyone with acne-prone skin, all that partying can catch up to your complexion in no time. What is Acne? The condition of acne is due in part to a hormonal imbalance that takes place within the body. Certain hormones can affect the amount of sebum, an oily substance, produced by the sebaceous glands. When too much sebum is produced, it can clog pores. These clogged pores combined with dead skin cells and debris from the skin’s surface and bacteria is formed within the pore, often leading to inflammation or breakouts. Certain things can potentially trigger the imbalance of hormones, such as sugar and lack of sleep, while other habits can create unsavory conditions on the surface of the skin, which will often lead to a dry, flaky complexion that can contribute to the formation of acne symptoms. Read on to learn about our top three holiday party dangers to avoid, ensuring a clear and healthy complexion! Holiday Party Culprits That Might Interfere With Acne-Prone Skin Alcohol . This one might be hard for some people to hear, but those holiday drinks are not only dehydrating, but may interfere with your sleep schedule later, which can potentially lead to breakouts over time. That being said, if you can’t cut out the cocktails altogether, just try to drink in moderation or make smarter choices for your skin, like choosing wine or straight alcohol over mixed drinks high in sugar which can lead to inflammation, exacerbating acne symptoms. Red wine is preferred over white unless you have rosacea, in which case avoid red wine. Straight liquor can either be consumed as a shot or over ice, and a refreshing blend of alcohol and sparkling water is another easy way to enjoy your spirits while minimizing the impact of alcohol on your acne. Adding a dash of lime or lemon can add a healthy dose of vitamin C, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, which contributes to clear healthy skin. Sugar . With all the sweet foods at our fingertips during the holiday season, temptation is around almost every corner. While everyone should allow themselves to indulge from time to time, those with acne-prone complexions might find themselves paying for it on the surface of their skin for days. Many people blame their acne on sugar, and although no single food is the cause of the condition, certain things we eat, including sugar, can affect the way our bodies react. When we eat too many sugary foods, our insulin hormones kick into high gear, which many believe to be directly related to the condition of acne. That is not to say, however, that we cannot have our sweet needs met. The trick is to find alternatives to sugar as a way to sweeten your treats, such as organic honey, stevia, and coconut nectar, which all taste great and won’t wreak havoc on your complexion. Check out our guide to sugar-free alternatives for acne-prone skin for a few tasty ideas! Sleeping in your make up. Most people wash their face upon waking, but if you’re the type to fall asleep in a face full of makeup, you could be making your acne worse, and with some long nights of festive fun ahead of you, it’s important to get into the habit of washing your face before bed. Keeping a clean surface is half the battle when it comes to acne, and washing with a gentle cleanser followed by a moisturizer suited to your skin type before bed can go a long way in keeping those pores clean and unclogged, which can result in fewer breakouts. Of course, even the most skin savvy person can slip up from time to time, especially when faced with the festivities of the holiday season, which is why it’s important to have something working for you even if you let your guard down for a night or two. The most effective way to keep your skin looking and feeling its best is to prevent acne before it starts, which means breaking the acne cycle, and this is exactly what AcnEase® does. Using 100% safe, all-natural ingredients, AcnEase® works to restore the internal balance and correct the factors that cause pimples to form while treating existing pimples simultaneously, regardless of the severity of your symptoms . Because it is a systemic solution to treating acne, you can rest assured that it’s always working from within, whether you indulge this holiday season or not. So we want to hear from you! What are some top tips that you usually do during the next week to avoid breakouts?

"[""6 Priceless Party Makeup Tips for Acne-Prone Skin 12-25-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments With the New Year right around the corner, we always want to look our best for those big (or not so big) plans we’ve made. For anyone with acne, this can be a stressful time, but with the right tools you can step into the New Year with your best face forward. 6 Party Makeup Tips to Keep Your Acne-Prone Skin Looking Flawless Prime. The best way to ensure a seamless finish? Primer. Becoming ever more popular in recent years, a pore minimizing primer will help anyone with acne-prone skin create a smooth surface to work with, and helps to lock that look in all night long, preventing makeup from budging (this is perfect for anyone with oily skin.) Conceal. Finding the right concealer will vary from person to person, but if you’re dealing with a red and swollen bump, the green hued variety will do the trick to balance that complexion out. For those with dry skin, be sure to moisturize before concealing to reduce any flakiness. Applying concealer should be built up, so dab a tiny amount with a thin, pointed brush, then blend with a CLEAN finger or sponge. Find the right formula. Be it concealer, foundation or even powder, the right formula will depend on the person, Those with oily skin can typically reach for heavier formulas, especially in the cooler months, while persons with a drier complexion can generally get away with a medium or even sheer coverage. Check out this helpful makeup guide for a list of do’s and don’ts to help you learn what to look out for. Set it and forget it. Now that the culprit has been concealed, you’ll want to blend it in as best you can, creating a smooth surface on the skin. Mineral powder has been known to work wonders on acne-prone skin because it contains non-irritating ingredients, is free of parabens, dyes, fragrances and mineral oil and rests lightly on the skin. Because you apply it with a powder brush, you also don’t have to worry about smudging your concealer, just be sure to apply a light layer to avoid a “cakey” appearance. Don’t pick. Anyone with acne should know by now how dangerous picking and popping those pimples can be for your skin. Aside from the pitting and scarring that can come of it, the spread of bacteria can actually lead to even more breakouts, not to mention rough patches that are nearly impossible to conceal. It’s easier said than done at times, we know, but always do your best to resist the urge and allow a breakout to run its course, which should only be a matter of days. And if you need emergency tips for zapping those zits , we’ve got them! Calm and tone the skin daily. When most people break out, they tend to reach for those topical washes to zap oil, leaving a squeaky clean complexion. While too much oil can certainly lead to breakouts, stripping the skin of all of its oil can actually be counter-productive, triggering the body to produce even more to make up for what was just washed away! Because this can actually result in more acne, we suggest calming the skin with a natural toner after your regular morning and evening washes, such as this chamomile astringent recipe, that’s as easy to make as it is inexpensive! While concealing existing blemishes is much easier through the power of makeup, treating the source of the problem is the only way anyone with acne will enjoy a real change. Certain types of blemishes such as cystic acne and whiteheads are impossible to cover even with the most professional makeup formulas. The only long-term solution that will keep your skin looking and feeling its best is to prevent acne before it starts, which means breaking the acne cycle, and this is exactly what AcnEase® does. Using 100% safe, all-natural ingredients, AcnEase® works to restore the internal balance and correct the factors that cause pimples to form, while treating existing pimples simultaneously. An easy and effective measure that will keep your skin healthy and clear all year round, AcnEase delivers real results you can see, no matter how mild or severe your symptoms may range.

"[""4 Thanksgiving DIY Facial Masks for Acne 11-24-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Leftovers are always in abundance on Thanksgiving. This year, don’t fret if you buy in excess. Many common Thanksgiving ingredients can be used in DIY skincare solutions such as masks or scrubs. The most important thing to remember during the busy holidays is to adhere to your skincare regimen and that includes taking your daily dose of AcnEase ® . It’s also helpful to supplement your skincare routine with a delicate scrub or nourishing mask when your skin suffers from stress or other times when it doesn’t receive the proper care. The holidays are one of those times when we are often too busy to dedicate enough time and energy to ourselves and our skin. Here are 4 simple DIY facial masks that can help maintain a clear and healthy complexion when time isn’t on your side and your skin needs a boost. An added bonus is that these ingredients are probably already in your refrigerator this week in preparation for Thanksgiving. The star ingredients are cranberries, yeast and sweet potatoes. There is also a link to our ever-popular pumpkin mask, which provides extreme nourishment for all skin-types. If using the Cranberry Facial Scrub, do not follow with a DIY mask. This is to ensure that your skin doesn’t have an adverse reaction to the foreign ingredients. Although all of the ingredients are mild, it’s best to be cautious. We recommend that you only use these 1-2 times per week. It is extremely important that you massage all of these GENTLY into your skin in a circular motion to avoid damaging your skin. It is possible to create tiny tears in your skin from abrasive ingredients. As always, if you experience any irritation or discomfort from any of these, rinse off immediately. Cranberry Facial Scrub [Calming & Moisturizing] This delicate scrub is good for reducing redness and inflammation and also contains nutrients that will smooth and moisturize the skin. Cranberries contain omega 3, 6, 9, Vitamin C and E, among other powerful components. The anti-oxidants in cranberries help fight free radicals that are responsible for aging the skin. The anti-inflammatory properties in cranberries help reduce the redness and irritation around the inflamed acne. Vitamin C is responsible for improving your skin tone. Brown sugar is enriched with molasses, which contains B vitamins, known to repair sun-damaged skin. The sugar acts as the exfoliator and helps remove dead skin, opens pores and allows dirt and bacteria to escape. Ingredients 1/2 cup fresh cranberries (uncooked) 1 tbsp honey 1 tbsp organic brown sugar Directions Combine cranberries and honey in a blender and puree. Empty contents into a clean bowl and add brown sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves slightly. You don’t want the mixture to be too abrasive as it will damage your skin. Apply the mixture to your clean face including jawline and massage gently in circular motions with fingertips for 2-3 minutes. Rinse with warm water. Extra mixture can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 week. You can substitute other types of sugar for the brown sugar, however it will not have the same nutrients and benefits for your skin. Velvety Yeast Mask [Deep-Cleansing] This mask is great for all types of acne. The vitamins and nutrients in the yeast help eliminate bacteria within the pores and fight future breakouts. This mask also reduces inflammation and simultaneously moisturizes the skin. Ingredients 1 tbsp fresh baker’s yeast (can substitute powdered yeast) 2 tbsp warm organic milk 1 tsp honey Directions Dissolve yeast in warm milk, then mix with honey. Apply mixture to clean skin and allow to sit for 20 minutes. If you are allergic to honey, substitute it with other ingredients depending of the effect you want - add an egg yolk if you have mature skin, egg white for acne-prone skin, or olive oil for dry skin. Sweet Potato Mask [Detoxifying] Sweet potatoes are loaded with antioxidants and vitamins. The orange color in sweet potatoes is attributed to beta-carotene, which helps reduce inflammation. In addition, the anti-aging properties in sweet potatoes will boost collagen production while keeping your skin smooth and hydrated. They also help the skin regenerate new cells and shed old ones. Cinnamon helps to control acne in various ways. As the cinnamon dries the affected area, increased amounts of blood and oxygen are drawn to the surface of the skin and bacteria is pushed out, while opening the pores. Egg yolk draws oil from the skin while nourishing dull and/or mature complexions. Butternut squash can be substituted for sweet potato, which has similar properties. Ingredients 1/2 sweet potato (or butternut squash) 1 egg yolk 1/2 tsp cinnamon Directions Boil sweet potato until soft, about 15-20 minutes. Allow to cool and remove the skin. Place all ingredients in blender and puree until smooth. Apply to clean face and neck in circular motion with finger tips. Allow to absorb for 20 minutes. Rinse with warm water. Discard any remaining mixture. Pumpkin Mask [Nourishing and Moisturizing] We also recommend our Pumpkin Mask for Acne-Prone Skin which can be used on all skin types but is best suited for those with sensitive and/or irritated skin. Pumpkin is full of antioxidants and also provides moisture to the skin. Take some time for yourself this Thanksgiving. Whip up one of these nourishing skin treatments and enjoy the results. Just like these masks, AcnEase ® produces noticeable results. Over 96% of our customers have seen positive results within 30 days of starting AcnEase ® . If you haven’t already tried it, you too can have clear skin in as little as 30 days. We guarantee our product so there is no risk. Do you have any favorite DIY skin treatments?

"[""5 Skin Pleasing Treats For A Clear and Beautiful Complexion Skin This Fall 11-04-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Fall weather got your complexion looking and feeling a little down? Autumn can be a tough time for anyone with acne, as the cool, dry air tends to dehydrate most skin, which can often result in breakouts. Acne is a usually the result of a hormonal imbalance, which goes on to affect the sebaceous glands. These glands produce sebum , or oil, which travels along the hair follicle, or pore, to protect and nourish the skin. Some imbalanced hormones can trigger the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum than necessary, which becomes clogged within the pore on its way to the surface. When combined with dead skin cells, bacteria forms, which sparks an inflammatory reaction, resulting in symptoms called pimples. Taking some extra steps to ensure a smooth and hydrated complexion is well worth the time, and luckily, it doesn’t take much at all. We’ve come up with 5 simple, seasonally-themed treats for acne-prone skin this fall to help you achieve a clear, beautiful complexion. 5 Fall Weather Treats To Please Your Skin Decrease oil with a fall-themed DIY mask. Oily skin is oftentimes a symptom of the acne condition. Most people usually want to strip away any oil with a topical wash made from harsh chemicals, which can actually trigger the body to create more oil to replace what was just lost, exacerbating the formation of acne. Keeping the skin clean by washing twice daily is an essential step in any skincare regimen, but if you have especially oily skin you can look to an easy and effective honey mask to help remove unwanted oil from the surface without compromising your complexion. To make, simply mix two parts honey to one part cinnamon, which will help open up pores to push bacteria out. Once a paste is formed, apply to skin, and rinse away after about 10-15 minutes. Slough away dead skin with a gentle exfoliating scrub. While oil is partially responsible for acne, dry, flaky skin plays its part too, contributing to the formation of bacteria within clogged pores. Exfoliating is key in the cooler months when dead skin cells tend to collect on the surface, but keeping it gentle will prevent any further dryness from damaging your skin. To keep things seasonal, look to a traditional fall side dish to create this cranberry facial scrub , which works to deliver a healthy dose of vitamins and antioxidants. Tone with a gentle chamomile tonic. If your pores are in need of a tightening tune-up, you can indulge your senses and skin with a chamomile-lavender toner, which is gentle on skin, calming any irritation you may be experiencing from the outdoor elements. The best part? This treat is simple and super affordable. To make, steep 3-4 chamomile tea bags in about 4 ounces of water, and allow to cool to room temperature. Add 2-3 drops of lavender essential oil, a natural antimicrobial, and dip a cotton ball into the solution, gently dabbing onto the face, or affected areas. Moisturize. If you’re only able to treat your skin to one thing this fall, you’ll want to stick with this suggestion. The cool outdoor air, combined with the forced, hot air we’ve all started cranking indoors really puts our complexions through the ringer. Even if your skin is oily, those dead skin cells that form as a result of the cooler, drier weather are likely forming, which is why keeping your complexion plump, healthy and hydrated will go a long way in achieving clear skin. While a non-comedogenic moisturizer or night cream is always suggested, you can find creative ways to add a little moisture to your skin without the residue if that’s what you prefer. Adding a humidifier to your room while you sleep is a great way to hydrate while you rest, and keeping the length and temperature of your showers as low as you can tolerate will prevent moisture from being zapped as you cleanse. As always, drinking the recommended 8 glasses of water a day can make for great changes to the complexion, but if you need to hydrate on the go, you can still snack on dehydrated fruit such as apricots, apples and blueberries.

"[""Facial Cleansing Brushes: Good or Bad for Acne-Prone Skin? 11-30-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Over the last few years, a new skincare tool has been all the rage for people spanning the entire spectrum of skin types. Offering users a deep clean, a variety of facial cleansing brushes claim to deliver a healthy glow and a blemish-free complexion. But are these brushes doing more harm than good for acne-prone skin? Designed to give users the cleanest clean possible, brushes work to remove dirt, grime, makeup and bacteria with the help of oscillating bristles or heads. Intended to keep pores clean in a similar style to microdermabrasion, brushes offer an at-home exfoliating treatment that was previously only available at the hands of a dermatologist or aesthetician. Whether brushing is indeed a skincare breakthrough or just a trend, it is important for those with acne-prone skin to be aware of the positive and negative aspects associated with brushing before making a decision to add another element to your skincare ritual. Here are just a few. PROS of brushing Exfoliation. Keeping pores clear of dead skin cells is an important aspect of skin care for the acne-prone. The combination of excess sebum and dead skin cells is what clogs pores and leads to breakouts. When we exfoliate the surface of the skin regularly, we have a better shot at remaining blemish-free (though this is only half of the solution). Pairing the exfoliating powers of a brush with a systemic treatment (like AcnEase ® ) designed to target the source of the problem, the overproduction of sebum, is your best bet for remaining acne-free. Improvement of skin texture. Acting as what is essentially a mini-massage, the surface of the skin is stimulated, which increases blood circulation, resulting in a rosy glow, and a softer, smoother dermis over time. CONS of brushing You may experience an influx of breakouts. Because the circular motion of the brush head sloughs away dead skin, these cells can plug up pores. Despite cleaning the surface, the production of sebum is still fully functional beneath the surface, which makes brushing alone a temporary solution. With regular use, the breakouts may become less frequent. HOWEVER, if you have cystic acne, brushing can not only harm the existing cysts, but also allow more bacteria to enter the pores, so it is really not for you. Over-drying. Along with dead skin, brushes can also rid the skin of the oils necessary to maintain a healthy complexion. While acne is believed to be caused in part by over-productive sebaceous glands, users should aim to balance the production of sebum, rather than rid the skin of all oil. Brushing is a good way to feel squeaky-clean, but lasting solutions are seen when we treat the problem from within our body. Important Tips to Follow for Brushing Following the major success of early brands to hit the market, there are now many options to choose from. The two types of skincare brushes available, sonic and rotating, both feature nylon bristles. The sonic brush oscillates back and forth at a rate of 300 motions per second while the rotating brush moves in a circular motion. Facial cleansing brushes typically range in price from as low as $15 for a drugstore design, to over $100 for a higher-end model. When it comes to using a motorized tool to clean your complexion, it is not recommended to skimp on this purchase, as you really do get what you pay for. Using a brush can be a beneficial supplement to an existing skincare regimen. Users and developers alike suggest gradually introducing the tool into your routine, starting at once a week, and adding use until the right amount for your skin is found. Most dermatologists recommend a maximum of three days a week. It is important to stick with a gentle facial wash, free of exfoliating beads, as too much exfoliation can break down skin tissues which can lead to inflammation and irritation. Always remember to moisturize and be sure to replace brushes every three months for the best results. Exfoliating the surface is a good step in helping your skin remain healthy and free of breakouts. However, “treating” not “helping” is a key word here as retaining clear skin requires that the problem be addressed at the source, among the oil-producing sebaceous glands. AcnEase ® is a 100% herbal formula, used to treat acne at its source as it works to prevent the outward symptoms of breakouts. AcnEase ® works to manage the relationship between hormones and sebaceous glands, allowing the glands to produce oil at a normal rate, naturally eliminating acne symptoms and simultaneously preventing new breakouts. If you’re thinking of adding a facial cleansing brush to your skincare routine, pairing it with a systemic treatment such as AcnEase ® is your best bet for achieving and maintaining clear, healthy skin.

"[""5 Easy Acts of Self Care That Can Help You Fight Acne 11-09-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When it comes to living with acne, a skin care routine is an essential part of maintaining clear and healthy skin, but what about the parts of ourselves we can’t see? Self-care simply refers to any acts devoted to supporting your mental, physical, and/or emotional well being. Acne obviously affects the physical part of us, but do you know how this skin condition can affect the other areas of our lives? Acne has been linked to depression, anxiety and low self-esteem among many, especially among teens and those with severe or chronic symptoms. Because acne affects more than just our skin, it’s important that we give our whole selves some extra love and attention from time to time. Looking at self-care as a part of your skincare regimen can not only work to improve acne from within, but help us get a helpful perspective on our condition, while helping develop healthier habits all around. We’ve come up with five easy, everyday ways you can add small acts of self-care into your routine, because skincare doesn’t have to stop at the surface! Give yourself a minute to rest. In a world that’s often go-go-go, it can seem like a lot to ask of yourself to take a few minutes to slow down, but giving yourself the gift of the moment in the moment can help reduce stress and anxiety, and possibly help fight hormonal acne . You don’t have to devote an hour to de-stressing - even a few deep, mindful breaths can help keep you centered and available to accept what’s ahead. There are many great apps like Headspace that can help you get a few minutes of guided relaxation. Treat your skin and body to a wellness session. The idea here is simply to devote some time and attention to your body, whether that look like a professional massage, a DIY spa day , or even taking a couple of minutes to stretch out any sore or tired muscles. We take measures of self-care to feed our minds and bodies what it needs, so just remember - if your bodies are calling out for some extra TLC, listen! The littlest bit of attention can sometimes go a long way. Partake in esteem-building activities not related to your looks or skin. It may be hard sometimes to not be obsessed with our acne, especially for anyone with severe or chronic symptoms that just don’t seem to stay away. With all the time and attention we pay to our skin, sometimes treating the condition can seem overwhelming, which is why it’s important to find things other than skincare to direct our attention toward, like joining a team or book club, or trying out a new recipe - whatever works for you! Honoring the self with esteem-building practices not only helps us to feel better about ourselves, but also encourages us to make better decisions for our general well being, which can carry over into our skin care practices. Implement a mantra or skin care ritual. When it comes to adopting healthy habits, encouragement is everything, and there’s no reason you can’t be your own cheerleader. Adopting a comforting or motivating phrase or mantra can be the boost you need to keep working toward your skincare goals, and adding one to your morning or nighttime cleansing ritual can turn your usual face wash into a blissful break from the stress of the day. Rituals not only work to reduce anxiety and stress, but also allow for mindfulness in the moment, which often encourages people to take their time while caring for their skin. A skincare ritual is like a little gift we can give ourselves and our skin, so the next time you’re lathering up or applying your moisturizer, try doing so with a deep breath, and a mindfulness of what you’re doing and why – even try putting on on some relaxing music, light a candle and diffuse some essential oils into the air! Small actions can go a long way, and just might help you find a new appreciation for your skin, and your skincare routine. Keeping a positive outlook to keep going and not give up. Easier said than done, we know, but resisting the urge to compare ourselves to others is a freedom like no other, and can make a big difference in our mental health, and outlook on life in general. Maybe it’s time to take a temporary hiatus from social media, or plan a hang out with some good friends who you know always pull you up rather than drag you down. Everyone deserves to have skin they can feel good about living in, and that includes you. Keep up the awesome work, and never give up, because your happiness and health are worth working for. Of course, there will be days when we feel tired and frustrated. We might not want to take ten minutes to apply a facial mask, or even stop to catch our breath, and that’s OK. Even if you don’t have those few extra minutes in the day, you can do yourself and your skin a kindness by implementing a treatment that will constantly work from within to stop acne before it starts. This is why our AcnEase® users love AcnEase® so much – it takes care of acne while you take care of yourself, and with a 96% user success rate and 60 day money back guarantee, you can give yourself the gift of clear skin with no risk involved.

"[""Q: Are facials good or bad for acne? I thought extraction was a “no-no”! 11-14-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments A: Everyone I know loves getting a facial. But most people think of facials as something to do on a special occasion, like for their birthday, or with the gift card their friend or family member got them. Building a relationship with an esthetician that has a wealth of knowledge about skin can truly change your condition. Try to think of facials like you would going to the gym. It’s a part of your body maintenance that shouldn't be neglected. Many clients ask me how often they should get facials and my answer is different for everyone. If you’re suffering from a condition like acne, having a facial is a bit more of an involved decision. First, if you have active cystic acne, you may want to wait until the major cysts heal at least partially (due to the level of inflammation of the cysts and the many white cells that this inflammation produces so close to the surface of the skin). For those with many blackheads and whiteheads and some mild or moderate acne breakouts, once a month is a good idea if you can swing it. If you have great skin and no serious problems, then getting a facial is good to do at least once a season. Your skin cells turn over approximately every 30 days, so getting on a regimen and care plan that aligns with this natural process can do wonders for your skin. A big part of the facial is extraction. The process of extraction actually has a lot in common with the biggest “no-no” of acne science - popping the pimple. Yet this is the professional popping of blackheads and whiteheads. Getting the pores physically extracted can help control your acne condition – also, with extraction, you can get harder sebum removed that would have eventually turned into a big inflamed pimple. But please, don’t do this at home because doing so can lead to more acne, scarring and hyperpigmentation. Professionally removing the whiteheads and blackheads allows in some instances to stop inflammation and pimple formation (for AcnEase users, these will go away). There’s a ton of preparation of the skin that goes into the professional extraction process. It is important to soften the sebum and prepare the skin thoroughly before attempting to squeeze anything – and then, closing the pores is as equally important (and should be done with a non-inflammatory toner and moisturizer). I have seen beautiful skin with broken capillaries that doesn’t recover from being unprepared, and squeezed in to oblivion. So again, don’t try it at home as most likely you’ll cause more skin damage and inflammation. As all other topical products or treatments, facials and professional extractions assist your battle with acne. They can help in preventing the worsening of the condition or in healing of some of the symptoms. The only real way of treating acne is to break the cycle of acne formation and prevent new acne form coming. This is why I 100% back AcnEase and normally recommend it to my clients since it is a treatment that gets to the root cause internally. Acne doesn’t go away without an internal treatment – it’s an internal issue that manifests itself externally. So, back to facials. They’re relaxing and remind you to take care of yourself. Many clients have told me that having a monthly scheduled facial motivates them to continue self care in other ways of their life. Taking time to take care of your skin, turns the focus on yourself. People are very busy and get easily distracted with everything happening outside of their body. This neglect leads your body, and especially your skin, screaming out for attention. Setting a monthly reminder to focus on you and your skin sets a wonderful tone to your life. Self care is incredibly important not only physically, but also mentally. I hope this motivates you today to make a positive change. Please leave comments below and I will answer!

"[""Skin-friendly Valentine's Day Cocktails 02-07-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Having acne-prone skin doesn't mean having to miss out on all the fun of either celebrating or not celebrating Valentine's Day! You can still enjoy yourself and enjoy a cocktail right alongside your friends without exacerbating your acne. You might be wondering what sort of cocktail you could sample (of course, if you are 21 years old or older and... in moderation) that won't give you sugar overload and negatively affect your skin. Try these 2 amazing cocktail recipes - your friends won't believe how healthy and skin-friendly they are! Melon Skin-Refresher Cocktail The freshly squeezed fruit juices in this cocktail are rich in vitamins and minerals that are readily absorbed by the body in order to revive problem skin and even provide additional energy. Parsley is rich in nutrients (especially iron) and will help bring a healthy glow to your complexion. A little coconut rum turns this healthy concoction into a drink fit for a party. Try to choose organic fruits and vegetables when possible. Ingredients ½ honeydew melon 6 grapes ¼ cucumber Splash of Malibu Rum Ice 1 sprig parsley How to make it Combine the melon, grapes, cucumber and rum all together in a juicer* and process. Make fresh before consuming because the nutrients are most effective and potent at this point. Pour over ice, top with parsley and serve. *You may of course prefer to use a cocktail shaker rather than your juicer. Carrot and Pineapple Skin-Friendly Cocktail This fresh juice is full of beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A. Carrots help to clear spots and blemishes and help boost the skin's resistance to UV light. Combined with pineapple, the juice will help to stimulate digestion and regulate the metabolism. Again, try to choose organic fruits and vegetables when possible. Ingredients 4 large carrots 2 generous slices of pineapple 1 ounce vodka 1 ounce orange liqueur ½ ounce freshly squeezed lime juice Fresh wedges of pineapple for the rim How to make it Process the carrots, pineapple, vodka, orange liqueur, and lime juice together in a juicer. Pour into a chilled cocktail glass, and add a pineapple wedge on the rim. Voila! Easy, tasty, skin-friendly cocktail you and your friends will love! If you want to enjoy a skin-friendly cocktail this Valentine's Day but are still worried it will exacerbate your acne, just remember that a little alcohol in moderation is okay, and be sure to take your AcnEase to prevent any flare-ups!

"[""Valentine's Day Fun Your Skin Will Love 02-06-2014 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments When we think of Valentine's Day, we usually think of candy hearts and boxes of chocolate from friends and loved ones. And for those of us with acne, we think about how eating all of this extra sugar may wreak havoc on our skin Need some V-Day ideas your skin will love? We've got you covered! 1. Handmade Valentines Feeling loved and loving others is a surefire way to boost your mood. A happy person is one less likely to fall prey to stress, which can exacerbate acne. So spread the love this Valentine's Day with handmade valentines. Taking the time to craft a heartfelt message to your loved ones will remind you how happy you make each other, and your skin will glow with knowledge that powerful. 2. Healthy Dinner Party It might be a habit for you to book your V-Day dinner at your favorite fancy restaurant, but your favorite restaurant may not be your skin's favorite restaurant. Try planning a healthy dinner menu for two, or a healthy potluck for you and your friends. Center the menu around acne-friendly foods , and focus on moderation when it comes to dessert. Your chances of gorging on foods that could exacerbate your acne are much less when you plan the menu yourself. 3. Get Moving Together You might be thinking, right, like I'm going to exercise on Valentine's Day . But before you dismiss the idea, consider this: exercise releases endorphins, which are associated with a feeling of euphoria. Consider an hour of yoga, a walk through a nearby park, a bike ride through your favorite part of town, or a dance party in your living room, and enjoy the feeling of euphoria with the people you love most on this special day. Your skin will thank you for it, too. 4. Volunteer Your Time Volunteering is a great way to make this Valentine's Day one to remember by helping others. Do a little research on the volunteering opportunities in your neighborhood, and schedule a little time on V-Day for you and your friends to give back. Stepping outside your own life for a bit and helping others will help to ease any stress you've been feeling--which will only benefit your skin. 5. Make a Healthy Treat There's a good chance you can turn your favorite treat into a healthier version. Try substituting the less skin-healthy ingredients for ingredients that your skin may like a bit better. For example, if your favorite recipe calls for granulated sugar, try substituting with raw honey. Or try adding a little something sweet to a healthy treat, like melting some dark chocolate and drizzling over your favorite fruit. You may even find your new favorite treat! And to prevent any flare-ups before this special day, remember to take your AcnEase ®!

"['Q: What are the best ways to deal with acne scarring? 10-23-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments A: One of the most frustrating parts of acne are the scars that it leaves behind. A pimple that only lasts a week can leave its impression on your skin for weeks, months or even- forever. There is number of ways to deal with scars – some that can start even when you still have acne and others that are only suitable after your skin improves. The major fact is however that the firth thing you need to do in your battle with acne scars is to stop acne so your skin doesn’t get injured anymore! This is why I recommend AcnEase to do this since it stops the acne cascade and prevents new pimples form forming. While putting prevention first, it is definitely worth it to also look at other options that could be very helpful in managing acne scars. I think it’s important to also realize how acne scars form so you can help it not happen! In general, scars on our skin result from a wound or injury. Most superficial wounds heal without scarring. It\'s when the skin is really damaged that scars form on the skin. Acne scars are most often the product of inflamed breakouts such papules, pustules or cysts. Inflamed blemishes cause the pore to become engorged causing a break in the follicle wall. If the rupture occurs near the skin\'s surface, the lesion is usually minor and heals quickly. More serious lesions arise when there is a deep break in the follicle wall. The infected material spills out into the skin and destroys healthy skin tissue. In response, the skin forms new collagen fibers. Unfortunately, the finished ""repair job"" never looks as good as before the injury and this patching is called a scar. So let’s look at some professional ways to deal with scars… Microdermabrasion : This is a treatment that can only be done after your acne has completely cleared. Personally, I think this is a very aggressive treatment and can only be handled by a few skin types. If you are using active topicals, like alpha-hydroxy acids or Retin A, you must discontinue them for at least a week before treatment or opt out of the treatment all together. If you have even slightly sensitive skin, I would suggest another service. Also, you must have patience with this because it takes multiple sessions and the healing process also takes time. Finally – deep scars cannot really be removed by microdermabrasion, and you must have a skilled professional do the treatments. Light chemical peels: I have seen good results through chemical peels with my clients who have suffered from acne scarring. This is a good option because you can get these done while you still have some active acne (not cysts or lesions but occasional pimples), and it will make scaring less visible and skin less oily at least for a while. There are lots of different peels out on the market and it can be confusing to decide which is best for you, and what the results are going to be. The newer philosophies with peels are that the light to medium depth peels are best, as opposed to the ""strip your face off"" aggressive treatments that were more popular in the past. These more superficial peels can take a series of treatments to obtain the acquired results, but each time reveals better looking skin, so the process is encouraging. The best peels for sensitive skin are mandelic acid, and lactic acid, in concentrations below 20%. Glycolic acid and TCA are much more aggressive and not suggested for sensitive skin. As professional skin services are a nice supplement to personal care, your daily skincare regimen still needs to be personalized for your skin and your acne treatment must address the internal causes of acne to truly make the difference. Remember this! So let’s switch over to vitamins now. Vitamin C is great for helping fade scaring. This is a great brightening vitamin and will give your skin a more overall even tone. My favorite way to use Vitamin C at home is in the form of a lemon sugar scrub. This gives you the benefit of the brightening Vitamin C, as well as the glycolic exfoliation from the sugar cane molecule. Mix in a few drops of lemon juice with a few teaspoons of organic sugar cane and a teaspoon of olive oil. Do this scrub nightly to reveal a more even-toned brighter complexion. Exfoliation is also a key to helping scarring. Vitamin A is the king of exfoliation because it encourages your cells to shed faster from underneath, as opposed to taking off the superficial layers of skin on the surface. The post-inflammatory hyper-pigmenation that is created after a pimple has healed is occurring in the deeper layer of the skin. This is why using a light at home scrub a few times a week seems to get you nowhere when it comes to scarring. Prescription retinols do work for some people, but I always stress the importance of listening to your skin. If it feels tight and dry, use the product less. I think the best form of retinol comes from natural sources, and may take more time to work, but produces less inflammation in the skin. Rosehip seed oil is a wonderful oil to use at night. This oil is non-comedogenic, so it will not clog your pores. It is high in trans-retinoic acid and also essential fatty acids that support your skins repairing and exfoliating process. Please don\'t’ forget however - professional skin treatments, vitamins and oils alone aren’t going to prevent the scarring from happening. This is why I recommend something like AcnEase, which treats the imbalance from within and prevents you from having to deal with scarring in the first place! You can probably guess what I’m going to say next too…finally, we need to talk sunscreen . Contrary to some beliefs, sun exposure does NOT help your acne scars. Therefore, the continued use of sunscreen cannot be more stressed. The melanin reaction that takes places when there is inflammation around a pimple is primarily what is causing the discoloration in the skin. When the skin is exfoliated, it is more sensitive to sun and needs to be protected accordingly. If you exfoliate, but do not protect the skin, you will actually make your scars worse by making them more visible. The bottom line is if you exfoliate, which you should if you have scars, you must protect your skin against the sunrays every singe day, not just when you are in direct sunlight. So I hope this answered the question about how to help scarring. Let me know what you want to hear each week and I’ll be glad to answer!

"[""3 Easy Ways To Use Apple Cider Vinegar To Help Your Acne 10-23-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments It’s officially fall, and while most of the world has gone pumpkin spice crazy, we want to throw it back to some old fashioned skincare goodness to show you the healing power of apples, or more specifically, apple cider vinegar (ACV.) When it comes to the benefits apple cider vinegar can have on acne-prone skin, the list is practically endless! It can naturally detoxify the body of harmful free radicals by flushing toxins from within, exfoliate dead skin cells on the surface, and contains manganese, which helps the body metabolize vitamins, and protects cells against damage caused by free radicals. Even digesting apple cider vinegar has its benefits, as the process produces malic acid, naturally rich in antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties, which are all essential steps in fighting acne! Now, please don’t think if you drink ACV every day that your acne is going to magically disappear. We just want to tell you about some ways that you can use it to help your acne symptoms. The best part about ACV? It can work to help reduce acne symptoms from the surface of the skin by preventing an inflammatory response before it happens. Acne occurs when sebum, or oil produced by the sebaceous glands, becomes clogged within a pore. When combined with dead skin cells, the pairing creates bacteria known as P. acnes, which then triggers the body to send in white blood cells to fight off the bacterial infection. This response, known as “inflammation,” results in acne symptoms on the surface of the skin, which we recognize as pimples. Containing naturally occurring alpha-hydroxy acid, ACV can help exfoliate dry, dead skin cells, reducing the risk of clogged pores. Furthermore, its naturally antibacterial and antiseptic properties can help kill off bacteria that form within a clogged pore, reducing the risk of an inflammatory breakout. When combined with a systemic solution, which works to control the production of sebum, such as AcnEase, apple cider vinegar can be a key player in any combination therapy treatment against acne! 3 Easy Ways To Use ACV To Help Your Acne There’s no doubt that apple cider vinegar can make for a wonderful supplement to any skincare routine, but how can it be used? We have three, simple ACV recipes that only take a minute to prepare, and require just a little help from a few ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen! ACV Toner An apple cider vinegar toner is a wonderful alternative to alcohol-rich store bought astringents that may further dry the skin. In a glass or ceramic bowl, mix one part organic, unfiltered ACV with two parts filtered water. The amount you use depends purely on how much toner you wish to create - but as fresh is always best, we recommend starting out with tablespoon measurements to create a small batch. Then dip a cotton ball or pad into the solution, and wipe all over cleansed skin, concentrating on the affected areas. Once the toner has dried, apply your regular moisturizer or sunscreen. If you have extra mixture on hand, you can turn this toner into a spray simply by emptying into a clean spray bottle, ideal for treating stubborn body acne in hard to reach places, such as the back! ACV Toddy Drink Perfect for fall, an apple cider vinegar drink can help deliver essential vitamins and nutrients from within. To create, simply mix: 2 Tbsp organic ACV 2 Tbsp lemon juice 1 Tbsp raw honey 10-12 oz. water The antibacterial properties of lemon juice, combined with the anti-inflammatory properties of organic honey will help transform that ordinary glass of water into an acne fighting solution, and can make for a great way to hydrate the body and flush the digestive system if taken first thing in the morning. ACV Exfoliating Mask Apple cider vinegar works well as a topical treatment as it helps the pH levels of the skin become balanced and restored, and helps prevent further damage with naturally occurring beta carotene. When combined with exfoliating baking soda, ACV can make for a wonderful mask to help slough off dead skin cells, without over drying. Simply mix equal parts ACV and baking soda until a paste-like consistency is formed. Apply to affected areas of the skin, and rinse away with warm water after about 15-20 minutes, patting the skin dry with a clean towel. If apple cider vinegar isn’t your thing, you can also look to green tea, a natural anti inflammatory, or tea tree oil, an oil-zapping antiseptic that’s easier on the skin than typical topicals such as benzoyl peroxide. While the many benefits of apple cider vinegar can work to reduce your acne symptoms from the surface, it's important to remember that the only way to truly fight acne is from within, by targeting the sebaceous glands. Acnease, an all-natural, herbal solution does just that, by creating a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, ensuring that only the necessary amount of sebum needed to hydrate the skin is being produced, and is designed to treat a variety of acne types , from mild to severe. With a systemic treatment like AcnEase preventing breakouts from within, and a home-remedy such as ACV keeping the surface of the skin clean from the outside, your skin has the best chance of remaining acne-free all through the fall, and then some!

"[""If ALL Else Fails: A Real Treatment for Adult Acne 10-26-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Acne is usually associated with being a teen “problem,” but did you know that the average age of someone with acne is 26? If you’ve tried everything to treat your adult acne, or are just experiencing acne for the first time and want to avoid the guessing game, read on to learn what you’re working with, and how to really treat the problem. What Is Adult Acne? Adult acne, like cystic, inflammatory, or any other type of acne, is usually the result of a hormonal imbalance, and how those hormones interact with the sebaceous glands. These glands, which are responsible for producing sebum, the oily substance that travels through the pores to hydrate and moisturize the skin, can become triggered by certain hormones, causing them to create excessive amounts of the oily substance. When combined with dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, bacteria can grow in the pores, possibly leading to breakouts. Adult acne is no different from ordinary acne, but the frustration many face regarding it comes with treatment. There are a couple of reasons why you may be having trouble treating your adult acne. Many acne products are designed with teen skin in mind. When adolescents hit puberty, hormones can go haywire, triggering an overproduction of oil specifically around the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin,) and sometimes chest and back. Most over-the-counter acne products are designed to treat teen acne, and their solution is to zap that excess oil from the surface of the skin, which can actually end up triggering even more oil to be produced, possibly leading to more acne! And in some cases, the internal issue never resolves itself, so acne can stay with them into adulthood or they may even experience it suddenly in adulthood. Additionally, adult skin tends to be drier, retaining less moisture with age, so the best bet is to find a gentle topical wash to cleanse the skin with no more that two times a day, then follow up with a non-comedogenic moisturizer. You aren’t working to treat your acne type . Like treatment solutions, not all acne is created equal. Cysts look and feel different than blackheads, so why would we use the same face wash, lotion or even cleansing technique to treat both as if they were the same thing? Additionally, it’s important to go with the flow when it comes to your skin, meaning, much in the same way as your eyesight or weight may fluctuate throughout your lifetime, your skin will too. You may have had dry skin two years ago, only to find a combination of types just this season. Work with it! Listen to your skin, and then give it what it needs - it will thank you, and save you from unnecessary frustration! You aren’t taking a preventative approach. This is the most common reason many people with acne continue to experience acne symptoms - we wait until there is a problem before we begin treatment. There is a more effective way to truly treat acne, and it all starts within. How Can I Really Treat My Adult Acne? The fact that acne is not something most people “grow out of” says a lot about the way acne should be looked at when aiming to treat it. Obviously, keeping the surface of the skin clean is an essential aspect of any skincare regimen, but it’s important to remember that the real issue lies with rebalancing the sebaceous gland activity, which is done from within. Many of our AcnEase users have learned that our treatment specifically inhibits the impact of fluctuating hormone levels on sebaceous gland secretions, and does not affect hormone levels per se, but rather works as a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, modulating the amount of sebum produced. This helps explain why AcnEase® is equally effective in treating both adolescent and adult acne in both men and women - it assures that your body is producing only the amount of sebum necessary for proper hydration and protection, no more, no less! Trial and error is a great way to learn, but when you don’t treat your specific acne type, success may not be on your side. Try this. We have a link on our site ( /acne-treatment-system/ ) that helps you figure out what type of acne you have and which treatment is best for you. 96% of our clients have been successful with this, so you have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain.

"[""3 Top Do’s and Don’ts to Eliminate Acne Cysts and Pimples This Fall 10-28-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Cooler days and longer nights can only mean one thing - Fall is in full swing! For some, this shift in seasons is a welcome departure from the scorching summer months, but for anyone with acne, this time of year can make for a whole new set of troubles and concerns. Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States, and comes in many forms. Acne is attributed to a hormonal imbalance, which can affect the function of the sebaceous glands, whose job is it to create sebum , or oil, which travels along the pore to hydrate and protect the skin on the surface. When too much sebum becomes clogged within a pore and pairs with dead skin cells from the surface, bacteria forms, triggering an inflammatory response from the body. The result of that response usually appears as red, swollen bumps known as pimples, a symptom of acne. Two common types of acne are pustules and cysts, both a result of inflammation, which can become further triggered by the cool air of the fall months. We’ve put together a quick and easy list of do’s and don’ts to refer to help rid your skin of these symptoms this fall! DO: Learn your acne type. While pustules and cysts are both forms of inflammatory acne, they are quite different in a number of ways, and treating each requires a little something different in order to witness real results. The difference between cysts and pimples lies in where they find themselves on the skin, with pimples above, and cysts forming below the surface. Learning your acne type can help shine a light on which treatment can work best for you. Implement a combination therapy approach to treatment. Regardless of where your acne appears on the complexion, it all starts in the same place - the sebaceous glands. By taking a combination approach to treating your acne , you can reduce the risk of clogging pores with sebum from the inside, while reducing dead skin cells on the surface by cleansing and exfoliating - a must-do during the chilly months of fall and winter. (*A note to AcnEase users: your treatment is working from within to ensure that any imbalance of hormones will not affect the sebaceous glands, allowing for only a healthy amount of sebum to be produced.) Have patience. Although you may sometimes wake up to a new pimple or cyst, it has actually been forming underneath the surface for days. And if you’ve had acne for over 2 years, treating it will likely take some time. As with any routine or regimen, patience is essential when it comes to skincare, and resisting the urge to over-wash or pop that pimple can actually reduce the risk of creating more acne, especially when it comes to cysts, which are so hard to treat as the spread of bacteria is more common with this type of acne. One way to stay on track is to add an indulgent fall-themed acne treatment facemask, which can easily be created with a few ingredients from the kitchen, like this moisturizing pumpkin mask ! DON’T: Over-wash or load up on many different products. Ads and commercials train us to keep our complexions squeaky clean with products that most likely contain drying ingredients, which can actually end up doing more harm by triggering those sebaceous glands to produce even more sebum to make up for what is stripped away by the ingredients. In the fall months, keeping moisture both inside and outside of the skin’s surface is something everyone should be making an effort to do, so remember to take it easy on the topicals, and try not to wash more than twice daily. Remember to also use products that are non-comedogenic. Forget to moisturize. Most people with oily skin feel like they can skip out on the moisturizing step in skincare, but as much as sebum is to blame for acne, dead skin cells shouldn’t get off the hook so easily, as they are just as responsible for the bacteria which often leads to breakouts. Whether you hydrate from within with the recommended 8-10 glasses of water a day, or from the outside with a daily sunscreen or non-comedogenic moisturizer at night, be sure not to skip this step to give your skin the care and protection it deserves. Neglect your internal health. Just because the days get shorter doesn’t mean our lives get any less busy, and it’s easy to slack on important aspects of our health like maintaining a balanced diet or getting enough sleep, which can actually end up hurting our skin. You can help regenerate skin cells from within by keeping stress levels low with getting enough sleep each night, or reduce inflammation systemically with the foods that you eat, such as honey, garlic, and turmeric, all naturally packed with anti-inflammatory properties. No matter how much care we show the surface of our skin, acne does not go away on its own when it's left untreated. No food, topical or DIY treatment can do it. Symptoms might lessen, but they will almost always come back. Why? Acne is a usually the result of a hormonal imbalance, which occurs from within. Our AcnEase® users are able to experience how a treatment can act as a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands so that the sebaceous glands can return to normal activity. The botanical ingredients that make up the various AcnEase® treatments were selected based on years of research and trials as the safest and most effective combination to not only eliminate existing acne symptoms but also prevent new acne from forming, no matter how severe . It is the only natural treatment on the market that PREVENTS acne (with a 96% user success rate), which is KEY to the process of breaking the acne cycle. We want to hear from you!

"[""The Many Ways To Use Brewer's Yeast To Help Fighting Acne 10-31-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments If you have been dealing with acne for any amount of time, you probably feel like you’ve heard of, and tried, just about every tonic, treatment and remedy under the sun, but there’s one you probably haven’t heard much about, and it’s a dietary supplement worth knowing. Brewer’s yeast is most known for it’s role in making beer, but did you know it can also work to help keep skin healthy and acne-free? What Is Brewer’s Yeast? Made from a single-celled fungus, brewer’s yeast has been used as a nutritional supplement for years because of its high levels of minerals, such as protein, B-vitamins (with the exception of vitamin B12 ,) selenium, and chromium. Known for assisting with a variety of ailments such as diabetes and high cholesterol, brewer’s yeast is rich in several B vitamins which work to aid in digestion, support the nervous system, and keep the hair, skin, eyes and liver healthy. How Does It Work To Help Fight Acne? While rich in a variety of minerals, there are two specific trace minerals in brewer’s yeast which work to keep skin healthy, possibly improving acne. These minerals are selenium, and chromium. Selenium works to help the body produce antioxidant enzymes, which work to help prevent cell damage by protecting and nurturing them. These antioxidants also promote cell turnover, which can improve both the health and appearance of the skin. Chromium works to help the body maintain balanced blood sugar levels, which may assist in reducing the effects of the acne cascade on the body. Acne is typically caused by a hormonal imbalance, which triggers an overproduction of sebum, or oil, by the sebaceous glands. This excessive amount of oil can become clogged within a pore, and when combined with dead skin cells, creates bacteria, which leads to acne symptoms, or pimples. Some believe that when our insulin hormones kick into high gear , other hormones may become knocked off balance, triggering this cascade, and resulting in breakouts on the surface of the skin. What Are The Best Ways To Use Brewer’s Yeast? As a systemic supplement. The simplest way to take brewer’s yeast is orally, as a dietary supplement. It is recommended to add up to two tablespoons per day to food, or you can mix well in a glass of water or juice, but keep in mind that it does come with a naturally bitter taste. Taking brewer’s yeast systemically can help deliver a healthy dose of essential B vitamins, including B3, or niacin, which is known to reduce inflammation. This is an important player in the fight against acne, as those red, swollen breakouts you see on your skin are actually an inflammatory response to the bacteria created within a clogged pore. As a topical mask. You can also use brewer’s yeast to form a simple yet effective mask to apply to the surface of the skin. Simply mix one teaspoon of powdered brewer’s yeast with one teaspoon of milk or plain organic yogurt. Apply to clean skin, and remove with a cloth and lukewarm water once the mask has dried, usually after about 10-15 minutes. The brewer’s yeast will work to gently absorb excess oil and tighten pores, while the lactic acid found in the dairy will make for a mild exfoliant, revealing a calm, clean complexion. While brewer’s yeast comes with a wealth of benefits, there are a few precautions to take before adding this supplement to your skincare routine. Brewer’s yeast, like many dietary supplements, can interact with other medications you might be taking, and anyone currently on a prescription regimen to treat diabetes or Crohn’s disease should be especially cautious and consult your physician first to avoid a harmful medical mishap. Fortunately, there are other alternatives to help ensure the health and clarity of your skin, such as AcnEase, a systemic, herbal acne alternative that works to actually treat the condition of acne. Targeting acne at its source, AcnEase treats existing symptoms from mild to severe , while preventing new acne from forming, and unlike brewer's yeast, AcnEase does not interact with additional medication, and has no side effects, making it safe for anyone to use.

"[""Sweet Holiday Treats for Acne-Prone Skin 12-23-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments With all the sweet foods at our fingertips during the holiday season, temptation is around almost every corner. While everyone should allow themselves to indulge from time to time, those with acne-prone complexions might find themselves paying for it on the surface of their skin for days. Many people blame their acne on sugar and although no single food is the cause of the condition, certain things we eat, including sugar, can affect the way our bodies react. The condition of acne is due in part to a hormonal imbalance that takes place within the body. Certain hormones can affect the amount of sebum, an oily substance, produced by the sebaceous glands. When too much sebum is produced, it can clog pores. These clogged pores combine with dead skin cells and debris from the skin’s surface and bacteria is formed within the pore, leading to inflammation or breakouts on the surface of the skin. When we eat too many sugary foods, our insulin hormones kick into high gear, which many believe to be directly related to the condition of acne. That is not to say, however, that we cannot have our sweet needs met. The trick is to find alternatives to sugar as a way to sweeten your treats, which can usually be solved by a quick trip to any health food or speciality store. Often overlooked ingredients such as organic honey, stevia, and coconut nectar taste great and won’t wreak havoc on your complexion. The syrupy sweetness of honey provides great flavor to baked desserts and is also full of anti-bacterial properties, which can be a real treat for someone with acne-prone skin. This easy recipe can be whipped up in a matter of minutes, and won’t linger on your skin for days. Crispy Honey Bananas 1 tsp coconut oil 1 banana, sliced 1 tsp organic honey 1 tsp vanilla extract a splash of water a dash of cinnamon Heat coconut oil in a pan over medium-high heat, adding sliced bananas once warm. While cooking, mix honey, vanilla, water and cinnamon in a bowl. Flip bananas after 1-2 minutes, and drizzle with mixture. Serve warm. The healing power of coconut has long been celebrated by many cultures, from hydrating coconut water to skin-healing coconut oil. Using the naturally sweet flavor of this healthy nut can easily enhance the taste of baked goods, or in the case of the recipe below, “no-baked” goods. Using the nutrient-rich coconut nectar, the sap that forms in the stems of coconut blossoms, this low-glycemic treat is great for anyone with acne-prone skin, and a sweet tooth. Chilled Coconut Macaroons 2 cups shredded coconut, unsweetened ½ cup raw cocoa powder ½ cup raw coconut nectar ½ tsp vanilla extract pinch of salt Mix all ingredients in a large bowl. Form teaspoon-size portions into balls with clean hands and place atleast 1 inch apart on a small baking sheet or plate. Freeze 3-4 hours before serving. Many people don’t think of vegetables when they hear dessert, but the creative combo of sweet spices can turn a simple sweet potato into a creamy treat to indulge your tastebuds. Vitamin A-rich foods, such as sweet potatoes, are a pantry staple for the complexion-conscious cook. Also high in antioxidants and vitamin C, sweet potatoes have a low glycemic index, which means they don't have a drastic impact on your blood sugar levels and inflammation. A pinch of stevia in place of sugar can sweeten foods without affecting insulin levels. Sweet Potato Custard Cups 2 sweet potatoes, cooked and mashed ½ cup almond milk dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove stevia to taste Mix all ingredients in a food processor, adding a small bit of stevia at a time, to taste. Pour into cups and chill in the fridge before serving. Making healthy eating choices to benefit your skin can be easy with a little insight and time for planning.

"[""Why as an adult do I have acne? I didn’t have it when I was younger but am now suffering with it! By Courtney Wells (Esthetician) 09-30-2016 0 Comments A: Adult acne can hit you like a train out of nowhere. Lots of people suffer from acne as adults, even if they had perfectly clear skin throughout their teenage years. Acne in younger people is, in a sense, easier to understand, because it is linked to hormonal changes and an excess of oil production from the sebaceous glands. Acne in adults is much more complicated because, yes even though it comes from a hormonal imbalance, there are more sources to contend with. The main trigger (cause) for adult acne is a hormonal imbalance when the excess of some hormones (usually androgens) will cause the sebaceous glands to over produce the sebum - starting the acne cascade. This has to be addressed internally and as many of you know, AcnEase does exactly that. There are also additional factors that may exacerbate acne, and this is what I want to talk about today. Usually my clients with adult acne are suffering with high stress. The stresses of life increases with age as more responsibilities pile on and our lives become more complicated. People get frustrated with this answer. Either they don’t believe this could be the cause, or they don’t know how to effectively lower their stress levels or even fit in the time to do so. I encourage all of my adult acne sufferers to incorporate many effective tools into their lifestyle like daily restorative yoga, or a weekly cranial sacral massage or morning meditation (check out the headspace app). Besides stress, diet can play a big role in adult acne. Many people begin to develop more sensitivities and allergies as they age, and I have seen a direct correlation between acne and diet. Food allergies, even slight, trigger inflammation responses in the body, which encourage breakouts. Try getting an allergy test from your doctor to determine if you may be ingesting foods that cause an inflammation response. For example, some people can have a gluten or dairy sensitivity – both of which cause inflammation. So eliminating these things could not only assist in clearing your acne, but also prevent a lot of other problems in your system down the road! Adult acne needs to be cared for differently than acne in your younger years. As you age, your oil production decreases, so harsh topicals may not be the best solution for you - especially topicals that increase Inflammation and dehydrate the skin. I have seen suffers of adult acne develop worse acne with prescription topicals or harsh over the counter solutions such as a high percentage benzoyl peroxide. They don’t even realize that this is happening either – the symptoms may go away for a little bit but they always return! The main take-a-way with adult acne is this: the only way to fully treat acne is from the inside. As mentioned, this doesn’t have to be done with chemicals and treatments that have side effects. Decrease inflammation and feed your body foods and supplements that nourish. Adding AcnEase to your daily skincare regimen is a great way to treat the issue (since none of these suggestions alone will do that). Also, cut out processed foods and sugar. Find out if you have sensitivities to gluten or to animal products such as lactose from milk. De-stress! Make a commitment and carve out the time to nourish your mind and body. All of these things can make huge changes in your condition and in your overall life.

"[""Everything You Need to Know About Water and Acne 07-22-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Water - it covers our planet, our bodies consist of over 80% of it, and we need it to survive. We also waste it, spill it, pollute it and even try to save it. Even though water is so pervasive in our lives, have you ever gave it a thought as to what effect water might have on your acne? If not, you're in luck! This article has been designed to provide you with everything you need to know about H2O-it covers drinking water to using water as a recreational activity and everything in between. We often think of water as a universally beneficial substance, but under certain conditions and with certain kinds of water, you may actually be hurting yourself in the fight against acne. Keeping Your Body Hydrated The call to drink eight glasses of water a day has become so ubiquitous in our society that almost everyone understands the importance of staying hydrated. However, did you know that water isn't just good for keeping your body running? It's also essential for good skin health as well. Dehydration can lead to a loss of sheen in your skin, and it contributes to giving an aged appearance as well. Getting adequate water will help your skin keep itself moisturized and will ensure that your cells are functioning properly. However, it's important to realize that drinking water isn't a miracle cure for acne. Think of it more as an essential building block for the beginning of good overall health and skin health, but don't increase your water intake in the hopes that your breakouts will vanish overnight. Cleaning Your Skin with Water It may seem counter intuitive, but cleaning your skin with plain water can actually cause it to dry out! This is because your skin does not stay hydrated with water by itself, but rather uses the skin oil (sebum) produced by your sebaceous glands (the glands located in your pores) to stay healthy. When water comes in contact with your skin, especially when using a variety of soaps, it takes with it some of this skin oil, which can dry your skin out. In response to this dryness, your sebaceous glands will begin to overproduce sebum in an attempt to reverse the effects of losing too much of it while washing your face. However, this excess sebum can begin to clog your pores, which will lead to the growth of acne-causing bacteria. To help mitigate the drying effects of water on your skin, avoid hot baths and showers - cool water will not diminish your sebum as much as warm water will. Also, when you're drying wet skin make sure to pat it dry instead of rub it dry because the friction can cause you to lose more sebum as well. The use of a non comedogenic moisturizer will also prevent over drying the skin. Swimming Safely There's nothing better than a dip in the pool to cool off on a hot summer day, and thankfully if you're smart you won't have to worry about the water having a negative effect on your acne. As with using water to clean your skin, you've got to watch out for excess dryness when you go for a swim. However, there are some additional problems that the swimming can pose as well. For one, most pools are treated with chemicals to keep them sanitary. If you have particularly sensitive skin, things like chlorine can cause inflammation, which makes you more susceptible to acne breakouts. If this is the case with you, try swimming in natural bodies of water like a lake or the ocean to avoid contact with chemicals such as this. If that's not a viable option, try applying a protective layer of lotion before you go for a dip, and be sure to shower off (with cool water!) immediately after swimming. If you're swimming in saltwater, it may actually work as a mild antiseptic and dry some pimples, but will also dry your skin. Remember to rinse at least your face with bottled water immediately after swimming in the ocean (or salt water pool), and take a shower as soon as you can. You also need to be careful about your sun exposure. UV rays can penetrate about a foot into the water, so it doesn't really offer you any protection from sunburn. Plus, the surface of the water reflects 100% of the sun's rays, which means that your face is particularly vulnerable to skin damage. In addition to putting you at a higher risk for skin cancer, sunburn can also dry and inflame your skin, and that's the perfect recipe for an acne breakout. So make certain you use your sunscreen and reapply after you finish swimming. Water and Acne Prevention Drinking plenty of water, avoiding hot showers, and minimizing exposure to chemicals or salt will certainly earn you points in keeping your skin healthier and better looking, but it can't do much to help you prevent the root causes of it - some of which are much more internal. When your body's natural balance of hormones are disrupted, typically by the presence of too many androgens in your blood stream, this can send signals to your sebaceous glands to overproduce sebum, and as you already know, this begins the cycle of acne breakouts. So, to effectively stop this cycle you can't simply focus on what's happening at the surface of your skin - you've got to address this underlying hormonal issues. AcnEase was designed as a safe and effective way to fight this hormonal cause, not by altering your hormone levels but by altering their effect on your sebaceous glands. Don't let acne stop you from enjoying the water this summer -let AcnEase help fight the root cause of your breakouts instead and leave you with acne free skin. [Bonus Tips] To keep your skin fresh during the heat or while participating in outdoor activities on hot days, use a DIY personal water spray to spray a light mist on your face and neck a few times a day. Add 2-3 drops of Azulene or chamomile essence, lavender extract or thyme oil to the water. They all have anti-inflammatory properties. For drinking, add a few slices of lemon, a few strawberries or whole raspberries to cold pure water and top it with ice. Let stand in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes, and enjoy!

"['Body Acne: Don\'t Wait to Take Your Shirt Off! How to Treat Your Body Acne Now for Summer 03-12-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Spring is almost here, and before you know it, summer will be upon us. Don\'t wait to take your shirt off to get rid of your body acne. If you start now, by then, you will have made some clear skin to show off! Here are our top tips on how to say ""goodbye!"" to body acne. Cause of Body Acne Women and men that have active physical lifestyles tend to suffer more with body acne primarily due to androgens that are the main stimulator of sebaceous glands. Acne results from the over secretion of sebum by the sebaceous glands and inflammation that follows too much sebum clogging the pores and mixing with acne bacteria that will cause inflammation known as pimples, cysts, lesions, etc. More acne occurs where the skin surface has a greater concentration of sebaceous glands, and where perspiration is more prevailing. The most common sites for acne are, therefore, the face, back and chest. Treatment for Body Acne Since body acne (acne on the chest, back, shoulders and neck) is harder to treat then facial acne, it requires a longer and more intense treatment regimen to see results. The back is made up of tougher skin with thousands of sebaceous glands that can produce excess levels of oil, making this area more susceptible to the formation of cysts and nodules which actually require a longer treatment period. Our FREE Personal Smart-System ™ matches you with the right acne treatment that will give YOU the best results . Find the Best Treatment for YOU! Body Acne Do\'s and Don\'ts 1 - Take a shower following exercise. This will help to wash away excess oils, sweat and dead skin cells preventing bacteria to settle in your clogged pores (reducing the incidence of body acne). 2 - Wear loose clothing made from natural, breathable fabrics like cotton and linen. This clothing will decrease perspiration and will not rub sweat and oil in to the skin. 3 - Diet and Lifestyle. Cutting out greasy, fatty foods, and sugary foods as well as trying to reduce everyday stress can help rebalance your body. 4 - Harsh acne agents are not recommended since they can dry and irritate the skin. Drying soaps and harsh cleansers containing salicylic acid or alcohol can not only dry and irritate, but they can actually stimulate more oil secretion as the skin will try to protect itself against the dryness. Instead, Witch Hazel can be used to enhance your daily cleaning routine since it also reduces inflammation and its astringent properties help skin tissue regenerate. 5 - Our Soothing Body Acne Oil helps calm inflammation and redness. The essential oils have antiseptic and anti-bacterial properties, which also help to control the bacteria on the skin surface. Ingredients 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 teaspoon calendula oil 1 teaspoon almond oil 2 drops tea tree oil 1 drop lavender oil 1 drop chamomile oil Instructions Blend all the oils together and keep in a dark glass bottle. Massage daily over all the acne areas. When the skin has absorbed the oil, freshen with a mixture of witch hazel or aloe vera gel. The gel contains a hormone that accelerates wound healing, and it has mild antiseptic and antibiotic qualities. And remember, treatment + support is really a winning combination in overcoming your acne. So Don\'t Delay!

"[""The Pocket Guide To Naturally Getting Rid Of Acne 07-18-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Organic produce, composting, environmentally sustainable cleansers – let’s face it, going organic feels good and is more and more an adopted way of life.Unfortunately, if you have acne, you may find out that most of the treatment solutions out there involve the use of chemicals, sometimes even quite harmful. But worry not! You don’t have to compromise your healthy lifestyle to achieve an acne-free complexion. Implementing certain natural solutions into your daily life may be easier than you think! Most topical acne solutions involve harsh drying chemicals which tend to dry and age the skin. In addition salicylic acid, alcohol and peroxide as well as retinoid creams or antibiotics will increase your skin sensitivity to sun. This over-drying can actually result in even more acne than before , as the sebaceous glands become triggered to create more sebum (oil) to make up for what was just stripped away! In addition they actually may have some serious long-term side effects (FDA recently warned about benzoyl peroxide). Prescription acne treatments are indeed chemically synthesized. Even if they may work to provide short-term solutions, the “health cost” may be very significant (ex. Accutane being pulled from market and its generics still on market, oral contraceptives used for acne).In addition, unless the the source of acne is targeted , most of the products mentioned above provide only a temporary solution what makes you think twice about using them and exposing yourself to serious and often long term side-effects that come with the territory. Our AcnEase users already get to experience first hand about the power and effectiveness of an all-natural acne treatment , and adding any or all of these tips to your current skincare routine is sure to take your complexion over the top! Wanna get in on the all-natural fun? Check out these quick and simple solutions for getting rid of acne without relying on harsh chemicals! Step 1: Form good habits! Resist the urge to pop! Surely we’ve all been tempted, but popping a pimple can further inflame the area, and can cause bacteria to spread to other pores, leading to more pimples! Popping is also the quickest way to lead to an acne scar, so if you need to tone down the red, try icing the area for a few seconds, and try to keep the area clean until the infection goes away on its own, which usually takes about 3-5 days. The integrity of your skin will be the ultimate reward for your patience! Keep your fabrics clean. The simple act of washing those pillow cases can go a long way in preventing the buildup of bacteria from compromising your complexion! Same goes for bath towels, hand towels, and anything else that might touch your face. If you work out, always make sure to wash that sweaty gear, including sports bras, after every session at the gym. Acne starts from within, but keeping a clean surface is equally important in keeping those pores clean. Step 2: Heal yourself, and your skin, from your kitchen! Best to ingest: garlic, turmeric, berries, fish. You are what you eat...and it shows on your skin! When eating to help with symptoms of acne , the most effective tactic is to work with the body to curb inflammation. In terms of acne, inflammation is the body’s response to the bacteria formed when a pore becomes clogged with excess sebum, along with dead skin cells, dirt and debris. By doing your best to avoid processed foods, which include meats containing nitrates or other preservatives, baked snacks, refined grains such as white flour, and anything with a high sugar content, and replacing them with naturally effective options, your skin will surely reflect the newfound care you show toward it. The easiest foods to add to any diet include antioxidant-rich strawberries and blueberries, or protein-rich nuts such as almonds or walnuts. Garlic and turmeric, both well known for their high anti-inflammatory properties can make for a nice curry, which can easily be paired with an Omega 3-rich fish such as black cod, for those nights when you feel like your skin could use a little extra love. Ready to wear: honey, oatmeal, cucumber, yogurt. Any of these ingredients can make for a great mask when you’re looking to treat your skin to some chemical-free indulgence. One of our favorite recipes only calls for two ingredients: yogurt and honey. The lactic acid in dairy works to slough and exfoliate dead skin cells, while zinc targets inflamed pores. Combined with the antibacterial and moisturizing power of honey, and you’ve got yourself a quick and easy treatment mask, minus the harsh, drying chemicals. Honey and Yogurt Mask For Acne 2 tbsp plain yogurt 1 tbsp organic honey Mix both ingredients in a small bowl, and apply to a clean face. Leave on for about 10 minutes before rinsing away with lukewarm water, and pat skin dry with a clean towel. Herbs. Ahh, the healing power of herbal remedies. Herbs have been used by varying cultures for thousands of years to treat everything from joint pain to menstrual woes to acne. AcnEase wouldn’t be what it is without the use of natural medicine , and when supplemented with additional ways to add herbs to your skincare routine, you’re sure to bring your best face forward. Whether you’re looking for a nice, pore-purging herbal steam, or some herb-infused water, basil, chamomile, and lemon all work to treat pores to an extra special Step 3: Treat the problem at its source All of the above-mentioned tips can make for a wonderful supplement to any skincare routine, but unless you work to treat the problem at its source, those bumps will be back in a matter of time. Acne is usually caused by a hormonal imbalance, which triggers the sebaceous glands to produce an excess of sebum, which can clog pores. AcnEase uses 100% natural ingredients to create a buffer between the hormones and the sebaceous glands, making it a totally safe alternative to harsh chemical treatments that delivers real results! The botanical ingredients that make up the various AcnEase® treatments were selected based on years of research and trials as the safest and most effective combination to not only eliminate acne symptoms, but also prevent acne from returning. It is the only natural treatment on the market that PREVENTS acne (with a high user success rate too), which is KEY to the process of breaking the acne cycle. The best part of working a natural alternative to your advantage is that you get to find what works for your lifestyle. Too busy to sit down for a steam and facial mask? Just whip those ingredients into a smoothie to enjoy as a drink on the go! Hectic schedule changing every day? Just choose the acne treatment right for you and let AcnEase do the work! Finding practical solutions is the best way to assure continuously good habits, so give your skin the love it deserves with some natural healing!

"[""5 Ways Not to Make Your Acne Worse This Summer 07-14-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Summer time is synonymous with fun in the sun, right? If you’ve got acne, it may also mark the beginning of some big-time breakouts, which isn’t exactly most people’s idea of a good time. Many acne sufferers complain of increased acne symptoms during the summer months, when our skin gets hit hardest with a catastrophic combination of skin-damaging factors – the drying effects of the sun, extra dirt and debris buildup from the outdoors…all of this “attacks” our skin. Fortunately, you don’t just have to sit there while your skin takes a beating! There are several simple measures anyone can take to assure that you are not making your acne condition worse this summer. Not only have we made it easy for you to choose the proper acne treatment for you, but here are a few of our favorite tips to assist you along the way. Love the sun (from under the umbrella) Seek shade, not direct sun. It’s not uncommon knowledge at this point - the sun can do some serious damage to your skin. The myth that the sun is a good way to treat acne has been debunked for some time now, and it's important to take this suggestion seriously! The UV rays of the sun are actually pro-inflammatory, meaning any existing pimples can become irritated with too much exposure. Not only that, sunlight can also darken existing acne scars or pigmentation. Once that bronze tan fades, you might be left with a lot of dark marks, which won’t be easy to reduce.If you can’t find a shady porch, tree or beach umbrella outside, try keeping a hat in your bag, and a light sarong or scarf to drape over the neck, chest, back and shoulders. As always, do not skip the non-comedogenic (mostly zinc) sunscreen! Stay cool While you sleep, try to avoid being in the direct way of the air conditioning or a stream of air from a fan. This tip is often overlooked, because honestly, when temps get into the 90’s, the only thing most people are thinking about is staying cool. However, if it is possible to create some space between you and your cooling off method - your skin will appreciate it. Much in the same way fall and winter weather can lead to acne by parching the skin of moisture, the cool breeze of the A/C can do the same. When the skin feels dry, the body signals the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum, the oily substance necessary to hydrate the skin. Too much sebum can become clogged in the hair follicle, or pore, which can lead to an acne breakout in the form of pimples, blackheads, and other irritating blemishes . If you can’t get away from the A/C, make sure to moisturize before bed, and mist with a hydrating toner in the morning if possible. This way, you can stay cool, and your complexion won’t be compromised. (A note to AcnEase users: your treatment is already working from within to assure only the necessary amount of sebum is produced!) Rinsing Off It’s so important to rinse off any type of water you’ve been swimming in – from chlorine, to salt water.While some oily-skinned people might notice a decrease in acne symptoms after a few dips in the pool, the bacteria-fighting properties of chlorine can actually do more harm than good in the long run. Chlorine has a tendency to dry the skin out beyond what is healthy, even if you do have a super oily complexion. If you find yourself poolside this summer and notice a tight feeling on your face, be sure to rinse away that chlorine with fresh water, and follow up with a gentle soap-free cleanser, and non-comedogenic moisturizer if possible. Salt water (or any outdoor water source) from the ocean also needs to be washed away…it can do similar damage. Live Light Whatever you use on your skin (topically) to clean, maintain, beautify or anti-age during the summer, opt for lighter formulas.It doesn’t matter if we’re talking makeup, sunscreen, moisturizer, or face wash, summer weather calls for lighter formulas all around. If you can’t bear the thought of stepping out bare faced, you can make minor adjustments, like switching up the heavy foundation for a lighter BB or CC cream, or tinted oil-free moisturizer. The heat has our skin producing more sweat in the summer months in an effort to cool the body down, and the sebum our skin needs to stay hydrated travels along those same follicles, so we definitely don’t want to clog those pores with a heavy, sticky formula. Moisturizer and sunscreen labeled “oil-free” or “lightweight” typically works best for all skin types this time of year, and still works to deliver a healthy heap of hydration. Summer is synonymous with dewy, glowy skin, so to avoid a meltdown, keep the formulas light - your skin will thank you for it! Don't forget your acne treatment! At home, on a cruise, traveling or visiting Grandma,don’t skip your systemic treatment. Quick summer hacks are a tempting solution for those with problem skin, but for lasting results, proper skin care is an inside job. When it comes to truly treating acne, meaning, getting rid of existing breakouts while preventing new ones from coming up, an acne treatment is needed. Making adjustments to your skincare routine for summer can truly go a long way in saving the state of your skin, but it will only take you so far. Why? Acne is a usually the result of a hormonal imbalance. This imbalance then makes your sebaceous glands, which control oil production, to go haywire, so if they produce too much oil, here comes acne. Our AcnEase® users are able to experience how a treatment can act as a buffer between the hormones and sebaceous glands so that sebum production can return to normal. When combining the AcnEase treatment that’s right for you with the healthy skincare habits, you can rest assured in knowing that your skin is getting its best chance at remaining healthy and acne-free.

"[""Advice from NYC Esthetician: Here’s how you’re causing more acne by dehydrating your skin. 06-10-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments We’re pleased to announce the addition of NYC esthetician, Courtney Wells,to the AcnEase team as a skincare expert to help you get even closer to obtaining and keeping acne-free skin for life. Courtney has worked with numerous acne sufferers over the years, helping them to find the right balance that works for their skin naturally. As an esthetician in New York City, I encounter a melting pot of different skin types and disorders. With so much information and umpteen products on the market, it is easy for clients to feel overwhelmed, and in the confusion, use the wrong products for their skin. Particularly with acne clients, I can visibly see the confusion. Personally, I have struggled with acne sensitive skin for years (many more years than I had hoped or even thought possible). I remember staring in the mirror and wishing I could scrub all of my acne off, and just start fresh. This is the mentality that causes too many people to over-strip their skin, and create an environment that can cause rapid aging. So, let’s talk lipid barrier function and TEWL.The most important thing to remember is that your skin is an organ. After a night out, you would never think to scrub the martini (dirty with three olives please!) off your liver. Be kind to your skin! Your body, in its perfect state, has everything it needs to function optimally Sometimes it can act not so perfect from various environmental and stress-based sources. Your goal should always be to assist your body’s natural defenses and help it return to balance. Our skin has a natural lipid barrier (oil), which helps to trap water (moisture) in and keep environmental toxins out. TEWL, or trans epidermal water loss, occurs when the skin is stripped. Commonly, clients use too many actives, including retinol, vitamin c, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide and glycolic acid at once or too often. If you are overloading the skin, it will do more harm than good. Your skin will stop receiving the benefits and will be come extremely dehydrated, and at the same time, produce excess oil. It is hard to convince acne clients to use their more “stripping” products less because they have a fear their acne will get worse overnight. Thus, the most common type of skin condition accompanying acne is dehydration. When skin is dehydrated, it cannot easily repair itself and is vulnerable to stress, both environmental and internal. In this state, it is also common for the skin to produce more oil for trapping moisture and for protection. Skincare is a very personal experience. Everyone has different skin. Yet, try to use actives and deep cleaning tools less. Feed your skin with real, whole food by finding the best food to eat for acne . Use nourishing soothing masks designed to help acne . Use this time in between to nourish your stressed skin and watch slowly as it starts to feel stronger and less sensitized. Getting rid of acne takes experimentation and time to figure out. Play with your products and always veer on the side of caution. Introduce products one at a time and use for at least one month (once cycle of replaced cells). With actives, remember, less is more. Focus on hydrating with water and good food, and nourish with masks. The concept is simple. It’s really about finding which products work best for you. It's a lifelong journey because skin changes over time. Acne can be treated if you find the right balance.

"[""5 of the Best Herbal Home Remedies for Acne 06-17-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Everyone’s skin and body chemistry is different but one thing remains the same: When chronic skin problems arise there’s a sure sign that something is amiss. Unfortunately, many people choose potentially dangerous or ineffective products including some prescription drugs and topical medications for acne that have well known sideeffects, and forget about alternative choices like natural acne treatments and natural home remedies. Many chemical drugs as well chemical ingredients and additives in over-the-counter and prescription acne medications may even carry more health concerns when used long term (and acne often requires a long term treatment). But the good news is, getting rid of acne naturally is possible. Our AcnEase users know this truth: Acne will not go away simply by using home remedies. A treatment is needed due to the nature of acne, since it is an internal problem caused by the sebaceous glands overproducing sebum (skin oil). And this is also why acne doesn’t stand a chance against our botanical acne treatment (with a 96% user success rate we might add). Home remedies however can significantly help in your journey to get clear skin, so here are some of the best to get you started. Green TeaWash Not only is green tea healthy and delicious to drink, but it can also be very beneficial for your skin. Naturally fortified with EGCG and polyphenols, this tea pumps your body with antioxidants and nutrients to fight acne outbreaks. How so you ask? Topical use of green tea reduces sebum production and protects against acne-causing bacteria. And its high antioxidant concentration eliminates the free radicals that lead to inflammation. To use: Simply add 2 tablespoons of loose green tea leaves to one cup of boiling water. Allow the tea to steep for 10 minutes, then cool, and use as a daily wash. While you’re at it, drink one to two cups of green tea per day for the general anti-inflammatory benefits! Thyme Astringent Many commercially-prepared astringents contain strong—oftentimes synthetic—solvents such as isopropyl alcohol and/or acetone. These ingredients can have a very drying effect and further damage acne-prone skin. On the other hand, handcrafted, herbal astringents are gentle and restorative. Because thyme has a greater antibacterial effect than standard concentrations of benzoyl peroxide—the active ingredient in most anti-acne creams or washes—it is highly effective when used in this preparation. Additionally, thyme’s primary actions include (but are not limited to) being anti-septic, anti-viral, and antioxidant. You’ll need: 2 cups with hazel extract fresh thyme leaves and flowers To make: Pack a pint-sized jar with fresh cut thyme leaves and flowers. (Note: If using dried herbs, fill jar with no more than 1 ounce of dried thyme.) Pour organic witch hazel over the thyme until it covers the plant material entirely. Place a lid on the jar and shake well to combine. The jar should rest in a warm place, near a sunny window, and somewhere that allows you to shake it at least once daily (twice is best). To use: Strain the mixture and reserve the herb-infused witch hazel. The astringent is ready to use at this point. Label each bottle with the name, date, and contents and keep in a dark-colored glass bottle for approximately up to 1 year. Use as you would any commercially-prepared astringent product. This herbal astringent does have a long shelf life and does not require refrigeration. Honey & Arrowroot Facial Mask Facials are used to draw a fresh supply of blood to the skin and stimulate circulation to the facial area. They are excellent for cleansing the pores and healing acne. Facials also help tone and firm the skin. With these 3 powerful ingredients you’re just moments away from providing a most effective and nourishing experience for your skin. Honey Honey makes an excellent facial for all skin types. It is a natural disinfectant and it nourishes and cleanses the skin. It brings fresh blood to the surface, removes impurities, and soothes and softens the skin. Tea Tree Oil Tea tree oil has beneficial antibacterial, anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties, making it perfect for healing acne. It also reduces redness and swelling that results from inflammation. Arrowroot Tea Known for its anti-inflammatory properties, arrowroot tea not only aids in digestion but it also aids in clear skin. It soothes the stomach and replaces vital nutrients that are lost when digestive issues arise. Digestive issues can contribute to skin ailments, so this tea can be very helpful for acne sufferers. You’ll need: 1 tablespoon honey 3 drops tea tree oil 1 teaspoon arrowroot powder Blend ingredients well and apply to cleansed skin. Leave on for 5 to 10 minutes and then rinse off. Herbal Facial Steam A facial steam is a great herbal remedy for deep-pore cleansing. Here are two recipes—choose which one is best for your skin. You’ll need: Dry-to-Normal Skin 1 part lavender 2 parts chamomile 2 parts roses 2 parts calendula 3 parts comfrey Normal-To-Oily Skin 1 part witch hazel 1 part sage 3 parts comfrey 2 parts calendula ¼ part rosemary To make: Mix all herbs together, adjust the amounts to suit you, and store in dry, airtight glass bottles. To use: Bring two to three quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add a healthy handful of the herb mixture and let simmer with the lid on for just a couple of minutes. Remove the pot from the heat source. With a large towel, completely cover your head over the pot of steaming herbs (please be careful not to get too close as to burn yourself!). Enjoy this minisauna. It does wonders for the skin! For extra pampering: Immediately after you complete your facial steam, rinse your face with cold water and mist with rosewater. Then, gently pat dry. Burdock Root Tea Burdock root ( arctiumlappa ) is a herbal supplement that’s widely used for detoxification and purifying the blood. It has also been shown to reduce chronic inflammation, the number one cause of acne. Burdock, otherwise known as lappa or niu bang zi, is one of the most well-known detoxifying herbs used in Western and Chinese herbal medicine. While further scientific research is needed to confirm burdock root's efficacy in treating complexion problems, it has a lengthy reputation as a folk remedy for boils, abscesses and acne. A warm cup of burdock root tea is as nourishing as it is healing! To prepare: Take a pinch of dried burdock roots in a teapot with boiling water. Steep for 3 minutes. Strain out the infusion into a cup. Add organic sugar or honey if needed. Fancy yourself a tea person? Or do you love to pamper yourself with a DIY spa mask?

"[""This Green Vegetable's Powerful Effect on Acne Prone Skin 07-19-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Cucumber has 96% water content that is more nutritious than regular water, which helps in keeping the body hydrated and body temperature regulated. It also helps in flushing out the toxins from the body. Cucumber also contains vitamins A, B and C and minerals like magnesium, potassium, and silica - all are very beneficial for your skin. Facial masks containing cucumber juice can be used for skin tightening. Additionally, the ascorbic acid and caffeic acid present in cucumbers can bring down the water retention rate, which in turn diminishes the puffiness and swelling under the eyes and works as a mild exfoliating agent. Our cucumber mask is a great natural helper for acne prone skin as it works both as an astringent and moisturizer, especially for oily skin. The honey and oats also included in the mask will nourish and revitalize your skin, and will help with dark spots. But since cucumber works as an exfoliator, DO NOT USE THIS MASK BEFORE SUN EXPOSURE! It is best to use it in the evening before going to bed. Ingredients 1. Half of a cucumber (fresh, crisp and organic if possible) 2. Two tablespoons of steel cut natural oats (do not use instant oats) 3. The juice of half of a small-to-medium sized lemon (organic if possible) 4. One tablespoon of honey Preparation: Use a fresh, crisp cucumber. Do NOT peel it. Cut diagonally and spoon out the pits. Cut it in pieces and put in the blender. Add the oats, lemon juice and honey. Blend until smooth. Application: Apply on clean skin (with no make-up, creams or lotions) on places most prone to acne. You may use it on the face and also on the neck, shoulders, chest or back - wherever acne is most prevailing. Massage gently to exfoliate the dead skin cells that may clog the pores, and then leave on for 15 minutes. Wash off gently with room temperature water. USE BEFORE BEDTIME and NOT BEFORE SUN EXPOSURE.

"[""Can Vitamin B12 Trigger Acne? 10-06-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Vitamins play an essential and vital role in the health of every living being. Whether we find it in the food that we eat, or the supplements that we ingest, the body relies on these important compounds in order to survive. Like anything sourced outside of ourselves, too much of a good thing can yield potentially harmful results. Vitamin B12’s Role with Acne Vitamin B 12 has extensive health benefits. Most notably, it: assists in the conversion of carbohydrates into glucose which fights fatigue and increases energy production regulates the nervous system, which reduces stress and depression promotes a healthy digestive system and protects against heart disease aids in cell reproduction and the promotion of healthy skin, hair and nails protects against cancers These days, many people commonly rely on B12 injections to fight fatigue and weight loss. Recent findings from a UCLA study suggest there may be a link between vitamin B12 and acne symptoms. Studies have shown that individuals with pre-existing acne experienced that their condition worsened after being injected with large doses of vitamin B12, and even a few individuals that did not have acne prior to the injection experienced an acne breakout as a side effect of the administration. Research suggests that the bacteria residing in the pores of the skin produces increased levels of inflammatory molecules that can exacerbate acne when Vitamin B12 is present. The bacteria, known as Propionibacterium. acnes , present in the pores of people with acne, responds differently to vitamin B12 than those without acne. It is important to remember that, despite these findings, vitamin B12 is not inherently bad, even for those who experience acne. The research simply suggests that “too much” vitamin B12 may not be a good thing for some individuals with acne. The researchers involved assure that vitamin B12 is an important vitamin for maintaining an overall healthy metabolism, red blood cell formation and the maintenance of the central nervous system. B vitamins are rich in riboflavin, specifically B2, which the body requires in order to develop and maintain healthy skin, and can be found naturally in foods such as dairy products, eggs, nuts, meats, broccoli, wheat germ, wild rice, mushrooms, spinach and other green leafy vegetables. In addition, observations noted during the study address an important point - just because the recommended daily amounts of a vitamin or supplement are good for you, it does not mean that larger amounts are better for you . As consumers, we are often taught that more of a good thing will yield a higher result in a shorter amount of time, but in the case of vitamin B12, the opposite is true. Too much of any supplement or vitamin can be harmful, and negative symptoms can occur with an overdose of any vitamin. Individuals should take their diet into consideration and any other supplements or prescription drugs they are taking before they continue to add to their daily routine. The key to being the HEALTHIEST POSSIBLE YOU is determining the right balance between diet and the use of multiple vitamins and other supplements. This is especially important when considering that acne is due to an imbalance within your body, which leads to an over-secretion of sebum by the sebaceous glands. Similar to the study in which the p.acnes bacteria found in individuals with acne responded differently to B12 than those without acne, this genetic diversity will come to play with many other factors. While the formation of an acne pimple is quite simple to understand, what triggers the pimple to form is another story. There are numerous factors that can be attributed to the physical symptoms of acne, including diet, stress levels, or even the climate in which one lives. The genetic makeup of the individual person is also a significant contributing factor. AcnEase® is a safe, vitamin-free alternative to treating problem skin. Our all-natural, herbal acne treatment works from within, stopping acne before it starts by counteracting the effects of hormonal imbalance and the overproduction of sebum. Designed to work together to address and treat the cause of acne, all herbs used to make AcnEase® are of the highest quality, and have been extensively tested and proven safe in clinical trials. The message is clear: education and the moderation is the key. By educating yourself about the types of supplements you are taking, their ingredients, and the correct amount needed for your body, you are able to determine and monitor how they relate to your diet and how they affect you. If you are unsure about adding a supplement to your daily routine, please speak with your healthcare provider first and address any concerns. Also, take notice of any changes or responses in your body when adding additional supplements to your usual routine and report these to your healthcare provider. We want to hear from you!

Stopping the treatment suddenly may work for some but for some it may also increase the risk for flare-ups to return. So we developed a strategy to minimize this risk. We suggest that instead of stopping AcnEase cold-turkey, you wean yourself off the treatment slowly by going down by one level of treatment over a 1-2 month period.For example, if you are on the severe acne regimen, you go down to moderate acne regimen. Stay on this level for 1-2 months, and if your skin remains clear, go down again to the mild acne regimen for 1-2 months.If you don\'t see any flare-ups within 1-2 months, then go down to the maintenance treatment. You can stay on the maintenance for a long time as AcnEase is safe for long-term use. Or, if you don\'t see any flare-ups in 1-2 months on the lowest maintenance dose (2x3 or 2x2 tablets daily), then congratulations! You may opt to stoptaking the product all together. Numerous individuals with chronic acne opt to useAcnEase regularly on a lower regimen for a long time to make sure they maintain clear skin.

Olszewski 0 Comments Your Drug-Free Acne Skincare Routine & Treatment Along with the excitement of being pregnant means many changes in your body. One of them is a dramatic increase in hormone production, especially sex hormones such as androgens (testosterone), estrogen and progesterone. These are among the most potent stimulators of sebaceous glands. The overproduction of sebum (skin oil) by sebaceous glands is the first step in acne forming. The accumulated sebum together with bacteria, dead skin cells and dirt will lead to inflammation and infection manifesting itself as pimples, cysts, and in milder cases whiteheads and blackheads. The fact is that more than 1 in 2 women will develop acne during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. The problem is how to manage acne during the pregnancy while ensuring the safety of baby and mother, and to help the woman to feel the best she can during this very important period of her life.

"['Is Birth Control Pill the Right Choice for Treating Acne? 04-17-2016 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments For women, the decision to take oral contraceptives is a personal one, with many reasons factoring into their decision. Many women use hormonal birth control (aka “the pill”) for the skin-saving benefits and for those with acne-prone skin, waking up to a face free of breakouts is reason enough to choose the pill as a way to manage their acne. Acne is the result of a hormonal imbalance , which is why many people notice increased symptoms at certain times, such as puberty, or for women, right around their monthly period. The function of certain hormones can directly affect the sebaceous glands, which produce sebum, an oily substance that travels through the pores to help skin function in a healthy manner. When these hormones are out of balance, they can cause the sebaceous glands to produce too much sebum, which may clog pores. Combined with dead skin cells, dirt and debris, these oil-clogged pores create bacteria, which leads to a minor infection, or as we know them, pimples. In order to keep acne from forming, the relationship between hormones and the sebaceous glands must be a harmonious one. Many people use birth control to treat acne for this exact reason. Oral Contraceptives Birth control increases globulin, a protein found in the blood that bonds sex hormones, such as testosterone, an androgen. Because testosterone directly affects the sebaceous glands, which produces sebum, an oily substance that can clog pores in excessive amounts, we want to keep testosterone levels as balanced as possible in order to keep the sebaceous glands from going haywire. Taking birth control that contains estrogen or progesterone will lower the amount of androgens produced by the body, which results in less impact being made on the sebaceous glands, and ultimately, acne. Even with this said, there are some current hazards of treating acne with birth control that everyone should know about. Using OC as a remedy for acne problem is quite popular and it pays to look into this with the proverbial grain of salt. Did you know that using birth control for acne is an off-label use? Meaning, it’s not a clinically confirmed and FDA approved use for these drugs. There are class action suits against some that have well documented side effects. Diane-35 which is NOT approved in the USA and is banned in many other countries, is a good example of this situation. ( www.examiner.com/article/diane-35-acne-drug-banned-after-15-women-die-using-it-as-birth-control ) As ‘the pill” improves acne for a number of women – for many it may also cause serious and possibly delayed site effects. When using oral contraceptive for their intended purpose of birth control, please be aware of the health concerns associated with the drug. If you’re using it for acne, that’s an entirely different story and you should consider if the effects are actually worth the risk. Oral contraceptives ONLY work for acne as you use the product and there are much healthier and equally effective alternatives for clear skin. Read and make an informed decision. Getting back to how oral contraceptives (OC\'s) work, they stabilize hormone levels, and reduce the impact of fluctuations of hormone levels on the sebaceous glands, thereby improving acne. When many women begin taking OC’s they witness an acne flare up due to the influx of hormones being delivered to the body, and the same happens when these hormones are taken away. When you stop taking OC\'s, hormone levels become disrupted, which can then contribute to an acne breakout. Without the high estrogen levels to manage the androgen produced by the body, the sebaceous glands can cause oil-production levels to go into overdrive, which can lead to breakouts. Because birth control impacts the body hormonally, changes in the amount or frequency of that medication can end up affecting the body, and often times the recurrence of acne symptoms is one of the first complaints women have when going off this type of contraceptive. Treating Acne It is important to remember that as with any form of birth control, it’s not intended to treat acne. The lessening of acne symptoms for some is merely “a side-effect” of the contraceptive medicine, so it is always very important to become aware of any and all risks associated with medication before beginning treatment. AcnEase®, however, was created with the treatment of the acne condition first and foremost, and works from within to do just that! In addition to minimizing the negative impact of fluctuating hormone levels on sebum production, the ingredients in AcnEase® have natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. This combination of effects is responsible for the ability of AcnEase® to prevent new pimples from forming, while treating existing acne. The best way to prevent acne from forming is to manage the relationship between the hormones and sebaceous glands without actually affecting the hormones, which is exactly what AcnEase® does! All-natural and 100% safe for use by people of all ages, AcnEase® is the only treatment solution that prevents new acne from forming, while treating existing breakouts simultaneously, and has ZERO side-effects, unlike antibiotics or hormonal birth control. If you are currently taking oral contraceptives are considering going off, you can minimize the impact by adding AcnEase® to your skincare regimen several weeks prior to stopping. As your body starts to adjust to the absence of the hormones, AcnEase® will help to reduce any ""acne fall out"" from cessation of the birth control by working as a buffer between these hormones and the sebaceous glands, and will not negatively impact the protection afforded by the birth control during this period. In addition to minimizing the negative impact of fluctuating hormone levels on sebum production, the ingredients in AcnEase® have natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. This combination of effects is responsible for the ability of AcnEase® to prevent new pimples from forming, while treating existing acne. Of course, AcnEase® is not intended to be an alternative to contraceptive birth control, but if you are taking oral contraception or an IUD simply to alleviate your acne symptoms, you can make it easier on your body, and achieve long-term results with AcnEase®.

"[""Six ways to keep your acne form getting worse in a summer 08-07-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Do you think summer is good for your skin? Unfortunately for those with acne the answer is: rather not! To keep your acne from worsening over the summer here are some important tips to remember. Clean you face and body wherever you sweat . We sweat to cool off, but irritants like dirt, dust and oil stick to the sweat and can cause clogged pores.” Because the bacteria that causes acne loves a super oily environment, like sweaty skin, the oil on skin coupled with bacteria create the perfect recipe for a pimple Use warm (not hot) showers and non comedogenic cleanser. Do NOT rub your skin but rather pat dry Exfoliate your skin more often so dead skin cells mixed with sweat, sun protection creams etc do not clog your pores. Use natural exfoliation like Japanese rice powder. For adult acne skin and oily skin summer calls for exfoliation even twice a week. Summer Exfoliation 2 Tbs of rice flower (in supermarket) 1 Tbs of honey (honey has strong anti-inflammatory properties) 2 Tbs of Aloe Vera gel (pure organic preferable) Mix well and massage in circular motions into clean skin. (do not use harsh rubbing, if not sure- use your ring fingers to better control the pressure during the massage) Rinse well. Your skin will love it and glow to thank you! Your skin is what you eat so avoid surgery drinks and food . Instead eat fresh fruits and veggies and drink plenty of water. Adding a slice of lemon and slice of cucumber as well as a spring of mint and ice will turn a humble water into a summer special drink Use non comedienne sunscreen . Using the sunscreen is mandatory. Exposure to SUV rays DOES NOT help acne and may carry danger of melanoma (skin cancer). The choice of Sunscreen is very important. Choose one without oils and parabens but with zinc and light moisturizers. Moisturize and beautify without clogging your pores . Outdoor activities, sun and wind as great for recreation will dry and even age your skin if you do not protect it with the right moisturizer. For both teens and adults , including men keeping your face and body skin supple and moisturized is essential. Use oil free products… and a tip below; Apply creams and lotions on a dump skin and let them soak in…. Treat and PREVENT acne with AcnEase like product that will heal exiting pimples and prevent the formation of both comedones (white heads and black heads) as well as pimples in a totally natural and safe way..

"[""How to Prevent Acne Breakouts 09-01-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The Old Adage “A n Ounce of Prevention is Better than a Pound of Cure” certainly applies to acne treatment Although the clinical manifestation of acne is quite simple, pimples appear on ones face, acne is actually a rather complex disease. What is causing the formation of pimples is what is actually more complicated. If we can understand what is causing acne in the first place we can develop a way to prevent acne pimples from forming and alleviate the need to treat existing acne. Let’s look at what may be causing your acne. Some women may have an over secretion of the adrenal glands that leads to elevated levels of testosterone (an androgen) in their blood which is the cause of their acne. For some individuals during adolescents may be a large growth spurt with very high levels of fluctuating hormones, for others it is linked to their menstrual cycle. For men it may be a result of high testosterone levels but also increased levels of estrogen and other hormones as well can be the culprit causing their acne . Genetic variation is also a large contributing factor, if one’s parents had acne it is likely their children may also have acne. Finally even things such as lifestyle, diet or skincare habits which may not be responsible for causing your acne but may exacerbate existing acne. The good news is that for all of the above scenarios the common denominator is over production of sebum (skin oil) by the sebaceous glands which can lead to clogged pores. Once your pores are clogged, dead skin cells accumulate and provide an ideal environment for the growth of bacteria leading to red an inflamed pimples. Acne can be divided into several stages of development and the entire progression is can be considered as the acne cascade: First step is over secretion of sebum (skin oil) by the sebaceous glands Pores in the skin become clogged with excess sebum and dead skin cells (seen as white heads and black heads) Bacteria ( P.acnes ) can begin to grow in these clogged pores The body sends in white blood cells (inflammatory cells) to kill the bacteria Formation of pustules and papules with redness surrounding the pimples appear on the skin surface Inflammation spreads outside the pore to surrounding tissue to form cysts the most severe form of acne As you can see the very first step in the cascade is the over production of skin oil by the sebaceous glands. If the goal is prevent acne pimples from forming then any treatment option requires intervention at this step. Accutane for example works by reducing sebum production but is associated with many serious side effects therefore it is often reserved for those with the most severe forms of acne. AcnEase is an all natural herbal product that also targets the over production of sebum in the skin. The ingredients in AcnEase work to reduce the impact of fluctuating hormones and other drivers of acne formation from stimulating the sebaceous glands. By reducing sebum production AcnEase works to prevent new pimples from forming. AcnEase also contain some mild anti-inflammatory herbals extracts and antiseptic herbal extracts that help with exiting pimples but the fight with exiting acne can also be supported by use the over counter topical products. These topical products can accelerate the disappearance of existing acne. It seems to make common sense, however, that instead of waiting for a pimple to form to treat the problem it would be better to simply prevent the pimples from forming in the first place. Hence it seems abundantly clear that when it comes to acne treatment “An ounce of prevention is clearly better than a pound of cure” So lets make a new proverb: “ AcnEase a Day keeps the Acne Away ” AcnEase provides a simple, safe and proven way to prevent acne from forming and attaining the goal of acne free skin.

"[""Acne & scars: How to choose and how to use concealer? 10-20-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Don’t have clear acne skin? No one has to know! Searching for the best concealer for your acne-prone skin can be a headache. Being in possession with several concealers and each one of them either did a bad job or even worse, caused you to break out, even more, can be devastating. As of now, long hours at the makeup aisle has come to an end because we did the research for you. Continue to read as you will be introduced to the correct and effective way to choose and use a concealer. What are concealers? Looking for answers to cover your pimples, under-eye circles, blemishes and more? Concealers are a quick way to cover up those imperfections on the face. These makeup products provide heavy pigmentation applied by brush, sponge, or spray together with a foundation if preferred. There are a wide variety of concealers varying from acne-fighting creams to moisturizers as well as different shades and colors. 2. Types of concealers There are three basic types of concealers; solid, liquid and powder which has a purpose for different usages. Solid. The solid form looks similar to a lipstick or pencil stick. To hide away spots, pimples, and blemishes, this is the best tool. However, because of its texture, it may be quite difficult to blend in. Using this form of concealer makes covering small areas a breeze. Liquid. If wanting to cover a larger area on the face, the liquid form does the job. Take note, areas which move a lot such as the eyes, a light finish is established using this concealer form. Too much heavy concealer tends to bring out wrinkles over time. Powder. Powder concealers are used to cover light blemishes and scars. They are the easiest to blend in but they offer the lightest coverage. 3. The Perfect Concealer & Shade A concealer is more than just a color but to hide the imperfections better. Just remember a few things when you are buying a concealer for acne-prone skin: It’s recommended to look out for products that are labeled “noncomedogenic,” in order to keep pores clear and reduce acne breakouts. Always choose a concealer shade that is one or two shades lighter than your foundation shade. Green concealer should be used first over a pimple, followed by the yellow skin tone for red blemishes. Pink toned concealer is always used on blue to purple under eye areas. Orange toned concealers are perfect for dark skin tones. Purple toned concealers will neutralize with yellow, which is best for sallow skin, allowing a greater brightness. On dry skin, use a liquid form concealer. While on oily skin, a dense, drier cream or cream to powder form is ideal. When using a concealer brush, ensure that the bristles are hard and fine applying the desired amount only to the red part, then gently blending in. Make sure these are clean before using. For a soft look, use face powder for the last step. 4. Prepare your canvas Step 1 : Evenly apply foundation on the face. This is an optional step. Step 2 : Once gotten the correct concealer shade, use your fingertip to tap the concealer directly on top of a pimple. This dabbing action is better than the rubbing or brushing since it covers up exactly where you need it and helps it adhere better to your skin. Step 3 : After you’ve applied your concealer, be sure to blend it in evenly. When covering pimples, scars or blemishes, use a Q-tip to blend the concealer in a circular motion, this will avoid the transfer from oil from your finger to your face which can worsen acne prone skin.

"[""Is acne treatment different for different color complexion? 10-26-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Regardless of your race, background, gender, or religion - all humans are equal. This is what makes us unique, and because of this, our body parts, hair, and skin differ alike. Acne is a struggle that most of us have experienced at one point in our lives but for some, it's still a battling problem. Does it discriminate? To some extent, yes. Read on as you will get a closer understanding that there is a very slight difference between all color and skin types! Acne is not created equal. There are many factors which cause acne such as puberty, genetics, diet, age, intense exercise or the weather. All of these can lead to or exacerbate your breakouts! Once you have figured out the cause of your breakouts, it gets easier to treat them. Treatments for acne are the same regardless of your race but vary depending on your skin tone. Oily or Dry skin? Not only does oily skin produce acne, dry skin too! It is important for individuals to identify and understand the skin type that they have in order to help with an ideal skin care regimen and selecting the best products. Oily - This skin type is more coarse-textured, and often noticed with enlarged pores. Due to the overproduction of sebaceous (oil-producing) glands, blackheads and breakouts are of reason. Shiny skin will be seen mostly from the forehead, down the middle of your nose to the chin. Don't use alcohol to remove the oiliness of the skin, as it will only worsen the situation. To take care of your skin, use a cleanser for oily skin right before bed. Exfoliate twice weekly with a gentle scrub and use light moisturizers Oil is more visual against a darker complexion and it is more active in this skin tone. Genetically, darker skin tends to be thicker which gives oil glands a difficult task to moisturize leaving skin dry. If pores are clogged with dead skin and sebum, this makes the task of removing breakouts even more difficult. Clay masks are perfect for absorbing excess production of oil. Dry - This skin type is usually thin and delicate, often flaky and prone to fine lines. Once this skin gets too dry, it can look and feel scaly. Using a moisturising regimen is recommended, but do not overdo it. All skin types experience ashy or dullness from dead skin build up, however with darker complexions, it is more noticeable leaving a greyish look. It is advised to exfoliate weekly with moisturisers. Are you in preparation for Halloween and have left over pumpkins? Make some time to treat you skin to an all natural pumpkin exfoliating and moisturizing mask with ingredients for skin benefiting. If you live in a dry environment, use a humidifier in your office and bedroom to keep skin from drying out. 2. Acne products that might cause discoloration on darker skins Retinoids, Peroxide and Tropical product use. It is advised to not use retinol and benzoyl peroxide at once. This dangerous combination can lead to skin dryness, redness, blistering, scarring, extreme peeling, and discoloration. Skin discolouration may take months or even years to fade away! It is recommended to use a pea-size amount in the morning and one at night. Not together! Products with Alphahydroxy Acids (AHAs). These acids that are found in foods can remove the top layers of dead skin cells. Firmness is also a resulting advantage as they can also increase the thickness of deeper layers of skin. If used in large amounts, skin irritation, swelling, itching and skin discolouration can occur. 3. Bad Skin Mistakes! Could your daily beauty routine be worsening your skin problem? We have made a list of the most common mistakes for people every day trying to fight the acne battle. Exercise. Before starting your workout, be sure to remove makeup on the skin as this can clog up pores. Hair products. Ensure to use hair gel or spray away from the hairline as this can create blemishes. Keeping hair away from the face can also decrease acne formation from the excess oil found in these hair products. Spa Treatment. Microdermabrasion cloths, pads, puffs, or scrubs does not do well on brown skin as it increases the risk of spot formation after acne has been healed. Ensure that products contains no fibers such as coconut or oat or granules such as polyethylene beads. Sunscreen. Brown skin has a lower chance of getting sunburn, however, exposure to UVA rays, is a reason behind discolouration. The darker your skin, the greater potential for long-term discoloration. An SPF of 15 is usually adequate and you’re skin will thank you later! Not patting dry. Irritation can be caused by tugging of a towel and not patting face dry. In addition, skin can lose its elasticity throughout the years. When you rub around your eyes, dark spots are more likely to form. The treatment of acne exists for any skin colour! Whether you are European, Asian, African, or American, you are at risk of getting acne. At the end of the day, you have to take care of your skin by using the correct treatments and products for your unique skin type. This safe and natural solution is a click away! AcnEase® , an all botanical and clinically tested acne treatment that is safe for everyone regardless of race, background, gender, age or whatever stage in your hormonal cycle.

"[""3-Point Checklist: Thanksgiving-Free Acne 11-20-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments With Thanksgiving being just a few days away, our schedules become hectic with traveling to our nearby families, grocery shopping and decorating. Let’s not get distracted by this holiday’s baked turkey, bread stuffing, potatoes, cranberries and the delicious pumpkin pie. Not only will the food be present but those flashing cameras with Facebook posts as well! Want to be photo-ready? You are at the right place! Thanksgiving is not only a time to fill our stomachs but rather to be grateful and appreciate the things that we currently have. AcnEase would like to thank our loyal clients for believing and choosing our products for their acne-prone skin and to also thank new users for trying and adding these products to their medicine cabinets. To ensure a time well spent during this Thanksgiving, here are 3 steps you should follow to ensure healthy, clear glowing skin throughout the holidays. 1. - Before the feast: Travel . Whether you are catching a plane, train, subway or any form of transportation, be sure to plan ahead and pack your skincare products in travel size containers since traveling can bring about stress which is not good for acne. Give yourself enough time to adhere to your usual routine and as always, include AcnEase® . Grocery shopping. Avoid indulging fat-rich products like cream, butter and cheeses since these may affect hormonal balance within our bodies and may impact our sebaceous glands by encouraging them to create excess sebum. This excess sebum clogs pores and allows the bacteria that causes acne to flourish. We recommend a moderate intake of only organic dairy products. Fall harvest foods such as pumpkin , squash, sweet potatoes, brussels sprouts and green beans are great for your skin! For the best clear skin, it is advised to steam, boil or sauté vegetables for the best intake of the advantages such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, factors promoting collagen production, and regulating sebum production. Can I help? If you’re the host and others want to help try delegating tasks and side dishes! Preparations for the dinner can be quite stressful and when guests are willing to contribute their efforts welcome them. Make-up. W e all know cameras will be present to capture these long lasting memories and we want our skin to be at the “photo op” best. Using the wrong makeup or following bad skincare habits could actually accentuate the pimples you are trying so hard to hide. Use products that are paraben-free, sulfate free, oil-free or non-comedogenic. Concealers are best for covering last minute pimples, under-eye circles and those often present acne scars. Ensure you use the best type with the perfect shade for your skin. 2. - During the feast: Be your own bartender! Choose wine or straight alcohol over mixed drinks high in sugar. Red wine is preferred over white unless you have rosacea, in which case avoid red wine. Straight liquor can either be consumed as a shot or over ice. A refreshing blend of alcohol and water with a squeeze of lime or lemon is another suggested way to drink and minimize the impacts of your acne. Citrus contains vitamin C, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, which contributes to clear healthy skin. Avoid sugary cocktails which lead to inflammation and exacerbates acne symptoms. Hands down! As you get your hands dirty from eating, avoiding touching your face as face-touching can lead to breakouts. Bacteria, grease and oils can transfer from fingertips onto the skin. Wash your hands after eating with a mild soap in lukewarm water for about 20 seconds. Restaurant dinner. For those of you who are eating out, and not preparing at home, avoid choosing foods with cow’s milk, high sugar content, high glycemic foods, junk and fast food. Increased inflammation can results from drinking too much cow’s milk as this may spike blood sugar levels. It also increases insulin levels, which encourage the production of skin oils (sebum). Consuming too much sugar can spike your blood levels leading to a later acne breakout. Glycemic foods such as white rice and white bread can trigger hormonal fluctuations and inflammation—both of which encourage acne. We recommend trying these holiday meals next time. After the feast: Catch up on sleep! After the feast, try and take a 30 minute nap to look and feel better. If this is not possible take a 7-8 hours of interrupted sleepp at night. Your skin heals and rejuvenates during these restful hours. Enzymes. With all the food that you’re going to eat, your stomach will get overwhelmed. It’s going to have a hard time digesting, which will lead to fermentation. Unfortunately, acne feeds off of bacteria that reside too long in your stomach. It may be advisable to get a digestive enzyme pill and take twice as much after your meal especially if you are prone to heart burn. Detox. Drinking large volumes of green tea is great for treating your skin because of its anti-inflammatory agents. It'll counteract the effects of sugary foods you ate by calming the inflammation they can cause. Facials. Have any leftovers? Let this not go to waste! Turn your extras into relaxing and hydrating facials with our Thanksgivings special harvest of cranberry, yeast, sweet potato and pumpkin. While it’s very tempting looking across a table filled with mouth-watering foods, with the justification that it’s “only once a year”, followed by many other holidays, it’s important to be mindful of what you eat as this will appear on your skin afterwards. By following the above 3 steps, this will ensure that you eat and celebrate with a peaceful mind and spirit. AcnEase wants to thank you for your continued commitment to your skin. As usual, we want to hear from you! What are you thankful for this year? Have you tried our new Rejuvel 3D? Please share it with us in the comments below. Bonus: Pumpkin Facial masks Pumpkin is packed with fruit enzymes and alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), which increase cell turnover, to brighten and smooth the skin. Pumpkin contains antioxidant Vitamin A and Vitamin C to help soften and soothe the skin and boost collagen production to prevent the signs of aging.since it contains potasioum and zinc- it controls redness.

"[""Trick or Treat Your Skin this Halloween! 10-28-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The Scary connection: How is your sweet tooth affecting your skin. Halloween is a popular time of year for scary movies, humorous costume parties, and not to forget, a wide variety of sweets and candies tempting us from every corner! This event can be a treat for some but a trick for others. Those who want to find a magical potion for this Halloween’s trick for their skin, should continue to read this article. But be aware- we will most likely scare you with our conclusions….and scary facts about sugar and acne. But… wait there is a light at the end of this scary article- as we will tell you how you can become acne free. Sugar Face? We all know that sugar is terrible for our skin, and if this doesn’t ring a bell, check out our informative post on how sugar is the enemy of your skin . To summarize, sugar is the reason to spike your blood sugar levels, increasing the production of insulin and IGF-1. This burst of IGF-1 and insulin releases an androgen hormones which after pushing the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum that needed or good for your skin actually initiate acne cascade ( process of pimple formation). An excessive production of sebum known as skin oil is the cause for clogged pores, blackheads, whiteheads, and cysts. So, to effectively treat acne, you must address the root of the problem, that is an overproduction of sebum and factors that may over stimulate your sebaceous glands such as hormonal imbalance. AcnEase is the magical potion you are looking for to actually neutralize those scary factors. This is a unique, safe and natural treatment designed to address your sebaceous glands and decrease future breakouts. Taste the Rainbow The famous Halloween candy Skittles might be right after all with its slogan “taste the rainbow”. We are not talking about this sugar packed little candies but rather about eating colorful foods. One of the keys to healthy, clear glowing skin is to understand what is consumed within the body. Eating vegetables and fruits with a rainbow of colors will give the body a variety of antioxidants and phytonutrients. These will help to protect your skin from free radicals and sun damage also, important for normal skin cell development and a healthy skin tone. Glow from the inside out with leafy greens such as broccoli, spinach, cucumber, and kale. Get nutty with almonds, peanuts, pecans, and pistachios. While picking berries of blue, black adding to your favourite oatmeal or yogurt. For a total skin rejuvenation, all of these foods will do wonders for your skin. Tricks to counteract sugar’s effect on the skin: As much as we may try to avoid sugar ( especially refine cane sugar and corn syrup) we are only human ( even we were super hero costume ) and occasionally we do succumb to the sugar craving. So how to avoid a real sugar skin damage? Check the labels! When purchasing or consuming candy for the holidays, take a look at the ingredients as these treats are very high in sugar content. Look out for treats that contain high fructose corn syrup, artificial food coloring and dye, preservatives, artificial flavorings and GMOS(genetically modified organisms). Sugar-Free doesn’t mean Acne-Free! Most Halloween candies will print in bold, ‘sugar-free’, but that doesn’t mean its better for you. The sugar found in these treats has to be replaced with artificial sweeteners, which is not good for clear glowing skin. Bad vs Good Sugars ! Yes, there is a big difference! Stay away from the bad sugars such as pizza or jelly and focus on the good sugars such as raisins. Eat good candy! It is expected that you will be eating all kinds of candy but remember your diet completely affects your skin’s health. Try to avoid milk chocolate and sugar candies such as lollipops or hard candies. Instead, grab some dark chocolate that is dairy-free which has less sugar. Have dinner! It is advised to eat before going to the holiday party as this will decrease your sugar craving. Halloween makeup ! In order for your Halloween costume to be complete, we understand a masked face is a must! However, your acne prone skin must survive. It is advised to use non-comedogenic makeup, avoid-oil based face paint and glitter as well as cleaning skin right before bed. After the trick-or-treating or left over pumpkins, make some time to treat your skin to an exfoliating and moisturising mask featuring pumpkin , which is stacked with skin benefiting ingredients. Hydrate! Keeping hydrated after the sugar fest is a must, especially because it will successfully prevent dry skin, breakouts, and even allergic reactions. Substitute! Instead of filling your stomach with delicious sweet treats and snacks, try some healthy food alternatives such as pumpkin seeds and sliced apples with honey! Not only are they good for you, but for your complexion too! Bonus: I can’t resist! Just because you have sensitive or acne-prone skin doesn’t mean you have to sit on the sidelines on a night like Halloween and miss out on all the fun. Candy Apple! This classic Halloween treat contains benefits to the skin too! Apples allow the skin to be lightened as it contains a high content of collagen and elastic which is important for keeping skin flawless and youthful. Skin hydration is another plus as this fruit help balances the oil production. Apples also provide relief to acne and sunburns, because of its cooling properties. During this festive event, people with the clearest skin can slip up, which is why it’s important to have the best acne fighting regime. The most effective way to keep your skin looking and feeling its best is to prevent acne before it starts, which means breaking the acne cycle, and this is exactly what AcnEase® does. “ AcnEase a Day keeps the Acne Away ” We want to hear from you!

"['Stress and Acne 09-12-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments I am STRESSED! Can Stress Make My Acne WORTH? What can I Do?? Stress comes in different “packages” for different people and what is stressful to you will not necessarily bother someone else. However, our bodies respond to stress in the same way. Adrenaline is the number one stress hormone; it speeds up the heart beat, breathing and metabolic rate to give us a necessary rush of extra energy. to deal with circumstances that cuse stress. Adrenaline is produced and stored in our two adrenal glands that are situated on top of the kidneys and with long-term stress these glands will deplete. Unfortunately modern stress is relentless and experienced day after day never giving us time to relax and balance ourselves it also have quite profound effect on the skin and may exasperate your acne . Stress affects our skin in a variety of ways. Adrenaline redirects blood away from the skin and sends it to the muscles instead. This is why in times of relentless stress the skin becomes pale and ""washed out"". Anger, irritability, excitement and frustration unleash chemicals, which stimulate the sebaceous glands into pouring out more oil. The excess sebum can block the pores and encourage the pimples to form. This is why we tend to break out in spots on the eve of an important occasion. Chronic stress makes muscles tense up and become stiff. This prevents the flow of blood bringing enough oxygen and vital nutrients to the skin. Tension also is responsible for slowing the swift removal of wastes from the underlying tissue. Stressed skin lacks vitality and looks congested. Strain slows down the rate of cell turnover so the fresh epidermal cells take longer to reach the skin surface and much of their moisture has disappeared. Under constant pressure the skin looks dull and sallow. Continuous stress increases cortisone secretion, which suppresses the body\'s natural immunity. The skin\'s defense breaks down and allows the skin to be irritated by outside chemicals and pollutants. Stress and Acne When we are stressed our blood sugar and insulin levels rise to mobilize the body organs to deal with the stress. This “mobilization” is a protection mechanism and while in many situations it helps us to be more efficient in dealing with stress, it also has some seriously negative impacts on our bodies –in short – stress causes a serious increase in inflammatory chemicals at a cellular level which can exacerbate acne. Since acne is one form of inflammatory disease – stress will worsen acne, sometimes quite dramatically. We all experience this situation in our lives when exams, job interviews or even health changes of our loved ones may cause an increase in breakouts and a more difficult path to eliminate them . We also need to know that during the “mobilization” of our bodies to deal with stress several special hormones are produced to help mediate this process. Some of the most important are Cortisol and other hormones released by the adrenal glands that can act as androgens (male hormones) and over- stimulate the sebaceous glands. A previously mentioned androgens and fluctuating hormone levels will produce more skin oil which in turn clogs the pores and… an acne flare-up is on the way. So if you already have acne or just acne prone skin it is vital that you find ways to eliminate or at least to reduce physical and psychological stress that is indeed directly correlated with breakouts. 4 Simple Tips to Reduce Stress: Make sure that you get enough sleep. Limit intake of coffee and tea. Replace them with water and herbal teas (no caffeine). Set aside fifteen or twenty minutes a day for de-stressing activities: meditation, yoga, simple walks or reading your favorite book may do the trick Use the ant-inflammatory diet Infusion for Stress 10g dried lime flowers 10g dried chamomile 10g dried vervain Add the dried herbs to 1 pint (600ml) of boiling water in a warmed pot with a lid. Leave to infuse for 10-15 minutes and then strain. Drink warm throughout the day.

"['Why Male Hormonal Acne Are More Difficult to Treat and How to Get Rid of Male Acne 09-19-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Acne is not just women and teens problem. Over 25% of acne sufferers are men and this includes not just adolescents but actually grow up and otherwise very macho guys. In fact, during last decade the median age of people with acne (including men) has risen by almost 23%, from 20.5 years to about 26.5 years old.. In addition guys have obviously less chance to camouflage acne with makeup while at the same time their acne is usually more difficult to treat, and a general trend is for men to be more concerned with their appearance, and more focused ( and spending) on their looks including wellness, grooming and clothes. What is Male Hormonal Acne? Acne is a manifestation of internal imbalance that leads to overproduction of sebum (skin oil) by sebaceous glands. This extra sebum together with dead skin cells and dirt creates an ideal condition for bacteria to grow and this, in turn, will cause an inflammation that presents itself as ACNE (pimples, cysts , blackheads, whiteheads etc). The most potent stimulator of sebaceous glands are the male hormones known as androgens or testosterone. While both women and men actually produce all three types of sexual hormones (testosterone, estrogen and progesterone) naturally men secrete much more restore and therefore their cases of hormonal acne may be more severe and prevailing (chronic). In addition- testosterone level increase due exercise and as it helps to build muscle mass and lose fat, it also, as in our society still more men (and boys) are engaged in strenuous or even excessive physical activities, their acne bounds are even more difficult to treat. Understanding that androgen related hormones can influence sebaceous gland secretions is only part of the story. Only 1-2% of these hormones circulate freely in the blood; the other 98% are bound to a protein called Sex Hormone Binding Globulin ( SHBG ). If the androgen hormones are bound to SHBG in the blood they will not cause acne, it is only the ""free form"" of DHT and DHEAS that can cause the sebaceous glands to make more sebum. Since men naturally have more testosterone related hormones in their bodies, it is more likely that more of the analogs (DHT & DHEAS) may be found in the free form leading to an increased risk of acne. How to get rid of male hormonal acne? Obviously guys being guys-have more testosterone. There are two major approaches to acne treatment To control the symptoms (in this case the focus is on killing some bacteria and shortening or limiting infection without really breaking the cycle of acne and returning sebaceous glands to the “normal” activity) To PREVENT new acne from coming by modulating the factors that actually over-stimulate sebaceous glands, and by doing this, stopping the acne cycle Most of the products that are promoted to control acne symptoms such as non-prescription gels, creams, lotions, pads etc help just to exfoliate and cleanse the skin and include two familiar ingredients: benzoyl peroxide , salicylic acid, or glycolic acid, As those products may help- they usually do NOT break the acne cycle and may also irritate, dry and prematurely age the skin. The more “serious” treatment options include: Antibiotics taken orally or rubbed into the skin that may help controlling bacteria. Vitamin A derivatives , known as retinoids, or ( internally) isotretinoin. Here the world of caution is required . Antibiotics may cause a number of side effects such as stomach problems, allergic reaction, UV rays sensitivity and as a result higher probability of skin cancer: and finally their overuse leads to developing antibiotics resistant strains of bacteria that represent a serious danger to our health. Isotretinoin (brand name Accutane) is presently a subject of class action suit for its serious adverse effects have been taken off the market while its generic forms are still in use with serious health warning including possible liver toxicity, inflammatory bowel disease, hair loss and even potential depression and suicidal tendencies in younger males. Even some supplements designed to “help” acne can actually cause other problems. Too much zinc can cause anemia and this can lead to a more severe infection and too much vitamin A – a vision problems. However the safe and natural solution is available. AcnEase® AcnEase® , an all botanical and clinically tested acne treatment is such solution What is important AcnEase is not only no–mess, no-fuss treatment that can easily be used by guys on a go (just take it with your meals or snacks and be on your way) but most importantly it does not contain any phytoestrogens, (women-like hormones) does not directly affect your testosterone levels, and does not contain gluten, sugar or milk derivatives. It is however tested for safety and it is up to 80% effective in improving male hormonal acne.

"[""Why do NOT pop your Acne Cysts and what to do instead 09-28-2017 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments How is cystic acne different from “regular” or common acne (acne vulgaris)? Cystic acne is considered one of the most severe forms of acne vulgaris . Cystic acne can appear similar to a nodule in size, but is pus-filled, and routinely have a diameter of 5mm or more across. Cysts originate deeper in the skin than typical pimples. These inflammatory lesions can be painful and commonly produce scarring Treatment of existing cystic acne followed by prevention of future acne is therefore necessary to avoid scars formations and to help healing of scars that have already developed. Acne cascade ( process of developing acne blemishes) pimples starts with over production of sebum ( skin oil) that together with dead skin cells clogs the pores. Eventually bacteria can also get trapped in these clogged pores. As the body attempts to kill the bacteria using its immune system, a local inflammatory response develops and white blood cells enter the area. Normally, the pore is “walled off” by the cells in the lower layers of the skin but in the case of cysts, this inflammation spreads under the top layer of the skin. The influx of cells and proteins causes swelling (bumps under the skin) and can be both very harmful to your skin and painful. If you try to squeeze these bumps you induce more skin damage which recruits more immune cells into the area and starts a vicious cycle which ends up damaging skin and leaving scars. Why I should NOT pop my cysts? Everyone has been told not to pop their zits at one point or another, since it might damage the skin and not only lead to more serious inflammation but also to serious acne scars and marks. This is particularly important when dealing with acne cysts (or what is called cystic acne) and there is a very good reason to follow this advice. In both instances, squeezing a pimple can damage your skin, however in the case of cystic acne, trying to squeeze the bumps under your skin can lead to permanent skin damage. Under normal circumstances, when a pimple starts to form, it is “walled off” by the body and contained within a single pore within the skin. With cystic acne, there is inflammation, which spreads under the surface of the skin to the adjoining tissue which makes cystic acne distinct from black heads & white heads and even from pustules and papules which reach the surface of the skin. The fact is that most times you try to squeeze an acne cyst you do not get relief by the release of the fluid (dead skin cells and other debris mixed with sebum and white blood cells) that has gathered under the surface of the skin, but rather, you further damage the skin and make the healing process take that much longer to occur. So what do you do with these cysts? The first step should be to decide on how to treat the underlying cause by stopping the cycle of acne and stopping the appearance of cysts. Without doing both simultaneously, the cycle will continue AcnEase is just this kind of product that protects your sebaceous glands from the assault of imbalanced hormones and prevents over secretion of sebum, stopping acne formation in its tracks and prevenying new acne from coming why also contains ingredients that are anti-inflammatory.. How to get an immediate comfort To release the pressure puss creates on your skin you may try a warm (not hot) compress dipped in a freshly brewed, strong chamomile tea (and cooled a little) and keep on the affected area for 15-20 minutes. Again, as mentioned, the only way to break the cycle of acne is when you get to the root cause by treating it. When cysts are almost gone but you still suffer from acne you may try the following aloe vera acne healing mask, which many AcnEase users use. Aloe vera has medicinal properties of healing scars caused by acne, and is soothing as it works as an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory to decrease redness and swelling. Turmeric is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and honey is both anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory and also helps to close the pores and nourish the skin. Try to use organic ingredients when possible. Aloe Vera Acne Healing Mask Ingredients 1 tbs fresh aloe vera juice (squeezed from its leaf) ½ tsp turmeric powder 1 tsp honey 1 tsp milk 3-4 drops of rose water Instructions Mix all the ingredients together. Apply the paste on the affected acne areas. Leave on for about 15-20 minutes. Wash off the effected areas with water. But remember- the only thing that has the power to treat acne t, and one that can break the cycle of acne and eliminate symptoms simultaneously – is a Botanical Therapeutic as AcnEase .

"['The Pocket Guide to The Pill, and How It Relates To Acne 07-27-2017 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments For women, the decision to take oral contraceptives is a personal one, with many reasons factoring into their decision. Some women opt for hormonal birth control simply to manage their acne , a method that has proven to work in some cases at least temporarily, but it also carries number of potential severe adverse effects. Using OC as acne remedy is according to FDA regulations OFF LABEL what means it has NEVER been tested for this applications and ling term site effects have not been established. So do you know why and how “pill” seems to help with acne at least for some women? And what happens once you put down the pill? What is Acne? Acne is the result of a hormonal imbalance, which is why many people notice increased symptoms at certain times of their lives and many women even at certain times of month. Is it puberty, or monthly period, after the baby or during the perimenopause…women get acne..The function of certain hormones can directly affect the sebaceous glands, which produce sebum, an oily substance that travels through the pores to help skin function in a healthy manner. When these hormones are out of balance, they can cause the sebaceous glands to produce too much sebum, which may clog pores. Combined with dead skin cells, dirt and debris, these oil-clogged pores create bacteria, which often results in an inflammatory reaction, which appear on the skin as pimples. In order to keep acne from forming, the relationship between hormones and the sebaceous glands must be a harmonious one. Many people use birth control to treat acne to forced this relationship even if temporarily.. How Does Hormonal Birth Control Affect Acne? To put it simply: hormonal birth control provides for more estrogen in women system and since the hormonal culprit in overstimulating sebaceous glands are androgens (testosterone- and yes women produce testosterone too as men also produce estrogen just in a different amount.) this “ extra estrogen “ balances” “extra” androgens in yiur blood and forces the balance in those hormones levels. This reduces the impact of androgens on the sebaceous glands, thereby improving acne. Like pretty much anything in life, however, there are good and bad aspects that come along with the use of birth control to treat acne. And remember this balance is “ force” and temporary… The Pro: Hormonal birth control will reduce the amount of pore-clogging oil that is created . Birth control increases globulin, a protein found in the blood that bonds sex hormones, such as testosterone, an androgen. Because testosterone directly affects the sebaceous glands, which produce sebum we want to keep testosterone levels as balanced as possible in order to keep those glands from going haywire. Taking birth control that contains estrogen or progesterone will lower the amount of androgens produced by the body, which results in less impact being made on the sebaceous glands, and ultimately, acne. The Con No. 1: Your acne will likely return as soon as you step away from the pill. When many women begin taking oral contraceptives (OC’s) they witness an acne flare up due to the influx of hormones being delivered to the body, and guess what? The same happens when these hormones are taken away. When you stop taking OC\'s, hormone levels become disrupted, which can then contribute to an acne breakout. Without the high estrogen levels to manage the androgen produced by the body, the sebaceous glands can cause oil-production levels to go into overdrive, which can lead to breakouts. Because birth control impacts the body hormonally, changes in the amount or frequency of that medication can end up affecting the body, and oftentimes the recurrence of acne symptoms is one of the first complaints women have when going off this type of contraceptive. I The Con No. 2: Long term use of OC carries a number of health hasards Some immediate side effects are: Intermenstrual spotting. ... Nausea. ... Breast tenderness. ... Headaches. ... Weight gain. ... Mood changes. ... Missed periods. ... Decreased libido. And even scarier than the “mild” side effects are the serious health risks that accompany birth control pills. These include: Increased risk of cervical and breast cancers. Increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Migraines. Higher blood pressure. Gall bladder disease. Infertility. Benign liver tumors. If you are currently taking oral contraceptives but are considering going off, you can minimize the impact of this step by adding AcnEase to your skincare regimen several weeks prior to stopping. As your body starts to adjust to the absence of the hormones provided by the OC\'s, AcnEase will help to reduce any ""acne fall out"" from cessation of OC\'s by working as a buffer between these hormones and the sebaceous glands, and will not negatively impact the protection afforded by OC\'s during this period. In addition to minimizing the negative impact of fluctuating hormone levels on sebum production, the ingredients in AcnEase have natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. This combination of effects is responsible for the ability of AcnEase to prevent new pimples from forming, while treating existing acne, no matter how mild or severe your symptoms may be. Of course, AcnEase is not intended to be an alternative to contraceptive birth control, but if you are taking oral contraception simply to alleviate your acne symptoms, it is by far the best and safest replacement of pill you can take it easier on your body, and achieve long-term results with AcnEase.

"['Guys, how do you think sex affects your skin? 04-14-2015 Dr Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Sex. If you\'re dealing with acne, it\'s one of those issues that might not leave you feeling so sexy. However, think again. While it might seem unusual, there is a definite connection between sex and making your breakouts less prevailing and large, and with the right information, you can keep your skin clear and have a little fun in the process. Here is a look at just how sex (and sex hormones) can affect the quality of your skin. The Skincare Benefits of Sex Let\'s be honest-most men don\'t need any motivation to have sex outside of the act itself. However, getting intimate with your partner can have some unexpected benefits in your fight against breakouts: Read More Try this tonight if you want to help your acne go away! 04-03-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Reduce Oil, Shrink Pores, Get an Even Skin Tone, Brighten Skin Spring has sprung (sort of!) and with that renewal, our skin also needs some assistance as it begins to get used to the different climate. New issues may arise or not, however, adding a new revitalizing mask to your skincare regimen can be a simple and effective way to help you in your journey to treat acne. Please note that this mask WILL NOT TREAT your acne (you need a TREATMENT to do this) so do not use it as a replacement for a treatment. It will however provide you with another highly effective skincare tip as you\'re on your way to an acne-free life. Read More Do\'s and Don\'ts to Fighting Acne with Spa Treatments 03-31-2015 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments You\'d be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn\'t enjoy a relaxing day at the spa, and because of this, these facilities are more prevalent than ever. While spa treatments are a great way to get away from it all, they may also be able to help in your fight against acne - as many promote healthy, clear skin. However, finding a treatment that works for you is not as simple as choosing the first thing you see. If you play it smart, though, you may just find something that works as a good supplement to your normal acne-fighting routine. Just remember however, these treatments DO NOT treat acne - they assist an acne treatment. Read More 4 Powerful Antioxidants That Can Reduce the Effects of Acne 03-26-2015 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Antioxidants hold a position of privilege among health conscious individuals. These powerful substances have the ability to locate and destroy free radicals, which are unstable atoms that can lead to illness and aging. Antioxidants are essential for overall health and wellness, but in particular they can promote clear skin and reduce the effects of acne. Here is a look at four particular ones that do just that. Keep in mind that antioxidants do not treat the underlying causes of acne, and therefore cannot eliminate your problems entirely. However, they are indeed powerful enough to help you along your quest for healthy skin. Read More [Quiz] What are you doing wrong to get rid of your acne? 03-24-2015 Dr Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments How much do you really know about dealing with breakouts? While most of us like to think that we\'re experts on the subject of skincare, there are some common misconceptions that can confuse even the savviest of people. That\'s why we\'ve created this quiz asking questions about the right (and wrong) ways to deal with acne. No one likes homework, but this is one quiz that can keep your skin healthy and acne-free! Read More How to Control Oily Skin to Reduce Breakouts 03-01-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Sebaceous glands are present throughout the skin on our body with the exception of our palms and the bottoms of our feet. These glands produce skin oil known as sebum which keeps our skin, soft, protected, and elastic. Without sebum, our skin would look like alligator skin...scaly and overly dry. But sometimes these glands produce too much skin oil and our skin becomes too oily. Our face, and sometimes our body, shines in all the wrong places leading to melting make-up and an unhealthy appearance. But very often, too much oil also leads to dreaded breakouts and unsightly pimples. Indeed oily skin is known to be a precursor to acne and even though some individuals with dry skin also get acne, the majority of acne sufferers have oily skin. So, if you want to prevent an acne breakout and get rid of your oily complexion, you need to control the excess oil being produced by your sebaceous glands. But, how? Read on. Read More The Smartest Way to Conquer Acne this Holiday Season 12-12-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments The holidays are officially upon us, and with them come lots of festivities and fun gatherings. During this social time of the year, you may be taking extra steps to ensure that you always look your best, and healthy, clear skin is probably pretty high on your list of priorities. Unfortunately, acne isn\'t very cooperative, and you may find yourself with breakouts at the most inopportune times. When this happens, it can be very tempting to turn to products offering a quick fix for your skin problems. However, relying on an endless string of supposedly fast-acting products can actually be doing more harm than good - and more importantly, first, you need to address those acne warning signs that are too serious to ignore. If you find yourself constantly reaching for the latest miracle cream or treatment, read this before you buy anything else. Read More Acne Warning Signs Too Serious to Ignore 11-23-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments While there\'s no denying that acne is a big concern and a very tough emotional experience for many, you can breath a sigh of relief knowing that it\'s not a major health issue. There are options available for treating it, albeit some are better than others, and it can be very difficult to choose an option that is right for you. However, there are some signs that your breakouts may not be typical or that are so severe that may lead to permanent skin damage. In these cases, it\'s important that you not ignore the signs your body is giving you. Here is a look at just a few instances where this is the case. Many people assume that acne is limited to the face, but it can actually occur on all parts of the body that have sebaceous glands and hair follicles that are EVERYWHERE (with the exception of the palms and feet). As it is not common to have acne over all your body, having outbreaks in areas others than the face -most commonly on the neck, back, chest, and shoulders - has become more and more prevailing. Read More Can Essential Oils Help Fight Acne? 11-15-2014 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Essential oils - the fragrant essences extracted from plants - have long been a staple of aromatherapy, but is it possible that they could help improve your acne as well? As you\'ll see, the answer to this question is not so clean-cut. It\'s true that they can be an effective supplement for your skincare routine, but there are also a few precautions to keep in mind when using them. The Potential Benefits of Essential Oils for Acne Treatment Many of the commonly used essential oils have powerful antibacterial properties - including tea tree oil, lavender oil, and bergamot oil. Since breakouts partially occur because acne-causing bacteria become trapped inside our pores, you can see why these might be useful. Additionally, many other oils also have a drying effect on the skin, which is perfect for those who are constantly battling oily skin. Some popular choices for this include rosemary oil, geranium oil, and rose oil. Read More 3 Trends in Acne Skincare to Watch Out For 11-09-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments There have never been more ways pretending to treat breakouts than right now. While these abundance of choices may look great for acne sufferers at least at first glance, not all of them are effective or even safe. Here are three increasingly popular trends that are making their mark in the world of skincare that we need to take a closer look at as for their real impact on treating acne (or their efficacy) and their safety profile. The Diet Approach For a long time, acne treatment was all about addressing the problem from the outside with things like creams and cleansers. While topical acne treatments are no doubt still popular, many people are beginning to see that what we put into our bodies is just as important as what we put on them. Take sugar, for example. Studies have shown that frequently eating high-sugar foods can cause skin inflammation that makes you more prone to acne breakouts. For this reason, dietary approaches to preventing breakouts have become increasingly important in the world of skincare. Read More How to Save Your Skin by Reducing Your Sugar Consumption 10-30-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments For those who have food allergies, know someone with them and/or don\'t want to give out candy this year: paint a pumpkin teal, and put it on your doorstep this Halloween. Why? The Teal Pumpkin Project is a public awareness campaign designed by FoodAllergy.org to raise awareness of food allergies by providing non-food treats for trick-or-treaters. Halloween time is here, and in addition to fun costumes and scary movies, it means lots and lots of candy! While there\'s nothing wrong with getting in the holiday spirit and indulging in a few sweet treats, lots of excess sugar can be a real terror on your skin. So, before you reach for a handful of candy corn or another mini candy bar, take a look at some of the facts on sugar and how you can keep your Halloween sweet but acne free. Read More 4 Fall Foods to Nourish Your Acne-Prone Skin This Season 10-12-2014 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Please note while reading, that we recommend when possible to purchase organic and non GMO food. Fall is here, and that means it\'s time to enjoy some of our favorite seasonal foods again. While dietary choices may not be a primary cause of acne, studies have shown that the things we eat do play at least somewhat of a role in our skin\'s health. For that reason, it\'s important to make healthy choices this fall season-especially since sugary, high-calorie treats lurk around every corner. Here\'s a look at four autumn-inspired foods that will help keep your skin glowing and acne-free over the coming months. Read More 5 Step Fall Skincare Routine for Acne Prone Skin 10-06-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Even though we still have some time before moving our clocks back (on November 2!) for the Fall, we want to help make sure you don\'t fall short on your skincare regimen. After a Summer spent in the sun sweating and applying lots of sunscreen, our pores get clogged more than usual, our skin can look dull and dry, hyperpigmentation is more profound, and pimples, blackheads and whiteheads may become more aggressive. In addition, the change in our daily routine with back-to-school and back-to-work stress makes acne breakouts even less tolerable while often more frequent. Read More Expert Reactions: FDA\'s New Warning on Benzoyl Peroxide & Salicylic Acid 09-30-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski and Dr. James P. Gilligan 0 Comments The FDA recently issued a warning regarding topical acne products that may have dangerous side effects (copy and paste this URL into your browser to see the announcement: http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/C onsumerUpdates/ucm402441.htm ). We wanted to provide you with a place where you could get the facts in an easy to understand way. When it comes to our health, wellness or beauty, we deal with a significant number of choices regarding products that claim to be able to help us, or perhaps help us meet our personal goals. Read More Can Probiotics Really Help YOUR Acne? 09-12-2014 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments Probiotics have come to the forefront of being an essential tool to helping maintain a healthy digestive and immune system. Despite this popularity, many people aren\'t entirely sure of what they are or what they can do. Here\'s a look at just a few of their great benefits-including a discussion of how they may be able to help you in your fight against acne. What are probiotics? You would be hard pressed to find someone who hasn\'t heard of probiotics and their numerous health benefits, but what exactly are they? The term ""probiotic"" refers to a wide range of microorganisms which can be found in certain foods, drinks, and supplements that help regulate everything from digestion to allergies. Most of these microorganisms are bacteria, and while chowing down on something commonly found in a petri dish may not sound appetizing, you might be surprised to learn that your gastrointestinal tract is already teeming with them!

"['Checklist of Questions to Ask Before Choosing an Acne Treatment 10-16-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments An educated consumer is a smart consumer! You certainly want to make sure that what you use will get rid of or at least contain your acne breakouts. So before you reach out for a bottle, cream or pill, read this. Acne is actually a rather complex disease, even though the clinical manifestation is rather simple: pimples! The driving force behind the formation of pimples is what is more complex. For instance, some women have an over-secretion of the adrenal glands that leads to elevated levels of testosterone (and androgen) in their blood, which is the cause of acne. For some, during adolescence, there may be a large growth spurt with very high levels of hormones. For others, acne is linked to their menstrual cycle. Genetic variation is also a large contributing factor; if parents had acne, it is likely their children will also have acne.

But avoiding the sun in the summer is like waving a big delicious candy bar in front of a child\'s (or, let\'s admit, an adult\'s) face and telling them they can\'t eat it. Being on an acne medication during the summer with this type of restriction can cause sunburn/sun damage (sometimes irreversible), irritation and dryness; all of which can make your acne problem worse. If your product is listed here, my recommendation to you is to consult with your doctor about taking these medications during the summer in order to reduce the harmful effects. ...

"['Does ""Natural"" Really Mean ""Natural""? 12-12-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments How to Become a Pro at Reading Product Labels How to Become a Pro at Reading Product Labels Everything we put into and on our bodies affects our health and the health of our skin. And everything that goes into our bodies can be classified as either natural or artificial. These days, believe it or not, when a product is labeled ""natural,"" some or many of the listed ingredients may actually be artificial or, contain an insignificant amount of a natural ingredient which may do not provide any real benefits. Just because something says it\'s natural, doesn\'t mean it is. It also does not mean that it is good for you. Using the word ""natural"" has become a marketing gimmick, and as a result, you may often be lead down the wrong path. A product labelled ""natural"" might not mean what you think it means. And you might be paying extra for a product that isn\'t much better than the one that\'s not labelled ""natural."" What does ""natural"" even mean? The common definition of ""natural"": means derived from or made by nature. The FDA defines natural ingredients as those derived from natural sources, such as lecithin derived from soybeans and corn. But did you know the majority of soybeans and corn are genetically modified here in the US? Ingredients not found in nature are synthetically produced and are referred to as artificial ingredients. Actually, there are some ingredients that are found in nature but are still produced synthetically. For example, vitamin C or ascorbic acid is often produced in a lab even though it may be derived from an orange or rose hips. The term ""natural"" is broadly used to describe foods, drinks, supplements and even cosmetics that are minimally processed and free of synthetic preservatives; additives, artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners; stabilizers, emulsifiers, growth hormones, antibiotics and hydrogenated oils. The key phrase when we\'re talking about ""natural"" labels is broadly used. It doesn\'t mean that every ingredient in the food or other products has all of the above-mentioned characteristics, or that the product is 100% natural. So how do we figure out the truth? First of all, don\'t get too hung up on a product being labelled ""natural."" The most important thing to do is read the label. If you\'ve never read a label before, look near the bottom or a side of a product for where it says ""ingredients."" The ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance by weight or percentage, which means the ones listed first are the most predominant in the product, and there is a lesser amount of the ingredients listed last. And please take note of this: if the only natural ingredient is listed last after the other artificial ingredients, you can bet that the product is not really natural. So, review all the ingredients. Do you recognize them or even use them when you cook? Or do some sound like an invention out of a sci-fi movie? If it sounds manmade, chances are it\'s an artificial ingredient-and isn\'t something you want to put into or on your body. And if you\'re not sure, just double check with a trusted source online. There\'s a wealth of knowledge out there that can help you stay healthy. Once you\'ve been reading labels a while, you\'ll become a pro, and the whole process will go much quicker. Most importantly, you\'ll be able to rest easy knowing that the things you and your family are eating and using aren\'t negatively affecting your skin (or your overall health). With all that is said, here is a word of caution: although eating truly natural foods or using mostly natural skincare products may be a great adjunct in treating acne, it will not treat your acne. To treat acne , you need to rebalance the body and ""reprogram"" the sebaceous glands to produce a ""normal"" amount of sebum. Final thought So now that you\'re on your way to becoming a pro at reading labels, remember how you\'re one step closer to not only helping break the cycle of acne but also creating a healthier lifestyle for you and your loved ones.

"['7 Easy Everyday MakeUp Tips for Acne Prone Skin 03-15-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments A message from Dr. Agnes: Treating acne takes time, dedication and perseverance, as there is no miracle cure that will allow you to regain clear skin overnight. While we are waging our war with pimples and cysts however, we still want to look and feel good about ourselves. So let\'s talk about make-up that does not spoil your results (or your progress with AcnEase®), but will make you feel secure without using products and techniques that may slow the healing process or actually accentuate your blemishes. Please join me in welcoming our guest, Todra Payne, former celebrity makeup artist and President of HealthyBeautyProject.com . By Todra Payne Looking great while clearing up your acne isn\'t as hard as you might think. Makeup, applied correctly and in naturally complementary shades, will make you look polished, not ""covered"". The mistake a lot of women make is applying too much makeup. When it comes to covering blemishes and breakouts, less is definitely ""more"". Follow these seven steps for great everyday looks, no matter what your skin\'s going through. 1. Always choose makeup with the simplest, most natural ingredients. Many of the chemicals found in the brands available at the drugstore or even department store counters contain toxins that are linked to cancer and other health issues. They can also work against the steps you\'re taking to clear up your skin. Pure mineral makeup works wonderfully. 2. Prep skin with a natural, lightweight, n o n-comedogenic moisturizer so your foundation holds to your skin better and looks ""fresh"" and touchable. Apply five to ten minutes before applying foundation. 3. Apply foundation that matches your skin exactly. You can choose powder, cream or liquid until they do not contain oil, paraffin or other comedogenic ingredients, but avoid the temptation to apply it thickly to cover blemishes or breakouts. 4. Once your foundation is on, go back over blemishes and breakouts with a thick cream concealer that matches the skin (and your foundation) as closely as possible. If you have red splotches, use a green color corrector underneath your color concealer first. For dark spots on dark skin, choose a peach color corrector. Using a stiff, nylon concealer brush works best for application. If you need concealer for under-eye circles, choose one that is one shade lighter than your skin and blend well so there\'s a smooth transition to your foundation. 5. Only apply powder if you have areas that shine heavily. Remember, less is more. If you don\'t need powder, then skip it. If you\'re going to apply blush, then add just a light dust of powder on the apples of your cheeks only. Apply blush over top of the powder to keep the blush in place. 6. To brighten eyes without doing a full application of eye shadow, add a swipe of champagne (for light skin), gold (for medium skin) or bronze (for dark skin) eye shadow just on the top lid and in the inside corners of the eyes. Blend well so that it\'s barely noticeable. The trick is to reflect light and look awake, not create drama. Finish eyes with a swipe of dark brown or black mascara. 7.

"['Why AcnEase? 19 Real Stories that Back Up Our Claims 03-17-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Dr. Agnes and the AcnEase team want to provide you with more than just a quality acne treatment that will help you break the cycle of acne, and so we pride ourselves on providing you with not only the facts about AcnEase and the science behind it, but the facts behind acne skincare and skin health in general We deliver the facts, and people are noticing. AcnEase has received so many great reviews from AcnEase users, and sites like Acne.org and Amazon.com and also investigative sites like DoesItReallyWork.org, who recommend giving AcnEase a try because we are ""legitimately trying to provide a quality product and not just after the quick buck."" That is us. Want proof? We\'re happy to deliver the real-life AcnEase customer stories that back up our claims: AcnEase Claims: AcnEase has a success rate of more than 96%. Brian claims: ""When I first came to AcnEase, I had no clue what to take. I just knew I had a real bad problem with acne. I had it ALL OVER my face and back - it was horrible. It\'s so great to use the past tense when I say that too. Now, on the other side 5 months later, I can safely say that I would recommend this product without reservation to anyone who is looking for a safe and effective alternative to EVERYTHING else out there claiming to treat acne. This is the REAL DEAL!"" AcnEase claims: AcnEase stops the cycle of acne. Enrica claims: ""I was done with using all of these different products that just gave me temporary results. My acne was on and off and on and off. When I found out about AcnEase I was happy to hear that this was something that was designed to stop the constant cycle. After 4 weeks I started to notice a difference, and 2 months later, no more acne. I\'m so happy! And now, 6 months later, I\'m still acne-free!"" AcnEase claims: AcnEase is 100% All-Botanical, clinically tested for safety and efficacy, and is formulated with a trade secret-protected blend of the highest quality herbal extracts. Linda D. claims: ""I made a conscious choice to find natural therapies that are not only good for me but for life on the planet. Mother nature gives us these gifts and AcnEase is the only product I have found that not only delivers results but also allows me to honor my personal code of ethics. AcnEase has become one of the ways I take care of myself ... Even with the challenges that life brings, when I\'m on AcnEase and my skin is clear, I know that I have the aid of mother nature and the science of AcnEase helping my physical body to detox and stay healthy during life\'s ups and downs. I am so grateful for AcnEase. It makes a difference much deeper than the surface for people like me. I wished for twenty years to have clear, beautiful skin and LITERALLY AcnEase has been the answer to that prayer!"" AcnEase claims: AcnEase restores the internal balance needed to return sebaceous glands to their normal activity. A review from Acne.org claims: ""I don\'t normally write reviews on products, but this is one that I would highly recommend because it is so effective. I\'m 28 and have had acne for as long as I can remember. I\'ve tried EVERYTHING-and I\'ve done a lot of research on this and other products. The ingredients are completely safe and they actually rebalance the craziness that is going on inside of your body that is causing your acne. I don\'t know what I would do without AcnEase and am so glad that I finally got my life back!"" AcnEase claims: AcnEase eliminates acne and prevents new pimples from forming. Ayesha claims: ""I have been taking Acnease for over 2 months now, and I am on my 3rd month. I have suffered from very stubborn and persistent acne for almost 3 years and no medications the doctors gave me worked and I was so fed up. Since using Acnease, believe me when I say this, it has ELIMINATED my acne, my scars were beginning to lighten and I was able to see and touch an acne free face. I however saw results only towards the end of my 2nd month of taking Acnease, which is understandable as I have had acne for a very long time. Acnease staff members reassured me that it will work if you take it for at least 2-3 months, and they were RIGHT! So after my second month of taking Acnease, my mother told me to order some more and I did."" AcnEase claims: AcnEase reduces impact of hormones on sebaceous glands. Julia claims: ""I cannot speak more highly of this product-it really saved me so much grief. I have always had fairly clear skin. For some reason, when I turned 27 last year, I started getting really bad breakouts all over my chin and sometimes forehead. My breakouts usually occurred toward the end of my cycle and would take weeks-if not months-to heal and fade. I started the moderate acne treatment about 6 months ago. After I had been taking it for a week or so I noticed that I did not have the same outbreak that I had come to expect each month. My pimples were smaller and fewer. By the end of the first month of taking AcnEase, my chin had completely cleared up!"" AcnEase claims: Effective results can be seen within 7-10 days (results vary case by case). Ashley claims: I am 16 and I have used AcnEase for about 2-1/2 months with 8 pills a day. My acne is moderate. I noticed a difference in the first week taking it. I love that the pills are easy to swallow and there are no bad side effects. I would recommend these pills because they aren\'t harmful like other pills because they are natural. My forehead definitely cleared and I am satisfied. I have suffered with acne for about 3 years. The hardest part about having acne is being judged because it has made me insecure. People who suffer with acne should try to not let others get to you because acne is only temporary and there is always a solution for everyone."" AcnEase claims: AcnEase is safe, contains no chemicals and has no side effects. Tom claims: ""I have suffered from chronic acne (more than 5 years) and was undecided about trying Accutane due to the side effects. I decided to give AcnEase a shot and I am glad I did. At first I was hesitant due to the price but with the money back guarantee I figured I had nothing to lose. I have to say, AcnEase was worth every penny since it worked! I had to use the 6 tablet 3 x day regimen but I had no side effects and I started seeing improvement within the first 2 weeks."" AcnEase claims: AcnEase is not drying and will not irritate the skin. Rebecca claims: ""I have used other acne products and they just dried out my skin and made my face all red without fixing my acne issues. I have very sensitive skin and since using AcnEase, my acne went away (be patient-it takes a little time but it works) and my skin feels great!"" AcnEase claims: AcnEase has no sun restrictions. Cassandra Bankson claims: ""They don\'t cause light sensitivity. When I was on antibiotics I could not go out in the sun because I would burn up and peel off. And the reason why is because antibiotics thin out your skin and make you sensitive to light. These do not do that for me. I was able to go out all summer long. I was able to swim. I was able to live a normal life."" AcnEase claims: AcnEase works for men, women, and teens of all ages and complexions. Mark Kond claims: ""I had very bad acne as a teenager, and never fully grew out of it. I tend to get it on my forehead and shoulders, worse in the summer months or if I\'m going to the gym a lot. I\'ve always been a bit self-conscious about it, but when I\'ve tried the creams and pads I just get dry and peeling skin but no change in the zits. I found AcnEase just searching online and gave it a shot-I started to see improvement after 1 month and after 2 my skin was all clear. I started with 4 pills 2x per day but now just do 1x a day and it works great."" Rashidah claims: ""I started to take AcnEase, and my skin started to clear up 2 weeks later. I had severe acne problems and have tried so many different expensive products and medication, but its proven that AcnEase was the best for my skin and I really enjoy having the skin I have now. I will highly recommend this product to all people who suffer skin problems like myself. It\'s worth every penny!"" Maria Gargano claims: ""My 17-year-old son has been using AcnEase for 10 months now. I cannot say enough about this product and Dr. Agnes. Prior to learning about AcnEase, my son was under constant care of his dermatologist. He was prescribed several antibiotics and topicals, including Accutane. Although, Accutane cleared his acne, once he was off it, he continued to breakout. With all the negativity about Accutane, I would not let him do another round of it. My son has been dealing with acne for five years. It really bothers him and has changed him. Socially, he would just rather not and psychologically he thinks it is really bad but really it isn\'t. He is always on-line researching and he discovered AcnEase. I read about it but really wanted to speak with someone about it. I contacted the company and I was put in touch with Dr. Agnes who gave me the time I needed as a mom and the guidance with the product. My son was put on a regime and it has been uphill since then. I believe my sons skin has never looked better ... If you are reading this review, I am telling you, you should give this product a try. You will see results and be very happy."" AcnEase claims: AcnEase works for cystic acne, androgen-induced acne, and body acne. Danny claims: ""My acne was chronic for many years. Although my face had cleared up for quite a while, minus the bumps and blackheads, I still suffered from cystic acne on my back and shoulders. I gave AcnEase a try after a friend had tried it and said it worked. I was skeptical as nothing had worked well in the past; albeit an all-natural product. I ordered the severe acne treatment and took 18 tablets per day. Easy considering it is three times a day. Just fit it into my daily routine. In just a few short weeks my skin was less oily and more matte. My blackheads were less and less as well as the bumps. The biggest change I saw was on my back. The cysts and blackheads, and whiteheads are all gone. I may get an occasional pimple, but the horrible acne I suffered is completely gone, and stayed gone. This drug is a miracle. The scarring I had too has diminished significantly as well. Overall a 9 out of 10 improvement. I couldn\'t be happier. AcnEase has changed my life."" AcnEase claims: AcnEase works for rosacea. Michelle Stamp claims: ""I cannot thank you enough for this product. I am 43 and have terrible redness from hot-to-cold situations, stress, nerves etc and it really is embarrassing. I found this product for my 16 year old son for his acne. I started the treatment first and I can say 100% that it has worked and I am not getting the burning red feeling when I come in from the cold etc. I daren\'t stop taking it now! I did read that you suggest a maintenance dose for rosacea-type skin anyway."" AcnEase claims: AcnEase treats acute and chronic hormonal and androgen-induced acne. Paula claims: ""I am 36-year-old woman and have had hormonal acne since I was 16. I spent thousands of dollars and many sleepless nights agonizing about my acne. I bounced from doctor to doctor and from product to product and nothing worked! In addition I had my share of side effects like dry and peeling skin after using products with salicylic acid and alcohol, and sunburn after antibiotics. I even wanted to use Accutane but a friend pointed out its side effects so I spared myself a major injuries. I found AcnEase 2 years ago and I am using it since that. I started with severe acne treatment and my skin was clear after 3 month! After 18 years of acne I had no more acne. Since that I have lower my regimen to treatment for moderate and mild acne and those 4 little tablets twice a day still keep my skin clear for two years now! I even have days where I wear no make-up!. I recommend this product to ALL who have acne. It is not cheap but you get your money worth and some. Skip your daily Starbacks, AcnEase is much cheaper and it works."" AcnEase claims: AcnEase replaces spirinolactone (Aldactone) for androgen acne. A review from Acne.org claims: ""I went off spironolactone because of all the side effects, and I broke out pretty bad. I ordered this stuff in desperation. I have been taking this for about 11 days at 12x/day and it has healed my acne about 70%. I am still breakout out a little but nothing like it was before. My skin is glowing, the zits aren\'t red, they are more pink, less oily skin, and it\'s only been 11 days!"" AcnEase claims: AcnEase is a safe alternative to oral contraceptives. Amanda Aszman claims: ""In the 7 weeks I\'ve been taking AcnEase, I\'ve noticed a big decrease in oil production, and the little acne I do have heals SO much faster. Since I\'m fighting ""severe acne"" after having been using tretinoin, antibiotics, and birth control for YEARS, I plan to stay on AcnEase for a while (the worse your acne, the longer treatment you\'ll need). I feel good (read: way less anxious!) knowing I\'m treating my acne from the inside, in a natural, SAFE way that has no side effects. Acne really does have to be treated from the inside in order to make your sebaceous glands produce less oil so that you stop getting acne, and that\'s exactly what AcnEase does. I was so excited when I learned about AcnEase, especially because it got some great reviews from people I trusted ... I only wish I\'d found AcnEase sooner to avoid the horrible side effects I\'m STILL dealing with from endless topical and oral antibiotics, tretinoin, and birth control use."" AcnEase claims: AcnEase alleviates the need for systemic antibiotic treatment. Joseph L. claims: ""It has been almost 2 years since I have taken AcnEase as a regular daily routing. Your product is unchallenged by anything else on the market. Unlike antibiotics, which fight acne AFTER it appears, AcnEase does it the right way, from the inside out, and works to PREVENT acne from ever occurring. It is also GOOD for your body, unlike antibiotics, which were never intended for long-term use."" *** We hope these real customer stories help you make the right decision to treat your acne , and as always, we wish you the best of luck on your journey to clear skin.

"['How to Reduce Acne Breakouts when Drinking Alcohol 08-17-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Chances are, when you consider having a cocktail or other alcoholic drink, the last thing on your mind is your skin. If you’re like most people, you are having a good time, enjoying the moment, spending time with friends and family, or savoring a delicious meal. What we’re about to tell you isn’t intended to squash your mood, but to help you weigh the consequences that indulging in alcohol may have on your health, appearance and acne-prone skin. Even though acne isn’t caused by alcohol, there is an abundance of scientific data that proves that alcohol adversely affects your skin and other organs. Let’s take a look at the impact of alcohol on your skin, how it can exacerbate your acne and how to prevent any damage to your skin…or at least moderate the effects without becoming totally abstinent! The Effects of Alcohol on the Body and Skin From a physiological standpoint, the negative effects of alcohol are numerous. Alcohol damages the liver - Alcohol is a hepatoxin, which damages the liver. The liver is the most important organ for maintaining healthy skin. Specifically, alcohol is a toxin to the cells whose sole function is to detoxify the entire body. The liver also regulates several hormones and helps maintain steady blood sugar levels. The liver plays a vital role in the body\'s use of hormones, both those that are produced naturally in our bodies as well as those hormones that are ""introduced"" via hormone therapies. It acts as a hormone processor, manufacturing and/or regulating some hormone levels, and directing various hormones to perform their proper function in other parts of the body. Over time, the liver function becomes less efficient due to “fatty liver syndrome”, which is a direct result of prolonged or excessive alcohol use. (Fatty liver is also related to obesity and some drugs). “Fatty liver” is unable to “manage” or process the hormones as quickly or efficiently, causing a hormone imbalance, and a number of other negative effects. Hormonal imbalance is the main cause of acne as it may overstimulate sebaceous glands that produce skin oil (sebum). This excess oil is the primary material that clogs the pores and initiates the acne cascade . Alcohol dehydrates the skin - Alcohol lowers the water content in your body, which hinders your body’s ability to remove and flush out inflammatory toxins. Your body is unable to cleanse itself as effectively and this can lead to acne. Alcohol changes hormone levels - Alcohol stimulates the production of testosterone and may therefore create or amplify a hormonal imbalance. This, in turn, may over-stimulate the sebaceous gland which is a direct cause of acne. If you already suffer from acne, this will make it worse. Heavy drinking will wreak havoc on your body and create even more damage than the occasional cocktail. When you drink heavily, more than 2 or 3 drinks within a 4-6 hour period, your body tries to convert the carbs found in alcohol, leading to a spike in your blood sugar levels. If you are drinking faster than your body can convert the carbs, your body is unable to keep up and this will lead to excessive sugar levels. A high-sugar diet damages collagen and also affects the type of collagen that is present in your body. The most abundant collagens in the skin are types I, II and III, with type III being the most stable and long-lasting. Glycation, the process where sugar bonds with proteins to form advanced glycation end products or AGEs, transforms type III collagen into type I, which is more fragile. Collagen is the main building material for your skin and is not only indispensable to prevent premature aging, but for people with acne, its deficiency will affect the healing of acne scars and marks. It’s important to note that alcoholic beverages contain very high amounts of added sugar and while these make the beverages taste good, they can cause serious damage to your body and skin. Alcohol depresses the immune system - Your immune system keeps bacteria under control and a weakened immune system will allow bacteria to build up in your skin pores, resulting in more inflammation and acne breakouts. A Guide to Choosing the Right Drinks – Easy Tricks to Reduce Breakouts when You Drink Alcohol If you are going to indulge, try to drink as little and as seldom as possible. Make your selection and choices with the following list in mind: Clear shots : Vodka, Gin, and Tequila are better for your skin’s health if it is served as a shot as it doesn’t contain heavy amounts of sugar and other chemical ingredients. You can have these over ice or even mixed with water. Also avoid flavored vodkas which contain added sugar too. Dark Shots : Rum, Whiskey, and Tequila don’t contain additives but they do have more congeners, which contribute to hangovers. Beer : Contains antioxidants and other benefits. The downside is that it contains salt and some other ingredients that stimulate urination which adds to dehydration. Beer also contains a lot of carbs and sugar. Beer contains less alcohol than straight drinks so when consumed in moderation, it lowers the chances of poor choices being made. Red Wine : Contains more antioxidants than white wine. This is the best drink if you are going to drink and minimize the effects of alcohol on skin health and aging. However, if you have rosacea, avoid red wine as there is a high risk of it causing a flair-up. Skip dessert! This will reduce your sugar levels. Supplement a dessert with a very “watery” fruit like watermelon. Drink plenty of water together with or immediately after drinking alcohol. Pace yourself. By drinking slower, you will drink less. Other Connections Between Alcohol and Acne that are Often Overlooked Follow your daily skincare regimen: If you choose to drink alcohol, be sure to follow your daily skin care regimen and your AcnEase® dose. While alcohol may lower the efficacy of AcnEase®, it’s not counter-indicated which means there is no adverse reaction between alcohol and AcnEase®. If you should miss your dose, continue with your recommended dose the following day. Drink a lot of water: Drink more than 8 glasses a day when drinking alcohol! Effects of high stress levels: People often drink to relieve stress. The stress could be causing acne because stress affects your hormone levels, which could have a negative impact on your skin. Touching your face: Avoid touching your face and irritating your skin. This is common knowledge and simple to avoid when you’re not drinking but can quickly become an afterthought if you are under the influence of alcohol. Note to those who suffer from Rosacea: This skin disease affects more than 50 million people worldwide. Parts of the skin that are affected by rosacea are sensitive to certain stimulants that cause their capillaries to open. One of these stimulants is alcohol and should be avoided. As previously mentioned, red wine is the worst option for rosacea-sufferers. How to REALLY Enjoy Yourself Without Having to Worry About Your Acne Taking action from within your body is the best and only way to end the acne cycle. AcnEase® is the first step in obtaining acne-free skin, enabling you to end the recurring cycle of acne and enjoy life! It limits your body’s response to hormones in the blood and keeps your production of skin oils at a healthy level that is beneficial for your skin. Our botanical ingredient based acne treatment can be used by anyone and is free of sugar, gluten, nuts and milk derivatives, chemicals, GMO’s and phytoestrogens. Most of you are already taking AcnEase®, and have worked hard for your achievements. Just remember, AcnEase® is working hard too. Most of the work is under the surface and may not yet be fully visible, but with patience and your continued dedication to using the product as intended, you will be rewarded with clear skin. AcnEase® is not intended to be taken with alcohol even though it does not have any counter-indication against such use. The occasional glass of wine or beer will not make a dramatic impact on your skin in your fight against acne. Keep in mind, we are partners in this endeavor and we hope that you make healthy choices for you and your skin. Let us know in the comments below how AcnEase® is working for you.

"[""Acne Skin-Friendly Halloween Makeup. Treat - Don't Trick - Your Skin This Halloween 10-30-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Who doesn't want to go a bit overboard with makeup on Halloween? Though this is the time to get away with it, you still may want to do it in a way that does not exasperate your acne. Here are some Halloween tips to look crazy-good but let your acne-prone skin survive the night. 1. Accentuate - Do Not Experiment Acne is a result of your pores being stuffed with too much sebum (skin oil) mixed with dirt, sweat, dead skin cells and, of course, bacteria. The heavy and often not very high-quality makeup we tend to use for Halloween is a really bad addition to this mix. Use your well-tested, non-comedogenic makeup but allow yourself to play with colors. Exaggerate with too-light foundation, strong blush, overstated lips, and lighter or darker shades of your regular well-tested powder. It will go a long way to make you look scary or made-up without a risk of additional breakouts. 2. Your Eyes - Your Greatest Asset Use your usual eye makeup to the extreme. Long and thick black eyeliner will make you look mysterious; if you do it in green or blue, you'll look like a fairy queen. Add on extra-long black or colored artificial lashes (simple and inexpensive ones that you just glue on). You will look special and your skin will feel like it too. 3. Twinkle, Twinkle...And Feel Like a Star Adding some sparkle (sparkling powder or eye shadow) to your eye makeup or even regular makeup goes a long way to change your looks. Apply a generous smudge of sparkle on the apples of your cheeks and your de'colletage. Sprinkle it on the outside corners of your upper eyelids and on both sides of your forehead. It will give you a fairy look but will NOT give you pimples. 4. The Magic Power of Clean Skin Halloween is a magical night, so do not forget to extend this magic at the end of the evening by removing your makeup and cleaning your skin before you hit the sack. Even if your Halloween night is short, sleeping with your makeup on will add to the clogging of your pores and exasperate acne breakouts. Use chamomile astringent to calm down any redness from the extra rubbing you do to remove the makeup, and use a mild, light moisturizer to keep your skin supple. After you dance with goblins and trick-or-trick with monsters, DO NOT FORGET your daily dose of AcnEase® to keep your skin healthy - and not scary - all year round.

"[""7 Easy Tips to Reduce Holiday Stress & Avoid Acne Flare-ups 12-01-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Stress is a horrible feeling no matter what time of year it is, but it's especially horrible around the holidays, when it tends to creep up on us and keep us from getting the most out of family time. Even more unfortunate is the fact that stress is more than just a feeling. No matter what kind of stress you're experiencing, your body will respond in the same way: Adrenaline, the number one stress hormone, speeds up the heartbeat, breathing and metabolic rate to give you a necessary rush of extra energy. Adrenaline is produced and stored in our two adrenal glands, which are situated on top of the kidneys. With long-term stress, these glands will deplete. Too much stress on our systems releases excess stress-related hormones, enzymes and other chemicals that leave us anxious and tense--and also with overstimulated sebaceous glands, which leads to more acne. So how can we avoid and defeat stress so that our acne doesn't flare up? 1. Get more sleep. You've probably heard this a million times, but that's because it's true. Sleep may not be a cure-all, but it certainly helps when it comes to stress. Research indicates that the risk of psychological stress increases by 14% for every hour of sleep you lose a night. Stress increases glucocorticoid production, which can over-stimulate sebaceous glands, meaning lack of sleep may exacerbate your acne. To improve your complexion, do everything you can to get enough sleep. 2. Fit in moments of relaxation We know you're busy, and even more so because of the holidays, so if you can't make it to a regular class for Yoga, Pilates or Qigong, there are some great videos online, even free ones . And if you still think you can't fit it into your schedule, try waking up just a little earlier to start your day off right. We love this quickie meditation video for total body relaxation. It takes less than 21 minutes and will leave you feeling great. 3. Eat your vitamins Vitamin B6 helps your skin by reducing the amount of homocysteines in your blood. High homocysteines levels trigger a stress response, which can cause both acne breakouts and hives. You can find Vitamin B6 in meats, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Folate has the same stress reducing function as vitamin B6. Increase your intake of folate with dark leafy vegetables like kale, mustard greens, and broccoli, as well as beans, legumes and citrus fruits. 4. Try herbal relaxants If stress is balanced with relaxation, then its negative effects may be diminished and a balance can be achieved. Chamomile, skullcap, vervain, wild oats, St John's Wort, limeflowers and lavender are often used for stress reduction. These helpful herbs can be taken as tinctures, pills, infusions or decoctions. When taken regularly, they can help to support the nervous system and keep a stressful lifestyle under control. And if you find yourself stressed despite your best efforts, calm down with this recipe: Herbal Infusion for Stress Ingredients: 1 tablespoon dried lime flowers 1 tablespoon dried chamomile 1 tablespoon dried vervain Instructions: Add the dried herbs to 2 cups of boiling water in a warmed pot with a lid. Leave to infuse for 10-15 minutes, and then strain. Drink warm throughout the day. 5. Remember to breathe Sometimes, all you need to do is breathe. If you feel yourself getting stressed, close your eyes and take at least ten deep breaths, making sure to fill your lungs. If you tend to breathe shallowly much of the time, or if you're not even sure how you breathe, try lying down and placing one hand on your stomach and the other on your chest. Breathe in deep through your nose, for 6 seconds or so, so that you feel your stomach rise up, but not your chest. You want your chest to stay level. This way, you'll know you're filling your lungs completely. Hold the breath for another few seconds, then breathe out through your mouth until your lungs are emptied. Repeat ten times and see how you feel. Better? We hope so. 6. Walk away and do something different We don't always have the luxury of walking away from the situations or tasks that are stressing us out. But, if you do, try it. Walk away and do something else for a few minutes. We recommend doing something that isn't even on your to-do list, for example, listening to a relaxing song, writing a poem or coloring a picture. Yes, coloring books are for kids. But that's the point! Do something you don't have to do, something you can do for the sole purpose of calming down and remembering how to enjoy life-even when it's stressful. 7. Make life easier for yourself Many of our customers have told us the various things they do that help remind them to take their AcnEase . The one that seems to be the most popular is to set 4 reminders on your cell phone each day.

"['Why You Need a Personalized Treatment for Your Acne 06-04-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski and Dr. James P. Gilligan 0 Comments When we discuss a sickness or disease, many times we are actually describing the symptoms, not the disease. Science and medicine have made progress in better understanding the underlying causes of diseases and therefore allowing physicians to tailor the treatment that is the best for a particular individual. Furthermore, researchers are continually developing more precise medications with a goal of increased efficacy and less adverse side effects. The birth of personalized medicine came about because of the Human Genome project that was completed in 2003 and for the first time in human history provided a detailed ""genetic map"" for mankind. This map is helping to explain why some individuals respond to a particular drug or treatment while others do not and also allows us to actually focus on individual needs for treatment rather than a traditional ""mass approach."" How does personalized medicine relate to the treatment of acne? While the clinical manifestation of acne is very straightforward and it manifests itself by pimples, cysts, blackheads and whiteheads on your face and/or body, the acne disease is actually far more complex. There are also many factors that can contribute to the formation of acne. For instance some women produce too-high levels of testosterone (androgens) and as a result may suffer from androgenal acne. Other women may produce too little estrogen and even though they do not overproduce androgens, the proportion of the hormones is off and this imbalance (too many androgens vs. too little estrogen) may actually result in pushing the sebaceous glands to the overproduction of sebum, and as a result - to acne. Hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle or extensive sport and physical exercise may also contribute to the formation of acne. Finally, an individual\'s genetic makeup (both the part you inherit and the one that is unique for you only) can possibly also be a factor that influences both severity of your acne and actually the propensity of you getting acne at all. The good news is that despite the complexity relating to the causes of acne there is a common denominator, and this is an over-production of sebum by the sebaceous glands. Excess production of sebum leads to clogged pores where dead skin cells accumulate and provide an ideal environment for the growth of bacteria. When the body tries to fight those bacteria we will see a local inflammation that manifests itself as moderate to severe acne, including redness, tenderness and pimples filled with puss. If this local inflammation spreads to the area surrounding the clogged pore, we are facing larger bumps or nodules under the skin known as cystic acne. In addition to this cause of your acne, there are also other factors that can influence your personalized approach to acne treatment. Is your acne mild, moderate or severe? Is your acne chronic (lasting for over a year)? Do you have cystic acne (bumps under the skin)? Do you have inflammatory acne (pustules and papules like puss-filled pimples and zits)? Is your acne primarily comedones (blackheads and whiteheads)? Is you acne restricted to your face or also present on your torso (back and chest)? Are you pre-adolescent, teenager or adult? In summary, we need to recognize that all of the above factors will contribute to how you decipher your personalized approach to acne treatment. So if you really want to break the acne cycle and get, and maintain, clear skin, you should find a treatment that fits a personalized medicinal approach as closely as possible. AcnEase ® is such a medicine. The ingredients present in AcnEase ® address the 3 major mediators of acne: Over-secretion of sebum by sebaceous glands Growth of bacteria Local inflammation The ingredients in AcnEase ® reduce the impact of fluctuating hormone levels on the sebaceous glands thereby reducing over-production of sebum. In addition, the ingredients also have mild anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. The personalized breakthrough approach to acne treatment with AcnEase® leads to developing personalized treatment regimens for ""different acne."" We developed a series of acne treatment programs that provide you with a personalized therefore more effective approach to treating your specific acne. As the next step and to make it as easy as possible, we translated those regimens into an easy-to-follow ""3-step user guide"" to enable you to choose the best PERSONALIZED ACNE TREATMENT FOR YOURSELF. Finally, to recognize the role of additional factors that influence acne, we created a virtual library of personalized skincare and dietary tips and advice so AcnEase users can also develop a personalized lifestyle that is helpful in achieving a healthy and clear complexion for years to come.

"['Important Tips on How to Fight Whiteheads and Blackheads 07-30-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Do you have whiteheads or blackheads? You may not think about it but - yes, this means you HAVE acne. The first warning sign that indicates you may succumb to acne is actually oily skin. This condition results from over production of sebum (skin oil) by your sebaceous glands. As skin oil is necessary for heathy skin, too much of it may clog your pores (together with dead skin cells, dirt, and other “debris”), and actually become a first step in the “acne cascade”. This first step is marked by the occurrence of comedones also commonly known as or whiteheads or blackheads. When clogged pores became inflamed due to the presence of bacteria, the result is a formation of pimples or even cysts. Read More Everything You Didn’t Want to Know About Buttne 07-21-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Buttne (butt acne) tends to be a hush-hush topic. However, it’s a real problem that acne sufferers must deal with, and without a conversation, it may never be treated correctly! Below, we take a look at how to prevent butt pimples and cysts. They may be all the rage, but yoga pants can spell trouble if you’re trying to avoid buttne. One of the main problems with these comfy bottoms is their fit—they’re simply too tight. As your skin creates new cells, the old ones are, ideally, sloughing off. However, in yoga pants, this doesn’t occur. Instead, your dead cells are forced to stay on the surface of your skin, where they clog your pores and set the stage for a breakout all over your posterior. In addition, many yoga pants are made of material that fosters sweat rather than promoting adequate ventilation. Sweat will increase the incidence of dead skin cells and any other debris or dirt that “packs” the pores.

These days, food is not just a source of nutrition but also a source of comfort, a means to socialize, a status symbol, and the subject of vigorous and lengthy discussions, and we would like to add our own two cents to this subject from an acne standpoint. If you’re looking for ways to improve your odds in the battle against acne, making some dietary changes might be the answer you need.

Read More Which astringents are best for my acne-prone skin? 06-15-2015 Dr Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments We hear this question quite often. Astringents are substances (both made by nature and by chemical synthesis) that have a special property of shrinking or constricting the tissue. Therefore, it’s no surprise that they are used in the beauty industry to shrink pores and smooth the skin. For the same reason, many popular acne products also contain astringents. The problem begins when they contain powerful chemicals that have a tendency to “overdo” what you would expect an astringent to do. In some cases, the wrong astringent or the wrong use/application of an astringent may have an adverse impact on your skin’s health. Some potentially harmful ingredients found in astringents include salicylic acid, peroxide and glycolic acid. Read More 3 Reasons Why You\'re Still Struggling with Acne 06-11-2015 Dr Agnes P.

Olszewski 0 Comments For anyone who\'s dealt with breakouts on the neck, back, arms, or chest, you know that body acne is much more difficult to get rid of than pimples or blackheads on the face. Even with proper treatment, it can be stubborn and hard to control. The reason behind the fact that body acne is more difficult to treat is that there are more hair follicles and more pores to be clogged on the back. A proper hygiene and skincare routine is also less freque for the body. These types of breakouts can have a major impact on your self esteem, especially during the summer months when swimsuits and other light clothing make body acne more visible.

We\'ve compiled this guide of helpful tips to help you and every women like you enjoy a fun, acne-free summer. Rinse off after enjoying the pool.

Unfortunately, most of these ""cures"" are not worth a second of your time...and some may even make your skin worse.

"['An Easy DIY Trick to Fight Blackheads 10-29-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments For many with acne, the pesky bumps that come with the territory can be an endless source of frustration. The symptom of the acne condition appears on the skin as pimples, whiteheads, and blackheads, each coming with their own set of problems when looking to eliminate. Typically, when a pimple appears on the skin, its natural course will run from anywhere between 3-7 days before disappearing. In the case of whiteheads and blackheads (a form of acne) , however, the clogged pore never quite reaches an inflamed state, making it much harder to treat, or even temporarily conceal with makeup or spot treatments. Many are tempted to pick at or squeeze the infected area, which can lead to irritation or even infection. Others reach for a more harsh solution to remedy their woes, turning to pore strips, or even chemical peels to erase these annoying occurrences. What many people don’t know is that an easy and effective alternative can probably be found right in their own kitchens.

Because there is no proven cure for acne, people have been left to treat only the symptoms. Along the way, many myths and false beliefs have been developed, from the highly debated to the downright comedic. Here are just a few...have a look and see if any sound familiar to you! “Just pop it so it goes away!” At the sight of a breakout, many people get the initial urge to get rid of blemishes and move on. While popping a pimple may provide some immediate gratification, the lasting effects can be far more damaging. When you pop, the skin is torn open which creates an even larger opportunity for harmful bacteria to enter and often results in more blemishes, not to mention scarring. It’s always best to let breakouts run their natural course, and most will disappear in approximately 3-7 days.

While the hot, humid summer months are tough on many acne sufferers, the fall season is actually the most common time of year for many people to experience breakouts.

At first, we usually don’t consider some of the contributing factors that can make it worse. We actually spend more time trying different products in hopes that something works, and less time on analyzing how our daily habits could be affecting our skin. Daily habits are so routine that we do them without notice sometimes.

Vitamin D is also known as the “sunshine vitamin”, and there are several reasons why it should be incorporated into your daily skincare regimen. Vitamin D can help regulate your body’s insulin response, which decreases hormonal acne, relieves inflammation, increases antioxidant production and strengthens your immune system. All of these factors contribute to healthy skin. In addition, vitamin D is recognized for improving your mood and decreasing depression. This may assist in managing stress levels and therefore lower amounts of cortisol, a hormone, which leads to acne.

What we’re about to tell you isn’t intended to squash your mood, but to help you weigh the consequences that indulging in alcohol may have on your health, appearance and acne-prone skin.

Lets explore this amazing fruit and its many healing qualities. Pineapple acts as an exfoliating agent and unclogs acne pores. Exfoliating naturally speeds up the production of new cells and this is also the same process that rejuvenates the skin. The enzymes found in pineapple fight damage from free radicals and also cleanse the skin by gradually dissolving the whiteheads, blackheads and dead cells on the skins surface. This also unclogs the skin and prevents buildup that invites bacteria, which begins the acne cascade. Read More What You’re NOT Being Told About the Ingredients in Your Skincare Products 07-30-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments If you have acne-prone skin, it’s vital that you avoid products that contain comedogenic ingredients. Comedogenic ingredients clog pores, it’s as simple and as complex as that! Skin oil, known as sebum, is produced by the sebaceous glands to keep our skin moist, but it also can get mixed with a number of “skin debris” such as dead skin cells, make-up, dirt and different ingredients of skincare products. When skin oil is produced in excess, the mix of sebum, dead skin cells and all other “ingredients” become too much to be naturally disposed by the pores and they get clogged. When a pore becomes clogged, the sebaceous glands still produce oil but there is no way to remove the excess oil and dead skin cells. This can happen by internal buildup and/or be exasperated by external factors such as makeup or skincare products. There are specific ingredients that are more likely to clog pores and these are labeled as comedogenic. It is especially important for someone with acne-prone skin to avoid these ingredients.

"['Why Do Guys Get Acne? 06-10-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski and Dr. James P. Gilligan 0 Comments I would like to thank Dr. Gilligan, Chief Scientific Officer at AcnEase, for collaborating with me today. So why do guys get acne? You may answer because guys don\'t take care of their skin as well as their female counterparts; or perhaps their skin hygiene maybe lacking; or maybe guys on average play more sports and sweat more. As all of the above may contribute to making men\'s acne more difficult to treat, the real answer to WHY guys get acne is because males have more testosterone!

Read More Do I Have Male Hormonal Acne? How to REALLY Treat It 03-06-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 1 Comments What is Male Hormonal Acne? Teenagers aren\'t the only ones who get acne - it can can effect adult men of all ages. The average age of the acne sufferer in the US increased during the last decade from 20.5 to 26.5 years old. Are You a Statistic? Acne is a manifestation of internal imbalance that leads to overproduction of sebum (skin oil) by sebaceous glands. This extra sebum together with dead cells and dirt creates an ideal condition for bacteria what in turn will cause an inflammation that presents itself as ACNE (pimples, cysts, blackheads, whiteheads etc). Read More Who gets cystic acne? What is it and how to treat it 02-27-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 1 Comments Unfortunately, cystic acne can affect anyone. Cystic acne, or nodulocystic acne, is the most severe form of acne vulgaris. Deep, inflamed breakouts develop on the face and/or other areas of the body. The blemishes themselves can become large; some may measure up to several centimeters across. Although many people use the term ""cystic"" to describe any type of severely inflamed acne, only those who develop cysts truly have cystic acne. They feel like soft, fluid-filled lumps under the skin\'s surface. Cysts can be painful as they originate deeper in the skin than typical pimples and may also commonly produce scarring. Contrary to common belief, squeezing an acne cyst can cause an even deeper infection and more painful inflammation spreading under the surface of the skin which can last much longer and lead to the development of additional cysts. Read More What is Women Hormonal Acne? 02-26-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 1 Comments The term “hormonal acne” may be a misnomer since most acne can be traced back to fluctuations in hormone levels. A common misunderstanding is that men have testosterone and women have estrogen and progesterone; in reality, both genders have a balance of all 3. The primary culprit in the formation of acne relates to fluctuations in androgens (male hormones) and in particular testosterone, DHEAS (dihyroepiandrosterone sulfate) and DHT (dehydrotestosterone). An elevation in these hormones can lead to the overstimulation of the sebaceous glands, and as a result to an over-production of sebum (skin oil) and the onset of acne formation. Too much sebum together with dead skin cells and dirt eventually leads to clogged pores, and this provides an ideal condition for the growth of bacteria (propionibacterium acnes) which secrete chemicals into the skin that stimulate an inflammatory response. These inflammatory responses are pimples, cysts, blackheads and whiteheads. Read More Real Guys Don’t Have Acne - They have Razor Bumps Right? Wrong! Real Guys Have Acne too 01-31-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski, CEO of Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments More than 60 million adults in the US are diagnosed with acne, over 50% of adult women and 25% of adult men having this skin disease. The average age of an individual with acne problem is now, 26.5, while just 10 years ago it was 20.5. So what other myths prevent men from having clear skin? Acne is only for teens.

Read More Hormonal Acne 01-28-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments According to the American Academy of Dermatology , the unpleasant and sometimes painful skin breakouts of acne can affect 40 to 50 million Americans. Acne is most common in teenagers, but it can affect people regardless of age. Hormonal acne is practically acne caused by hormonal fluctuations. Acne can flare at any time, but people are particularly susceptible to it during certain phases of life, including, and perhaps most famously, during puberty and adolescence in general. Read More Female Hormonal Acne 12-23-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments As a general rule, women\'s hormones tend to fluctuate more than men\'s, which helps explain why acne in women tends to be less constant and more erratic than acne in men. More than half of all adult women experience at least occasional breakouts. Approximately 60-70% of women battle with acne experience premenstrual flare-ups. Acne can occur throughout a woman\'s adult life: in early adulthood, in the late twenties and thirties, during pregnancy, and during menopause. While female adult acne can be frustrating to deal with, it can be prevented and effectively treated. Read More Acne versus Cold Sores 12-16-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Sometimes people tend to confuse acne with cold sores. However, these are two different skin disorders. Even though, both skin conditions share certain common symptoms they have absolutely no similarity when it comes to causes and treatments. By closely observing the symptoms, you will be able to distinguish between the two conditions. However, when doubt remains, a visit to your dermatologist can lead to a proper diagnosis and a recommendation for appropriate treatment.

Unfortunately, this is incorrect. Learning about proper sun protection and sunscreens will keep you and your skin safe! In fact, the sun is healthy if you take precautions. Ultraviolet light from the sun comes in two main wavelengths: UVA and UVB. They are quite different in respect of the risk they create for your health.

The exposure to drastic temperature changes tends to dry out the skin. In some cases, these factors may trigger the production of dry skin cells, which clog pores and lead to breakouts.

Olszewski 0 Comments The holidays are a time where many indulge in sugary things. From the holiday parties to intimate gatherings, there is so much temptation that it can sometimes be hard to avoid. But do know this! Sugar REALLY is bad for your skin and may exacerbate acne as well. Many people wonder why they can\'t break the cycle of acne - and this is one major cause. Sugar is not just a part of cookies, candies, cakes or sodas, but it also can be found in almost every food in your refrigerator from mayo to Canadian bacon. The ingredient may not say ""sugar"", and be disguised as corn syrup (or a word that ends with ""syrup""), fructose, lactose (or a word that ends in ""ose""), fruit juice concentrate, sorbitol or xylitol. When you combine their rather overwhelming presence with foods that easily and rapidly convert into sugar like potatoes, pasta, crackers and potato chips, your skin can continually have issues.

Since my teens I have tried every topical acne treatment from benzoyl peroxide to pumpkin acid peels. I spent 15 years as a model and actress and learned every trick in the book for covering up my skin eruptions with makeup but there were times that the bumps and redness were such a distraction that it took a lot of effort from the make-up artists and photographers’ lighting to compensate for the issue. In my thirties I even resorted to a series of extremely painful photo facials with the promise that they would stop my acne and get rid of the scarring. Needless to say nothing has worked except being on birth control pills but birth control pills reeked havoc on my body. I went through volatile mood swings including depression, weight gain, and hypoglycemia from not eating because I had pseudo-morning sickness often, two small cysts in my breast and a uterine fibroid. After getting off the pill, the cysts went away and the fibroid has shrunk. I never ‘adjusted’ to the chemical hormones that altered my natural cycle.

Do NOT squeeze, pop, rub (vigorous exfoliation) the pimples - and do not let anyone do it for you! A very important role of skin is PROTECTION. When you break or injure this barrier, bacteria will hop in and create even more serious inflammation and infection. In addition, this is how acne scars and marks are made!

"['5 Back to School Acne Skincare Tips that Will Transform Your Look 08-27-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Going back to school means a lot of things-seeing old friends, making new ones, and unfortunately, homework. However, one thing that it shouldn\'t mean is a fear of acne breakouts. Thankfully, if you\'re smart and proactive about your skincare, there\'s no need to worry about pesky problems like that. Here are five tips to help ensure that your new school year is filled with clear skin and self-confidence. Start your anti-acne campaign early. If you want great skin by the time that school starts up, you need to begin taking care of it right now. Acne is not a condition that develops overnight, and similarly, it\'s not one that goes away quickly either. When dealing with it, you\'ve got to be patient and plan for the future, and that means getting started as soon as possible-some zit zapping cream the night before classes begin is just not going to cut it. Read More The Experts All Agree: There\'s No Quick Fix for Acne 08-22-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments There\'s no denying that waiting around for great things to happen is no fun. It would be much more gratifying if we could get the things we want at the moment we want them, but unfortunately that\'s just not how the world works. Treating acne is no different. People are constantly looking for ""a miracle cure"" that can give them clear skin overnight, but eventually they all learn that a product like that doesn\'t exist. Instead, the trick to beating acne once and for all isn\'t in a magic cream or potion -it comes down to having some good old fashioned patience and perseverance. Read More What Can Aloe Vera Really do for Acne? 08-14-2014 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The association between aloe vera and skincare is nothing new-people have been using it to treat everything from sunburns to eczema for centuries now. However, is this plant extract also a good addition for acne prone skin? The answer is a bit of a mixed bag. First and foremost, it\'s important to remember that aloe vera cannot really cure your acne on its own. The only solution for permanently stopping breakouts is addressing the problem at its root . However, that being said, aloe can work as a wonderful supplemental product for certain acne-related issues. In its pure form, it\'s a non-comedogenic moisturizer with anti- inflammatory properties. Read More 5 Tips for Resisting the Urge to Pop Your Pimples [...And Why You Shouldn\'t Pop!] 08-04-2014 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Large and small pimples are only one of acne\'s physical symptoms , but they are easily the most noticeable, discussed, and most hated. Because of this, people are normally willing to do whatever it takes to get rid of them as soon as possible without considering the long-term impact on their skin and without understanding that the superficial removal of a pimple is very far from treating acne. Short term, you may get rid of this ugly white head sticking out from your skin, but popping pimples can increase your risk of getting new and more severe pimples or cysts in the future as it actually opens ""a window"" for infection and may spread bacteria throughout your skin too. Furthermore popping pimples damages the skin tissue, and if this damage is deep enough it will lead to acne scars and marks.

If not, you\'re in luck! This article has been designed to provide you with everything you need to know about H2O-it covers drinking water to using water as a recreational activity and everything in between.

Thankfully, there are steps you can take to protect yourself and your skin during the dog days of summer. Don\'t let the heat get you down-use these tips to keep yourself safe from the sun. Try to Limit Sun Exposure During the Hottest Times of the Day If you\'re able to avoid sun exposure during the hottest times of the day, which are later afternoon in the summer, then by all means do so because you\'ll be missing out on both the heat and UV rays that can negatively impact your skin. Read More The Truth about Gluten and Acne 07-13-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Ten years ago, the average person would have never even heard of gluten; however, today it seems to be the one thing that people can\'t stop talking about! It also became a nutritional villain blamed for all sorts of health issues, and a marketing bonanza occurred within the food industry as a whole range of gluten-free products were born and brought to market to provide those who truly should avoid (and those who believe they should avoid) gluten rich products. So is this anti-gluten rally a step in the right direction to healthier living or yet another food fad? And more importantly, can eliminating gluten really help with acne breakouts? Read More Understanding the Link Between Dairy Products and Acne 07-01-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Even though food is not responsible for the underlying hormonal causes of acne , there are certain products that have the potential to exacerbate acne breakouts or prime your skin for new breakouts in the future. Dairy products are frequently cited as one of these ""problem foods"", which has caused many an acne sufferer to abandon some of their favorite dairy-based treats in the hopes that this dietary switch would make their acne problems finally go away for good. Read More Summer Treats and Sweets That Make Your Skin Happy 06-22-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Summer is officially here, and for most people that means eating lots of chilly treats to stay cool. However, when it comes to keeping your skin healthy and acne free, not all treats are created equal-many of our summertime favorites are loaded with excess sugar, which can lead to skin inflammation or glycation (a loss of skin elasticity and sheen due to collagen deterioration-collagen serves as the building blocks of the skin). If you\'re smart about it though, there are plenty of summer treat options out there that won\'t wreak havoc on your skin! It\'s all matter of finding foods which have many of the important vitamins and minerals for good skin health , and thankfully there are plenty out there. Keep in mind that simply eating healthy foods won\'t treat or reverse conditions like acne, which has more of a hormonal basis than a dietary one; however, these skin-friendly foods do a good job of supplementing treatments that do address conditions like acne directly . Read More How to Win the Battle with Cystic Acne and Prevent Acne Scars 06-17-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Acne pimples start to develop in pores that become clogged with excess sebum (skin oil) made by the sebaceous glands. How serious your acne problem is depends both on the length/persistence of acne breakouts over the years and how serious the inflammation is that manifests into different types of breakouts (from whiteheads to serious cysts and lesions). If you suffer from acne for two or more years, you have chronic acne. The most serious form of acne is cystic acne that forms when the pores become clogged with sebum mixed with dead skins cells that normally rise to the surface of the skin to be sloughed off and get trapped in the pore. Bacteria also get trapped in this mix and as the body attempts to kill the bacteria using its immune system, you get a local inflammatory response due to cytokines, chemokines and white blood cells entering the area. Normally the pore is encased by the cells in the lower layers of the skin, but in the case of cysts this inflammation spreads under the top layer of the skin. This influx of cells and proteins causes swelling (bumps under the skin) and can be both very painful and very harmful to your skin. Read More Why You Need a Personalized Treatment for Your Acne 06-04-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski and Dr. James P. Gilligan 0 Comments When we discuss a sickness or disease, many times we are actually describing the symptoms, not the disease. Science and medicine have made progress in better understanding the underlying causes of diseases and therefore allowing physicians to tailor the treatment that is the best for a particular individual. Furthermore, researchers are continually developing more precise medications with a goal of increased efficacy and less adverse side effects. The birth of personalized medicine came about because of the Human Genome project that was completed in 2003 and for the first time in human history provided a detailed ""genetic map"" for mankind. This map is helping to explain why some individuals respond to a particular drug or treatment while others do not and also allows us to actually focus on individual needs for treatment rather than a traditional ""mass approach.""

Even if you only ever use the towel on freshly cleaned skin, there\'s a chance your skin isn\'t 100% free of bacteria. Any residual bacteria can transfer to the towel, and if you use that towel again you\'re putting it right back on your face. The point is, if you want to keep your face as clean as possible, and thus your skin as clear as possible, err on the side of safety and use a fresh towel every time.

"[""5 Step Fall Skincare Routine for Acne Prone Skin 10-06-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Even though we still have some time before moving our clocks back (on November 2!) for the Fall, we want to help make sure you don't fall short on your skincare regimen. After a Summer spent in the sun sweating and applying lots of sunscreen, our pores get clogged more than usual, our skin can look dull and dry, hyperpigmentation is more profound, and pimples, blackheads and whiteheads may become more aggressive. In addition, the change in our daily routine with back-to-school and back-to-work stress makes acne breakouts even less tolerable while often more frequent. Here are some of our best-kept secrets on how to have a smooth transition between Summer and Fall in order to keep those frustrating breakouts far away. 1. Change your cleaning routine Fall is a time when we advise to switch skin cleansers. For the majority of us, our skin gets oilier in the summer due to the heat and humidity. As such, a deeper cleansing product is often used. When the Fall and cooler temperatures arrive, you need a gentler cleanser. Look for a non-soap cleanser, which removes dirt, but doesn't strip away natural oils. You can then support the skin with a gentle non-alcoholic astringent, like our chamomile astringent. Chamomile has anti-inflammatory and anti-bacteria properties. When applied topically, chamomile can help reduce inflammation associated with acne, razor bumps or irritation. Chamomile Astringent How to use: You can make your own chamomile astringent by taking 3-4 chamomile tea bags (or 2 handfuls of the dry plant) and brewing it into a very strong tea. When cooled, splash or use on a cotton pad all over your face twice a day. Keep the leftovers in the refrigerator, but use or discard in two days. Do twice daily, and follow up with moisturizing. 2. Exfoliating Exfoliating is great to remove the outer layer of dull, dry skin and to unclog pores and help even the skin color. There are some general guidelines that you should adhere to when choosing exfoliators. Do not use harsh and abrasive exfoliators, as you will force your skin to produce more oil and in addition- by creating mini nicks- actually cause more infection and inflammation. Use mild, natural exfoliating ingredients. Exfoliate no more than twice a week with 3-4 days in between Try our oatmeal exfoliating mask as an effective natural exfoliator. This mask has been used for years because it cleans and tones the skin. Here's a variation of the basic oatmeal mask that has lavender in it for an aromatherapy effect. Oatmeal Exfoliating Mask Ingredients 2 tablespoons of dried lavender (available at floral shops or natural food stores) 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt (lactic acid will gently exfoliate and lighten the skin) 2 tablespoons of oat (natural, not instants; steel cut, finely chopped or grounded coarsely in the blander) Instructions Mix well with a fork or spoon or on the LOWEST speed in a blender until smooth. Spread on the face and neck. Lie down and relax. Keep on for 20 minutes. Wash gently with luke warm water. 3. Moisturize and Revitalize Use a non-comedogenic moisturizer on your face and body twice a day. Contrary to what you may think, all acne prone skin, needs moisturizing so the dry flakes don't add to clogging pores. It is essential that you replenish your skin after sun and wind exposure as well. Cabbage is rich in vitamins and minerals. Its deep cleansing, anti-inflammatory and cooling action makes it a valuable mask for acne sufferers. This mask can be used on all skin types, and should be done on a day when you don't do the exfoliation mask. Fresh Cabbage Rejuvenation Mask Ingredients 1/4 small green cabbage 1 large carrot juiced or 2 tablespoons fresh carrot juice 1/2 lemon 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons of green clay powder (available inexpensively on Amazon) Instructions Throw away the outer leaves of the cabbage. Rinse and chop the remainder of the cabbage. Combine the cabbage, carrot juice, one teaspoon of lemon juice and the olive oil in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Mix together three tablespoons of the puree with the clay powder. Use the cabbage mask once a week after cleansing, not on the day when you do the exfoliation mask. Masks are best made and used on the same day; they don't have a good shelf life. To apply the mask Find a calm time when you are not rushed. Protect your hair with a towel or band and remove all makeup. Cleanse the skin with water. Steam your face for 1-2 minutes to open the pores (to do this, put hot water in a bowl, put a towel over your head and put your face over the bowl - be careful not to get too close, you don't want you to burn yourself!) Apply the mask evenly (avoiding the eyes) and leave it on for around 20 minutes. If the mask has more of a liquid consistency, apply using a cotton ball. A second layer can be applied after a few minutes. Lie down and relax - no talking! Keep your face relaxed! Wet the mask to soften the clay first, and then remove the mask with cotton pads or a cotton towel and luke-warm water. Then dry. Close the pores using the chamomile astringent. 4. Control Stress Stress comes in different guises, yet our bodies respond to stress in the same way. Adrenaline is the number one stress hormone; it speeds up the heart beat, breathing and metabolic rate to give us a necessary rush of extra energy. Adrenaline is produced and stored in our two adrenal glands that are situated on top of the kidneys and with long-term stress these glands will deplete. Adrenaline moves, motivates and energizes. Unfortunately over stressing our system releases excess stress related hormones, enzymes and other chemicals that result in leaving our bodies anxious, our muscles tense and our sebaceous glands over stimulated as well. The result of this? More acne breakouts. Here are some of our favorite ideas to control stress: Try fitting in Yoga, Pilates or Qigong into your fitness schedule - we know you're extremely busy, but if you can't make it to the gym, fit it in at night by watching a workout video at home. In order to help support and relieve anxiety and stress, there are many available plant relaxants. These herbs can be taken as tinctures, pills, infusions and decoctions. When taken regularly, they can help to calm and help deal with a stressful lifestyle and support the nervous system. The following herbs are used for stress, chamomile, skullcap, vervain, wild oats, St John's Wort, limeflowers and lavender. Herbal Infusion for Stress Ingredients 1 tablespoon dried lime flowers 1 tablespoon dried chamomile 1 tablespoon dried vervain Instructions Add the dried herbs to 2 cups of boiling water in a warmed pot with a lid. Leave to infuse for 10-15 minutes and then strain. Drink warm throughout the day. 5. Prevent acne from coming Remember that THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP to really get rid of acne is to stop the acne cycle by removing causes of acne (over secretion of sebaceous glands). This can be done only from the inside out (topical agents cannot influence sebaceous glands) by helping the body to manage factors (ex. hormonal imbalance) that may over-stimulate the sebaceous glands.

"['3 Trends in Acne Skincare to Watch Out For 11-09-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments There have never been more ways pretending to treat breakouts than right now. While these abundance of choices may look great for acne sufferers at least at first glance, not all of them are effective or even safe. Here are three increasingly popular trends that are making their mark in the world of skincare that we need to take a closer look at as for their real impact on treating acne (or their efficacy) and their safety profile. The Diet Approach For a long time, acne treatment was all about addressing the problem from the outside with things like creams and cleansers. While topical acne treatments are no doubt still popular, many people are beginning to see that what we put into our bodies is just as important as what we put on them. Take sugar, for example. Studies have shown that frequently eating high-sugar foods can cause skin inflammation that makes you more prone to acne breakouts. For this reason, dietary approaches to preventing breakouts have become increasingly important in the world of skincare. It\'s true that the foods we eat can have an impact on our skin\'s health. Yet, wildly specialized diets that require you to eat certain foods in certain quantities at certain times may not only be ineffective to really address the causes of acne (an overstimulation of sebaceous glands and over production of skin oil (sebum)) but also unnecessarily tedious and often unhealthy as they can limit your access to necessary nutrients such as calcium, vitamin D, fiber etc. For most people, simply eating a balanced diet recommended for overall health will do the trick. As long as you keep your calories in check, include lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, and take precautions to avoid excess sugar, and fried, over spicy dishes, this should be enough to promote healthy, resilient skin that isn\'t prone to breakouts. Milk and/or dairy have also been under the microscope as of late as something that could contribute to breakouts. If you think dairy could be contributing to your acne issues, take these next steps . The Medication Approach Acne treatment is no longer just about over-the-counter products. There are now powerful creams and pills that can only be prescribed by a doctor. Even though these treatment options can show visible improvement in your acne symptoms, there is a lot of controversy surrounding them. Prescription-grade products are usually very potent and have serious and unpleasant side effects (ex. Accutane, the oral contraceptive Diane-35, retinoids). We need to realize that our desire for quick fixes must be tamed by the need for a balance between a quick fix that may lead to a larger problem in the future or a more natural and safe solution to acne. There\'s no doubt that some severe forms of acne may require medical intervention and that the elimination of breakouts may still, for some, be worth the side effects. However, these products should be used with ""open eyes,"" and hopefully as an absolute last resort. The Supplement Approach Similarly to dietary treatments, addressing breakouts with supplements focuses on trying to address the internal causes of acne. However, this approach should not be confused with taking powerful and sometimes troublesome acne medications. As you already know, they are made of synthetic chemicals that may cause a whole host of potentially serious side effects. Treating breakouts with supplements may seem as a gentler and more natural way to treat acne if of course they do not include phytoestrogens or an overdose of vitamin A, E or B-Complex that can also have an adverse, cumulative effect. Also, do you know if these treatments have been tested for efficacy and safety? For example, AcnEase® is a new breed of natural medicine with a safe blend of natural ingredients that addresses the underlying imbalance of sebaceous glands that may lead to acne. As this imbalance is often created by the presence of too much androgen in the blood that can over stimulate the sebaceous glands and cause them to overproduce skin oil, AcnEase will not affect or change the hormones and is therefore suitable for both women and men of all ages (from teenagers to adults). It has been tested for efficacy and safety, and helps minimize the interaction between your hormones and your skin by using a proven mixture of herbs, plants and other natural ingredients that don\'t come with any nasty side effects. As you\'re making a decision, just keep your eyes open, ask questions and make sure that your choice includes something that will not do more harm than good to your body.

"['Say Goodbye to Acne Scars Naturally: Part I 09-20-2012 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments ""An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure."" The first step in getting rid of acne scars and marks is to let the skin heal itself while new breakouts are prevented. Acne marks and scars are a result of deep lesions and repeated breakouts and can be prevented if acne symptoms are eliminated. What to do about those persistent acne scars? Persistent cysts and lesions that effect adult acne sufferers often leave behind long lasting marks in the form of acne scars, which represent post-inflammatory changes in the skin that are not easily reversed. Depending on the method you choose, acne scar treatment can be quite costly and occasionally even discomforting or painful. The most common ""dermatological"" procedures recognized for eliminating acne scars are: Dermabrasion: At about $1,500 (or more) per treatment, the surgeons remove the top layers of skin with an electrical machine that abrades the skin. Repeated treatments are often necessary especially if new acne formation is not prevented. Chemical peels: For $750 (or more) per treatment, doctors remove the top layers of skin with a chemical application. Often, this treatment must be repeated several times for satisfactory results. Again, if new acne outbreaks are not prevented, peels may not only fail to bring satisfactory results, but may not be permitted during times of acne flare-ups. Collagen: Doctors make injections beneath the skin to replace the body\'s natural collagen that has been lost. This can be done with collagen or fat taken from another part of the body. The cost is $300-700 (or more) per cubic centimeter for collagen. Results are temporary, so it must be repeated. New acne scars will require new injections. Laser resurfacing: High-energy light burns away damaged skin at $3,000 (or more) per treatment. Repeated treatments are sometimes necessary. New acne may produce new scars requiring additional treatments. Punch grafts: Small skin grafts replace scarred skin. Doctors punch a hole in the skin to remove the scar, which is then replaced with unscarred skin. Each punch costs about $50 (or more) depending on the doctor. Multiple punches are usually necessary. The KEY to PREVENTING ACNE SCARS and HEALING the existing scars is PREVENTION that stops new acne from forming. AcnEase® offers an effective remedy for acne scars, since it offers PREVENTION.

"[""Back Acne Sufferer? What You MUST Avoid. 10-03-2012 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Internal imbalances make your sebaceous glands work over time, which leads to the overproduction of sebum (oil), in turn, clogging pores. Sebum, dead cells and dirt attracts bacteria, leading to inflammation, resulting in the formation of pimples and even cysts. With that said, you need to take some important steps not to exasperate this tough to treat acne. What YOU NEED to AVOID if you have back acne. Don't Scrub Your Back: Keep clean, but don't scrub the skin on your back. Scrubbing may actually break the skin barrier, creating an open door for bacteria, and can actually stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce even more sebum, which is the opposite of what you want! Use warm (not hot) water and mild soap instead of anti-perspiration or drying soaps. After a shower, dry your back with a patting movement (not a vigorous rub). Then, you can apply a non-oily moisturizer. Tight shirts: If your skin cannot breath, you create a breeding ground for bacteria. Wear looser fit-shirts made with breathable fabrics like cotton or linen, especially when you're exercising. Astringents: DO NOT USE harsh astringents. They will strip your skin of the good oil. Instead, try a natural astringent such as witch hazel. Dab it on a Q-tip over the small affected areas (not over the entire back). So how do I get rid of my back acne? Since skin on the back is thicker than anywhere else on the body, back acne treatment requires more time, and a disciplined regimen to see improvement. Target the internal imbalances responsible for back acne. AcnEase® is more than just a treatment, it's a way to prevent new back acne from forming. Join the hundreds of thousands of acne sufferers in getting rid of your acne for good with an all-botanical, safe, effective acne solution. GET RID OF YOUR BACK ACNE NOW!

"[""Summer Series #4: Is Your Acne Medication Harmful in the Summer? 10-18-2012 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments As an acne sufferer, you know that many medications have sun restrictions. But avoiding the sun in the summer is like waving a big delicious candy bar in front of a child's (or, let's admit, an adult's) face and telling them they can't eat it. Being on an acne medication during the summer with this type of restriction can cause sunburn/sun damage (sometimes irreversible), irritation and dryness; all of which can make your acne problem worse.

"[""How do I get rid of my blackheads and whiteheads? 08-14-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Whiteheads and blackheads are known as comedones, and are a certain type of acne. They are both filled with sebum and dead skin cells, creating the ideal playground for bacteria to grow. The difference between the two is the oxidation of melanin (which gives the follicle a black or white color); the blackheads have a larger opening so the air makes the melanin oxidize, turning black and the whiteheads don't have a large opening, so the air access is limited, making the melanin white. As popping the whiteheads and blackheads is highly NOT recommended, and may lead to infection and acne scars, the only practical way to deal with whiteheads and blackheads is PREVENTION. Prevention in this case means using an efficient acne treatment that actually helps to regulate the sebum secretion and a consistent, effective cleaning method . Properly clean your face twice daily, and remember the 3 following things : 1 - Don't scrub your face. This creates more oil, and may also cause abrasions that allow bacteria to access deeper layers of the skin, which is exactly what you don't want 2 - No picking or popping! This allows more bacteria to enter, creating a vicious inflammation cycle; it also destroys tissue 3 - If you use makeup , use a non-comedogenic product and always wash it off properly at night In addition to treating and preventing your acne with the right treatment and cleaning method, you can use this comedone fighting skin mask , which helps to dissolve the sebum accumulated in your skin pores. It can be used twice a week. Do not use if you have open cysts. Comedone Fighting Skin Mask Ingredients 1 egg white 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons high quality extra virgin olive oil (or olive nectar) 1 small peeled papaya or 2 thick slices of a large peeled papaya ½ teaspoon of baking soda Instructions Mix all ingredients in a blender on a low speed until creamy. Massage on a clean face with your fingers in circular motion with moderate (not high) pressure for about 30 seconds. Leave on for twenty minutes, and then rinse with lukewarm water.

"[""Herbal Acne Treatments 12-02-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Acne is a prevalent skin disorder affecting nearly 17 million people. Over-production of oil plugs pores and causes pimples. It is common to see acne on the face, back, shoulders, arms and chest. Effective over-the-counter treatments are numerous, but many can cause adverse side effects, such as dryness, redness and itching. Herbal treatments can be as effective as the commercial products, but may cause fewer side effects. There are several reasons why herbal acne treatments are effective. In general, this kind of natural acne treatment uses the purest ingredients extracted from various plants to cure the problem at its very source. Herbal treatments are made with natural elements that have been proven by experts over centuries to heal skin problems like acne and help in promoting a healthy clear complexion. Furthermore, each type of herbal acne treatment has its own specific reason why it gives effective changes. First, herbal capsules have safe and natural ingredients that target the inner source of acne and subsequently take away the said cause. In addition, these capsules work to promote a clear skin tone from the inside. This type of natural acne medication is taken orally for several weeks in order for it to show full results. Second, herbal cleansers take away debris, dirt, and excess oils acquired from daily outdoor and indoor activities. They provide relief from painful inflammation caused by acne and retain the softness and smoothness of skin. Aside from these, herbal cleansers prevent causative organisms from building up. This kind of treatment is used with warm water as a daily facial wash which can be done once or twice a day. The third type of herbal treatment is the topical gel. It has healing nutrients that penetrate skin and it provides antibacterial activity that quells organisms that initiate the appearance of acne. Herbal gels also reduce swelling, scarring, and redness by modulating the inflammatory reaction of the skin. This topical medication can be applied sparingly on the thoroughly dried skin after the facial wash. AcnEase combines Western Medicine with the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine to create a natural and safe solution for acne treatment. Made from natural ingredients, AcnEase works to overcome the imbalances within your body that cause acne. AcnEase has been proven to be safe to use with no reported side effects. AcnEase not only treats your current acne outbreak, but also prevents new acne from reappearing.

"['Menopausal Acne and Treatments 12-09-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments About Menopausal Acne Hot flashes, night sweats, and weight gain are all common symptoms of menopause. Acne can also occur among menopausal women as well. No matter what age you are, when you go through a hormonal change, the hormonal imbalance will result in acne. According to the American Academy of Dermatology , women in menopause are most likely to spot acne blemishes near their chin, jaw, and mouth, but pimples can also appear on the chest and back. The reasons behind menopause acne are quite similar to the reasons behind adolescent acne. Both menopause and adolescence are times when our hormones are working overtime. At the onset of menopause, or more accurately, the phase that leads into it, called preimenopause, levels of the female hormones, including estrogen, drop. But androgen levels, the male sex hormones that each woman has as well, remain constant. This situation in effect causes the body to experience a relative increase in the effect of these ""male"" hormones . During menopause, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone and DHEA levels tend to fluctuate wildly. This hormonal \'roller coaster\' is responsible for emotional fluctuations and other common menopause symptoms, and it can also trigger skin problems and nasty breakouts. Some women, on the other hand, do not experience menopause acne until they begin hormone replacement therapy. The purpose of such therapy is to balance the hormones, yet it sometimes has the unintended side effect of causing acne when it wasn’t present before. Menopausal Acne Treatment and Prevention There are many ways to successfully treat menopause acne that can safely be used during hormone treatment. You may find relief with nutritional supplements, dietary changes and topical products. If you are currently using synthetic hormone replacement therapy, you might wish to speak with your doctor or nurse practitioner about trying bioidentical hormones as an alternative. Menopausal acne can also be helped with herbs and other natural remedies. Diet, herbs, supplements and topical applications can treat menopause acne. Maintaining a good self-care regimen is necessary for skin health throughout your life, but it is especially important for women experiencing the dual challenges of delicate skin and breakouts during menopause. Washing your face twice a day can help reduce acne. You should choose a face wash that your skin doesn\'t react to. When selecting a facial cleanser, you should ensure your face does not become red or irritated; if it does, choose another brand of face wash. Do not scrub your face with a washcloth, for it will make your acne peel and possibly scar. Monitoring what you eat can also help treat and minimize menopausal acne. Increase your daily water intake to 8 to 10 glasses of water per day. Eat healthy foods and avoid food with rancid fats (almost any processed food). Try to cut out as much sugar as you possibly can, and eat more whole grains, fiber rich food and vegetables. Add supplements to your diet such as vitamins and minerals that combat excess oil, specifically vitamins B and C which help with oily skin and acne. Herbs that help balance your hormones may help. Made from natural ingredients, AcnEase has been proven to be safe and effective among women with menopausal acne further supporting the products ability to regulate hormonal imbalance and emotional fluctuations. Additionally, AcnEase was also developed to correct bodily imbalance among older individuals. AcnEase addresses the underlying causes of menopausal acne as well as preventing future outbursts, thus allowing the skin to clear and to begin a healing process for skin scars and acne marks. It doesn’t matter if you have a severe or a mild case of acne during menopause. The acne will most likely clear up as soon as your hormone levels and menopause symptoms return to normal. Menopausal acne is not serious in most cases, and is a temporary issue that can be controlled with a little extra care and attention.

"[""Pineapple: A Miracle Fruit to Help with Acne, Acne Marks and Acne Scars 08-07-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments It is beautiful, decorative and very tasty...but can pineapple really help with acne breakouts, minimize acne scars and heal bruising left by larger acne cysts? Lets explore this amazing fruit and its many healing qualities. The Powerful Enzymes and Vitamins in Pineapple Pineapple acts as an exfoliating agent and unclogs acne pores. Exfoliating naturally speeds up the production of new cells and this is also the same process that rejuvenates the skin. The enzymes found in pineapple fight damage from free radicals and also cleanse the skin by gradually dissolving the whiteheads, blackheads and dead cells on the skins surface. This also unclogs the skin and prevents buildup that invites bacteria, which begins the acne cascade. Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapple that speeds the healing process by helping the body eliminate metabolic waste from injuries. Acne cysts and larger postulates or pimples, leave behind skin injuries known as acne scars or marks. Bromelain can help them heal faster and rebuild the skin by stimulating collagen production and bonding to the underlying collagen fibers. You can reap the many benefits of pineapple by eating the flesh, drinking the juice or by incorporating a bromelain supplement into your diet, which will provide more standardized benefits for your skin. Vitamin C has numerous healing qualities. Applying vitamin C to the skin may have a beneficial effect due to its antioxidant properties. Correctly formulated vitamin C creams may protect against the aging effects of sunlight and also reduce wrinkles. There is an abundance of vitamin C in fresh pineapple. Its antioxidant activity may help protect your body from free radical damage and also speed up the rebuilding of damaged skin cells from acne marks and scars which lead to visible signs of aging. Try drinking an 8-ounce serving of fresh pineapple juice daily while ALSO using it as a topical treatment. It may work even better! Pineapple Mask to Fade Acne Scars A mask of pineapple puree can be made in a blender and applied to acne scars and marks 3 times a week. Apply the pineapple puree directly to the affected areas and leave it on for 15 minutes. Wash off. The enzyme activity on the skin will help fade acne marks while stimulating collagen production to make acne scars appear less deep and less noticeable. As an added benefit, the ascorbic acid in pineapples will fade current blemishes. Please note: If you feel a burning sensation, wash the pineapple mask off. This occurs because your skin is not accustomed to the enzymes in the pineapple and it may take a few times before your skin is ready for a natural remedy. Wait a few days and try again. The Truth About Acne Scars and Marks Acne marks are more noticeable on bare skin because they appear darker, and are merely a skin color issue. Acne scars are not as obvious unless you look at them directly or have severely deep scarring, and this is a skin texture issue. Acne scars are usually permanent. Topical creams and lotion do little to treat acne scars, so exercise caution when selecting products based on those claims. Acne scars never disappear completely however their appearance can be minimized by invasive facial procedures such as laser or dermabrasion. Silicone micro droplet injections can also help improve the appearance of indented scars. Keep in mind that results vary and even aggressive and expensive scar treatments do not offer guaranteed results. Acne marks represent post-acne hyper-pigmentation. They are flat red or brown dots left behind by pimples. They tend to give skin a blotchy look. Acne marks fade, but it can take several months. How to Prevent Acne Scars and Marks The ONLY real alternative to avoid acne marks and scars is TO PREVENT ACNE. By doing so, you prevent the damage in the first place. AcnEase® does exactly this by mitigating the impact your hormonal imbalance has on the production of sebum. Hormonal imbalance is the most prevailing reason behind the over-stimulation of the sebaceous glands. This excess sebum, together with dead skin cells and dirt, provides a home for acne bacteria and fertile grounds for inflammation –the begging of the acne cycle. AcnEase ® has demonstrated clinical efficacy for treating acne, preventing new acne from forming and making red spots and scars less visible. In addition, AcnEase ® improves the quality and health of skin in both males and females, yet another reason it is recommended as an alternative to expensive medical treatments. So tell us what you think in the comments. Is it hard to believe that something found in your kitchen like pineapple can actually have such a strong effect on your acne prone skin? Just remember, we’re not saying that if you try these tips, within a week or so you’ll be free of acne. Use these tips for a while, atleast a few months, in conjunction with a treatment like AcnEase.

"[""Is Gluten Bad For Acne 08-20-2012 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments A hot topic in the news lately has been whether or not gluten is a cause of acne. We're here to set the record straight. For those that do not have a gluten allergy called celiac disease, or gluten sensitivity, products containing gluten will NOT exasperate their acne problem. Remember, diet does not cause acne, but exacerbates it. To keep your body andskin healthy, a diet rich in probiotic bacteria and low in processedfoods (including sugar and saturated fats) is your skin's friend, andacne's enemy.

"[""Is Thyme Good for Acne? 08-20-2012 Dr. Agnes Olszewski 0 Comments We are always on the look-out for the latest natural and practical solutions to get clear and healthy skin. As we get smarter about herbs and foods that may improve our skin (andthose that may be bad for it), we need to treat news headlines with agrain of salt. Thyme - a popular herb found in gardens, stores and traditional medicinalproducts and experimentally known for its anti-inflammatory andanti-bacterial properties - made recent headlines as a possible acnetreatment. Researchers from Leeds Metropolitan University in the U.K.steeped thyme, marigold, and myrrh in alcohol to make what's called atincture, and then tested them on the bacteria that cause acnebreak-downs. They all had greater antibacterial effect after fiveminutes compared to those exposed to plain alcohol, but thyme was themost potent. In fact, the thyme tincture was more powerful than standard concentrations of benzyl peroxide, which is the active ingredient in many acneproducts. The new findings were presented at the Society for GeneralMicrobiology's Spring Conference in Dublin. Does this mean we should immediately run out to the nearest grocery store to buy ingredients to make thyme tincture? The ANSWER is NO. It is true that treatments containing benzoyl peroxide may have beenassociated with such side effects as a burning sensation, skinirritation and even premature aging, and thyme preparation may be lessharsh on the skin. Neither one of them however addresses the real causeof acne, which is overactive sebaceous glands that can ONLY be balancedfrom the inside. So, if we are one day to use thyme as an acne weapon it will be as an adjunct therapy, not a primary one. In addition, like with many other non-standardized treatments, there is no reliable data yet on how much thyme one should use, and how often andhow this tincture should be prepared. For now, unless you want to askthe compounding pharmacist to develop thyme based tincture especiallyfor you and to check for yourself if it is a friend or a foe, save thyme for cooking and look into standardized botanical medicinal products tosolve your acne problem.

"['Do You Know What Type of Acne You Have so that You Can Treat it the Right Way? 05-13-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments It\'s time for a reality check: You might think you know what kind of acne you have, but you might be wrong. Let\'s see if you\'ll be able to tell.... QUIZ TIME! You\'ve had acne for multiple years and you really only get breakouts a couple times a year. Should you treat it as mild or moderate acne? The right answer? Moderate! How did we make that determination? Here\'s a general formula to use: - If you\'ve had acne chronically between 1-3+ years, you should approach your acne as being moderate even if you get 1- 3 breakouts/year. Determining what kind of acne you have is difficult for many reasons. There\'s a lot of false information out there, and some of it might even be coming from those close to you--even from yourself. Why is it important to know exactly what kind of acne you have? So that you can treat it the right way, of course! If you\'re trying to treat severe acne with a mild acne treatment, you\'ll be sorely disappointed. And you don\'t want to waste your money by treating your mild acne with a severe acne treatment. So put your thinking cap on, take a look in the mirror, and use this guide to help you determine what type of acne you have: Mild acne : You have a small number of small pimples that usually appear periodically on the face and forehead. For you we recommend taking AcnEase Mild Acne Treatment for a minimum of one month. Moderate acne : You have numerous and/or frequent inflamed pimples that cover larger areas of the face and forehead, and are generally more persistent. For you we recommend taking AcnEase Moderate Acne Treatment for a minimum of one month. Severe acne : You have larger pimples and some cysts, many inflamed, covering larger areas of the face, and it is persistent and chronic. For you we recommend taking AcnEase Severe Acne Treatment for a minimum of two months. You may need to take it for three months to get your desired results. Body acne : You have pimples and/or cysts on the back and/or neck, shoulders and buttocks. For you we recommend AcnEase Body Acne for Athletes Treatment for a minimum of 6 weeks, but realize that you may need to take it longer. Body and face acne : You have pimples on the face, chest and/or back, neck, shoulders, buttocks. For you we recommend AcnEase Body Acne Treatment for a minimum of 6 weeks. Chronic Acne : The longer you suffer from acne, the longer the treatment needed to clear your skin for good. Miracle overnight ""cures"" do not exist. So be patient, and your skin will become healthy and clear again. Chronic mild acne : You have suffered for 2 or more years with mild acne. For you we recommend AcnEase Moderate Acne Treatment for a minimum of two (2) months. You may need to take it for three months to get your desired results. Chronic moderate & severe acne : You have suffered with acne for 2 or more years. For you we recommend AcnEase Severe Acne Treatment for a minimum of three (3) months. You may need to take it for three months to get your desired results. Athletes body or body & face acne : You are an athlete who suffers from pimples and/or cysts on the face, chest and/or back, neck, shoulders and buttocks. For those who exercise more than 6 times a week and/or those who weigh 175 lbs or more and have moderate or severe body or body and face acne, we recommend AcnEase Body Acne for Athletes Treatment for a minimum of 6 weeks, but realize that you may need to take it longer especially if you have chronic and/or severe acne. Your AcnEase® treatment will also depend on whether you are male or female because male acne tends to be more persistent and therefore more difficult to treat since testosterone is a strong stimulator of the sebaceous glands and is responsible for their overproduction of skin oil. But you don\'t have to figure this out all on your own--try our simple 3-step system to help you figure out exactly which treatment you need.

"[""Summer Treats and Sweets That Make Your Skin Happy 06-22-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Summer is officially here, and for most people that means eating lots of chilly treats to stay cool. However, when it comes to keeping your skin healthy and acne free, not all treats are created equal-many of our summertime favorites are loaded with excess sugar, which can lead to skin inflammation or glycation (a loss of skin elasticity and sheen due to collagen deterioration-collagen serves as the building blocks of the skin). If you're smart about it though, there are plenty of summer treat options out there that won't wreak havoc on your skin! It's all matter of finding foods which have many of the important vitamins and minerals for good skin health , and thankfully there are plenty out there. Keep in mind that simply eating healthy foods won't treat or reverse conditions like acne, which has more of a hormonal basis than a dietary one; however, these skin-friendly foods do a good job of supplementing treatments that do address conditions like acne directly . Below, we give you three summertime treats that will both satisfy your craving for something tasty and cool and keep your skin healthy and glowing. From a lazy day at the pool to a vacation in a far-off destination and everything in between, these snacks will satisfy without doing a number on your skin! Tri-Berry Smoothie Ingredients - use organic, when possible 1 cup mixture of blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries Splash of water or fruit juice (100%, natural and unsweetened) Fresh mint spring (optional) Blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries are three fruits you should be very familiar with if you're looking for skin-conscious food options, and that's why this tasty smoothie recipe contains all of them! These berries are lower in sugar than most other fruits and contain high levels of antioxidants-the free radical-fighting substances that help prevent the oxidation of cells that can lead to aging, sagging skin. In particular, these berries are high in vitamin A, vitamin C, and flavonoids. This recipe is super simple to create-the only equipment you'll need is a blender. It's important that you use only fresh or frozen berries, since canned fruit is often high in refined sugar. Thankfully, most grocery stories have frozen berries year round if fresh ones aren't available. In a blender, mix together the blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries with ice and a splash of water or fruit juice. Blend until all the ingredients are mixed well. If you're not getting the consistency you want, continue to add water or juice little by little. For an extra kick, consider adding a sprig of fresh mint into the mix-it's full of antioxidants as well! Chocolate-Kiwi Pops Ingredients - use organic, when possible 2-3 whole kiwis 1-cup shredded dark chocolate or chocolate chips (Non-GMO) ½ cup coconut oil (unrefined, expeller pressed, if possible) You may not think of chocolate as a food that would be good for your skin, but if you go for the right kind (i.e. dark chocolate) it can be a welcome addition to any skin-conscious diet. Dark chocolate is lower in sugar than other varieties but is just as tasty, and it's full of flavonoids as well. When shopping for dark chocolate, make sure to go for a brand that is at least 70% cocoa (the higher the better!)-that's the level where you start to find a significant amount of antioxidants. Coconut oil has long been used as a way to maintain healthy skin, and we've even looked at its benefits in the past. Kiwi is a great source of both vitamin C and vitamin E-two other important antioxidants. However, kiwi is a bit higher in sugar than the fruit in our tri-berry smoothie, so make sure to only enjoy this snack in moderation. For chocolate-kiwi pops you'll need popsicle sticks as well as a double boiler for melting the chocolate. If you don't have access to one, putting a small sauce pan inside of a larger pan filled with water will work as well. First, you'll need to prepare the kiwi by slicing it into portions that are roughly one inch thick. Once the kiwi has been sliced, remove the skin from around the edges of your portions. Insert the popsicle sticks into the kiwi and place them in the freezer. Melt your dark chocolate in the double boiler and add the coconut oil. Allow the mixture to return to room temperature, and then begin dipping the frozen kiwi into the chocolate. Return the dipped pops to the freezer until the chocolate has completely hardened around the kiwi. Then enjoy! Fresh Guacamole* Ingredients - use organic, when possible 2 whole avocados 1 medium tomato 1 small onion Cilantro, to taste Dash of lemon juice Not only are avocados full of heart-healthy fats that help promote clear, healthy skin but they're also chock full of vitamins A and C-which we've already discussed as powerful antioxidants. Tomatoes are similarly high in vitamins A and C, and even onions, smelly as they are, provide you with skin-protecting antioxidants as well! With fresh guacamole you really hit the skin care jackpot. In a mixing bowl, scoop out the flesh of the avocados with a spoon and combine with a finely chopped tomato and onion. Add cilantro sprigs to taste and sprinkle the lemon juice on top to keep the avocado from turning brown. Place the mixture in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours to maximize the flavors of the guacamole. Guacamole is perfect served with chips by itself or as a condiment for Mexican-inspired cuisine! * Avocado contains ingredients that have blood thinning properties, so if you have blood problems or use aspirin, or blood thinners of any kind, eat avocado and foods made with it in small quantities and not too frequently. It is also good idea to consult your physician.

"['The Truth about Gluten and Acne 07-13-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Ten years ago, the average person would have never even heard of gluten; however, today it seems to be the one thing that people can\'t stop talking about! It also became a nutritional villain blamed for all sorts of health issues, and a marketing bonanza occurred within the food industry as a whole range of gluten-free products were born and brought to market to provide those who truly should avoid (and those who believe they should avoid) gluten rich products. So is this anti-gluten rally a step in the right direction to healthier living or yet another food fad? And more importantly, can eliminating gluten really help with acne breakouts? What Is Gluten Exactly? For a subject that is so widely talked about, many people still woefully misunderstand gluten. In a nutshell, gluten is a substance found in wheat, rye, and barley that act as a sort of ""glue""- it\'s what gives dough its elastic, sticky texture. More scientifically, it\'s a combination of two proteins (gliadin and glutelin) and is used as a source of nutrients for plant embryos during germination. To be precise, almost all foods including fruits and vegetables contain a certain amount of gluten with grains being known to lead the way. Is Gluten Detrimental to Good Health? Gluten is one of those few substances where a dividing line is quite easy to learn if you look for it in the right way. There is a limited group of people who suffer from a disease called celiac disease that makes them non-tolerant of gluten. This is a condition in which a person\'s immune system reacts adversely when gluten is broken down during the digestive process, and it includes symptoms such as diarrhea, fatigue, joint pain, and even intestinal damage. Obviously those people should eliminate as much gluten from their diet as possible. There are also a number of individuals who have a gluten sensitivity that makes them somehow less tolerant to a larger amount for gluten. Finally for most people, gluten poses no problems. For people without celiac disease or high level gluten sensitivity, gluten containing products pose no threat, and in fact, attempting a gluten-free diet could actually be detrimental to their health. Some packaged gluten-free foods may lack some essential nutrients and the balance you need. Yet on the other hand, a gluten free diet may be healthy and beneficial if you use healthy home made recipes that provide for a balanced diet. One of my colleagues, Erika McQuade, experiments alot with gluten free cooking, and she forwarded me this barbecue lentil recipe that she\'s going to be making this weekend. Looks delicious! Please note that it is wise to consult with a registered dietician before making any major changes to your diet. Is Gluten Causing My Acne? While there is definitely a link between the foods we put into our bodies and how well those bodies function , the link between gluten and acne is much more tenuous-much of what has been said on the subject can be chalked up to mere fad dieting. Before you ditch your gluten-rich foods in the hopes that it will clear up your breakouts, let\'s take a moment to explore the facts (and misconceptions) about gluten and its role in the acne process. If you are not suffering from gluten intolerance, then there is little to no chance that gluten is causing your acne. Your body can process the substance without having any adverse side effects. If you do have celiac disease, gluten might be making your acne worse, but it\'s not the cause of it. Another common symptom of gluten intolerance is skin inflammation, which as you may already know can make acne breakouts worse or prime your skin for new breakouts in the future, but this is not the root problem. What Is the Cause of Acne Then? Acne begins when your sebaceous glands, which are located in your skin all over your body with exception your feet, palms and arm pits, overproduce skin oil-known as sebum. This excess sebum clogs your pores and allows acne-causing bacteria to flourish, which leads to the all-too-familiar blackheads, whiteheads , and cysts . The overproduction of sebum may be caused by a number of factors with hormonal imbalance being the most prominent one. This imbalance can come from many things like puberty, pregnancy, menopause and your body subtle or less subtle issues, but the one thing it cannot come from is diet alone! Therefore, expecting dietary changes to eliminate your acne entirely will leave you disappointed when you don\'t receive the results you were looking for. While gluten can potentially affect the functioning of your body, its mechanism of action is different and it does not really affect your hormone levels and therefore it is not a major reason behind the cycle of acne. Therefore, altering your gluten consumption will not treat the cause of acne - although it may help you with the symptoms of acne, but only if you are truly suffering from gluten intolerance. Instead, to effectively treat acne, you must address the root of the problem-that is an over production of sebum by sebaceous glands and factors that may over stimulate those glands. One of the major culprits in doing so is a hormonal imbalance, most often too many free androgens (known as testosterone) in the blood. AcnEase does this in a safe, natural way by moderating the impact of a hormonal imbalance on your sebaceous glands without changing or affecting the hormones. This allows AcnEase® to improve both your current breakouts as well most importantly to PREVENT new breakouts from coming, decreasing the instances of acne in a future and breaking the cycle of acne. If you\'ve been suffering from acne for many years, it makes sense that you would want to explore each and every potential cause of your breakouts, but really, gluten poses no risk for most people and can only worsen (but not cause) acne in people with celiac disease.

"[""Do I have Cystic Acne? Symptoms, Warnings and Treatment 05-29-2013 By Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski & Dr. James P. Gilligan 0 Comments Cystic acne is the most severe form of acne vulgaris . Acne in general develops due to overactive sebaceous glands. At the base of each hair follicle is a gland called the sebaceous gland, which makes sebum. Sebum is an oily substance, which under normal circumstances travels along the hair follicle to the surface of the skin. Sebaceous glands are most numerous on the face, chest, back, neck and scalp; consequently, these are the most common sites of acne. A number of factors can cause an increase in sebaceous gland secretions. A primary culprit are the androgen hormones (analogs of testosterone) DHT(dehydrotestotsterone) DHEAS (dihydroepiandrosterone). Elevated levels of these androgens cause an increase secretion of sebum, which can lead to clogged pores and the start of the acne cascade. Under normal conditions, sebum flows to the surface of the skin along the hair follicle (figure 1). For an individual with acne, the normal transport of sebum out of the follicle is impeded, which leads to an accumulation of sebum providing an enriched breeding ground for bacteria. Cleansing with soap is not capable of removing the bacteria entrapped at the base of the hair follicle. The rapid growth of the bacteria in combination with the accumulated sebum cause the follicle to enlarge and can result in a mild form of acne called comedones (blackhead, open comedone or whitehead, closed comedone) both of which are non-inflammatory (Figure 2). This is the start of the acne cascade. Under most circumstances acne does not proceed any further, the skin forms a “wall” around the follicle which contains the bacteria so a healing process can start. For those individuals that have cystic acne the process does not stop here; instead the acne can progress to inflammatory type of lesions that are red in color called pustules and nodules. The next stage is the development of a clearly inflammatory lesion called the pustule, which contains limited number of bacteria and pus below the surface of the skin. Nodules or cysts are the most advanced and severe form of acne. Nodules result when the contents of a comedone expand from the follicular region to the surrounding tissue causing a local inflammatory reaction that may damage the skin. The final stage of the acne cascade is cystic acne and it is the most severe form of acne vulgaris , Cystic acne appears similar to a nodule, but is pus-filled and routinely has a diameter of 5mm or more. The cysts result from a more chronic inflammatory response that can lead to local tissue destruction. Unlike common pimples where a “wall” is established around the hair follicle to prevent expansion of the local infection and to reduce the degree of inflammation, with cysts, the inflammation expands to the surrounding tissue. Cysts originate deeper in the skin than typical pimples . These inflammatory lesions can be painful and commonly produce scarring. Individuals should never squeeze an acne cyst, since squeezing the cyst can cause an even deeper infection and more painful inflammation spreading under the surface of the skin. This further damage can result in the cyst lasting much longer and lead to the development of additional cysts, more permanent tissue damage and scarring. AcnEase , our all-botanical acne treatment, has been VERY successful in treating cystic acne for both women and men. AcnEase is designed to not only eliminate symptoms of acne, but to also prevent it – which is the key to getting rid of acne. This one-month treatment is clinically proven to be safe and effective for all ages and skin types, and has absolutely no-chemicals and is also gluten-free. With a 96% user success rate, the body is rebalanced so that the sebaceous glands are able to produce a normal amount of sebum – another key to winning the fight against acne.

"['5 Tips for Resisting the Urge to Pop Your Pimples [...And Why You Shouldn\'t Pop!] 08-04-2014 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Large and small pimples are only one of acne\'s physical symptoms , but they are easily the most noticeable, discussed, and most hated. Because of this, people are normally willing to do whatever it takes to get rid of them as soon as possible without considering the long-term impact on their skin and without understanding that the superficial removal of a pimple is very far from treating acne. Short term, you may get rid of this ugly white head sticking out from your skin, but popping pimples can increase your risk of getting new and more severe pimples or cysts in the future as it actually opens ""a window"" for infection and may spread bacteria throughout your skin too. Furthermore popping pimples damages the skin tissue, and if this damage is deep enough it will lead to acne scars and marks. As the cost of ""popping"" is high, the benefits are really low and very short lived; popping pimples cannot break the acne cycle and treat acne. Even though many chronic poppers know that their habit is bad news, they can\'t break the cycle, and that\'s because stopping is not just a matter of wanting to - you need to know why it is important to stop and really take a strategic approach to it. Assuming that you now accept that popping is bad for your skin, you just need to concentrate on HOW to do stop popping. These five tips for resisting the urge to pop pimples were developed based on what psychologists know about habits and how they are formed and broken. With them, you will increase your chances of eliminating this damaging practice from your life entirely. Arm Yourself with Knowledge One of the most helpful ways to make popping your pimples seem less appealing is by understanding what exactly happens when you do it. Pimples act as a container to hold debris and bacteria in your pores. While this is a less-than-ideal situation, letting your pus run free over your face, hands or anywhere else for this matter is much worse. When you pop a pimple, you release this junk and allow it to contaminate other nearby pores. On top of this, you also run the risk of contaminating your skin even more, as bacteria from your hands are then transferred onto your skin and existing blemishes. This increases the probability of further infection and inflammation. Raise the Stakes While positivity can go a long way in your quest to stop popping pimples, sometimes you\'ve got to get a little mean with yourself in order to stay accountable. Find a close friend or family member who\'s willing to help you out with your problem and each week give them a certain amount of money - it should be enough that it will hurt to lose but not enough that it will wreck your finances. At the end of the week, if you have successfully refrained from popping your pimples, you get the money back, no strings attached. However, if you succumbed to the temptation, you lose that weeks\' money to your friend. This may sound extreme (and maybe a bit embarrassing), but by adding real-world punishments into the mix you make pimple popping look much less attractive. Utilize Technology Studies have shown that repeating affirmations is a great way to break an old habit or form a new one, and your smartphone is the perfect tool for cementing those affirmations in your mind. There are lots of motivational apps out there that send you inspirational quotes throughout the day, and there are even some that let you customize your own. Use these to your advantage - come up with one to three short, positive affirmations about resisting the urge to pop pimples and have them sent to your phone multiple times a day, so that you\'re never far from a motivational pick-me-up. You may feel goofy at first repeating these affirmations to yourself, but over time they\'ll begin to take hold, and you\'ll really start to believe them. Find a Viable Alternative One of the main reasons that people pop their pimples is because these blemishes are unsightly. So, if you want to successfully resist the temptation, you\'ve got to find something better, more effective and healthier that can get rid of them. There are TWO parts to this process: Find a real acne treatment that will help you to break the acne cycle and remove the need to pop the pimples as they stop coming. One of the options to consider is the all-botanical ingredients based AcnEase . It works for both women and men, for different types of acne, and with up to a 96% efficacy rate. It has GMO\'s, no chemicals, no side effects, no sugar, no gluten, and no milk derivatives. Choosing a non-comedogenic concealer is an additional and instant way to camouflage pimples so you can concentrate on treating them. Makeup products labelled as ""noncomedogenic"" are specifically designed to not clog pores, so your pimples stay hidden without sacrificing skin health. With a good concealer, you\'re achieving the same effect, while avoiding harmful popping. Additionally, here are some of our celebrity makeup tips . Reward Your Victories While we\'ve already addressed creating negative consequences for succumbing to temptation, it\'s just as important to celebrate yourself when you resist the urge to pop! Once you start having some success, don\'t forget to reward your commitment. Your rewards can be tangible or intangible - for some people it might be something as simple as watching an extra baseball game on TV, for others it make take something more, like a visit to the spa or even new pair of shoes. Whatever you ultimately decide on, remember that by reinforcing your good behavior the chances of your not popping pimples turning into a bad, skin damaging habit increase greatly.

"['What Can Aloe Vera Really do for Acne? 08-14-2014 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The association between aloe vera and skincare is nothing new-people have been using it to treat everything from sunburns to eczema for centuries now. However, is this plant extract also a good addition for acne prone skin? The answer is a bit of a mixed bag. First and foremost, it\'s important to remember that aloe vera cannot really cure your acne on its own. The only solution for permanently stopping breakouts is addressing the problem at its root . However, that being said, aloe can work as a wonderful supplemental product for certain acne-related issues. In its pure form, it\'s a non-comedogenic moisturizer with anti- inflammatory properties. A Little About Aloe Vera Aloe vera has been around for a very long time-the earliest records of it come from ancient Egypt over 6000 years ago! They called it ""the plant of immortality"" and used it both medicinally and as a gift for pharaohs. Needless to say, since then, aloe has been a popular ingredient in all sorts of herbal remedies and beauty products. Aloe is classified as a succulent plant and is primarily cultivated today for its leaves that contain a gooey gel-which is used in a number of skincare and other health products. The plant is grown worldwide, and its popularity only continues to rise. Aloe Vera and Acne When it comes to acne sufferers, there are a couple different ways that aloe can help with breakouts. First of all, you should be interested in aloe\'s healing properties. It\'s commonly used as a remedy for sunburns or minor cuts and scrapes, but it\'s also great for addressing the problem of acne scars . Aloe has a natural exfoliating effect that helps remove dead skins cells from the scarring site and it also promotes the healing and regeneration of damaged cells by increasing your body\'s collagen production. Collagen is one of the essential building blocks of skin, and the more your body creates the less noticeable scarring will be. Aloe also works as a softening and moisturizing agent. In addition to making acne scars less visible, aloe is also beneficial for its anti-inflammatory and redness reducing properties. While these properties won\'t cure your acne, they will help minimize the visible symptoms and offer some protection against future outbreaks. Finally, aloe vera is also quite high in vitamin A . This is an essential nutrient that helps your body naturally remove its dead skin cells. Dead cells left on the skin can cause clogged pores that create a breeding ground for acne-causing bacteria, so anything that can help the exfoliation process will be a benefit to you. Using Aloe Vera Aloe vera comes in several different forms these days. The most natural choice would be to use the gel straight from the plant\'s leaves. This gel can be applied directly to acne scars once a day to help reduce their appearance. You may use the gel on unaffected skin as well, but keep in mind this might not be effective. Aloe has difficulty penetrating the upper layers of healthy skin, which means that any potential health benefits it could have will be lessened. However, you may still find that is has a temporary but pleasing moisturizing effect. There are many skincare products on the market these days that contain aloe vera gel or extracts. When using things like this, it\'s important to be a smart consumer. Check the label to see what other ingredients have been added to the product-unfortunately, you may find that it\'s full of harsh, less-than-natural chemicals that can negate any of the potential benefits the aloe would have on your skin. Aloe vera juice is another increasingly popular trend. Drinking the juice from this plant will probably not be as effective as topical applications for reducing acne scars, but it does have other applications. It\'s a great way to absorb aloe\'s vitamin A and all the exfoliating benefits that come along with it. However, keep in mind that, like other juices, producers of aloe juice may add unhealthy ingredients into the mix-like extra refined sugar for sweetness. So make sure you sure only use PURE aloe products to amplify your benefits.

"['5 Back to School Acne Skincare Tips that Will Transform Your Look 08-27-2014 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Going back to school means a lot of things-seeing old friends, making new ones, and unfortunately, homework. However, one thing that it shouldn\'t mean is a fear of acne breakouts. Thankfully, if you\'re smart and proactive about your skincare, there\'s no need to worry about pesky problems like that. Here are five tips to help ensure that your new school year is filled with clear skin and self-confidence. Start your anti-acne campaign early. If you want great skin by the time that school starts up, you need to begin taking care of it right now. Acne is not a condition that develops overnight, and similarly, it\'s not one that goes away quickly either. When dealing with it, you\'ve got to be patient and plan for the future, and that means getting started as soon as possible-some zit zapping cream the night before classes begin is just not going to cut it. Go easy on the makeup. While it\'s perfectly understandable that you want to look your best when classes start, piling on layers of makeup is actually going to hurt you in the long run. Makeup has a bad habit of clogging your pores more than they already are, and this extra blockage can lead to your acne breakouts worsening or lasting for longer times. If you can\'t imagine a world without makeup don\'t fear-there are some things you can do to mitigate its effects. First, always go for products that are labeled as ""noncomedogenic"". These have been specially designed to be easy on your skin, and they won\'t clog your pores as badly as traditional makeup. Secondly, be sure to wash your makeup off daily, and if possible, don\'t wear it for the entire day. And don\'t forget to wash it off at night - this is a MUST do! Pamper your skin. If you\'re in the middle of a particularly bad acne breakout, you may be tempted to focus all your efforts on combatting zits, blackheads, and cysts. However, don\'t neglect what a good daily skincare routine can do for breakouts . People with naturally oily skin should focus on a routine that helps get rid of some of that excess skin oil (or sebum) that can clog pores and help spur on a breakout. Conversely, people with naturally dry skin should focus on cleansing and moisturizing. Resist the urge to pop. The prospect of going to school with whiteheads and blackheads can be scary, no doubt, but it\'s in your best interest to resist the temptation to pop pimples . For one, the red, inflamed skin that\'s left behind after a pop is just as unsightly as the pimples themselves-it doesn\'t really improve your situation any. Secondly, popping pimples can actually cause the bacteria contained in them to travel to nearby pores, which then can start a new breakout. Treating your acne and covering it with a good noncomedogenic concealer is a much healthier and effective plan of action. Treat the underlying causes of acne. This is by far the MOST IMPORTANT tip we can share with you. Attacking pimples with a whole host of topical products can only do so much for your acne breakouts. However, if you\'re not treating the underlying causes of acne, you can expect those breakouts to keep returning in the future. For example, many cases of acne stem from an imbalance of hormones in the body-specifically the presence of too much androgen. This imbalance sends signals to your skin\'s sebaceous glands to overproduce sebum, which clogs your pores and leads to acne. No amount of creams or cleansers can do anything about your hormones! Instead, you should be looking for products (such as AcnEase ) that can treat the underlying causes of breakouts. This is the only way to really win the fight against acne.

"['The SUPER HERBS that REALLY Fight Acne 11-01-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments There are a number of herbs that are good for your skin. But when you suffer from acne, good is not enough! You need SUPER herbs and skilled preparation to get a true natural medicine that actually works. To exemplify how complex the science of herbs is: As wine grapes yield a different quality and taste depending on where and how they are harvested, the similar rule applies, and is even magnified, with herbs. Different parts of the same herbs (leaves, root or stem) processed under different temperatures, and the method of extraction, may provide for totally different properties of a final product. According to the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acne and rosacea are due to excessive ""heat in the body"". A common term for acne in China is ""heat sores"". So, the herbs used to treat acne need to decrease the ""heat."" In Western medical terms, the herbs that work help reduce and balance sebaceous gland secretions, possibly impact factors that are responsible for stimulating this secretion and also work as anti-inflammatory agents. You may know that I worked for years on finding a solution that would accomplish this - and I have! What is so great about the SUPER HERBS that we use in AcnEase, which are hands down super herbal acne eliminators? Gardenia Fruit (Fructus Gardeniae), specifically when ripe, serves as a base for herbal medicine regulating heart and lungs and (in Chinese Medicine) alleviating blood heat and removing toxins. Gardenia is one of the major ingredients present in AcnEase. Houttuynia (Herba Houttuyniae) is a Chinese drug made from the dried herb Houttuynia cordata thumb. It also impacts toxic heat, and promotes the drainage of pus. Scierotium (Poriae Cocos) assists in digestion and serves as a catalyst for improved metabolism. This ingredient works synergistically with "" heat reducing"" ingredients in AcnEase, thereby further reducing acne symptoms. Dandelion (Herba Taraxaei) is a Chinese drug made from the dried herb Taraxacum mongolicum. Dandelion has a positive impact on the stomach and liver, and again it has the effect of removing heat and reducing swelling and sores. Dandelion is also attributed with decreasing the size of the abscess and dispelling the local inflammatory responses typical for acne breakouts. Balsam Pear and Mustard Leaf have similar properties in alleviating heat and improving intestinal function. Mustard Leaf is therapeutically related to balancing the lung functions, decreasing phlegm and alleviating pain. Please Note! I do not recommend that you run to your nearest health food store to buy all of these herbs to try to make your own AcnEase concoction. IT WON\'T WORK. The ratio of ingredients in each treatment combined with the development process is a proprietary trade secret of ours. Knowledge is power though, right? And additionally you already know that the only way to eliminate and prevent acne FOR GOOD is from the inside. So make an informed decision! ELIMINATE THE WORRY OF HAVING ACNE, GET YOUR LIFE BACK AND GET RID OF YOUR ACNE NOW!

"[""What NOT to Do When You Have Acne 11-19-2012 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments In this journey we've set out on to help you get clear skin for the holidays, it's important to focus on the basics first, and to learn not just what to do, but also what not to do. 1. Do NOT squeeze, pop, rub (vigorous exfoliation) the pimples - and do not let anyone do it for you! A very important role of skin is PROTECTION. When you break or injure this barrier, bacteria will hop in and create even more serious inflammation and infection. In addition, this is how acne scars and marks are made! 2. Do not follow diet fads. Recently, having gluten in your diet became linked to having acne. If you don't have celiac disease or are sensitive to gluten (both can be diagnosed by a doctor), going gluten free without a carefully designed diet may deprive you of iron, fiber and several other important nutrients, which will do more harm to your skin. Protein shake diets may also exasperate skin problems. Balance and moderation are key, not extreme measures. 3. Don't use heavy alcohol and salicylic acid based products. Drying your skin does not mean you are treating your acne. If you want to use a powerful quick-fix astringent, use witch hazel, and dab it on your pimples with a q-tip 3 times a day. 4. Tanning booths are bad for your skin. Now that we're going in to wintertime, some think that the fake sunlight will help their pimples look better. I don't need to go in to the numerous bad effects of tanning booths (ie. skin cancer and premature aging), but do know that this will not help treat your acne, can actually make you look worse and can further injure and irritate your skin. 5. Do not put aspirin on your face. When diluted in water, this turns in to acid. It may kill some bacteria temporarily, but it can dry, sensitize and irritate your skin.

"[""Linda's Success Story 11-20-2012 Linda D. 0 Comments I have been an AcnEase user for several years now. Since my teens I have tried every topical acne treatment from benzoyl peroxide to pumpkin acid peels. I spent 15 years as a model and actress and learned every trick in the book for covering up my skin eruptions with makeup but there were times that the bumps and redness were such a distraction that it took a lot of effort from the make-up artists and photographers’ lighting to compensate for the issue. In my thirties I even resorted to a series of extremely painful photo facials with the promise that they would stop my acne and get rid of the scarring. Needless to say nothing has worked except being on birth control pills but birth control pills reeked havoc on my body. I went through volatile mood swings including depression, weight gain, and hypoglycemia from not eating because I had pseudo-morning sickness often, two small cysts in my breast and a uterine fibroid. After getting off the pill, the cysts went away and the fibroid has shrunk. I never ‘adjusted’ to the chemical hormones that altered my natural cycle. I experimented over the years and would go off the pill. My physical and emotional health would even out but the acne would return on my face chest and back. I decided I would rather find the natural remedy for the acne than return to something that I knew was unhealthy for me on every level. All of the alternative heath methods, including an organic diet and several different herbs and tinctures to deal with hormone imbalance, digestion issues, liver detoxing, (YOU NAME IT) would give some relief but never the full results that I desperately wanted. AND it was an expensive and time-consuming effort! I knew there HAD to be someone out there who had found the right combination and thanks to hours and hours on the internet, I found AcnEase years ago when it was still new to the market! Here is the personal part of why AcnEase is so special for me. I've spent the last 15 years of my life taking care of everyone else around me including my mother who died from complications from Parkinson’s Disease. My mother had several other ailments and diseases throughout her life. Watching her suffer through the pharmaceutical treatments with all of the side affects was the catalyst for me to do things differently. I made a conscious choice to find natural therapies that are not only good for me but for life on the planet. Mother nature gives us these gifts and AcnEase is the only product I have found that not only delivers results but also allows me to honor my personal code of ethics. AcnEase has become one of the ways I take care of myself . The last few years have been filled with many personal losses and tragedies. Ironically, AcnEase has made a huge difference in how I have seen my health through these life lessons. When my skin is flaring up, I know that energetically things are out of balance. It’s more than a good diet and plenty of sleep although those two are the best places to start. Sometimes life is hard and we need more help. AcnEase does more than clear my skin.....I truly feel better not just because I look better. When my skin is broken out, I feel like my body is not processing the stresses of life very well and it really shows on my face. Even with the challenges that life brings, when I'm on AcnEase and my skin is clear, I know that I have the aid of mother nature and the science of AcnEase helping my physical body to detox and stay healthy during life's ups and downs. I am so grateful for AcnEase. It makes a difference much deeper than the surface for people like me. I wished for twenty years to have clear, beautiful skin and LITERALLY AcnEase has been the answer to that prayer! - Linda D. Comments Add New Tara Hello, it was truly inspiring to read your post. I have the same problem as you I was on a very strong birth control, diana 35, for the past 5-6 years and every time I tried stopping the acne with return within a month or two, nothing seemed to help. I stopped again 3 months ago and just as expected got full blown acne within a month afterwards and found acnease and have just completed my first month of 12 pills/day treatment, unfortunately I still have acne even though the acnease helped a bit I still have some left and now I'm waiting for my second batch of acnease to start on another month. You've mentioned that you've been on acnease for years? Is that really necessary? What happens when you stop? Would I have to be on acnease for the rest of my life?

"['How to Not Let Sugar Destroy Your Skin this Holiday Season 12-03-2012 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments The holidays are a time where many indulge in sugary things. From the holiday parties to intimate gatherings, there is so much temptation that it can sometimes be hard to avoid. But do know this! Sugar REALLY is bad for your skin and may exacerbate acne as well. Many people wonder why they can\'t break the cycle of acne - and this is one major cause. Sugar is not just a part of cookies, candies, cakes or sodas, but it also can be found in almost every food in your refrigerator from mayo to Canadian bacon. The ingredient may not say ""sugar"", and be disguised as corn syrup (or a word that ends with ""syrup""), fructose, lactose (or a word that ends in ""ose""), fruit juice concentrate, sorbitol or xylitol. When you combine their rather overwhelming presence with foods that easily and rapidly convert into sugar like potatoes, pasta, crackers and potato chips, your skin can continually have issues. Remember - sugarplums should dance in the Nutcracker, not on your table! Sugar causes two major types of damage to your skin: Inflammation , that may affect different organs in your body including skin (which is an organ!) and Glycation , which is a chemical reaction similar to the one that occurs when you fry meat - collagen (a building block of the skin) deteriorates, and as a result, your skin loses its elasticity and brightness - basically, it AGES. So how do you decrease your sugar intake, and save your skin? Be an educated consumer. Read the labels and ask your waitress what is in the food you\'re about to eat - you need to not only watch the sugar content but also the carb content. Learn which foods contain carbs that have a high glycemic index (turn rapidly into sugar) and try to avoid them or at least limit them. Turn to www.glycemicindex.com for this information. There are ""friends"" that can help your cause. Fiber slows the absorption of sugar. Antioxidants and proteins, when eaten before carbs or sugar containing products, prevent the rapid increase in sugar level in your blood, prevent excessive food cravings, can help you lose weight and will keep your skin younger and happier and your body and skin less exposed to inflammation. Eat before you go! Fill up on something nutritious before you go so you\'ll feel a bit ""fuller"". A spoon of natural low fat cottage cheese, hard boiled egg, 2-3 slices of home baked turkey breast (NOT A COLD CUT) can do the job right. If you opt to use supplements, choose Vitamin C Ester. This highly absorbable form of Vitamin C has great anti-inflammatory properties. By taking 500mg a day, your skin can show a difference in 3 months or less.

"['The Best Herbal Relaxants for Stress and Skin 12-04-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Ever feel like this? Loaded question, I know! But little do many know that if stress is balanced with relaxation, then its negative effects may be diminished and a balance can be achieved. Really! And if a balance is not achieved, stress affects our skin in a variety of ways. Adrenaline redirects blood away from the skin and sends it to the muscles instead. This is why in times of relentless stress the skin becomes pale and ""washed out"". Anger, irritability, excitement and frustration unleash chemicals, which stimulate the sebaceous glands into pouring out more oil. The excess sebum can block the pores and encourage the pimples to form. This is why we tend to break out in spots on the eve of an important occasion. Chronic stress makes muscles tense up and become stiff. This prevents the flow of blood bringing enough oxygen and vital nutrients to the skin. Tension also is responsible for slowing the swift removal of wastes from the underlying tissue. Stressed skin lacks vitality and looks congested. Strain slows down the rate of cell turnover so the fresh epidermal cells take longer to reach the skin surface and much of their moisture has disappeared. Under constant pressure, the skin looks dull. Continuous stress increases cortisone secretion, which suppresses the body\'s natural immunity. The skin\'s defense breaks down and allows the skin to be irritated by outside chemicals and pollutants. Stress shatters serenity and fuels self-doubt. It is important to balance, regulate and compose your inner body environment, which in turn expresses itself on the surface of the skin. How to Balance Stress with Herbal Relaxants In order to help support and relieve anxiety and stress, certain plant relaxants, when taken regularly, can help to calm and help deal with a stressful lifestyle and support the nervous system. Try the following warm drink to balance stress and keep your skin from being effected. Infusion Drink for Stress 2.5 tsp dried lime flowers 2.5 tsp dried chamomile 2.5 tsp dried vervain Add the dried herbs to 2 cups of boiling water in a warmed pot with a lid. Leave to infuse for 10-15 minutes and then strain. Drink warm throughout the day. Let me know how it works for you...

"[""Causes and Treatment for Male Hormonal Acne 12-11-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments While acne is prevalent among teenagers, adult men of all ages can also be plagued by this skin disorder as well. Hormones appear to be the primary culprit in adult male acne, which can be tough to treat. Hormonal imbalance is the main factor that leads to acne. Hormonal acne affects 50% to women and 25% to men. Hormonal acne in men can occur at any stage of life whether it is a teenager stage or adult stage. However, the American Academy of Dermatology suggests that dermatologists can clear almost any case of acne, even in an adult male, with the treatments now available. A common misunderstanding is that men have testosterone and women estrogen and progesterone. The truth,indeed is that both male and female have a balance of all three hormones. The primary cause of the formation of acne is a fluctuation in androgens and in particular testosterone. Increase in these hormones leads to extra emission of oil by the sebaceous glands and the commencement of hormonal acne formation. Hormonal acne in men is most common at the onset of puberty. Since boys have more male hormones, they tend to have more severe and longer lasting acne than their female counterparts. This also helps explain why males who use performance enhancing anabolic steroids, which belong to the androgen, class of hormones, experience frequent acne on their face and torso. A frequent problem encountered by men while working out is the appearance of body acne. Aside from a greater propensity for pores to become clogged during exercise, intense work outs stimulate increased production of the hormone testosterone which makes the skin more acne prone. The good news is that hormonal acne in men is very short lived most of the times, there are only few cases where hormonal acne persists for long time. There are ways that men who suffer from acne can prevent an outbreak from occurring again once they have treated the acne. These prevention methods include eating a balanced and healthful diet, exercising, drinking water and softening the skin with a warm cloth before shaving. Eating a balanced and healthful diet will provide the skin with the nutrients it needs. Exercise reduces stress and improves the circulation, which can prevent acne. Drinking water hydrates the skin. Softening the face with a warm cloth before shaving removes dead skin and smooths the face, which will eliminate nicks near acne regions and prevent the spreading of infection. In order to treat adult male acne, you need to interrupt the skin condition's cycle of oily skin, bacterial infection and clogged pores. Most acne sufferers turn to over-the-counter products. According to the AAD , over-the-counter preparations that include sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can help adult acne by killing acne-causing bacteria. Skin ointments containing benzoyl peroxide also kill bacteria and help to clear pores. Physical procedures that help to clear acne in teens, such as laser treatments and blue LED light therapy, haven't been studied in adults and may not work effectively. However, most dermatologists are able clear particularly bad acne lesions quickly by injecting them with a solution containing a corticosteroid. This procedure kills the inflammation and reduces the chance that the pimple will leave a scar. AcneEase is a skin care product consisting of herbal tablets. AcneEase offers a safe and natural solution to treating male hormonal acne. This acne treatment has no impact on male hormones, and therefore proven safe to use for all men. While Accutane has been known to instigate depression among young males, there have been no reports of side effects among users of AcneEase. It is essentially a quick, clean, and safe way to treat all levels of acne and Rosacea .

"[""Treating Dry Skin and Acne During Winter 12-13-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments During the winter, people typically experience drier skin due to a number of factors, including cold and windy weather and central heating. The exposure to drastic temperature changes tends to dry out the skin. In some cases, these factors may trigger the production of dry skin cells, which clog pores and lead to breakouts. People who struggle with acne may experience breakouts more frequently. Sufferers of eczema or rosacea may experience more intense symptoms in dry and cold weather. Some people with normally clear skin may have problems with acne in the winter. This is referred to as “seasonal acne.” Regardless of the skin type, acne problems are usually exacerbated during the winter. People suffering from the aforementioned skin issues should adjust daily skin care routines during the winter season. Below are several tips on how to retain moist and healthy skin amidst the harsh bitter cold winter winds. For starters, buying a humidifier will be one huge step towards hydration. Leave it on while you sleep and you will wake up to better skin. Skin gets dryer when the air gets dryer, so keeping adequate moisture in the air helps skin, hair and your throat from being too dry. Cleaning Your Face/Skin Keeping your skin clean is very important during the winter season. Why? During the winter, the air is full of loose dust and sand and these particles can get stuck on your face and skin, especially when you’ve applied moisturizer and skin creams. You should clean your skin as early as possible. Soap is not recommended for removing dust and sand as it may further dry up your skin. Instead, you should use an aloe based deep cleaning regimen. Aloe moisturizes and tightens your skin while simultaneously cleaning it. You can also refer to other natural skin cleaning product such as plain milk, yogurt, and chickpea powder can remove dirt and grease without drying out your skin. Moisturizing Your Skin During the cold, dry winters, moisturizing is an important step in the skin care routine. Chilled and dried out air sucks the moister from your skin causing the outer layer of your skin to dry out and crack. People of all skin types, including oily, combination and acne-prone skin, should use moisturizers on a daily basis. People naturally inclined to dry skin should use creams and thicker moisturizing formulas during the winter. People with oily, combination or acne-prone skin should use lighter formulas, such as moisturizing gels and lotions that moisturize the skin without clogging pores. Vitamin E based moisturizer can help keep your skin soft, smooth, and younger looking. A good quality night cream will repair your skin as you sleep. Cod liver oil is another great skin moisturizing agent. This oil is super rich in DHA and Omegas that nourish the skin, hair and nails. It’s beneficial in a number of other ways as well such as weight management and brain function. Coconut oil is an excellent treatment for dry skin because it is very thick. Nourishing Your Skin Nourishing your skin on a regular basis is crucial to keeping your skin glowing and radiant. You can nourish your skin using fruit pack. You can find ready-made fruit-pack or you can make it on your own. The ingredients you need to make fruit-pack are fruits like ripe papayas, strawberries, grapes, ripe mango, etc. Place these fruit along with some plain yogurt in a blender and blend until smooth. Mix well and apply on your face. Keep it on your face for about 20 minutes before rinsing it off with water. For the best results, apply the fruit-pack at least once a week on your face. Flaxseed oil is one of the best sources of plant-derived, inflammation-fighting omega-3 fatty acids. Flaxseed oil reduces skin sensitivity, roughness, and scaling of the skin. Moreover, it smoothes and increases the hydration of the skin. Eating foods and drinking beverages rich in vitamin C as well as supplements lowers the risk of wrinkles, dryness, and thinning of the skin. Drinking at least 8 cups of water a day will also keep your skin hydrated and prevent dryness of your skin. What to Avoid Some people should avoid using skin care products with fragrance during the winter. They may irritate the skin and exacerbate seasonal skin conditions. Makeup containing certain types of oils and waxes may clog pores and lead to more acne breakouts. During the winter, women should use non-comedogenic beauty products, which contain ingredients that will not clog pores. During the winter, people should take simple steps to clear and prevent acne breakouts. Long, hot showers should be avoided during the winter, as they will dry the skin. Using exfoliating products every day will most likely irritate the skin. Rubbing the skin vigorously while cleaning may spread the bacteria on the face and increase the incidence of breakouts.

"[""Coconut oil. Does it REALLY help acne? 09-06-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments Although it may sound counterintuitive, some natural oils may help to fight oily skin and improve breakouts. There is much talk about coconut oil and whether or not it's effective in helping acne prone skin, so here are the facts. Acne and its predecessor, oily skin, are results of over production of sebum (skin oil) by sebaceous glands. The increase in sebum production can lead to clogged pores (whiteheads and blackheads), which accumulate dead skin cells as well as bacteria. This combination leads to a local inflammatory response, which if chronic, can lead to damage to the surrounding tissue. Acne and oily skin have to be treated from the inside out by removing the cause of excessive sebum production, the common denominator for both acne and oily skin. Oily skin can therefore be treated by two distinct pathways: a) decrease sebum production b) use a cleansing regimen that will safely remove excess oil from the skin. Removing excess skin oil deposits in pores may significantly help to reduce the formation of acne, and also improve the look of the skin. Using Oil on Acne Prone Skin Sebum is a fat soluble substance and is not soluble (diluted) in water without including detergents. Fatty substances may be soluble in other fatty substances like oil or organic solvents like alcohol or water that contains detergents. Many topical acne products and cleansers contain alcohol along with active ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Products containing salicylic acid for instance may remove some of the sebum and temporarily improve the look of the skin. However, this treatment will not treat the causes of acne, and longer term use may dry and prematurely age the skin. In addition, products containing organic solvents may make skin red, over-sensitive and depending on the active ingredients, increase sun (UV rays) sensitivity. Why Coconut Oil? Coconut oil can help clean your skin and reduce excess skin oil on the surface of the skin so your skin looks and feels less oily, and your pores less clogged. Additionally, coconut oil can be used to remove makeup, and can help to soothe inflammation that often accompanies severe acne. For some people, it can help to alleviate the red, dry skin that some topical acne products may cause. Coconut oil contains no harsh chemicals or preservatives; instead it possesses antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant properties that help fight acne infections. Coconut oil helps to soothe inflammation that often accompanies severe acne, and helps to alleviate the red, dry skin that some topical products may cause. The lauric and caprylic acid, along with the Vitamins K and E found in coconut oil help to soften acne scars and may accelerate healing by speeding up the skin cell turnover. How to Use For the best impact, use coconut oil twice a day (in the morning and before bed time). Apply with your fingers (please wash hands before applying). Massage in light circular motions avoiding the eyes. Wipe with a soft tissue, and follow up with our chamomile toner/astringent . Coconut oil becomes very thick when it is stored at temperatures below 77 degrees; you may therefore heat it slightly so it is easier to apply. Make sure it is not too hot (never boil it). When coconut oil is used in a solid state, it is less oily than when it has been heated up. However, no matter the state coconut oil is in, it is good for all skin types, even oily skin. Unrefined, virgin, organic, cold pressed coconut oil is the best to use. Please note, coconut oil will not eliminate your acne. It can assist with helping reduce inflammation and bacteria and can be used in addition to a treatment that prevents acne from coming - the key to breaking the acne cycle !

"[""Pre-Teen Acne 12-11-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The preteen period marks the transition from child to teenager. Acne is which is normally prevalent among teenagers is now affecting preteens as well. Acne in the preteen years would once have been considered distinctly unusual and a cause for concern. In fact, about 8 in 10 preteens and teens have acne, along with many adults. However, the reduction over the past 50 years in the average age at which puberty occur meaning that preteen acne is becoming increasingly common. The time in which acne is often most active is during puberty is when hormonal changes cause an increase in sebum production. Since not all of the extra produced sebum can make it to the surface of the skin, clogs start to develop and result in acne. For some adolescents, puberty can start even in their pre-teen years, resulting in a need for acne treatment at an early age. A preteen can experience a wide range of severity with acne outbreaks ranging from mild comedone formation, also referred to as blackheads or whiteheads, to serious acne nodules or cysts that can form acne scars. Each case varies based on the individual. Pre-teen acne is usually the sign of a child who is experiencing early, but normal, puberty and is not in itself a cause for concern. Towards the lower end of the eight to twelve age range, one starts to have more concerns as to whether the development of adolescent acne is associated with abnormally early puberty, also known as precocious puberty, which may have a serious underlying medical cause. Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed way to prevent acne, but there are a variety of acne treatments available that are effective. Cleansing Regimen The regimen should include gentle washing of the face, neck and acne-prone areas twice daily, once in the morning and before going to bed. A mild soap should be used and applied with the fingertips to damp skin. Washing any more than that can irritate the skin and over-dry it, which produces more dead skin cells. Over-The-Counter Treatment The medications for preteen acne differ and depend on the gravity of the eruption. For minor eruptions, the treatment of over-the-counter medicine like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide may possibly be sufficient to unblock the pore and destroy the bacteria thus preventing the development of acne. Prescription Medications For extra serious acne eruptions, your child’s physician may perhaps recommend medicine to assist is clearing up the acne. For instance, a choice of antibiotics, like erythromycin or clindamycin, might be dispensed to lessen the populace of P. Acnes in the eruption. Additional prescriptions might involve retinoids like tretinoin or adapalene. In a number of situations, the physician or dermatologist might also utilize laser treatments to destroy the sebacious glands within the skin to avoid additional production of sebum. Natural Remedies If you are concerned about the utilization of treatments on your child, perhaps additional natural treatments might be useful. For instance, a five percent mixture of tea tree oil might be as efficient as a five percent mixture of the prescription benzoyl peroxide in remedying acne, according to the Mayo Clinic. Supplements of brewer’s yeast, guggul or zinc might also assist with acne therapy. Prior to utilizing a natural treatment, talk about your alternatives with your child’s physician to prevent possible problems. A preteen’s skin is more sensitive when compared to the skin of adults. This is the reason why some are hesitant to use more active treatments for acne. When choosing your treatment, it’s important to stick to it in order to notice results. In most cases moderate or even serious teen acne can be improved and most importantly prevented with AcnEase® the all natural and unique acne treatment equally effective for preteens.

"[""Acne versus Cold Sores 12-16-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Sometimes people tend to confuse acne with cold sores. However, these are two different skin disorders. Even though, both skin conditions share certain common symptoms they have absolutely no similarity when it comes to causes and treatments. By closely observing the symptoms, you will be able to distinguish between the two conditions. However, when doubt remains, a visit to your dermatologist can lead to a proper diagnosis and a recommendation for appropriate treatment. Cold sores and acne require different treatments, and improper treatment can slow down healing. Causes of Acne vs. Cold Sores When oil-producing glands in your skin become blocked, the area can become infected with bacteria. Your body's immunity sends white blood cells to fight the bacteria, which is what causes pimples. Cold sores, on the other hand, form on the lips as a result of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Once contracted, the virus stays in your body permanently. However, the sores often only appear as a result of stress or illness. Location Cold sores normally form around or right on the lips in the form of clusters whereas acne can mostly be seen in the form of pimples located on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and elsewhere on the face. People may also suffer from back acne as well. Unlike cold sores, however, acne rarely appears on the mouth. Symptoms Cold sores are painful and can appear after an illness or stressful situation. The common symptom of cold sore is a tingling sensation in the lips and the area around the lips which continues for a couple of days. You can go months or years without having cold sores reappear. Cold sores are infectious and can spread from one person to another. Acne pimples can also be painful to the touch but are not connected to any illness. Cold sores are essentially contagious symptoms and they take at least ten days to heal. While an individual is suffering from cold sore, he or she should avoid sharing food with others. Acne bumps are significantly larger than the cold sores. Most importantly, acne lesions referred as pimples contain pus. Therefore unlike cold sores, acne is typically marked by formation of pus filled pimples. However, the term acne is not just restricted to pimples but also refers to other small raised bumps on the skin like whiteheads and blackheads. Acne can last for months or years with frequent breakouts if left untreated. Every person is susceptible to the herpes virus and thus susceptible to developing cold sores. Acne is most common in adolescents. Pregnant women and newborns have also been known to have acne outbreaks. Treatments As the underlying cause of both the skin problems is different, there are different treatments for acne and cold sores. Use of topical anesthetic agents like lidocaine temporarily provides numbing effect, thereby helping to alleviate pain associated with cold sores. Severe cases of acne may require use of oral antibiotics. Because cold sores have been categorized as a viral infection, best treatment for cold sores may involve use of oral antiviral such as acyclovir and famciclovir to facilitate the healing of cold sores. When talking about the similarities between the two, it should be noted that squeezing cold sore or pimple can cause oozing and pain. Therefore, it should be avoided in both the cases. Pimples, when squeezed, can cause scarring which can be permanent if not treated immediately. However, scarring is not seen in case of cold sores. Although you may now know the differences and similarities, it is advisable to consult a dermatologist for proper treatment of either of these. Lastly, note that maintaining cleanliness and hygiene and following a balanced diet can help in prevention of pimples, acne and cold sores.

"[""Female Hormonal Acne 12-23-2012 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments As a general rule, women's hormones tend to fluctuate more than men's, which helps explain why acne in women tends to be less constant and more erratic than acne in men. More than half of all adult women experience at least occasional breakouts. Approximately 60-70% of women battle with acne experience premenstrual flare-ups. Acne can occur throughout a woman's adult life: in early adulthood, in the late twenties and thirties, during pregnancy, and during menopause. While female adult acne can be frustrating to deal with, it can be prevented and effectively treated. Acne is an androgenic disorder. In other words, the effects of hormones called androgens set off acne. Testosterone generally plays the biggest role in acne. Men and women both produce testosterone. The testosterone stimulates the sebaceous (oil-making) glands in the skin. However, when excess testosterone stimulates too much oil production, pores will clog and trap the oil inside. Bacteria begin to grow in the trapped oil, causing the body's immune system to respond. At that point, the immune system responses thus causing the redness, swelling, pus-like fluid and scarring that are associated with acne. Puberty is the most notable time acne flares up. As you enter adolescence, increased amounts of hormones begin surging through your body. While girls will experience heightened levels of estrogens, they will also experience a boost in androgens as boys do. It is believed these androgens are mostly responsible for the appearance of hormonal acne. In some cases, an underlying condition may not be to blame, but a simple hormone imbalance could cause unexpected acne breakouts. Women with very oily skin, breakout often and show signs of other hormonal problems like irregular periods and increased body hair in women. They should consult with their physician and have their hormonal levels tested.

"[""Hormonal Acne 01-28-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments According to the American Academy of Dermatology , the unpleasant and sometimes painful skin breakouts of acne can affect 40 to 50 million Americans. Acne is most common in teenagers, but it can affect people regardless of age. Hormonal acne is practically acne caused by hormonal fluctuations. Acne can flare at any time, but people are particularly susceptible to it during certain phases of life, including, and perhaps most famously, during puberty and adolescence in general. Adult acne, however, is also increasingly common. Much like adolescent acne, it is essentially hormonal in nature. Generally speaking, adult women tend to be more vulnerable to hormonal acne than adult men, but men can certainly experience it as well. Women tend to go through several different hormonal stages in their lives, starting with menses (the onset of menstruation), followed by many years of menstruation, perhaps a pregnancy or multiple pregnancies, premenopausal, and finally, menopause. Any or all of these new phases can change a woman's hormonal balance yet again and cause her acne to flare anew. Hormonal acne typically does not respond to traditional acne treatments, such as topical retinoids or antibiotics. Hormonal acne can be treated through the use of oral contraceptives for women and Accutane for men. Men and women who are experiencing hormonal acne find that over the counter topical treatments, such as ointments and cleansers containing benzoyl peroxide and/or glycolic acid, provide them with all the acne relief they need. Aleve is an over the counter medication that has been found to alleviate premenstrual acne and menstrual acne in many women because of the anti-inflammatory effect that it has on a person's entire system. However, Aleve which contains Naproxen, is an NSAID medication, which means that it is not safe for everyone to take. For instance, people who are allergic to aspirin should not take Aleve. AcnEase is an all natural herbal medicine that specifically inhibits the impact of fluctuating hormone levels on sebaceous gland secretions. AcnEase does not affect hormone levels but rather they modulate their effect on sebaceous gland secretions. This mechanism is effective in treating adolescent and adult acne. Likewise, AcnEase can be used by both men and women. But most importantly, AcnEase is safe and by addressing the causes of acne it will prevent the future outbursts letting your skin to clear and to begin a healing process for skin scars and acne marks. There are also several natural and safe ways to treat hormonal acne. You can cleanse your skin twice daily with an oil-free cleanser. Daily cleansing will help to keep your skin clear of makeup, bacteria and other contaminants that can exacerbate your acne. Avoid cleansers that contain heavy soaps or scents as these can worsen your acne. It also helps to keep your skin hydrated using a moisturizer. You may think that you should avoid moisturizer in an effort to dry out your acne. However, moisturizer is actually essential to getting rid of your hormonal acne. If you don't moisturize, your skin will actually produce even more oil to make up for the dryness there.You can also use an oil-free moisturizer that won't clog your pores. You can try some home remedies for clearing hormonal acne. Mash up one clove of fresh garlic. Apply the mashed garlic to your acne and leave on overnight as this has been shown to reduce hormonal acne. You can also try mixing a solution of equal parts rose water and lime juice. Apply the mixture to your acne and leave it on for ½ hour. Rinse the solution off your face and moisturize as you normally would. A healthy diet, rich in nutrients and antioxidants can also help treat hormonal acne and maintain clear healthy skin. A nutritious diet promotes overall skin balance and health, thereby helping to eliminate your acne. Avoid caffeine, alcohol and excess sugar, all of which can exacerbate hormonal acne.

"['Real Guys Don’t Have Acne - They have Razor Bumps Right? Wrong! Real Guys Have Acne too 01-31-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski, CEO of Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments More than 60 million adults in the US are diagnosed with acne, over 50% of adult women and 25% of adult men having this skin disease. The average age of an individual with acne problem is now, 26.5, while just 10 years ago it was 20.5. So what other myths prevent men from having clear skin? Acne is only for teens. If you toughen up and wait until those uncomfortable years are gone- acne problem will go away too. Wrong! The reality is that most acne can be traced back to fluctuations in hormone levels. A common misunderstanding is that men have testosterone and women estrogen and progesterone; the truth is that both - males and females have a balance of all three hormones. The primary cause of the formation of acne is a fluctuation in androgens (male\'s hormones) and in particular testosterone, DHEAS (dihyroepiandrosterone sulfate) and DHT (dehydrotestosterone). Elevation in these hormones can lead to over secretion by the sebaceous glands and the onset of acne formation. The most common period of life when the adrenal glands start to produce these hormones is at the onset of puberty. This helps explain why oily skin and acne are so prevalent among teenagers. Naturally, since boys have more ""male"" hormones, teen acne tends to be more severe in males. If untreated, teen acne may last way after teenage years and many men may experience a fluctuation of hormones into their thirties or even forties. Untreated acne will leave them not only with skin scars but also.... psychological scars. After all men are “disadvantaged” , as they don’t routinely use makeup to cover up imperfections in their skin. There is nothing men can do about adult acne. Wrong! There are both acne treatments and health & skin care tips that can improve your skin (GSD: should probably be capped for consistency with the last section) Health and skin care tips for men Do not use performance enhancing anabolic steroids, which belong to the androgen class of hormones, as you will experience severe and persistent acne on your face and torso If you are an exercise fanatic and have acne, choose less stressful workouts that are associated with less marked hormonal fluctuations Sweat and dirt does not cause acne but can exacerbate it by facilitating inflammation that manifests itself as those pesky zits. Keep your skin clean but avoid harsh and drying soaps. Do not rub your skin as a broken skin invites bacteria. Use a mild and non-comedogenic cleanser and befriend oil-free moisturizers Food does not cause acne- it may worsen it. Try to limit those hamburgers and beer. Greasy, spicy and fried food, as well as too much sugar (as beer has) may worsen acne. Food rich in Omega -3, greens and veggies are friendly to your skin TREAT YOUR ACNE NATURALLY Remember that the ONLY way to treat acne is from inside. To really treat acne you must stop overproduction of sebum. This PREVENTS new acne from forming Choose natural ingredients (preferably herbal) over chemically based products so you can balance your body and reprogram your sebaceous gland naturally. Do your research: antibiotics and retinoids have number of adverse effects, as do salicylic acid and even peroxide.

"[""What is Women Hormonal Acne? 02-26-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The Signs to Watch For The term “hormonal acne” may be a misnomer since most acne can be traced back to fluctuations in hormone levels. A common misunderstanding is that men have testosterone and women have estrogen and progesterone; in reality, both genders have a balance of all 3. The primary culprit in the formation of acne relates to fluctuations in androgens (male hormones) and in particular testosterone, DHEAS (dihyroepiandrosterone sulfate) and DHT (dehydrotestosterone). An elevation in these hormones can lead to the overstimulation of the sebaceous glands, and as a result to an over-production of sebum (skin oil) and the onset of acne formation. Too much sebum together with dead skin cells and dirt eventually leads to clogged pores, and this provides an ideal condition for the growth of bacteria (propionibacterium acnes) which secrete chemicals into the skin that stimulate an inflammatory response. These inflammatory responses are pimples, cysts, blackheads and whiteheads. Why Acne as an Adult The most common period of life when the adrenal glands start to produce these hormones is at the onset of puberty. This helps explain why oily skin and acne are so prevalent among teenagers. But what about adult women? In many instances there is a temporal relationship to the mid-cycle of the menstrual cycle, which is often associated with the highest level of estrogen and androgens. After ovulation progesterone levels increase which can also stimulate sebaceous gland secretions. Hormones are also thought to be responsible for acne in a significant percentage of pregnant women during the third trimester when the sebaceous glands go into high gear, causing oily skin and frequent breakouts. Some women even experience acne after menopause when estrogen levels begin to taper off and testosterone becomes the dominant hormone. Finally, in some women when the balance of estrogen and androgens is unbalanced, androgens will push the sebaceous glands to over production at any age. Signs that your acne may be hormonally induced include: Adult onset acne, breakouts that appear for the first time in adults Acne flare-ups preceding or coincident with your menstrual cycle A history of irregular menstrual cycles (indicating hormonal fluctuations) Increased facial oiliness (sebaceous gland over secretion) Hirsutism (excessive growth of hair, or hair in unusual places which is known to be induced by androgens) Elevated levels of certain androgens in the blood stream Treatment Options for Women As acne in general, and specifically hormonal acne are caused by an internal imbalance the only way to treat it is indeed from the inside out. Unfortunately, too easily a widely used treatment for hormonal acne in women is the use of hormones, especially contraceptives that carry a number of potential serious effects that recently have been tragically illustrated by Diane-35 (the birth control pill used for acne treatment banned in January 2013 from Europe, the Americas and most other countries for causing deaths and other serious adverse effects). A BETTER WAY to Treat Hormonal Acne AcnEase ® is an all-natural herbal medicine that specifically inhibits the impact of fluctuating hormone levels on sebaceous gland secretions.

AcnEase ® has proven to be extremely effective in the treatment of women with cystic acne further supporting the products ability to inhibit hormonal influence on sebaceous gland excess production of sebum. AcnEase ® is the safe alternative all women suffering from hormonal acne especially those that do not want to use OC, that stopped taking OC in order to start their families and experience acne flare-ups or those that have recently had children and are experiencing changes in their skin with periodic acne.

"['Who gets cystic acne? What is it and how to treat it 02-27-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Unfortunately, cystic acne can affect anyone. Cystic acne, or nodulocystic acne, is the most severe form of acne vulgaris. Deep, inflamed breakouts develop on the face and/or other areas of the body. The blemishes themselves can become large; some may measure up to several centimeters across. Although many people use the term ""cystic"" to describe any type of severely inflamed acne, only those who develop cysts truly have cystic acne. They feel like soft, fluid-filled lumps under the skin\'s surface. Cysts can be painful as they originate deeper in the skin than typical pimples and may also commonly produce scarring. Contrary to common belief, squeezing an acne cyst can cause an even deeper infection and more painful inflammation spreading under the surface of the skin which can last much longer and lead to the development of additional cysts. Causes of Cystic Acne Cystic acne is caused by the same factors as other forms of acne, which are: overactive oil glands excess dead skin cells within the hair follicle (pore), and a large number of acne-causing bacteria, propionibacteria acnes Inflamed acne blemishes develop when the follicle wall ruptures, leaking infected material into the dermis. If this break occurs near the skin\'s surface, the blemish is usually minor and heals quickly. Deeper breaks in the follicle wall cause more serious lesions. Nodules develop when the contaminated material infects adjoining follicles. Treating Cystic Acne Since most of cystic acne is caused by an internal imbalance, AcnEase ® is the ultimate herbal remedy for cystic acne that achieves sustained effects without the use of drying and irritating external ointments or serious side effects of retinoids or antibiotics.

"['Do I Have Male Hormonal Acne? How to REALLY Treat It 03-06-2013 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments What is Male Hormonal Acne? Teenagers aren\'t the only ones who get acne - it can can effect adult men of all ages. The average age of the acne sufferer in the US increased during the last decade from 20.5 to 26.5 years old. Are You a Statistic? Acne is a manifestation of internal imbalance that leads to overproduction of sebum (skin oil) by sebaceous glands. This extra sebum together with dead cells and dirt creates an ideal condition for bacteria what in turn will cause an inflammation that presents itself as ACNE (pimples, cysts, blackheads, whiteheads etc). Hormones appear to be the primary culprit in adult male acne. The most potent stimulator of sebaceous glands are the male hormones known as androgens. While both women and men actually produce all three types of sexual hormones (testosterone, estrogen and progesterone), naturally, men ""manufacture"" much more testosterone, and therefore their cases of hormonal acne may be more severe, chronic and difficult to treat. Also, testosterone levels increase due to exercise, and since today more men are engaged in strenuous or even excessive workouts, acne became a more prevailing problem. Don\'t Struggle, Learn How to Treat It! Adult acne does not go away on its own. It needs to be treated. Yes, you can modify your lifestyle to a healthier way of life, but ultimately, if you want to really get your life back, choose an acne treatment that is proven to provide results that won\'t harm your skin further.

Test our FREE 3-step ""Smart-System"" to see which treatment will give you the best results! It takes 3-seconds! Ways to Help Control Acne: Myths & Truths As the increase in androgens is the main reason why men get acne, there are some additional factors that may exasperate the acne symptoms for different people. Paying attention to them may help control acne outbreaks, and speed up the treatment process. Controlling these factors alone however is NOT sufficient to treat and PREVENT acne - as mentioned above, you must treat it to defeat it! Diet Research suggests that increased insulin can cause inflammation in the skin, leading to breakouts. Casual observations also confirm that limiting simple carbohydrates, switching to a whole grain, low sugar diet and limiting processed foods that include sugar, can help to keep skin healthy. Good and bad fats can also play a role in helping guys to maintain clear skin. Fried food high in saturated fats are bad not only for your body, but also for your skin. Food rich in Omega-3\'s such as salmon, trout, sardines, avocado or nuts and EPA supplements can reduce the inflammation and therefore help to keep those pimples at bay. Stress Researchers believe that stress hormones can worsen acne. Certain steroid hormones, like glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens, are released during stress, and are known to cause breakouts by activating the oil glands, therefore stimulating the sebum production that may start clogging the pores. Sun Exposure There is preliminary data to suggest that several years of sun exposure may increase the skin\'s oil production (the skin tries to protect itself against over drying agents like salicylic acid, alcohol, peroxide, sun and wind). So if you live in a sunny climate , use non- comedogenic (non-pore clogging) sun protection and moisturizers . Please also note that using any type of anabolic performance enhancing products and/or testosterone boosters can lead to many problems, including severe acne. So Don\'t Delay!

"[""Acne: How to deal with holiday candy temptation 03-29-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments From jelly beans to chocolate bunnies and Cadbury eggs to Peeps, it is impossible not to be tempted with these sweet treats once a year. Yet, when you have acne, sugar is not a good friend. So how do you avoid the temptation but satisfy the craving? The good news is that when the Easter Bunny arrives, you don't have to totally ignore his gifts. But please do not dive head first in to a jelly bean bowl either. Sample! Y our skin will thank you! (1) Fill up on Fiber. Fiber actually slows the absorption of sugar, and will also keep you fuller longer. Choose some foods to eat that have a higher concentration of fiber such as dark chocolate (in moderation!), nuts, almonds, beans, passion fruits, flax or sesame seeds and bran. (2) Antioxidants and Proteins. When eaten before sugary foods, antioxidents and proteins can prevent the rapid increase in sugar level in your blood, prevent food cravings and will keep your skin less exposed to inflammation. So eat those pretty decorated hard boiled eggs and some lean meats. Antioxidants also attack free radicals that cause skin issues. (3) Vitamin C. If you opt to take supplements, you can take Vitamin C Ester which is a highly absorbable form of Vitamin C with great anti-inflammatory properties. Start by taking 500mg a day, and you can expect to see a difference within 3 months if you're also treating your acne. Foods rich in Vitamin C include tomatoes, strawberries, kiwis, guava, papaya, oranges, bell peppers, broccoli and cauliflower. (4) Emergency Tips. Should you have to deal with an unexpected outbreak, check out our Emergency Tips for Last Minute Zits . So remember, I know you want to enjoy yourself, but if you only have samplings of candy, you will be happier in the next few days when you don't have any further breakouts! Happy Holidays!

"['Adult Acne Myths: Does Acne Go Away On Its Own? 06-03-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski 0 Comments W e understand that skin problems effect almost everyone growing up, but the fact that some of us experience acne in our mid-to-late 20\'s, 30\'s, 40\'s and even 50\'s or perhaps never fully outgrow acne breakouts, is hard to accept. It is estimated that over 30% of women and more than 20% of men ages 20 to 60 (and beyond) are troubled by acne. Over 60 million people suffer from acne in the USA alone, and another 70 million experience acne related breakouts in Canada and Europe. What Causes Adult Acne? Adult acne is caused by an over production of sebum, an oily substance produced by the skin\'s sebaceous glands. Sebum clogs pores, which can support bacterial growth and inflammation. For some adults, acne breakouts are a result of a hypersensitivity to or over production of androgens (male hormones). This is a prevailing cause of acne in men and athletes of both genders as androgens are powerful stimulators of sebaceous glands. Both women and men produce testosterone, estrogen and progesterone; the difference is how much and what really is needed for different genders. It should be noted that an imbalance in both male and female hormones (estrogen) can also cause breakouts. For women, this can happen during pregnancy, perimenopause and menopause. Some medications, such as corticosteroids, and cosmetics can also contribute to the development of acne. Myths Regarding Adult Acne Adults don\'t have acne. The skin issues are related to allergies. False. Adults have acne and acne is not an allergy. Skin allergies usually manifest as hives (they will look like insects bites) or welts (red patches) related to a histamine release in the skin, whereas acne takes the form of pimples, comedones, zits, cysts, blackheads and whiteheads, which are related to an inflammatory response around the hair follicle. Adult acne cannot be treated. False. Adult acne can and should be treated. Acne can affect many aspects of a person\'s life, not just their skin. Before choosing an acne treatment, READ THE LABELS and carefully measure potential side effects against the expected results. Beware of the serious adverse effects associated with Isotretinoin (Accutane and its generic forms), long term and short term negative impact of broad spectrum antibiotics and warnings associated with Retinoids. Also, beware of promises that are to good to be true - don\'t waste your money. Acne doesn\'t occur overnight, so it won\'t go away overnight. Look for natural ingredients, clinical safety documentation and real consumer testimonials. My acne has been ""on-and-off"" for years. It will go away eventually. False. Acne will not go away on its own when left untreated or treated by products that are meant for short-term use. It can turn into chronic acne, which requires longer-term treatment because of its persistent nature. Furthermore, some short-term acne solutions may have a number of adverse side effects when used long-term. Personalized information and education on the short and long-term approaches to acne treatment and support for the psychological impacts of this long-term fight with acne are also vital to combat adult and chronic acne in a truly successful manner.

"['Why Do Guys Get Acne? 06-10-2013 Dr. Agnes P. Olszewski and Dr. James P. Gilligan 0 Comments I would like to thank Dr. Gilligan, Chief Scientific Officer at AcnEase, for collaborating with me today. So why do guys get acne? You may answer because guys don\'t take care of their skin as well as their female counterparts; or perhaps their skin hygiene maybe lacking; or maybe guys on average play more sports and sweat more. As all of the above may contribute to making men\'s acne more difficult to treat, the real answer to WHY guys get acne is because males have more testosterone! By understanding how acne pimples form, this answer may begin to make more sense. Acne in general develops due to overactive sebaceous glands. At the base of each hair follicle is a gland called the sebaceous gland, which makes sebum (skin oil). Sebaceous glands are most numerous on the face, chest, back, neck and scalp; consequently, these are the most common sites of acne. Under normal conditions, sebum flows to the surface of the skin along the hair follicle (figure 1). For an individual with acne, the normal transport of sebum out of the follicle is impeded which leads to an accumulation of sebum and dead skin cells providing an enriched breeding ground for bacteria. Simple cleansing with soap is not capable of removing the bacteria entrapped at the base of the hair follicle. The rapid growth of the bacteria, in combination with the accumulated sebum, cause the follicle to enlarge and can result in a mild form of acne called comedones (Figure 2). The real culprit responsible for acne therefore, is over active sebaceous glands - so why is this considered a ""guy thing""? A number of factors can cause an increase in sebaceous gland secretions, but the primary culprit is the androgen hormones - in particular the analogs of testosterone, dehydrotestotsterone (DHT) and dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) which are thought to have the most dramatic impact on sebaceous gland secretions . Understanding that androgen related hormones can influence sebaceous gland secretions is only part of the story. Only 1-2% of these hormones circulate freely in the blood; the other 98% are bound to a protein called Sex Hormone Binding Globulin ( SHBG ). If the androgen hormones are bound to SHBG in the blood they will not cause acne, it is only the ""free form"" of DHT and DHEAS that can cause the sebaceous glands to make more sebum. Since men naturally have more testosterone related hormones in their bodies, it is more likely that more of the analogs (DHT & DHEAS) may be found in the free form leading to an increased risk of acne. Understanding how these analogs of testosterone impact sebaceous gland secretions also helps explain why guys who take anabolic steroids are prone to acne as well since these anabolic hormones do not bind to SHBG! So, if you are a guy with acne, you now know that you have it because guys have more testosterone. What is more important is that you can get rid of acne by balancing your body with natural and safe products (not with chemically laden products that will only create other problems) to ensure that DHT and DHEAS are not in the free form. In addition, inflammation caused by acne bacteria growing in the clogged pores can be decreased by the right skincare and lifestyle practices. Join us next time to learn How Guys Can Get Rid of Their Acne.

"[""How to Get Enough Vitamin D to Help with Acne 08-28-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments While there are many vitamins that are beneficial to your skin’s health, vitamin D stands out among them as your ally in fighting acne. Vitamin D is also known as the “sunshine vitamin”, and there are several reasons why it should be incorporated into your daily skincare regimen. Vitamin D can help regulate your body’s insulin response, which decreases hormonal acne, relieves inflammation, increases antioxidant production and strengthens your immune system. All of these factors contribute to healthy skin. In addition, vitamin D is recognized for improving your mood and decreasing depression. This may assist in managing stress levels and therefore lower amounts of cortisol, a hormone, which leads to acne. It is estimated that almost half of the world’s population is deficient in vitamin D. This is an astounding number when you consider that your body manufactures this vitamin from minimal sun exposure. What is Vitamin D? Vitamin D is special because it is the only vitamin that is produced by your body. Once it is manufactured, it is turned into the hormone calcitriol. Your body creates vitamin D through your skins exposure to the sun. However, your body cannot create enough to meet its needs and it is imperative to obtain additional amounts from other sources including foods rich in vitamin D, and supplements. Calcitriol is important to the body because it regulates calcium and phosphate levels, which strengthen and promote bone density. In addition, vitamin D affects the other hormones in your body. If there isn’t enough calcitriol present, the other hormones try to compensate which can lead to increased activity in the sebaceous glands and an overproduction of sebum (skin oil). This, in turn, causes acne. Acne is further exacerbated by a lack of calcitriol, which decreases cell turnover, clogging pores with dead skin cells. Cell renewal is dependent on vitamin D. Benefits of Vitamin D to Your Skin Improves Sensitivity to Insulin Vitamin D controls your body’s response to insulin, a hormone created in the pancreas. In-sulin allows your body to use the sugar that you get from eating carbs for energy or store it for later use. Insulin helps your blood sugar level from getting too high or too low. When there is minimal insulin in the body, our body uses fat instead of glucose as an energy source. Insulin resistance occurs when the body fails to respond to the hormone insulin and your body fails to use it for its intended purposes, which leads to an excess of insulin in the body and high blood sugar. Insulin, along with other hormones, stimulates the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum that may lead to acne or exacerbate acne that is already present. Relieves Inflammation Vitamin D reduces inflammation and therefore helps minimize the appearance of acne by reducing redness and swelling. Increases the Production of Antioxidants Vitamin D helps the body manufacture its own antioxidants which protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals and help clear blocked pores, leading to smoother, softer and clearer skin. Free radicals weaken cell structure and cause cell mutation. Other Benefits to the Entire Body Vitamin D boosts and strengthens the immune system. In the winter months, as our bodies get less and less exposure to sunlight, our Vitamin D stores diminish, making it easier to catch colds and influenza. Vitamin D helps our bodies fight bacteria and prevents degenerative dis-eases. It is recognized as an ally in fighting cancer as it helps minimize cancer cell reproduc-tion. Vitamin D is the primary component behind calcium absorption, preventing osteoporosis. It may also improve moods, decrease depression and stress levels by increasing the amount of the hormone cortisol. How to Get Enough Vitamin D Your first line of defense is to get Vitamin D naturally, from the sun. Also try to incorporate foods that are rich in Vitamin D into your diet. Lastly, if you are unable to meet the daily re-quirements from these sources, take a supplement to ensure that you are getting the recom-mended daily dose. It is recommended that you first try to obtain your daily dose of Vitamin D from the sun. Your body gets all it needs for several days within 15 minutes of full body sun exposure. Try to get at least 15 minutes, 3 times a week if you have fair skin, and 10 minutes longer if you have dark skin. It is recommended that you expose 40% of your body for maximum effectiveness. Avoid sunscreen during these initial few minutes of vitamin D restoration as it prevents the skin from being able to produce vitamin D. If you plan on exposing your skin longer than that, apply a non-comedogenic sunscreen that is free of parabens and other harsh chemicals immediately after the initial 15 minutes. Try to eat foods that are high in vitamin D, including liver, cod liver oil, salmon, tuna, mack-erel, oysters, eggs and mushrooms. It is difficult to get enough vitamin D through food alone, even fortified products, so don’t be dismayed. During winter months or times when you are unable to get the recommended amount of sun exposure, it is suggested that you take a supplement or liquid. 2,000-4,000 IU per day is con-sidered a safe and effective dose. To be certain, have your blood tested by your general physi-cian (or for women, your OB/GYN) to find out exactly how much your body needs. When select-ing a supplement, choose d3 as opposed to d2. D3 is cholecalciferol, which is the closest to the natural vitamin D that your skin produces from sun exposure. Also, make sure that the supple-ment (or liquid) is free of harsh chemical additives, especially magnesium stearate. Magnesium stearate is used to keep the contents from sticking to the inside of the capsule. What compa-nies don’t disclose is that it inhibits the absorption of vitamin C, and contains bpa, calcium hy-droxide and irganox 110, which are ingredients that cause damage to your body by weakening your intestinal wall, inhibiting food absorption and gut damage. Keep in mind that as you age and gain weight, your body produces less vitamin D. There-fore, your needs will change over time. Vitamin D alone will not heal your acne. It is important to eat a balanced diet, get plenty of sleep, follow your skin care regimen, and take your daily dose of AcnEase®. AcnEase® is your strongest defense for healing your skin and eliminating future acne. It counteracts the effects of hormonal imbalance and the overproduction of sebum. Hormonal imbalance is the leading cause of over-stimulation of the sebaceous gland and excess sebum production. Ex-cess sebum, dead skin cells, and dirt and debris on the surface of the skin mix together to cre-ate the perfect environment for acne bacteria and inflammation, which begins the acne cy-cle. Most of you are already aware of the extraordinary benefits of AcnEase®, so we en-courage you to incorporate Vitamin D into your daily routine and let us know your results.

"[""How to Use this Superfood in Your Fight Against Acne 08-31-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments The Back to School and Fall season can be very stressful and busy, especially after the lazy days of summer. Although it can be an exciting time of year too, it can also wreak havoc on your immune system and your skin. Germs are everywhere, especially in the school environment and it’s difficult to stay away from them. By incorporating high-antioxidant foods like the MAQUI BERRY into your diet, your chances of keeping germs and illness at bay and obtaining clear, healthy skin improve significantly. And the best part is, it’s easy to do! If you’re like most people, you are probably unfamiliar with this newly popularized super berry. The maqui berry, pronounced MAH-key, grows prolifically in certain parts of South America and is renowned for having the highest levels of antioxidants ever tested, to date. Let’s look into this amazing super berry, the benefits for you and your skin and how you can incorporate it into your daily routine. What is a Maqui Berry? The maqui berry is a super fruit, different than other super fruits and super berries as it is not cultivated, but grows prolifically in the wild. The berry is predominantly found in Patagonia on the Andes Mountains of Southern Argentina and Chile, a sparsely populated area with rich volcanic soil, free of harmful pollutants. The maqui berry is slightly sweet and tart, with a taste profile similar to a blackberry, blueberry and acai. It is also known as the chilean wineberry or rainforest blueberry due to its deep purple color. It is best to purchase the maqui berry in its powder form, preferably freeze-dried. The freeze-dried version is ten times as concentrated as the regular dried version and protects the compounds from heat damage in which valuable nutrition is lost. Why is it so great? The maqui berry has the highest content of anti-oxidant rich nutrients of all of the super fruits. Antioxidants are a critical component to your overall health. Although your body produces some antioxidants during normal body processes, it still needs additional antioxidants from a healthy diet of nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables. Antioxidants are beneficial to our skin for a multitude of reasons. Markedly, they slow down premature aging, fight and neutralize free radicals (the compounds produced by metabolism and exposure to toxins and radiation) which cause DNA damage as well as wrinkles and fine lines, and they nourish the skin cells, leaving you with healthy, glowing skin. In addition to Vitamin C, the maqui berry contains anthocyanin, polyphenol, coumarin, cyanidin and triterpene. Together, these antioxidants have the following properties and benefits that are impossible to ignore: anti-inflammatory fights against cancer anti-viral and anti-microbial reduce high blood pressure reduce risk of heart and cardiovascular disease fights against diabetes anti-tumor fight alzheimers neuroprotective inhibits obesity promotes wound healing has expectorant qualities In addition, the nutrients found in the maqui berry boost the immune system, strengthen bones and joints, renew eyesight, increase brain function and promote clear, healthy skin by renewing skin cells and lessening the impact of aging, all essential in your Fall and Back to School routine. How to Incorporate Maqui Berry into Your Diet It can be easy to incorporate this powerful ingredient into your daily diet. The recommended serving for adults is 1-2 teaspoons of powder per day and children should have 1/2 of that. The daily serving can be consumed as a juice, smoothie, blended into baked goods, or a variety of other ways. Supplements are also available but please read the ingredients first and make sure the product is organic and does not contain any additives or unwanted ingredients. There are no side effects associated with the maqui berry and the taste is relatively mild, so experiment in your kitchen, determine what is right for you and your family and have fun with this new addition. Maqui Berry Juice Blend 1/2 tablespoon powder with 2 cups of cold water in a blender. Strain the seeds or fiber through a fine mesh sieve. Serve chilled and add sweetener if desired. Keep any leftovers in the fridge. Maqui Berry Smoothie 2 frozen bananas 1 tablespoon maqui berry powder 2 cups coconut milk (boxed – without carrageenan) 1 cup frozen peaches, blueberries or mixed berries sweetener if desired Blend all ingredients until smooth and serve. Don’t forget to take your AcnEase® regularly - this is your first step in fighting and healing your acne. A daily dose of AcnEase® works under the surface of the skin to neutralize excess hormones, leaving the surface of your skin clean, healthy and ultimately acne-free. AcnEase® is an all-botanical ingredient based formula so you don’t have to worry about any side effects due to harsh chemicals. It can be used by anyone, teens or adults, males or females, or pregnant or nursing mothers.

"[""7 Easy Tips That Have a MAJOR Impact on Decreasing Acne Breakouts 09-11-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments Often times when we have acne, we’ll do anything to find (and try) products that will make it go away, quickly and easily. At first, we usually don’t consider some of the contributing factors that can make it worse. We actually spend more time trying different products in hopes that something works, and less time on analyzing how our daily habits could be affecting our skin. Daily habits are so routine that we do them without notice sometimes. Habits can be tough to change but with practice, research shows that adjusting them can have a MAJOR impact on decreasing acne breakouts. So let’s get right into it! 1. WASH YOUR FACE PROPERLY Before washing your face, wash your hands. Always remember to use a clean wash cloth, if using, and towel. When engaging in normal activities that don’t involve exercising and sweating, wash your face twice a day, in the morning and again before bed (if you exercise or excessively sweat from an activity, do your best to wash your face and body as soon as possible). Using warm tap water and a mild cleanser, gently wash your face, neck and décolletage, in a circular motion for 30 to 60 seconds. Only exfoliate your skin once or twice per week. If you have active acne, avoid exfoliating until the cysts heal. If you have whiteheads and/or blackheads, only exfoliate once a week. 2. ALWAYS WASH YOUR SKIN AFTER SWEATING Always wash your face and skin after sweating or intense physical activities. Try to wash your face immediately after a workout or extended periods outside when you develop a sweat. Don’t let sweat dry on your skin, as this can lead to clogged pores and breakouts. 3. DON’T TOUCH, SQUEEZE OR POP PIMPLES...“SPOT TREAT” INSTEAD! Avoid touching pimples, which can cause deeper problems and lengthen the amount of time needed for your acne to heal properly. Popping or squeezing blemishes may increase inflammation, damage the cells, and push bacteria further down into your skin. If the skin damage is deep, it can lead to permanent scarring. Instead of popping and squeezing, “spot treat” ( learn more here on how to do this ) – for example, dip a cotton swab in tea tree oil or in pharmaceutical grade hydrogen peroxide and dab it on the pimple(s) 3 times a day. Use sparsely and only on the pimple(s). Follow with a green concealer (to counteract the redness) and then a concealer on top of that that matches your skin tone. 4. AVOID DIRTY CELL PHONES AND HANDS Always make sure your hands and cell phone are clean before touching them to your face. Your cell phone is a breeding ground for bacteria and a depository for oil and dirt. Wipe your cell phone frequently with antibacterial wipes or isopropyl alcohol (a great disinfectant) and try to avoid touching your face with your hands or any other object. Make it a routine! Earbuds are a great alternative for this common problem. It is a good rule to assume your hands and cell phone are dirty unless they have been cleaned recently. Every time you touch something, the germs on your hands and fingers transfer to and from objects. Because the dirt and germs are often too small to notice, we assume that the everyday objects we come into contact with are clean. Some common items in addition to cell phones include your computers, keyboards, iPads, iPods, other electronic devices, keys, credit cards, computer bags, etc. Be sure to clean these items with antibacterial wipes or isopropyl alcohol (be careful not ruin your electronics) as often as possible. 5. USE HAIR PRODUCTS WISELY Try to keep hair products away from your hair line. During the day, they may seep down onto your face (you probably won’t even notice this happening), blocking your pores and causing acne. Also avoid getting fine-mist products on your skin. Often, when spraying hair spray or other products, it inevitably settles on your face and other exposed areas which can additionally lead to clogged pores and acne. Try to cover your face with a washcloth before using products with this type of application and move out of the “spray zone” long enough to let the products dissipate from the air. Also try to buy oil-free, non-comedogenic products which will minimize the negative effects if it does get on your skin. 6. CHOOSE AND USE MAKEUP PRODUCTS WISELY The biggest concern with makeup is that it is often applied and worn on a daily basis. Therefore, it is highly beneficial to your skin’s health to use non-comedogenic make-up, which won’t clog your pores. Always remember, less is best when applying makeup. The more makeup that you apply to your skin, the greater your chances of clogged pores and breakouts. Lastly, remember to always remove the makeup before cleansing your skin. These are two separate steps in your skincare regimen. 7. DO NOT SKIP OR STOP YOUR ACNE TREATMENT For those on AcnEase®, it is essential to not skip any doses. Compliance is key! Acne is a disease and must be treated in order to break the cycle. By skipping a treatment, stopping it too early, or using it irregularly, the product is not given ample time to perform its job. What is seen on the surface of your skin is not indicative of what is happening under the skins surface. The pimple formation may take up to 14 days. When the sebaceous glands overproduce sebum, it takes time to balance their activity levels and return them to normal levels. With AcnEase®, your body is changing how it responds to the hormones in your body and this takes several weeks, sometimes months, for the results to appear on the outside. These simple tips will help ensure your skin is as clean as possible so that AcnEase® can do its job. The cleaner your skin, the less likely you are to suffer from acne. However, that principle works best when you are committed to your skins health and are taking the necessary steps to make acne-free skin a priority in your life. If you aren’t already using AcnEase®, it’s the best natural way to eliminate acne and break the acne cycle. Our 100% botanical ingredient based treatment has a 96% proven success rate, with zero side effects and it can be taken by anyone...men or women, teens or adults, pregnant* or nursing** mothers. Please share with us any comments or tips that you use to keep your skin clean. We would love to hear from you! ** Always consult with your physician about ANY supplement or medication you plan to take if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are nursing.

"[""10 Beliefs Not to Listen to When You Have Acne 09-23-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments For those that don’t experience living with acne, the problems acne-sufferers face may seem minor and cosmetic. Because there is no proven cure for acne, people have been left to treat only the symptoms. Along the way, many myths and false beliefs have been developed, from the highly debated to the downright comedic. Here are just a few...have a look and see if any sound familiar to you! “Just pop it so it goes away!” At the sight of a breakout, many people get the initial urge to get rid of blemishes and move on. While popping a pimple may provide some immediate gratification, the lasting effects can be far more damaging. When you pop, the skin is torn open which creates an even larger opportunity for harmful bacteria to enter and often results in more blemishes, not to mention scarring. It’s always best to let breakouts run their natural course, and most will disappear in approximately 3-7 days. “Acne only happens to people with oily skin.” Normal, dry, oily, or combination skin-there is not a single one in the bunch that could be considered 100% safe from experiencing acne. While oil production is one of the main causes of acne, dead skin cells, clogged pores, and bacteria also contribute to the problem and these are all seen within various skin types. Whatever your type, finding a regimen that works for you is important. “Why don’t you want to go out tonight? Just put on some concealer and no one will notice.” Acne can be uncomfortable, both physically and socially. For those that experience cystic acne, the deep bumps under your skin and the area surrounding the breakout can be painful to the touch. On top of that, no one wants to go out just to feel self-conscious about whether or not their concealer is caking or creasing. It is extremely important to allow skin to breathe when broken out, and it’s always advised to give your face a break from makeup if possible. If you’re really not feeling it, it’s totally OK to stay in once in awhile. Curl up with a good movie or book and give you, and your complexion, a break. “Just have a few bites of this delicious food, it’s not going to do that much damage!” A constant topic of debate amongst the acne ridden is the comfort food quandary, which ultimately comes down to a personal choice: should I have some, or not. While comfort foods such as pizza, burgers, french fries, and the like do not cause acne, they can lead to breakouts IF too much is eaten in one day (if you have the willpower to cut yourself off at a bite or so, great!). There is always another option. Let the burgers and fries come to you, and make them at home by substituting all the heavy grease and calories with alternatives like organic beef, grilled onions using coconut oil, no cheese, ketchup, pickles and an organic whole wheat bun. Make your own fries – cut up some potatoes, drizzle with coconut or olive oil, sprinkle with sea salt and bake in the oven – voila! Just watch your portions. “Exercise and sweat may increase breakouts!” Exercise in moderation is a great way to get your blood flowing which brings oxygen, a natural collagen-producing anti-inflammatory, to the skin’s surface and also allows impurities to be flushed out of the pores. As with any good practice, hygiene and not overdoing it is key, especially when open pores are involved. Always remember to keep hands and hair off of the face and clean the skin immediately after a workout. If you’re in a hurry and don’t have time to shower, a swipe of toner or witch hazel on acne-prone areas will help. “Tanning will definitely dry out your pimples.” Ask any dermatologist and they will all agree: tanning is not recommended to treat acne – nor is it good for your overall skin health. The illusion that breakouts disappear with sun exposure is actually just a result of the skin around the blemish becoming darker, camouflaging rather than treating the problem. The vitamin D your body creates when exposed to the sun, however, is an essential ally in the fight against acne. Vitamin D decreases hormonal acne by regulating insulin levels, increases antioxidant production, and strengthens the immune system, which all contribute to having healthy skin. Again, everything in moderation. Too much can lead to issues. “They’re just pimples, don’t get so upset.” The physical effects of acne are obvious, but what many people who do not live with acne don’t know is that the psychological effects can produce scars of their own. Self-esteem and self-confidence are often low and body image issues are plenty. This causes many to isolate, withdraw from social situations, and in some cases become clinically depressed. Much like the treatment for acne, a truly positive self-image begins within. “Toothpaste on pimples will make them go away.” This at-home treatment remedy has been around for ages. Although the basic properties found in toothpaste can certainly be used to dry out pimples, it can actually end up causing more irritation on the skin surrounding the blemish. There is no proof that toothpaste works any better than treatments intended for acne, so stick with the professional tools and keep the paste on those pearly whites. “Sorry, I can’t kiss you or I’ll get acne too!” Acne is not contagious! If someone doesn’t want to kiss you out of fear of “catching” acne, you deserve to be kissing someone much cooler. “Try washing your face more often.” A major myth surrounding acne is that acne prone people are unhygienic. While good hygiene is a major tool in keeping breakouts at bay, no one can simply wash their face enough times and immediately be rid of acne. Over-washing comes with its own set of problems including irritation, sensitivity, and increased oil production. Acne is typically the result of a hormonal imbalance, causing the sebaceous glands (which control oil production) to go crazy. AcnEase® works to manage the relationship between hormones and sebaceous glands, allowing the glands to produce oil at a normal rate, naturally eliminating acne symptoms and simultaneously preventing new breakouts.

"[""An Easy DIY Trick to Fight Blackheads 10-29-2015 Herborium Group, Inc. 0 Comments For many with acne, the pesky bumps that come with the territory can be an endless source of frustration. The symptom of the acne condition appears on the skin as pimples, whiteheads, and blackheads, each coming with their own set of problems when looking to eliminate. Typically, when a pimple appears on the skin, its natural course will run from anywhere between 3-7 days before disappearing. In the case of whiteheads and blackheads (a form of acne) , however, the clogged pore never quite reaches an inflamed state, making it much harder to treat, or even temporarily conceal with makeup or spot treatments. Many are tempted to pick at or squeeze the infected area, which can lead to irritation or even infection. Others reach for a more harsh solution to remedy their woes, turning to pore strips, or even chemical peels to erase these annoying occurrences. What many people don’t know is that an easy and effective alternative can probably be found right in their own kitchens. With just three common, inexpensive ingredients, this humble recipe is a real contender in fighting off stubborn blackheads, leaving your pores clean and your skin soft and smooth. All you need is lemon, salt, and warm water. More effective than anything you’ll buy in the store, this simple trick, intended ONLY for oily or combination skin, can safely be applied two to three times a week, and will break down those nasty blackheads and keep them from returning. How? Here’s the breakdown: Ingredients Salt is an antibacterial agent that helps cleanse and unclog the pores. People have been turning to the antibacterial properties of salt to treat their acne for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians would use water from the Dead Sea, known for having a high saline content, for its skin clearing benefits. With a coarse grain, salt works as a wonderful, natural way to remove dead cells from the skin, an essential step in avoiding acne breakouts. Paired with excess sebum, an oily substance, dead skin cells can lead to clogged pores, which then oxidize, leading to blackheads. Exfoliation is an important step in the ritual of keeping skin clear and smooth. Lemon juice contains citric acid which helps fight off germs and bacteria, thus cleaning the skin. As blackheads are actually clogged pores still open to the air, unlike a pimple or whitehead, which are both closed by the skin, the citric acid can actually pull dirt and grime from clogged pores that commonly lead to breakouts. With antiseptic properties, the juice of a lemon can work as an astringent when applied topically to targeted areas of the skin. Lemon juice is also rich in vitamin C, and works as a natural and safe alternative to chemical solutions in addressing dark spots or sun spots. Warm water helps open up your pores, allowing the previous ingredients to get in there and work their magic. All together, it’s like an expensive chemical peel but not nearly as bad for you. Instructions To make the mixture, just follow these simple steps! In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of sea salt, 1/2 a teaspoon of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of warm water. Using clean (washed) hands, apply the mixture to a freshly washed face, applying more to the area with blackheads. Next, using a clean cloth soaked in warm water, slowly work the mixture into your skin in a circular motion like you’re waxing a car. Wax on, wax off. Massage ONLY the affected area of your skin with the warm cloth for 5 minutes. Rewarm the cloth if it starts cooling off - about a minute in the microwave will do. Be sure to gently massage, rather than rub the skin, as harsh scrubbing may cause micro-abrasions. Allow the mixture to sit on your skin for another 5 minutes, then wash your face off with warm water. Apply moisturizer after. If you care for more of an exfoliating experience, try pouring table salt directly onto the cut surface of each lemon half. Knead the half to loosen up any lemon juices, and rub directly onto affected areas of the skin for a soft, clean finish. Important Considerations Before Trying This recipe may cause irritation for those with sensitive skin, so we don’t recommend it for those with sensitive skin or for those who have open cysts. As always, keep your skin in mind when attempting to do any at-home treatments, and remove immediately if irritation occurs. This mask recipe is intended to aid as a supplement to your established skincare routine, and is not a permanent solution, but serves as an affordable, easy, at-home DIY trick to target stubborn blackheads. It is important to remember to apply this scrub to the affected areas only, and always be sure to use a clean towel, hands, and face when applying. While dirt, grime and bacteria can clog pores, leading to breakouts, acne is typically the result of a hormonal imbalance, causing the sebaceous glands (which control oil production) to go crazy, which is why it is important to treat the problem from the inside, as well as out. AcnEase® works to manage the relationship between hormones and sebaceous glands, allowing the glands to produce oil at a normal rate, naturally eliminating acne symptoms and simultaneously preventing new breakouts. AcnEase® is an all-natural, herbal acne treatment that stops acne before it starts by counteracting the effects of hormonal imbalance and the overproduction of sebum, making it a safe and effective solution for all of your acne concerns.
