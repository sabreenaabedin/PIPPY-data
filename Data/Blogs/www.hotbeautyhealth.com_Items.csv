"['The excitement of a road trip can sometimes be slightly dimmed by the difficulty over what to pack. While on one hand you may be willing to travel light, on the other, you don’t want to be relentlessly berating yourself for the items you left behind. So whether you are planning to drive across a state or across the continent, here is a road trip packing list of 50 essential items that you need to take with you: Road Trip Packing List: 50 Essentials 1. Music/Playlist: Your mood is likely to change quicker than you think, especially when you get into unlucky situations. So before you even put key in the ignition , ensure that you have at least 30 playlists for the trip. I mean serious, what’s a road trip without music. If you need a fresh set of tunes, try Tune In Radio app at Apple iTunes or Google Play . You can choose from list of 50,000 radio stations from around the globe. This is also an opportunity to learn the names of new artists. Don’t forget your headphones! 2. First Aid Kit: Whether you accidentally cut yourself while gathering wood for a camp fire or you have just eaten a wrong snack on the road, first aid kit will come in handy than you think. 3. Camera: You will need to take some photos to remember the trip and memorize that delighted look on your face when you reached your favorite destination ( Great gift idea! See Amazon’s Most Wished For List ). 4. Snacks/Food: Your wallets will get empty sooner than you think when you are constantly eating out. Though eating at different restaurants is often one of the most exciting parts of a road trip, you can always do your wallet and health a favor by carrying your own snacks/food. 5. Mosquito Spray: Gotta keep the bugs away! 6. Sunglasses: To protect your eyes from those harmful UV rays. Definitely a must! 7. Hand Sanitizers: You can’t predict the amount of dirt your hands will be exposed to. 8. Auto Essentials: A spare tire and some motor oil, among other motor essentials can help you a great deal when you wind up with a minor accident or when you misjudge the distance from destination A to B. 9. Sleeping Gear: There are unprecedented numbers of places that you can sleep under the stars if you wish not to waste your hard earned cash staying in a hotel every night? If you do need to stay in a hotel, I would suggest booking a room in advance, through Vacay Bookings . At least you can save some money with their price comparison search engine. 10. National Identification card or Driver’s License: These will confirm that you are indeed a homosapien who pay bills and taxes. 11. Travel Alarm Clock: Hotel wake up calls can sometimes be bothersome. You need a familiar sound that will wake you up without a problem. 12. Good Friends: Your company is ultimately what will make your road trip worth it. 13. Portable Power Device: To keep your phone and tablet charged at your convenience take a portable charger . Never rely on rest stops and hotels to recharge your electronic essentials. 14. Journal: A record of those weird local jokes, breakthroughs, surroundings, and thoughts will help you process them later. 15. Keys: You cannot afford to get very far without them. 16. GPS: Your phone’s GPS will be great until you find yourself in No man’s land with no internet or network coverage, and worse a drained battery. So, I don’t recommend using your phone’s GPS. Instead, A GPS like Garmin or TomTom will come in handy when you hit heavy traffic and need to find alternate routes. 17. Sofa Cushions: No matter the number of songs that you listen to or the number of stories you tell, eventually boredom will set in. This is the time that your friends in the backseat will need to build a fort out of the cushions. 18. Map: Navigating your destinations with a real map is not only a fun challenge but makes you feel like a real explorer as well. 19. Phone: Besides updating your friends about the destination that you will be spending a given night, you can jam to your favorite music playlist while updating your Instagram feed from the road. 20. Sunscreen: A road trip without sun protection is a recipe for disaster. Be sure to lather up on sunscreen periodically throughout the trip. 21. Water: You have to stay hydrated throughout the trip. Don’t even think about soda or juice ; they will make thirst worse. 22. Extra set of Keys: You never know when you will lose the set you are used to. 23. Binoculars: There will be several moments when you will want to whip out your binoculars to get a clearer look at stuff off in the distance. 24. Appetite: You will be snacking on those chemically loaded snacks you never thought you would, under normal situations, put in your precious body. 25. Hygiene Bag: You will hardly come by showers while on the road. A hygiene bag with deodorant and towelettes will help cover those unfriendly stenches of sweat. Also bring eco-friendly shampoo and shower soap if you’re lucky enough to stumble upon a lake or outdoor shower. 26. Safety Pins: To mend some of your wardrobe malfunctions, clasp the zippers of your day packs together, tack your kid’s pant legs, especially when they are hiking through a mucky terrain among other uses. 27. Pocket Knife: You cannot simply count the number of times that you will use or need to use a pocket knife . 28. Lucky Charm: To keep you free from those bad road juju. For ladies, this will allow you to easily find keys amidst piles of lip glosses, hum packs and old movie stubs. It’s a great item to add to your road trip packing list. 29. Games and activity sets: A deck of cards or backgammon will break up the monotony of the trip. 30. Roadside Emergency Kit: This kit will come in handy in case something goes wrong. 31. Rain Gear: People get rained on even in the desert! A rain gear or waterproof jacket will be useful when you visit misty destinations as well. 32. Tote Bag: To toss around picnic and beach items. You can also use them to cordon off dirty laundry items in your suitcase to preserve the freshness of the unused items. 33. Comfortable items: Wearing comfortable clothes during your time in the car is a given but you should also bring a blanket or a sweater in case you travel through a mountainous area at night or you disagree about an appropriate level of air conditioning with your travel mates. 34. Reading materials: A book or magazine will help you pass time, especially if you like reading. 35. Folding Shovel: A definite must-have in my road trip essentials list. You may need a folding shovel to dig out your truck’s tires from unexpected snow or to fill spots where you are stuck in the mud. 36. Good Walking Shoes: Though this sound like a normal road trip gear, you will seriously need them, especially if you find yourself wandering in grounds where flip-flops or flimsy shoes just won’t do. 37. Travel Mug: To stash transport sunglasses and other delicate souvenirs in your hotel room. Remember, a coffee-stained mug is an unlikely target for thieves. 38. Garbage bags: When you plan a long drive, it is always a great idea to have a few garbage bags to empty trash after each day’s drive. 39. Toilet paper: This will be very handy whenever you think about having that Big Gulp from 7-Eleven. 40. Voting system: To guide you and your team on how you decide on when to stop or where to eat. 41. Silicone Travel Bottles: Generally, TSA-approved mini travel bottles are often considered old news to any avid road traveler. 42. Duct Tape: From bandaging your exploded items to removing lint from your clothing, duct tape will always earn its all-purpose reputation. 43. A cooler: To stuff restaurant leftovers, roadside snacks, soda and anything you want to keep cold. This is a lot cheaper than constantly buying beverages and related food stuffs at roadside stops or gas stations. 44. Underwear: Bring more of them (even 10 more pairs) than you would practically need. 45. Positive Attitude: Nasty things that will push your buttons will obviously happen on the road. You need just to have a positive attitude and remember that pretty soon you will be back home on your comfortable couch. 46. Bandana: The list of obvious uses for this versatile carry-on is long—you can use it as a lens cleaner, hair tie, hand towel, scarf, head band or a cooling devise (when you dampen it). 47. Ziploc Bags: To prevent sandy beachwear from soiling your items and to protect some of your delicate clothing from snags. 48. Multi socket Power strip: This will help you charge most of your electronics at a go. Besides, plugging all your electronic in the same place, a multi socket power strip lessens your chances of leaving any behind. 49. Disinfectant Spray: It’s convenient when you plan to stop by public places like a restaurant or hotel. 50. Plan B: No matter how prepared you are, sometimes a road trip may not work out. Reveal your alternate vacation plan early to avoid crying out loud if things don’t go as planned. Your road trip packing list plays a major role in the outcome of your road trip, especially if you are not used to long trips. Remember to always be well-prepared and hopefully this road trip essentials list will help make packing easier for you.

"['I’ve been hearing a lot about the Ketogenic diet since the beginning of the year and now it’s become so popular. Never heard of the keto diet before? Well, it’s a low carb, high fat diet. I would say that it’s very similar to the Atkins diet that gained popularity in the early to mid 2000’s. It involves eating less carbs and replacing it with fat which then helps your body burn fat like crazy. For more detailed info on how the process works, you should read this guide from Ruled.me .

"['Mosquitoes…ugh! We all hate seeing them around the house and will do anything to prevent them from coming inside our homes. As the weather warms up, these pesky critters can become extremely irritating to both you and your pets inside and outside your home and they can cause certain health problems too since they carry serious diseases. Of course there are numerous chemical sprays on the market that you can use to get rid of mosquitoes, but these commercial products contain toxins that can cause various other medical problems that are detrimental to your health. Your other option for getting rid of mosquitoes is to go for the natural alternatives like the following 11 mosquito repellent plants that work just as well as any commercial product available. I’ve used a few of these mosquito repellent plants in my home last summer and I was able to relax without the fear of getting bitten. Popular Posts Now 15 Air-Purifying Plants You Need in Your Home 11 Unexpected Ways to Decorate Your Home With Plants 1. Lavender Lavender is a beautiful purple plant that gives off an equally beautiful scent, but did you know that it does wonders for keeping those annoying mosquitoes away? Although pleasant to you, the aromatic smell of lavender is repugnant to mosquitoes and will stop them from attacking you both indoors and outdoors. Plant it directly in your garden or in pots close to doors and windows to keep mosquitoes at bay. Crushing the leaves and rubbing them directly onto your exposed skin will give you even more protection against these pesky critters. 2. Marigolds These pretty, colorful little flowers with their strong, aromatic smell, are also great to use as mosquito repellents. The reason for this is because marigolds contain a substance called pyrethrum, an ingredient used in numerous commercial insect repellents. Positioned in pots around the doors and windows of your home will look great, but will form an invisible barrier that will stop mosquitoes from entering your home. 3. Mint Besides its refreshing, clean “minty” smell that is way better than the chemical smell of any commercial insect spray, mint is also an effective, natural mosquito repellent. According to a report by the Malaria Journal, studies conducted showed that mint, when applied to exposed body parts, stopped mosquitoes from settling on the skin. It was also discovered from these studies, that mosquito larva died a day after being sprayed with a mixture of water and peppermint oil. 4. Lemon Balm With the leaves having the scent of lemon with a slight minty smell, it is no surprise that lemon balm is part of the mint family. Apart from its many healing properties, lemon balm is also used by many people to keep mosquitoes at bay. If mosquitoes are making your life miserable, crush a few lemon balm leaves between your fingers and rub them onto any exposed skin. Grow lemon balm close to your doors and you will have a quick and easy mosquito repellent handy to use indoors as well. 5. Catnip Besides being hugely attractive to cats, catnip is also deemed to be one of the most effective natural insect repellents around. This particular plant contains nepetalactone, a natural chemical which is effective as both a cat attractant and insect repellent. According to the American Chemical Society, one of several studies conducted discovered that catnip is in fact, about ten times more successful than DEET at repelling mosquitoes. Apart from growing catnip to repel mosquitoes, you can apply the crushed leaves to your exposed skin for maximum protection against mosquito bites. 6. Citronella Like many other people, you probably also use citronella candles to ward of mosquitoes, but do you know that they contain harmful chemicals that can be damaging to your health? More effective and with no risk to your health at all, is the citronella plant (citrosum), frequently referred to as the mosquito plant, that you can grow in your garden to use as a mosquito repellent and when you need to. The citronella scent is found in the leaves of the plant and when crushed and applied to the skin, helps to repel mosquitoes. 7. Rosemary While this lovely flowering plant is frequently used to flavor food, it is also extremely effective at repelling mosquitoes. Rosemary can be grown in your garden or in pots inside your home, provided that they are placed in a position where they can enjoy full sun every day. The growing plant, as well as cuttings from it, is great for keeping mosquitoes away. If you’re camping or having a BBQ in your garden, toss a few sprigs of rosemary into the fire and the smell it gives off while it is burning, will keep mosquitoes away from you, as long as you’re close to the smoke. 8. Basil Basil, one of the most aromatic herbs, is one of the easiest, most effective plants to keep mosquitoes away. Unlike other plants, there is no need to touch or crush the leaves of the basil plant to stop mosquitoes from attacking you, although applying the crushed leaves to your skin will give you ultimate protection. Simply grow basil in pots and place them at strategic places in your garden or on your patio to stop an invasion by those irritating mosquitoes. A study conducted in 2009 reported that basil essential oil, when sprayed onto mosquito larva, kills them off within 24 hours! 9. Scented Geraniums Many gardening sites and gardeners recommend scented geraniums for use as a mosquito repellent, with the lemon-scented variety being the most effective. The scent of these plants is similar to citronella, which is well known for being one of the best for keeping insects at bay. Plant them in your garden close to windows and doors to stop mosquitoes from invading your home. Scented geraniums can also be grown in pots on your deck or patio, but should be pruned regularly to keep their prolific growth in check. 10. Pennyroyal Another plant well known for its natural insect repellent properties, pennyroyal is most effective for the fight against mosquitoes. Planting them in the soil around your house will prevent mosquitoes from coming into your yard. You can also place vases containing sprigs of fresh pennyroyal around your home to kill off any that come into those areas. Pennyroyal can also be grown in pots inside your home for added protection. If you are going to be in an area where you know you will be plagued with mosquitoes, simply put some crushed pennyroyal leaves in your pockets and the mosquitoes are guaranteed to stay far way from you! 11. Sage Crushing sage leaves and rubbing them on your skin will keep mosquitoes away, but for maximum effectiveness, go for a higher concentration of sage in the form of sage essential oil to keep mosquitoes at bay. Tossing some sage into the fire when you’re out camping or entertaining guests around a BBQ will give off a sage-scented smoke that will keep the irritating pests away. As mentioned above, it is the natural smells in the oils found in the leaves and flowers of certain plants that make them effective natural insect repellents. You can plant them in pots on your deck or patio, close to your front and back doors, or directly in your garden, whichever suits you best. By doing this, you will not only have colorful, wonderfully-scented plants to beautify your home and garden, but some of the best and most effective natural mosquito repellents too, to keep these irritating insects at bay.

"['Since the start of the year, I’ve devoted myself to living a more active lifestyle. It’s a choice I made because…a). I wanted to drop a couple of pounds and b). start taking better care of my health now that I’m in my thirties. We’re 3 months in to 2018 and so far the changes I’ve made in my life has made a strong impact on my body and mindset. I’m at the gym at least 3 to 4 times a week and I’ve changed my diet to include healthier food options. I feel and look great, and I’m so close to hitting my target weight loss goal. This new lifestyle has rejuvenated me and made me go back to an old passion of mine: gardening. The days have become more beautiful, thanks to spring’s arrival, and I thought what better time than now to add more colors to my flower garden. I like gardening a lot because I still get some moderate exercise and it’s a great reason to be outdoors and enjoy nature. After about an hour or two of being in the sun, I’ll go in the house and grab an ice cold beer, like Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold to cool down and relax. What I love about Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold is that it gives you the permission to make healthier choices, while still ending off the day with an ice cold beer that you can feel great about drinking. Michelob ULTRA is a premier fitness brand, so they know that beer drinking doesn’t always mean the opposite of being fit. Pure Gold is Michelob ULTRA’s newest line of beer that is sustainably sourced with ingredients and inspiration from nature. It’s made with organic grains, from the country’s finest fields, and with sustainable packaging in partnership with the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. The beer itself is a light lager with a superior, golden taste that contains only 85 calories and 2.5 carbs. Pure Gold is also triple filtered and brewed free of artificial colors and flavors. Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold is the perfect drink to enjoy in nature since it’s inspired by nature. I love Michelob ULTRA because I know I don’t have to make sacrifices. I can still pursue health and happiness in equal measure. Add Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold to your spring activities so you can enjoy your social moments more while still living your best healthy and active lifestyle. This line is being produced in limited quantities, so be sure that you and your friends get some ASAP!

"['This is a sponsored post written by me on behalf of Whole Earth Sweetener Co. . All opinions are 100% mine. As a busy blogger who is constantly on the go, the one thing I always make time for is eating breakfast! During the winter season, I prefer eating something warm in the morning like an egg breakfast sandwich or a bowl of oatmeal. Most of the time it’s oatmeal; however, I’ve been enjoying a chilled version of it lately that doesn’t require cooking on the stove or in the microwave. My new wintertime fave is Overnight Oats and honestly, I’d take it over hot oats any day. Overnight oats, is a creamier and denser version of rolled oats that’s super easy to make. The rolled oats soak in a liquid mixture that softens it to perfection when left overnight in the fridge. I love adding fresh fruit toppings, and when I whip them up in a jar, it makes the perfect grab-and-go breakfast! Today, I’m sharing an overnight oats recipe that I come back to over and over again because it’s just so darn tasty. Banana & Chocolate Chip Overnight Oats Ingredients ? cup plain Greek yogurt ½ cup rolled oats ? cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk – or milk of choice 1 tablespoon chia seeds or ground flaxseed (I used a mixed version of both) ½ ripe banana, chopped or mashed 2 tablespoons unsweetened chocolate chips 1 packet of Whole Earth Sweetener Turbinado Raw Cane 50 (topping) Instructions Step 1. Mix together all ingredients (except Whole Earth Sweetener Turbinado Raw Cane 50) in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Step 2. Spoon into a jar with an air tight lid and refrigerate the mixture overnight (it’s ready in about 4 hours but overnight is best). Step 3. Take mixture out of the fridge and into a serving bowl. Step 4. Top with sliced bananas, a few chocolate chips and a bit of Whole Earth Sweetener . Enjoy! I also like to top it off with a pinch of sweetener especially if the banana is a bit on the un-ripe side. Sprinkling a bit of Whole Earth Sweetener Turbinado Raw Cane 50 added the perfect amount of sweetness I needed to enjoy my breakfast. What I love most about Whole Earth Sweetener Turbinado Raw Cane 50 is that it has half the calories of traditional sugar per serving and uses the highest quality of natural ingredients. You can find Whole Earth Sweetener products at Amazon , select Walmart Supercenters, Target stores, and other grocery stores nationwide. Click here to find your closest store. I’ve been enjoying this recipe every morning because it keeps me full and energized to start my day. I’ll make a week’s worth of jars over the weekend to take for quick breakfasts during the work week. That’s why overnight oats are the perfect breakfast for those who don’t have the time to make a morning meal. Why don’t you give it a try, and let me know what you think! Pin for Later!

"['This is a sponsored post written by me on behalf of SOFIproducts.com for IZEA . All opinions are 100% mine. Storage, storage, storage. There never seems to be enough of it in my house. I have a very small bedroom with an even smaller closet. For years, I’ve always complained about the lack of space which oftentimes stops me from buying new clothes. I’ve now come to the realization that my problem is letting go of pretty little things or justifying keeping pieces I no longer need. So, what I have now is a small overflowing closet full of unnecessary items and it’s time for me to finally do something about it. Spring is just around the corner and I’m dying to buy all the things on my spring wishlist, but given the state of my closet, I first need to figure out a way to reorganize it. Right now my top shelf is full of bulky shoe boxes that I’ve had since college. I don’t even wear half of them anymore. I also have tons of old clothes I should’ve a tossed or given away years ago. Thankfully, I came across a new line of SOFI products on Amazon designed to make spaces work the way you live. It offers an essential, style-smart organizational system in a variety of styles that can instantly transform your closet into your own chic boutique. I love that you don’t need to sacrifice style when organizing your closet with this line. Some of my favorites include the SOFI Hex Box (perfect for drawers, nightstands and dressers to store jewelry, socks, and other small trinkets that can be easily lost), SOFI Rax Bin (ideal for at-a-glance access to purses, hats and footwear), SOFI Brix Box, Small (easily accessible with pull-out handles and open tops), and SOFI Zipper Tote, Small (allow for quick access to clothes and accessories). They’re perfect for my closet needs and I like that they have environmentally-friendly features (made from a minimum of 65% recycled content). I also love the sophisticated mocha and lavender-grey color palette on the exterior and interior, respectively. Sofi Hex Box Spring Cleaning Closet Tips! Monica Friel , organizing expert from Chaos to Order, offers her tips and tricks for organizing your closet space into your own chic boutique for spring fashion. Reimagine your closet as your personal chic boutique: Before you begin to organize, make sure you have cleverly-designed products to make your closet inspiring, vibrant and fun! The new line of SOFI™ home organizational products can help you makeover your closet. SOFI products feature stylistic touches like gold fasteners and zipper accents, geometric print interiors, in a sophisticated color palette to bring you inspiration every time you open your closet door. Now, Be a Style Editor: Go through your closet item by item. Eliminate what feels drab while gathering ideas for pieces you can add to update your existing clothing collection. Group Similar Items Together: The best way to know exactly what you have is to put like-items together. Use your style editor-eye to organize by type of clothing or style and then by color. Celebrate the Season: Keep the clothes you’re currently wearing accessible so that you don’t have to waste time searching for the things you need. For quick access to clothes and accessories, use a SOFI™ Brix Box™ with pull-out handles and open tops or a SOFI™ Zipper Tote™ for quick, front-panel access to clothes and accessories. And, take advantage of floor and shelf space in your closet with a SOFI™ Stax Shelf™ that makes the most of existing vertical and horizontal space. Forget Last Season : Take time to get out-of-season clothes stored away. This will make your closet feel less cramped so you can easily see what you own before hitting the stores. Organization is not a Destination: Organization is an ongoing process that requires efficient systems, maintenance and the good old-fashioned discipline of putting things back in place. With Monica Friel’s tips, you’ll be on your way to having your own couture closet space! See my follow up before and after post of my new organized closet space using the SOFI products.

"['Are you tired of being jealous of women with fuller lips? Do you finally want a beautiful pout without heading to the doctor’s office? Well, now you can. There are different ways to achieve this look but I’ll show you two natural tricks that will really give your lips some plumpness. Not everyone turns to lip injections, lip plumpers, or even makeup to achieve a nice pout. There are simpler, safer, and more natural approaches for having a fuller lip. Are you ready? Tip #1. The secret to fuller lips…….an ELECTRIC TOOTH BRUSH! When your toothbrush is foamy, use it to carefully brush your lips. Be gentle and avoid scratching or injuring your lips. Rinse thoroughly after brushing both your teeth and lips. The next step is to apply a moisturizer or a lip balm on your brushed lips. Doing these continuously will improve circulation of the blood in the lips and make them fuller and more plump. Aside from that, you will notice that your lips will have better color. Tip #2. To really give your lips some plumpness, mix some cayenne pepper into your gloss. This is another secret in attaining a fuller lip. Pepper slightly irritates the lips and makes them swell a little. Some may find this uncomfortable and unnecessary. However, if you are bent on having a pouty plump lip then you could sacrifice a little comfort in order to get it. An alternative route is a lip plumper . I hope you enjoyed this beauty tip of the week!

"['For most people, there never seems to be enough money left before the next pay check comes in. The price of everything continues to rise and it seems like every day there is something we have to pay for. This was my issue years ago, until I learned a couple of money hacks that helped me get a better hold of my spending habits. If this feels like you too, don’t worry you’re in good company. Here are 13 money hacks I’ve learned throughout the years that your wallet will thank you for mastering. 1. Make a Budget This is probably the last thing you want to hear when you find a money hacking article but it is honestly the task that will put everything into perspective. Most people have issues with money because they don’t look at how they are spending it. You might think you know what’s going where but it is so easy to burn through your cash when spending a little here and a little there. The first step is determining a financial goal. What is it you want to happen in your financial life? For most people it’s being able to save some money so figure out how much of the money that you bring in each month you want to be able to save. READ: 18 Ways to Simplify Your Life In The New Year The next step is to write down what you bring in and what you spend each month. Be honest here because if you aren’t, the budget won’t work. Write everything down from the essentials to the stuff you don’t need. Once you do this, you’ll find it is much easier to get a bird’s eye view of where your money is going, what you have to keep in your budget and what can potentially be cut out. 2. Use the 50/20/30 Rule The 50/20/30 rules (also known as the 50/20/30 budget) is a type of income budgeting strategy. This one is a little more sophisticated than a basic budget where you write down who much you make and how much you spend. This type of budget can help you allocate your funds so that it’s a little easier to accomplish your financial goals. This is how it breaks down: -50% Goes to Essentials The first 50% of your income goes to essentials or the things you absolutely have to pay no matter what. Obviously depending on how important any given expense is to you, that could encompass virtually anything but we are talking about the basic necessities a person needs to have. This includes things like your food, housing, vehicle payments and insurance, etc. Figure out what the must-haves are in your life (and again be honest with yourself). For instance you might absolutely love to watch your favorite shows on cable but cable is sadly not a necessity. You might love the freedom of driving your car but if you don’t need it to make money at your job, it’s not a necessity. Get the picture? – 20% Goes to Savings Pretty straight forward here. 20% of your monthly income should go directly into a savings account. If you’re already taking out 20% of your income to sock away in a retirement account, that works too. -30% Goes to Personal Spending This is the discretionary spending on stuff you want but don’t need every month. For instance if you like to buy fancy coffee, if you like to shop for stuff that you don’t really need, or if you like to donate money to your favorite charity; that’s all discretionary spending. The idea behind this budget is that when you divide your money up, you quickly see how much you have for each of these categories. That’s a much clearer picture than when you take money from one big pot every month. You might find out that you don’t have enough for necessities and personal spending without dipping into savings. 3. Avoid Eating Out Eating out is easily one of the biggest strains on a budget especially if you have children. Depending on where you live, a family of four can easily burn through 20-30 dollars per meal time when eating out. Multiple that by even just a few times per week and you are spending a few hundred dollars per month on food on top of whatever groceries you are also buying. An easy way to stop yourself from destroying your budget by eating out is to set the number of times you do it each month. For example resolve to only eat out 2 times per month and pick which days those will be. By making things predictable you can plan better and avoid surprises. This brings us to our next tip, planning your meals. 4. Plan Your Meals You can tell yourself all day long that you are never going to eat out again but if you don’t have a plan, it’s even easier to fold and say ‘oh lets just get a pizza’. Planning your meals helps you avoid eating out and it also helps you budget your grocery money each month as well. Just like with a lot of money budgeting tasks, meal planning doesn’t have to be a big complicated job. Start by doing it a few days to a week in advance. Pick the meals you are going to have for breakfast, lunch, dinner then build your grocery list around that. 5. Optimize Your Costs Take a look at your monthly expenses that you have to pay. For instance your energy bill, your car insurance bill, your car payments, and other monthly expenses that are pretty much set in stone are all candidates for negotiation. Pick the ones you know you can influence and see what you can do to lower them. Car insurance is a prime example. You can shop around for car insurance to find a better rate. You can ask your current carrier if there are ways for you to get a discount like by having a car alarm, by increasing your deductibles or rearranging your coverage in another way. Even if you can only lower a few of your bills by 10 or 15 dollars per month, every little bit helps. 6. Monitor Your Energy Usage This is a monthly expense that deserves closer inspection in terms of lowering costs. Energy consumption is something we don’t always think about but that costs us a ton of money every month. Find ways around your home to save on things like electricity, natural gas, heating oil, etc. Get energy efficient LED lights, make a habit of turning off lights and appliances when they aren’t in use, keep your heat/AC at minimal levels when you aren’t at home and look into better insulating your home or apartment. Many small tweaks can add up to big savings. 7. Defer a Car Payment This is another monthly expense that you can look at optimizing. Deferment is not recommended as a regular strategy as it lengthens the term of your loan or lease but if you need a little extra cash in one month, many loan and lease servicers will allow you to move one or more payments to the end of your loan. Of course you have to be in good standing with your lender and this isn’t a good strategy to get in the habit of using more than once but it can get you some quick cash for the month if you need it for something else. 8. Refinance a Vehicle A better strategy to improve your monthly cost on a car is to see if your lender will renegotiate the terms of your loan. Your credit may be in a better position than it was when you first got into your auto loan and if it is, you might be able to refinance for a lower rate. 9. Refinance a Home If you have a mortgage this is a prime monthly bill that can be targeted for reduction. Refinancing your loan can potentially save you thousands of dollars per year in interest charges. Just like with your auto loan, you may have a better credit position than you did when you first got the mortgage. 10. Turn Old Items into Cash A quick way to get some extra cash in your pocket is to sell stuff you don’t use any more. If you have old clothes, electronics, appliances, and similar items, you can sell them for cash on sites like Facebook or Craigslist. There are also a ton of apps for mobile that allow you to sell used stuff. Recommended Sites Letgo – Sell items locally Poshmark – Buy and sell fashion Fashionphile – Sell your handbag Thredup – Online thrift store Tradesy – Sell anything in your closet Recommended Apps Mercari – The flea market app OfferUp – Sell large household items locally Gone – See electronics you no longer want 11. Buy Seasonal Stuff off Season Shopping for seasonal things like holiday decorations or swim wear is often a necessity but you can save money on them. Look for deals right after these seasons end. Stores often sell items for 50% to 80% off retails after seasons end in order to make way for new merchandise. 12. Use Coupons Coupons are still a great way to save some cash on a regular basis. A good strategy is to sign up for your local grocer’s frequent customer plan (it may not be called this but a lot of leading grocers have them). These are loyalty plans that allow you to save cash the more you use them. Here are some sites to get free discount coupons: Coupons Red Plum Restaurant.com 13. Drink Your Coffee at Home We totally get it, the fancy coffee at your trendy café is way better than the junk you brew at home but if you’re willing to make the sacrifice, making your own coffee can save you a bundle. The daily coffee trip, otherwise known as the moca-effect, is a popular scape goat for killing budgets. While it might not help a ton, brewing your own coffee at home can save you at least 3 dollars each time you would have otherwise gone to Starbucks. Invest in a good coffee machine. Keurig has a good line of coffee machines. The one I own , cost less than $100 bucks and brewing K-cups can save you about $3 per cup of coffee. They run about $12-$15 for 24 kcups, which would be 50¢ to 63¢ per cup of coffee. Conclusion Ultimately, all budgeting and money saving strategies are about sacrifice. There are expenses and necessities you can’t avoid but to accomplish your goals, sometimes you have to forego the near term things you want.

"['It’s a new year and people like to use the month of January as a fresh start to finally getting fit and dropping those unwanted pounds. Sticking to a diet day in and day out will at some point wear on your nerves and focus. You can keep that from happening by finding ways to stay on track so you can finally hit those goals. Here are 6 tips to help you stay on track in 2018! 1. Set Small & Large Goals If your long-term goal is to lose, let’s say…25 or 50 pounds, then you’ll need small goals to keep the motivation up. I like to do weekly goals, such as eating more veggies or exercising at least 4 times a week, and as I achieve them, I pat myself on the back. By setting small and large goals, you’re less likely to be discouraged and quit altogether. 2. Keep a Food Journal I have a food journal and it’s absolutely the best way I like to stay on track with my meals. Being specific is probably the most important aspect of keeping an effective journal. For example, when I’m writing, I focus on portion size, time of day, and how I felt before, during, and after eating. I was once told long ago that within an hour after my workouts, I should consume protein and fiber so I make sure to make a note of my post-workout meals for the day. There’s no better way to recover after a workout session and preserve muscle mass than eating protein. Having a fiber-rich snack will also leave you feeling satisfied and full for hours. A great food source I’m currently lovin’ at the moment is Dannon Oikos Protein Crunch yogurt . I found it at my local Walmart and picked up a few in different flavors and it was the best decision I’ve ever made. Oikos Protein Crunch is an excellent pre or post protein snack as it contains 17 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber per serving. This greek nonfat yogurt has no artificial or added sugar and comes with tasty toppings to give the yogurt you love, the crunch you want, packed with the protein you need! 3. Track Your Successes Keep track of your results by writing it down in a journal, using a fitness tracker or on a graph where you can see your progress. Use anyone of these tools as a visual reminder of how far you’ve come, and what you need to do keep going. 4. Make it Enjoyable Do what’s best for you. If you’re more likely to go to a pilates class than run on the treadmill, write down the class times and do more of that. If you’re tired of the same meals over and over again, mix it up with a new one. I like to change up my post-workout snacks every once in a while and right now, I’m really loving Dannon Oikos Protein Crunch Yogurt . 5. Recommit if You Have Setbacks You don’t really need to have a fresh start at the beginning of the year. You can reaffirm your goals anytime of the year and having a calendar is a great reminder of that. If you think about it, every day, week or month can be a fresh slate to get back to work. 6. Congratulate Yourself Reward yourself every once in a while. Maybe it’s buying some ice cream for sticking to your meal plan or having a spa day. Note it down on the calendar as reminder to continue pushing through while keeping your eyes on the prize. Head over to your local Walmart, go straight to the Dairy aisle, and pick up all 4 flavors (Banana & Chocolate, Chocolate Oats & Peanuts, Oats & Blueberries, and Oats & Peanuts). Make sure to use this ibotta offer when you do!

"['Neutrogena is doing its part in providing eco-friendly skincare products by expanding its Neutrogena Naturals line. The line is created with naturally plant derived ingredients and contains no harsh chemical sulfates, parabens, petrochemicals, dyes or phthalates. Neutrogena created only pure, high-quality natural ingredients for balanced beauty from the skin care experts you trust. These days, more skincare brands are becoming more eco-conscious and Neutrogena is one of my favorites so you can only imagine how thrilled I was to learn that I would be given the opportunity to test drive their natural skincare line. For this review, I will go over the Purifying Pore Scrub, Purifying Facial Cleanser, The Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Night Cream, and Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover. Purifying Pore Scrub : It gently scrubs away impurities and dull, dead skin cells that can build up in pores to improve complexion for fresh, clear skin. It’s not a harsh scrub, which many experts say is the preferred choice for acne-prone skin. I love this scrub because it didn’t feel like it was stripping my skin off and I’ve definitely noticed an improvement on my skin texture. It also leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed. Purifying Facial Cleanser : This face wash contains natural salicylic acid found in Willowbark bionutrients to penetrate deep into pores to detoxify and help remove dirt, oil and makeup, while rinsing clean without pore-clogging residue. I took a liking to this cleanser after one use. It cleanses and moisturizes my skin, and my skin hasn’t suffered from any acne breakouts. Neutrogena says it’s a recommended choice for acne-prone skin and I certainly agree. The Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Night Cream : For someone like me with oily skin, I was a bit concerned that this cream would be too heavy or break me out; but after using the product for a few days, it’s been a pleasant experience. The moisturizer is light and fast-absorbing. I wake up to smooth, soft skin (no breakouts) and it smells amazing! Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover : I wear makeup everyday so finding a makeup removing cleanser that is strong enough to remove all traces of makeup with out stripping the skin’s natural moisture is often difficult to come by until now. I was super impressed on how well it was able to remove the majority of makeup with just one wash. It’s very gentle around my eyes and it managed to remove my waterproof mascara too! Overall, I would say this remover is gentle but effective. Neutrogena Naturals is a great line and I hope they keep this line available for a long time. I’ve already started replacing my normal skincare routine with them. Go Green! Neutrogena is following the masses and making an impact on the world by…. leveraging natural plant derived ingredients no animal testing on products and ingredients using up to 50% post consumer recycled content in their bottles using folding cartons made from 100% recycled paper with 60% post-consumer recycled content and are FSC (Forrest Stewardship Council) certified. supporting clean water for people, plants, and animals by partnering with The Nature Conservancy using a green server for its Neutrogena Naturals website which is self-sustainable, sun-fueled, and wind-powered and only uses renewable energy.

I go green by using reusable water bottles and shopping bags, recycling, purchasing organic clothing, and eating organic foods.

"['We all enjoy the warm and sunny weather during the summer months but in reality, it can have damaging and negative effects on our skin, making it important to “summe-rize” your regular beauty routine to protect your skin from premature aging or even worse, skin cancer. Healthy Directions Physician Researcher, Dr. Aaron Tabor shares with us his top 7 sun protection tips to maintain our gorgeous skin all summer long. 7 Sun Protection Tips for Healthy Skin Tip #1 Buy Sunscreen with at least SPF 30 Purchase a sunscreen product with at least SPF 30, and make sure it blocks both UVA and UVB rays. Try to look for a light-feeling lotion (spray versions are ok but, it may not give as good of a coverage). If you have oily or pore-clogging skin, we recommend a lotion with SPF like Kate Somerville Daily Deflector Broad Spectrum SPF 50+ Sunscreen Moisturizer . I like that it has anti-aging properties with great sun protection. Tip #2 Use Sunscreen Year Round Apply your sunscreen every day, all year round. Sun protection is not just in the summer or on sunny days. Even if it is winter, cloudy, or hazy, use sunscreen. Tip #3 Don’t Skip Important Areas When applying sunscreen, be careful not to forget your neck, the back of your hands, and the tips of your nose and ears, which are all areas that get a lot of sun exposure but are often overlooked. Other areas that are especially vulnerable are the tops of the ears, where skin cancer loves to develop. Tip #4 Reapply Often Always remember to reapply your sunscreen every few hours. Tip #5 Use a Moisturizer Use a moisturizer to hydrate skin and protect against environmental factors like the sun.

"['Attempting to organize your life, particularly with regards to financial affairs, can be hard in today’s busy world. What with settling bills, retirement planning and raising children, life is often a challenge. There’s no better time to start setting goals than the new year though, so make the effort now to increase your happiness and direct your precious time more productively. The following tips will help you to simplify your life over the coming months: 1. Embrace Frugal Living and Apply the Fourteen day Rule You can make your life simpler straight away, by living within your means. Do not exceed your monthly budget, regardless of how desirable this may be. Assign significance to the things that matter and be happy with the way your life is. A good method to implement this is to observe the fourteen day rule. If there is something you wish to buy, wait fourteen days before purchasing it. Once this period is over, you will likely think that you can manage without it. This will save you from buying on impulse. 2. Cut Down on Television While television shows can be entertaining, they also waste a lot of your time. Most people spend too long staring at the TV. Although it is nice to unwind in front of the screen after a tiring day, the average person does this for more than thirty-five hours each week. In all likelihood, you would be shocked if you calculated the amount of time you spend watching television. If you took back just half of that time every week, you could spend extra time with your family, participate in outdoor activities, work on a side business and more. Here’s a money saving idea: Forget cable and satellite. Matter of fact, forget Netflix and Hulu too an opt for a digital antenna to enjoy free TV. 3. Accentuate the Positive A good day can quickly turn sour, when unforeseen events occur. Perhaps your vehicle stalled at a junction, a date stood you up, or you had a run in with a work colleague. Reacting to these things in a negative way is understandable, however it is important not to let them affect your life negatively. If you spend your day fretting about how awful these events are, you are not using your time productively. It is natural to be annoyed initially, but rather than getting bogged down with negative events, by gossiping and/or feeling regretful, you could allocate this time to more important things. It is never easy to move on from difficult situations, however refocusing your energy in the right way will enable you to navigate through the day and your life smoothly. 4. Repay Your Debts You might have debts from credit cards, student loans or bank overdrafts, but paying these off will help you to manage your finances, because reducing your debt makes everything less stressful. Debt often weighs heavily in many people’s subconscious minds, and it can ruin relationships. Repaying your debt will streamline your budget, and enable you to clarify your long term and short term financial objectives. READ: 85+ Ways to Make Extra Money in Your Spare Time 5. Set Aside Some ‘You Time’ It might seem difficult to take time off for yourself, when your schedule is hectic. Nonetheless, organising your week in advance will facilitate this. Allocating some ‘you time’ will keep you more physically and emotionally balanced. Also, you can use this time to plan your future goals. A bit of solitude can help you to identify your desires and how to realize them. This is therapeutic as well, because it can prepare you to cope with days that are hectic. If any of your ‘friends’ forever criticize you and never show you respect, tell them that you are unhappy. If they don’t alter their behavior, stop associating with them. Likewise, if you have been trying to make a negative relationship work, which constantly drags you down, it is time to move on. READ: 3 Fun Things To Do During “Me Time” 6. Get Your Life Organized Disorganization can result in you wasting lots of time and lead to stress, late fees, lost belongings and more. On average, people spend twelve days each year searching for items they lost. To organize yourself, you might wish to use a life or day planner that can set phone reminders, and use post its to highlight forthcoming tasks, etc. 7. Pay Your Expenses Yearly or Biyearly Certain bills need to be paid each month, however rather than paying for bills such as car insurance and home insurance like this, you may wish to consider paying them once a year or every half year. In all likelihood, you will receive a price reduction by doing this, and you will have two less expenses to think about every month. It might be necessary to amend your yearly and monthly budget, however examining and tweaking your budget is never a bad thing anyway. 8. Reduce Your Social Media Activity Lots of people spend considerable time online. However, rather than staring at a computer screen or smartphone for hours, you could spend time socializing with friends and relatives in real life. Many studies show that people who use social media for too long often suffer from anxiety. With all the depressing news stories and worrying about whether your posts are getting enough attention, it is hardly surprising that taking a break from this will benefit your health. Although it is difficult in the modern world to eliminate social media completely, it is possible to choose a couple of social media sites to limit your activity to. 9. Consider What Things in Life Mean the Most to you The start of the year is the best time to consider what you desire from life, and identify ways of accomplishing these objectives. Write your priorities down in a list, so you can simplify your life and eliminate any obstacles that might be standing in your way. Doing this allows you to see what means most to you, so you can tell the difference between the important things and the things that are insignificant in the overall scheme. 10. Do Some Decluttering Have a policy of always keeping your house organized and clean. You can do this by completing small chores during the week, or set aside Sundays to do it. Having a tidy house will calm you down and improve your productivity, because you do not have to devote any mental space to clearing up mess. 11. Scale Down Your Wardrobe You are probably familiar with the fact that we wear just twenty percent of the garments we own. Most rich and successful people have a limited wardrobe. By purchasing clothes that match each other and being less fashion conscious, you will have extra time to devote to other areas of your life. Begin by deciding which clothes you wear most often, and throw away the ones you have not worn for months. Then, you can base your wardrobe on the garments you know you like and will use regularly. 12. Compile a List of Things to do Undoubtedly, writing a list of things to do will reduce your stress levels. It will serve as a handy reminder of your priorities, so you do not fall behind. This list will identify everything that needs attention, and organize daily tasks by person, concern or subject. 13. Become More Confident This Year This is one of the more challenging things to master, however there’s no doubt that becoming more confident will simplify your life and make everything you do more enjoyable. Acquiring confidence takes time, and it begins by identifying small reasons to have faith in yourself. Then, after the process gathers steam, your confident demeanor will enable you to enhance your life, instead of fretting about things that frighten you. Being more confident will allow to you obtain what you deserve from life, pursue the career you want, earn a higher salary, achieve your ambitions, be a good public speaker, meet new friends, network effectively, manage staff or a business, and travel the world — to name just a few things. Needless to say, confidence can benefit you in a wide variety of ways, and it will help you to fulfill your true potential. 14. Use Automated Payments Using automated payments will help to ensure that you pay everything on time, so you don’t need to worry about missing deadlines. Lots of people become stressed, even by the thought of being charged for a late payment. You can set up automated credit card payments, have your paycheck directly deposited into your bank account, and automate all your utility bill payments. This will save you cash, ease your mind and allow you to concentrate on other activities. 15. Take a Step Back Quite often, there will be days where you feel like you are simply jumping from one task to another. Before you know it, you will be retiring to your bedroom wondering where the time went. Perhaps you are missing out on things due to mental distractions – spending your time at university obsessing about getting a job, starting a job and obsessing about getting married, until one day everything has happened, and you realize that you could have done much more with your time. While having future plans is important, if you take a step back and consider your present situation, you may be amazed by the number of options at your disposal. This way, you can live a simple life ‘in the moment’ and enjoy yourself much more. 16. Use Reminders on Your Smartphone to jog Your Memory If you have an appointment in the near future that you might overlook, set up a reminder about it on your phone. This will make managing your life simpler, because you will not need to fret about missing payments and forgetting things, etc. You can set up reminders for things like settling your quarterly tax bill, business tasks, paying biyearly bills such as motor insurance, and renewing car license plates. Amazingly, lots of people fail to do this. In addition, your phone can be used to remind you when to return books to the library, call friends and take medication, etc. 17. Simplify Things With Some Peace and Quiet The world we live in is fast paced and noisy. Cast your mind back to when you last relaxed in total quiet, with no interruptions. If you are like most people, this was probably a long time ago. Sitting in silence allows you to think about your life and consider what is happening in the wider world. Also, it can help to refresh your mind and destress you. This does not mean that you have to engage in lengthy meditation sessions, unless you wish to do this, however you could try something simple — such as waiting in the supermarket queue without looking at your phone, taking a stroll on your own, or switching the radio off when you are in your car. By removing all distractions, you will find that you can zone in on the important things. 18. Be Skeptical of Multitasking Many people use multitasking to complete several jobs at once, if they are pushed for time. In some cases, this works fine, however other people struggle with this, due to the amount of time it takes to refocus on new tasks. Consequently, it can mean that each time you change tasks, you might end up taking longer than if you had completed each task individually. Consider your weaknesses and strengths, to determine whether multitasking will actually save you time and help you. It might be that certain jobs are suitable for multitasking, but others require your undivided attention. Moreover, in the main, by single tasking and focusing on one job at a time – fully completing each job before moving onto the next – you will be better placed to simplify your life and avoid spreading yourself too thin. Final Thoughts Identifying the things that matter most to you is the best way to lead a simple life. Often, it is the small things that make the difference and allow you to feel happy and content. Hopefully, the above information will have inspired you to take the necessary steps to simplify your life this year. Good Luck!

"['Image: Bigstock We all suffer from acne, which is a constant battle to our skin. I have been suffering from acne on my face and back since my teenage years and the truth is, there’s no cure to get rid of acne completely. There are days when my skin is healthy and blemish free and then there are other days when I have pimples all over my face. We all have those days; however, there are several people who suffer with acne daily. Acne is caused by several factors such as stress, puberty, hormonal imbalance, over production of sebum by sebaceous glands, clogged hair follicle, and etc. The only way to treat acne is to control it. I am going to share with you some acne treatments that I have used in the past and still using, also some products that has gotten great reviews. Philosophy Acne Kit I have oily skin so this product brings beauty and health back to my skin. It’s benzoyl peroxide free, it suppresses oil production, it exfoliates, and keeps your skin glowing. It comes with a face wash for oily skin, a blemish serum for acne, hydrogen peroxide cream that helps sanitize the skin from bacteria, and a protection cream. It’s a great product, one I would definitely recommend. Zeno I just started using this a month ago, and this is amazing. It really does get rid of your pimples overnight. It’s a medical device that’s been cleared by the FDA that applies controlled heat to the pimple through a metal pad. It treats mild to moderate acne. If you feel that a pimple is forming and is coming to surface, just put this device directly onto your pimple and it will go away within 24 hours. It is costly, but if I had a device that can remove a pimple in less than 24 hours, I would definitely buy it (See my Zeno Mini review ). Proactiv Proactiv is a popular acne product amongst teens and young adults.It’s a popular because it does work and it is the #1 Acne Selling Treatment. I’ve used this product in the past when my acne was extremely bad and it did help to clear up my skin. I really like the defining clay mask which I still use on my face. It’s an inexpensive product, easy to use, and has promising results. It’s even great to use on other parts on the body besides the face. So if you want beauty and health back into your skin, the only way to treat acne is finding the right product to keep it under control.

"['Is the weather making your skin look a bit dull? Keep your skin glowing all year long especially during the winter months by learning how to keep your skin looking fresh. Here are 8 beauty tips for glowing skin ! Cleanse and Exfoliate Skin Get glowing skin by using a mild and gentle cleanser (Cetaphil $7). Exfoliate with a facial scrub like St. Ives Apricot Scrub ($4). Banish Breakouts Fight off acne with a facial cleanser and acne spot treatment. More importantly, try and keep your skin calm by controlling your stress. I like to apply a facial mask twice a week to keep me in a “zen-like” mood. Your skin will be glowing in no time. Wear Sunscreen The best way to keep your skin looking youthful is by pouring on the sunscreen. You should wear sunscreen year round and look for one with SPF15 or higher. Since sunscreen stops working after 3 hours, an easier solution is to use a powder sunscreen . It’s great for touchups and it’s light so your makeup stays on. Drink Tea Research shows that drinking green or black tea at least three times a day can safeguard your skin. Tea contains compounds like theaflavins and ECGG which helps protect against skin cancers and the breakdown of collagen aka wrinkles. Sun-kissed Skin Having a sun-kissed glow gives a more youthful appearance. Adding a little tint can give your skin a more even tone look. “A little tint takes years off your face by evening out your skin tone, ” says Ranella Hirsch, M.D., a dermatologist in Cambridge, MA. Olay Complete Touch of Sun Daily UV Moisturizer + A Touch of Sunless Tanner ($15) should do the trick. Tone and Tighten Witch hazel or a toner can help tighten and tone your skin. It doesn’t irritate the skin and it promotes fast healing. Another cool tip is exercising your facial muscles. “I am religious about strength-training, and I always tell patients to do it more as they get older, ” says Patricia Farris, M.D., a dermatologist in Metairie, LA. It’s a great way to obtain firm and plump skin. Superfoods for Skin Eat foods rich in antioxidants and essential fatty acids. Foods with high antioxidants: blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, black and pinto beans, pecans, and artichokes. Foods high in essential fatty acids (EFA’s): halibut, almonds, nuts, flax seed, olive and canola oil. Selenium is a trace mineral that plays an important role in skin cell health too. To grab a good amount of selenium, eat whole grains, cereal, tuna, muffins, and turkey. Hydrate Skin Drink water everyday !! You know it’s good for you.

"['I was at Target yesterday and I noticed that they sell Zeno. For people who are not familiar with Zeno, it is a device for acne. Zeno is a handheld acne treatment device with a tip that heats to a pre set temperature. When the tip is in direct contact with your pimple, it releases that heat on the pimple, and the pimple usually clears up within 24 to 48 hours. I have used this advice for my acne and it works. It’s a great treatment option for your acne when you get sporadic flare ups. The only problem is the price. It can cost up to $200 to own one of these. Well….not anymore. Now, the good news is the creators of Zeno has come out with a new product called the Zeno Mini (now the Zeno Hot Spot). It’s a 45 treatment count and gives the same results as the regular Zeno. The only difference is that it’s smaller and portable. It’s made to be portable so it can fit inside your jean pocket or your purse. Here’s another plus: The cost is $89 (now $43). That’s half the price of the original. You can find it at your local Target store in the skincare section or you can go to MyZeno.com for more info.

"['Best Natural Skincare Tips You’ve probably gone through several tips to find a solution for your skin ailments. Truth is, skincare products are often times not enough. Here, I’ve put together 35 natural skincare tips for overall skin health. By using natural skincare solutions, your skin will show a dramatic improvement overtime. 1. Drink More Water Your body is made up of 60% water. It’s necessary to drink water daily. Water hydrates the skin which in turn makes it healthy and beautiful . 2. Take in More Antioxidants Antioxidants are great at protecting your skin cells from free radical damage. It helps keep your skin glowing and youthful. Fruits and vegetables are full of antioxidants- Blueberries, raspberries, dark leafy green vegetables, and citrus fruits. 3. Exercise Exercising can have a huge impact on your complexion.

Breathe more Deeply This can reduce stress and you’ll feel more calm and at peace. Breathe deeply while you’re reading this post! 5. Reduce Alcohol Intake Alcohol is a diuretic which can cause dehydration. This is the last thing you want for your skin!. 6. Lay off the Caffeine For all you coffee lovers out there, caffeine is another diuretic which can lead to dry skin and lack of nutrients. Try and limit your coffee drinking. 7.

I take MSM supplements daily ( Grab it here on Amazon ) but it’s better to consume raw vegetables. It has to be raw because food processing removes it. 9. Vitamins Take plenty of vitamins for healthy skin.

Many skincare products have harmful ingredients so look for natural/organic skincare products that are of high quality. Great places to find them are at whole food stores or vitamin shops. 16. Get Some Sun With summer approaching it’s okay to get some sun. In fact, it’s necessary. Your body needs the sun for the production of Vitamin D. There are a lot of people out there who are Vitamin D deficient and at one point I was and I didn’t even realize. So, enjoying 15 or 20 minutes of sun exposure couldn’t hurt. 17. Stay out of the Sun This might sound hypocritical since the previous tip suggested some sun; however monitoring sun exposure is also necessary. A lifetime of sun exposure can lead to dry skin, wrinkles, age spots, freckles, sunburns, or even worse..skin cancer. So try to avoid the sun when the sun rays are the strongest which is usually between 10am to 4 pm. Wear protective clothing and sunscreen too! READ: 8 Popular Sunburn Cures & Remedies That Work Well 18. Juicing A simple way to get more nutrients into your body is by doing a juice cleanse . Get a juicer to make all kinds of drinks with fruits and vegetables. The nutrients will protect the skin from aging and provide plenty of antioxidants. 19. Go organic Organic foods are so much better than non-organic items. Yes it cost a little more dough but I consider that better than grabbing foods that contain pesticides. 20. Don’t smoke If you don’t wrinkles then put the cigarette down. Smoking can deplete the skin of its nutrients such as Vitamin A. It can also damage elastin and collagen which gives the skin its elasticity. 21. Good Digestive System To have good skin you gotta have a good digestive system. The main causes of a bad digestive system is not drinking enough water and not consuming more fiber. If you don’t want to suffer from acne, psoriasis or constipations, get your digestive tract right on track. 22. Get your Beauty rest Try and get at least 8 hours of sleep a day. Lack of beauty sleep can cause hormonal imbalance and accelerate the aging process. 23. Organic Clay Mask Applying a clay mask once or twice a week is great for cleansing the skin. Mask draws out impurities and reduces acne. You’ll be left with soft and clean skin. 24. Keep it moving The best solution for overall skin health… Keep it moving . Invigorate your circulation by taking a quick walk outside, going to the gym, doing some stretching, and etc. Doing nothing can promote acne, loss of muscle tone, and cellulite. Yikes! 25. Reduce Sugar Intake Sugar is one of the causes of aging prematurely. It damages the collagen in the skin and reduces elasticity. Try and reduce your sugar intake. I know it can be difficult but it can be a gradual process. 26. Meditation Mediation is known to reduce stress and keep you calm. It increases your health and improves your skin. 27. Stay away from Synthetic Chemicals Synthetic chemicals are harsh for the skin and can do more damage than good. You can find all kinds of ingredients in skin care products that are chemically based which isn’t a good thing. It’s better to go all natural . 28. Eat More Whole Foods Whole foods have more vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and nutrients that the body needs. Stay away from refined sugars! 29. Include Fermented Foods They keep your stomach happy by improving digestion, absorption and nutrient intakes. Examples of fermented foods are sourdough bread, salsa, ketchup, Kefir, and sour cream. 30. Try Aloe Vera Aloe vera naturally heals the skin. Check out my post on the benefits of aloe vera ! 31.

Exfoliate Exfoliation gets rid of dead skin cells and allows the skin to detox. It also brightens and softens the skin . Go for all-natural scrubs! 33. Try a Natural Astringent A natural astringent like rose water and witch hazel is great for removing excess oil, reducing pore size and increasing blood circulation. Astringents found at stores can be really harsh on the skin and can cause more oil production. I like to make my own astringent at home using lemon juice, cucumber juice, and honey. 34. Good Hygiene This is very important for a healthy body. You can prevent many infections with a good anti-bacterial soap. 35. Be Good to your skin Take care of your skin daily and enjoy the benefits of natural skincare.

"['Who doesn’t love how mascaras give your eyes that hot, sexy look. Want to obtain great eyelashes, well here’s BeautyHealth’s secret to hot lashes. I can’t live without DiorShow mascara. It’s one of the best mascara I have come across. I’ve been using DiorShow mascara for a year now and it has done wonders to my eyes. It gives my eyelashes super volume, it lengthens, and curls it perfectly. I definitely feel I have an ultra glam “just off the runway” look. It takes little effort to look good using it and I don’t even use a mirror to apply it. The best part about DiorShow mascara: No smudges, no flakes. Now, it is quite costly ($24.00) and I can’t by it at a RiteAid at 2am but in the end of the day, I obtain gorgeous lashes so who cares if you spend a little more to achieve great set of lashes. Again, great product to use, and it definitely enhances your beauty if just using this product alone. So it’s a winner!

"['Disclosure: I was given free Carmex products for this review. All thoughts and opinions are my own. Carmex has expanded its skincare line with Carmex Healing Lotion and Healing Cream. Here are some facts about Carmex Skin Care: For nearly 75 years, people have come to love the healing power of Carmex lip balms.Finally the Carmex has created a skin care line as a solution to help heal, soothe, and moisturize your dry skin. “Carmex fans have embraced our skin care line since we unveiled the Healing Lotion and Healing Cream last year, ” said Paul Woelbing, president, Carma Laboratories. “Our goal was to leverage the healing power of Carmex to develop a family of skin care products that work as well as our popular lip balm. We are excited that we now offer two Carmex skin care formulas in a variety of sizes to serve virtually every customer need.” Carmex Healing Lotion The healing lotion features aloe and vitamin E to moisturize, heal and protect skin from dryness. It has a light, fresh scent and is formulated for daily use. Carmex Healing Cream The healing cream is a richer, more concentrated formula that helps repair extremely dry, rough or cracked areas. It features nine concentrated healing and moisturizing ingredients and can be used anywhere on the body. It is particularly effective on areas prone to extreme dryness like the hands, feet, elbows and knees. My review: As a member of the Carmex Blog Squad, I had the opportunity to test out both the healing lotion and healing cream. The first thing I noticed from Carmex Healing Lotion and Healing Cream was the scent. It has that signature Carmex smell, but the scent is light and smells awesome! I like the Carmex Healing lotion because it is very soothing and non greasy; however, the Carmex Healing Cream has a more thicker concentration and does wonders to my dry skin. Both products compliment each other well and are great to have throughout the winter season. I keep a small tube in my purse whenever my skin is starting to look parch. Giveaway Carmex fans!

"['With winter, I like to think of all the good things like sipping hot chocolate and cozying up by the fire. Unfortunately, I also think about how much havoc the cold weather can do to my skin. The winter weather calls for special attention to the skin and many of us are either not upping our skin care routines or just making a lot of mistakes. We’re now dealing with dry, itchy skin and it’s uncomfortable and irritating. To help minimize the damage winter weather can do, I’ve put together a do’s and don’ts list to help you keep your skin in the best condition possible. 1. Do care for your lips Every winter my lips always get more chapped and dry. One way I care for my lips is with a lip scrub. You can buy a lip scrub or DIY your own with sugar and honey . I do this before bed and slather on a heavy, moisturizing lip balm to soothe my lips overnight. You should also use lip balm regularly to maintain smooth, soft lips and prevent chapping. I like to wear it before applying my lipstick! 2. Don’t cover up dry skin with makeup Exfoliation is a must before you apply any makeup to dry skin. If you skip this step, your makeup will give your skin a blotchy and flaky appearance. It will just make it more noticeable and nobody wants that. I like to use exfoliating products but if you need a quick fix, try using a washcloth and gently rub the dry area. Then use a moisturizer and primer so the area is smooth before applying your makeup. 3. Do remember to moisturize often You should moisturize several times a day. Even if you’re in a rush because you’re late for work or tired after a long day, you can’t miss this step if you want to prevent moisture from leaving your skin. Moisturizing your face is just as important. The best face moisturizer for winter is one that is grease-less and not too creamy. It will really helps plump up super dry skin. 4. Don’t forget the sunscreen One common mistake people make (and I too have made in the past), is forgetting to wear sunscreen in the winter. We tend to associate sunscreen and SPF with the warmer months because we think the sun is not as strong in the winter. While UVB rays, which cause the skin to tan, are not as strong in the winter, UVA rays are the same length year round and they’re the same rays that cause wrinkles and cancer. So, we’re actually exposing our skin without even realizing it. I learned this from my dermatologist a couple of years back so look for sunscreen with broad spectrum protection for year round use. 5. Do protect your hands Your hands is usually first to get cold and dry so to maintain soft skin on the hands, apply hand cream regularly. I always keep one in my purse so I can use it whenever I feel a cold breeze coming on. Another way I like to protect my hands is by wearing mittens or gloves. 6. Don’t take hot showers I know, I know it’s hard not too especially when it’s super cold but not taking hot showers can do wonders for your dry skin. I’ve slipped up a few times in the past and I always end up paying for it afterwards. You see, taking hot showers can actually irritate dry or sensitive skin. Instead take a warm bath or shower and wash with a gentle cleansing bar. This should help combat eczema or dry itchy skin. 7. Do apply body lotion in the shower My mother taught me this trick when I was younger and it still works for me til this day. Moisturizing your body right after you shower will lock in hydration. What I like to do is towel off in the shower, then I would slather on my favorite ultra moisturizing body lotion ( Click here to see a list of my top 10 body moisturizers to stick with this winter) . This will help prevent moisture from drying out before you can lock it in. If your face tends to get super dry in the winter, you can also use this trick with your face as well. Just apply a moisturizer to your face in a steamy room. 8. Don’t skip exfoliation I’ve always thought that winter skin is too dry to exfoliate but that couldn’t be furthest from the truth. I know now that exfoliating, even during the winter, will slough off dead skin cells from the weather and will regenerate healthy new cells leading to a more glowing complexion. It’s also a must before applying makeup. There’s been times where I’ve left the house with a face full of makeup without exfoliating and ended up with dryness and peeling a few hours later. Very embarrassing! I made sure not to make that mistake again. One product I’m very fond of is Braun’s Face Spa Cleansing Brush . It removes makeup and impurities from the cheeks, T-zone and chin up to 6x better than manual cleansing. This really sloughs off dry skin cells and you can adjust the speed to your preference and skin sensitivity. You can also use Braun Face Spa for facial hair removal by just switching attachments. Two treatments with one device. Pretty sweet! 9. Do keep legs silky smooth and hair-free Smooth legs will always be in style year round and one of the best ways I like to keep my legs looking soft and beautiful is with epilating. It’s a lot better than shaving because I can go about two weeks after epilating without a sign of stubble. Ever since I started to epilate a few months back, I swear by Braun Silk-epil 9 SkinSpa System . It’s a wet-dry epilator that comes with a body exfoliation brush for faster hair removal. Before epilating, I like to start with the exfoliation brush to buff off the dead skin cells and smooth away the rough spots. The brush itself has over 10, 000 fine bristles that gently removes dead skin cells and stimulates the regeneration of the skin surface. It’s also cordless and has a speed personalization feature so you can pick the right speed for your personal needs: extra gentle or extra efficient. Since it’s also a wet epilator, I like to epilate in the shower because it makes the process more comfortable and relaxing. The Silk-epil 9 has a 40% wider head than other Braun epilators so it covers more skin with each stroke for faster epilation. Another great feature is the smartlight on the device to help me see the hairs better. I can remove even the smallest hairs on my legs thus keeping my legs hair-free longer.

"['Zac Posen is stepping into a new venture. He is launching Z Spoke, a lower-priced line that will be sold exclusively at Saks Fifth Avenue in Spring 2010. The American designer has a new endeavour? Aaah Yes…. Sportswear that is!! The 60 piece collection will be largely made up of separate pieces such as cotton shirts, knitwear, and pleated khaki shorts which he describes as “minimalist and utilitarian.” “We’ve had so much pressure from press and retailers to build out our collection into this more American sportswear look in our top line, ” Posen tells WWD . “To me, it’s more appropriate to build a whole brand and collection around this price point. Chic sportswear should be at this price point.” Speaking of price point, cotton Tshirts will start at $78 where as a knit dress can reach anywhere to $675.

"['If you missed the American Music Awards last night, you missed a lot because there were spectacular and controversial moments throughout the show. Lots of shockers too like Ms. Taylor Swift winning 5 AMA’s. 5 AMA’s…..that’s crazy! Oh..and let’s not forget the hyped up performance of Adam Lambert which turned out to be very unforgettable and unexpected but not in a good way. The red carpet surely had my attention but which one was the attention grabber? Check out pics of the 2009 AMA’s Red Carpet Looks! Alicia Keys looking gorgeous as usual in a blue Armani Prive’ dress with crystal details. For hair, she went with an old-fashioned, classic up-do that’s a straight blast from the past. For makeup she has on a strong blue eyeshadow and sheer pink gloss. Carrie Underwood in a gold Theia frock with a new curly bob. Honestly, I miss the length but the new bob is a fun look. Makeup in smoky lilac/purple eyeshadow with peachy color lips to finish. Teen sensation Demi Lovato in a nude Jenny Packham dress with a jeweled necklace and diamond earrings by Martin Katz. I love her look! AMA winner Fergie brought sexiness to the red carpet wearing a zipper edge Armani Prive’ diamond studded black gown. Her voluminous, wavy locks is amazing and the makeup was kept simple. Jennifer Lopez looks amazing in a feathered Marchesa dress. Hair is stunning and pinned back and makeup is flawless. Love her glammed up look! Kristen Bell looks sexy in this Christian Cota bandeau with matching skirt. Kristen Bell makeup looks smokin hot with pink-toned lips and cheeks. Eyes very smoky and hair.. tousled up. Leona Lewis with a more edgier look and quite frankly I’m not a fan. Not feeling this one but I do love the hair and the makeup. For makeup she went with a bright green shadow that really makes her eyes pop, pink lips, and bronzer on the cheeks. Just beautiful! Rihanna in a Marchesa gown. Marchesa is known for their beautiful and elegant gowns. This gown is a bit more racy with cutouts of roses up to the hip. Only Rihanna can pull this look off. She keeps the hair funky but not crazy and for makeup….I love the red eyeliner! Disney Star Selena Gomez shimmered in a silver Talbot Runhof cocktail dress. For hair, she went for elegance wearing curls in a lovely loose bun with pieces falling free on both sides of face. Makeup is simple, sheer and age-appropriate. Shakira looks amazing in this bright yellow Versace minidress with geometric details. Hair is pulled back in a sleek ponytail. Makeup is very neutral. The whole look is very chic. If I had to pick, this would be the winning look! Love, love, love it!! Mary J. Blige looks chic and elegant in this slim black gown with knotted details. Hair is very hip and makeup absolutely flawless. The Queen of R&B is just fabulous from head to toe. Who’s your pick for best or worst red carpet look?

"['Actress Zoe Saldana hit the red carpet for Tuesday’s Los Angeles premiere of Star Trek: Into Darkness in a gorgeous Rodarte dress from the fall 2013 collection and a loosely-knotted bun courtesy of celebrity stylist Mara Roszak. Inspired by her casual yet glam dress, Mara gave Zoe a chic, frizz-free updo that felt easygoing while still red carpet appropriate. Get The Look Step 1 – Prep To keep hair frizz-free all night, Mara applied John Frieda Frizz-Ease Serum Original Formula to wet hair and started to blow out Zoe’s hair in sections using a round boar-bristle brush. Step 2 – Style Once Zoe’s hair was completely dry, Mara started adding a wave with a 1 ¼ inch curling iron all over her head, wrapping each section away from Zoe’s face. Because Zoe’s hair has a natural wave and it’s summertime in LA, Mara applied John Frieda Frizz-Ease Secret Weapon Flawless Finishing Crème to her hair, loosening the waves as she ran her fingers through Zoe’s hair. Next, Mara pulled her hair into a low ponytail , securing it with an elastic, and wrapped Zoe’s hair into a bun and pinning it in place. Step 3 – Perfect Leaving a few pieces of hair brushed out to frame her face, Mara sprayed her hair with John Frieda Frizz-Ease Moisture Barrier Hairspray to hold the style all night, and finished off the look by spritzing John Frieda Frizz-Ease 100% Shine Glossing Mist to keep Zoe’s hair looking soft, shiny and healthy.

"['More great looks from New York Fashion Week Spring 2010. I love all four of these looks. As you can see, three of the looks are great everyday wear and I picked out one evening wear. The Anna Sui dress is so cute, I can’t stop gushing over it. I love this look from Tory Burch. The whole look is complete. I was super impressed from the Michael Kors Collection. There were so many great looks; but, overall the look above is my favorite because it’s so chic and I love the strong shoulders in the dress. The Thakoon dress worn by Chanel Iman is lovely but I also love the hair. The Thakoon design theme is described as “warrior surf” so the inspired hair look, performed by Wella Professionals, comes across as “sumo wrestler meets surf”. That’s pretty cool! All hair styling, hair products, and hair color was done by the whole Wella Professionals Team. Get the Look Blowdry the hair back and away from the face. Brush all the hair from ear to ear back and into a tight pony tail. Apply Wella System Professional Supermousse to the pony for a sleek, satin finish. Incorporate the hair from the center of the nape of the neck, in a 2 inch section up to the pony. Bind the hair in the pony with 1/2 inch thick black elastic or ribbon, folding it back on itself to create a knot of hair. Smooth a silicone gloss into hands and smooth over the hair that has been bound for a sleek finish. Add colored extensions to the hair that is left out of the bind, to add length and fullness, as well as color depth. Then spray this hair with Wella High Hair Ocean Spritz and diffuse for a beachy texture.

"['Designer: Thakoon Looks: It’s all about the fur hoods! Fox, Mink, and Racoon jackets and coats were seen down the runway as well as prints. Color palettes mainly used were gray, black, and ivory. His inspiration draws from Chopinot & Gaultier’s Le Défilé, a dance troupe that collaborated with Jean Paul Gaultier for costumes during the 80’s and 90’s. Thakoon also did a fab job on playing with layers, proportions, and lots of textures! Makeup: Diane Kendall for NARS . All makeup was done by NARS to create a palette of neutral colors. They kept the makeup soft to keep the focus on the clothes. Hair: Eugene Souleiman for Wella . The hair look was “destroyed blowdry” and a matte texture with the help of baby powder. My thoughts: I love the makeup on the models especially how they sculpted the cheeks slightly with Douceur blush (new product for fall). My favorite looks are the printed pieces!

Thakoon Panichgul’s first-ever collaboration with beauty brand NARS brings us a limited-edition six-piece collection of gorgeously bright nail lacquers. Right on-trend with this season’s festive warm-weather brights, all six shades are inspired by the exotic, high-impact hues found in Indian spice markets. From the fiery orange-red Lal Mirchi to the cyan blue Koliary, each shade retails for $18 a pop and delivers a glossy, long-lasting, chip-resistant wear. While all six shades are gorgeous, my personal favorite is the sunny yellow, Amchoor, which is the perfect in-your-face yellow without verging on blindingly neon!

"[""Supermodels Chanel Iman and Jourdan Dunn are gracing the cover of the upcoming November issue of Teen Vogue. Both of these ladies are gorgeous and are an inspiration because they bring some much needed diversity to the runway. I love these models! Chanel is wearing a Miu Miu bodysuit and Jourdan a Miu Miu dress shot at Atlantic City, NJ. The November issue will hit stands October 13th. To read more about their interview with Teen Vogue, go here . “It’s competition, ” Jourdan says. “There aren’t a lot of us, but instead of sticking together, we’re pitted against each other. People will say things in Chanel’s ear like, ‘Jourdan is taking your spot, ‘ and then they’ll say to me, ‘Don’t trust Chanel.'” A large part of the problem stems from the ridiculous idea that there’s only room for one. Chanel says, “You’re being told, ‘So and so is only booking one black girl. It’s either you or Jourdan, ‘ So we’ll be sitting in the lobby looking at each other like, ‘Okay, I want this job, and she wants it too.

"['Don’t get me wrong — as a huge Hello Kitty fan, I normally think she can do no wrong, but I have to admit I was a bit disappointed by the recent release of her debut makeup collection for Sephora. Sure, some choice items were cute, like the brush collection and the tiered palettes. However, there are only so many candy-colored shadows and glitter eyeliners a girl can own before it becomes painfully obvious that I’m only buying them for my love of HK. That’s why I was curious, but still a bit skeptical, when I found out that the collection would continue with special edition seasonal items. I mean, maybe this was the Kitty’s chance to step up her game! And in the case of the Memoirs of a Kitty collection — namely the Say Hello tiered palette — she does not disappoint this time! Inspired by the pretty, feminine colors of Japanese cherry blossoms, the palette boasts a cute blossom print and inside, a series of 4 coordinating shadows in soft browns and peaches and 2 pretty pink blushes. Together it makes for a softly smoldering look with just the right amount of edge (love that dark smoky brown shadow!), and let’s face it — that printed Hello Kitty case is too cute to pass up! – Alex Gambardella Guest post from my friends over at The Find!

I wanted to create a wearable hairstyle that would be translatable for everyday women, while still incorporating sculptural elements to the design.

It’s the perfect time to catch up on novel and magazine reading, but the chlorine, sun and salt water can take a dramatic toll on your hair. Be sure to protect your hair with sunscreen before and condition after your dip in the pool or day at the beach. We’ve found some after sun hair care products to make summertime maintenance all that more enjoyable. Lenore Greyl’s Huile de Palme combats against the damaging effects of sun, seawater and chlorinated pool water. To restore summer damaged hair simply apply for 10 minutes up to overnight and then re-apply after four trips to the pool. Barex’s Sun Essential Hair and Body Shampoo chlorine, sand, salt and sun creams while infusing pro-Vitamin B5, Carotene and Meadowfoam Oil for optimal hydration and at the same time softening skin and hair. Fresh’s Pomegranate conditioner moisturizes while adding body and protecting hair from the sun’s elements, to be used before and after poolside exposure, all summer long. Other treatments for keeping your locks looking healthy all summer long include Ouidad Sun Shield Sun & Sport Leave-In Spray provides a shield against damaging sun, wind, salt, and chlorine and seals in moisture with UV filters. Another easy to apply spray on conditioner is the Oscar Blandi Capri Sun-Shield Spray. This product is inspired by the glamorous outdoor island lifestyle of Capri.

I’m always frying my hair so I needed some kind of treatment to get my hair back to its lustfulness and shine. Something to restore the beauty and health of my hair and minimize the hair breakage from heat damage. The kit is from Ojon called SWA Liquid Hair Building 4 Step ritual. I have used Ojon products in the past for my hair, which is why I was so inclined to try this new product. This kit is to be used once a week for 8 weeks. It penetrates the hair to rebuild and restore the protein bonds in the hair. It increases the strength of the hair and targets hair density loss. It also forms a protective shield around it which provides antioxidants and minimize hair breakage. What’s also great about this kit is that it’s made from natural ingredients. So, no sulfates, alcohol, or artificial color. The kit includes: 8.44 oz SWA+Nourishing Conditioner 8.44 oz SWA+Stimulating Cleanser 2.5 oz SWA+Hair Juice Daily Leave in Treatment (8) 0.24 oz SWA+Concentrated Liquid Hair Boosting Serum with Two Applicators So far, I have tried one treatment, and I already notice a change in my hair.

"['Finding the perfect red lip shade can be a nightmare but, keeping it in place is another challenge. Just look at gorgeous stars like Kerry Washington, Jessica Alba, and Lauren Conrad. They know how to achieve well-defined fiery lips. Q: How can I get my lips perfectly defined? A: Easy! Just follow these 5 steps… Step 1 : Exfoliate! Soft lips is key for proper application so make sure you exfoliate beforehand and apply a nourishing lip balm for added protection. Step 2: Use a lip liner slightly darker than your lip shade. Especially if you’re wearing a bright pout like red. Step 3: Make sure your lip liner is sharp to achieve a finer line. Start at the middle and line towards the corners of your mouth. Use a cotton swab to clean up the edges. Step 4: Grab a lip brush to apply lipstick or apply directly but, dot it on or use a circular motion. Also, use your brush to smooth out your liner after applying the lipstick. Step 5: Wipe the corners of your lips with a cotton swab again to get rid of any color on the edges and you’re done! Check out a step-by-step visual for gorgeous well-defined lips below! I hope you enjoyed my beauty tip of the week!
