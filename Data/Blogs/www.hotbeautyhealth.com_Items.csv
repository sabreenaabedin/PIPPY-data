"['There has long been a connection between our physical space and emotional well-being. When we live amidst clutter, that chaos affects our emotional health. The spaces we create for ourselves in our homes should be a reprieve from the outside world and should offer us solace and peace. Opening up space in your closet and storage areas opens up space in the mind, as well as a feeling of pride and accomplishment. Below are some steps to get you started on how to declutter clothes. Step 1. Locate all the Places Clothes are Stored Chances are, if you are in need of a good decluttering, it is more than just your closet that is in need. Work your way through every room and closet to make sure you have located all the storage spaces for clothes in the home. Move them all to one central location so you are not constantly going from one section to another. Step 2. Decide on Pile Organization Once you have all your clothes centralized, consider how you would like to organize them. A good plan is to make a pile for ‘keeps’, a pile for ‘donating’ or giving to someone you know, and a pile for ‘throwing away’. Once you have decided on your piles, make sure you have picked a good space to start going through your clothes. Also, make an additional pile for seasonal items; these are items you want to keep but don’t suit the current season so don’t need to take up prime real estate in your closet and can be stored elsewhere. Step 3. Create Clothes for ‘Keeps’ Pile: 4 Questions to Ask When it comes to deciding which clothes you want to keep, ask yourself some pertinent questions: Have you worn this in the last year? Is this something that makes me feel good when I’m wearing it? Am I likely to fit into this again? Am I holding onto this because of a memory? Asking yourself these questions will help you figure out just why you want to keep certain things. 1. “Have I Worn this in the Last Year?” When you are looking at a piece of clothing, ask yourself when the last time you wore it was. If it wasn’t within the last year, let it go. This can be tough as you may be thinking of that outing in the future that it might just be perfect for. The truth is if you haven’t found a use for it in the past year, you likely won’t in the following. 2. “Does this Item of Clothing Make me Feel good?” Ask yourself if an item you are considering actually makes you feel good about yourself. If it is one of those items you bought because it’s a status symbol, or because it was a good deal, or simply because it’s fashionable, it might not bring you much pleasure in wearing it and is not worth the space it takes up. These items are good ones to add to the ‘donating’ or ‘pass-to-a-friend’ pile. 3. “Will this Really Fit Me Again?” Often you hold onto clothes because they represent a former you, a smaller you, a larger you, a pre-pregnancy you. When you hold onto clothes on the chance that they will fit you again, ask yourself if this is really realistic. Your body will change drastically throughout your life, especially if you have children, or make attempts to lose weight. It is okay to not have the perfect body; instead, strive for a healthy body, and get rid of those clothes whose fit no longer reflect who you are or your present stage of life. 4. “Am I Holding onto this as a Memory?” These are the hardest clothes to get rid of. You all know which ones I’m referring to. Maybe it’s that shirt you wore on your first date with your boyfriend or husband. Maybe it’s the dress you wore the night you found out some really good news, or really bad news or maybe the clothes belonged to your children, who have now left the nest. Memories are memories, and they will exist with or without a physical reminder of them. In these cases, you should commit to keeping one item that represents a certain beloved stage, event, or person in your life, but only one. Your life will be full of memories: past, present, and future. If you hold onto too many old-memory items, there won’t be enough room for new ones. Consider what’s more important to you, holding onto the clutter from the past, or moving forward. Step 4. Donating and Giving Away Once you have asked yourself these questions and hopefully answered them truthfully, sort your clothes into the various pile categories. Be generous with the donation pile. Think of how many clothes you have accumulated that now need to be decluttered, and consider the difference they could make in the lives of people who truly need them. When donating, choose somewhere your local Goodwill and a cause you can feel good about; this will make it easier to part with the items. Step 5. Seasonal Items Once you have sorted your pile of seasonal items, find a good place in the home where they can be stored between their relevant seasons. A good spot is somewhere they are easily accessible but not taking space away from areas of daily use. Good spots for seasonal clothing items are armoires in the basement or a closet in a guest room. Once you have decluttered your home and closet of unnecessary clothing, take a deep breath, grab a cup of tea, or coffee, and relax. There are few things that make you feel better about your home than freeing up much-needed space. Once you have redistributed your clothes and can see all that space you have opened up, it might be tempting to go on a shopping spree. Try and resist the urge to build up clutter again by always keeping those decluttering questions in mind when you are in the shops considering whether or not to buy.

"['In this day and age when everything is filled with chemicals and toxins, it’s even more important to take good care of your body. Detoxification is the best way to cleanse your body and reestablish its balance from within. If you detox your body on a regular basis you can maintain your health, reduce risk of disease, boost your metabolism and immune system, optimize digestion and lose weight. These are all physical benefits, but with a body cleanse you will also get mental benefits like improving you capacity to focus, help relieve stress and get rid of fatigue. So let’s take a look at these 13 detox snacks that you can munch on every day. Note: If you’re following a clean eating diet, this list of foods are perfect to add to your clean eating plan! 1. Avocado A great snack, high in fiber and fat – don’t fret, it’s the good type of fat! It’s advisable to consume avocado as is, without any other ingredients. Also, your best option is to go for organic avocados. This fruit contains a bunch of antioxidants and glutathione, a nutrient that can block up to 30 carcinogens and detox your liver. Avocados will help you eat less added sugars, thus help you lose weight, lower your BMI and metabolic syndrome risk. ( Read This: 13 Savory Ways to Cook with Avocado ) 2. Grapefruit This fruit is widely famous in diets because it helps the liver to burn fat. It’s a great snack that helps treat diabetes, strengthens the body fight against cancer and lowers cholesterol. Not to mention that it works wonders for people suffering from stomach ulcers and gum disease. Another benefit of grapefruit is that it helps prevent strokes and the apparition of metabolic syndrome. 3. Pineapple Pineapples are one of the tastiest detox snacks you can get your hands on. Not only do they taste amazing, but they also help with digestion and colon cleansing thanks to a digestive enzyme it contains. This enzyme called bromelain can also help balance blood coagulation, reduce inflammation and the growth of certain tumors (Try this recipe: A Make-Ahead Strawberry & Pineapple Green Smoothie . 4. Asparagus Asparagus not only helps you detox your body, but it also helps you stay young. It also helps with liver drainage and reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer. It’s a tasty vegetable that helps with all forms of inflammations and it’s also known to maintain a healthy heart. ( Try this Recipe : Bacon Wrapped Asparagus with Caramelized Sesame (Guilt-Free) 5. Celery Fresh celery helps balance the body’s pH levels and neutralize acidity. Slightly alkaline pH will not only improve health, but also help with fertility. Celery juice will replace electrolytes, so this is actually a healthy option to Gatorade and other such drinks. It lowers cholesterol and blood pressure and it sometimes even works better than medicine. It is known for reducing cravings for both sweet and highly consistent foods. It will help with stress as it calms the entire nervous system. On the other hand, it also has great benefits for the urinary tract and kidneys. 6. Apples Great snacks that contain phytochemicals like flavonoids, D-Glucarate and terpenoids are vital for when you detox your body. Phlorizin is one flavonoid that helps with bile stimulation, thus helping the liver eliminate toxins. Apples also support the body to get rid of additive and metals that we ingest from regular food consumption. 7. Watermelon Watermelon helps the body get alkalinized, while having diuretic effects. Consuming watermelon will make you use the loo a lot more often, but eliminating high amounts of urine means ridding your body of more toxins. Watermelon contains a high amount of citrulline, which removes ammonia from your body. It also contains arginine that regulates blood flow. Watermelon also helps reduce inflammation and prevents wrinkles because of its high levels of lycopene. ( Try this Recipe: Frozen Watermelon Popsicles ) 8. Green smoothie Green smoothies contain a variety of healthy, green, fresh vegetables. They are extremely helpful with digestion, bloating, allergies, constipation, indigestion, weight issues and obesity. Moreover, they can reestablish a person’s energy levels, improve brain function, alleviate headaches, chronic pain, insomnia and infections. ( Try this Recipe : A Green Detox Smoothie for Glowing Skin ) 9. Green tea High in antioxidants, this tea is great with any diet and detox as it identifies and kills free radicals in your body. Green tea can be considered a snack in some ways because you can drink it instead of soda or pre-packaged juices. It also has diuretic effects and it can help lower blood sugar levels. 10. Lemon water Lemon water helps with acidity from foods and is great to drink first thing in the morning. It will improve digestion and detoxify the liver. Apart from flushing toxins out of your body, lemon water will help stabilize your body’s pH levels (Try this: How to Make Infused Water ) 11. Almonds Almonds are tasty detox snacks, high in fiber and rich in protein that help remove bowel impurities and balance sugar levels in your blood. They’re filled with vitamins like calcium, magnesium and vitamin E. Not to mention they’re easy to consume anywhere, so you have no excuse for not eating a healthy snack at work. 12. Blueberries Blueberries are nature’s medicine in the form of small fruit. They are considered to be natural aspirin and have antiviral properties. These round tasty berries reduce inflammation and lessen pain. They’re natural antibiotics and help prevent infections in the urinary tract by blocking out bacteria. 13. Kale This is the latest trend in detox diets and for good reason. It has so many antioxidants, vitamins and minerals that it simply boosts your metabolism, protects from any and all diseases and cleanses your body with every bite you take. Eating kale will help you flush out your kidneys, thus restoring the health of a vital organ that helps your body get rid of toxins on a daily basis.

"['Efficient and well-insulated homes serve many useful purposes, but they often also end up doing a pretty good job of trapping indoor air pollutants! We are talking here chemicals such as formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, benzene, xylene, etc.—toxins that are commonly found in most household items and personal care products. And this, in turn, makes us vulnerable to a number of mild to serious conditions such as frequent headaches, asthma, allergies, difficulty in digestion and more. However, there is an easy solution at hand and one that is hundred percent natural, healthy and inexpensive— air purifying plants. There is a huge variety of home plants that you can place indoors and that do an excellent job of filtering out harmful airborne particles and releasing fresh oxygen in the air. In fact, NASA has already published a study on this subject ( the Clean Air Study ) with different plants being assigned individual scores based on how good they are in purifying indoor air. Below is a list of 15 such air purifying plants which are great at cleansing your indoors air at the same time as they add a nice touch to your décor. Many of these air purifying plants are also hard to kill and very effective in resisting insect infestation. 1. Spider Plant (Chlorophytum Comosum “Vittatum”) Spider plant is one of the easiest plants to grow and it grows very quickly and in a wide variety of conditions. A bi-weekly watering will suffice for its growth and it is able to thrive even in very low temperatures. This is why we feel this plant is ideal for beginners. Natural light is essential for the growth of spider plant, however make sure it is not exposed to direct sunlight. The spider plant does a pretty good job of clearing the indoor air of pollutants like xylene and formaldehyde (a chemical frequently found in cleansing and personal care products). Experts also recommend that it is best to place your spider plant pot inside your kitchen and near the fireplace since the plant is good at clearing any carbon monoxide build up. Find it at: Etsy 2. Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum sp) Peace Lily comes with a NASA air purification score of 7.5, which is enough to tell you that it is one of the top plants for fighting indoor air pollutants. In addition, this is another plant which is very easy to grow. Keep it in shade and water the plant weekly and this is all it will need to thrive and produce blooms. The plant does an excellent job of clearing the indoor air of the three most common Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)—benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene. It is also good at cleansing the air of acetone, a common carcinogen normally found in paint, nail polish, etc. However, the proximity to the plant may be a little harmful to your pets, so make sure to keep them away from it. Find it at : Amazon or Proflowers 3. Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata) This plant is instantly recognizable by its sharp, pointy leaves, hence the name (funnily enough, it’s also called Mother-in-law’s Tongue!). The plant is easy to care for and although it may not be one of the top air-purifying plants, it is still good at filtering out formaldehyde. More importantly, as we’ll later see in the case of Aloe Vera, the plant, instead of absorbing, actually releases oxygen in the nighttime. Which is why it is a good idea to place the plant somewhere in your bedroom. Find it at: Amazon or Proflowers 4. Dracaena (Dracaena spp.) Among all the different plants in the Dracaenas family, Dracaena Deremensis (Janet Craig), or Warneck Dracaena, as it is commonly called, is best in removing trichloroethylene that comes from varnishes and solvents. As such, it is a great idea to put this plant indoors in newly painted homes or office spaces. With long striped leaves growing out of a small stem, the plant is also quite attractive looking and can grow up to 12 feet tall. However, if you prefer, you can keep it shorter by pruning the leaves. The plant needs little sunlight and moderate water to thrive. The edges as well as the inside streaks of this particular species of Dracaena leaves have a whitish hue. If, however, the edges or the stripes start to get brown, this may be due to an excess of fluoride in the water you are using for the plant. In such a case, you may consider bottled H2O for watering the plant. And while we are at Dracaena family plants, we may just as well mention the Dracaena Marginata. The plant looks quite similar to that of Warneck Dracaena, however it can be distinguished by its purple-red edges around the leaves. This plant is good at eliminating formaldehyde, xylene and trichloroethylene. Find it at: Amazon 5. Boston Fern (Nephrolepsis exaltata v. Bostoniensis) Ferns normally pose some difficulty for the owner when it comes to take caring of them. However, Boston Fern is quite tolerant in that regard. You need to keep it in a cool, partly shady place with indirect sunlight reaching the plant and it will thrive quite nicely. However, all ferns require moist conditions, so make sure to check that the soil is moist all the time. Boston ferns work great as a natural air humidifier, besides being one of the top plants in removing formaldehyde effectively off indoor air. The plant, with its attractive feather ferns spanning as large as 4-5 feet, comes with a NASA air purification score of 7.5. Find it at: Amazon 6. Ficus/Weeping Fig (Ficus Benjamina) At 7.7, the Weeping Fig comes with an even higher air purification score and is great at removing chemicals like toluene, xylene and formaldehyde. Like most figs, this plant thrives in direct sunlight, so choose a nice sunny spot for it in your home. However, any kind of overt light-level fluctuations could be bad for the plant’s health, so keep that in mind when choosing a place for it. Also, the plant is toxic to pets, so keep it out of their reach. Find it at: Etsy 7. Bamboo Palm (Chamaedorea seifritzii) Bamboo Palm is right at top when it comes to purifying indoor air off different pollutants. It has an air purification score of 8.4 (only Lady Palm and Areca Palm—both at 8.5—come with higher scores) and is one of the best air filters for xylene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene and benzene. What is more, the plant also works great as an air humidifier, transpiring as much as a litre of water per day. And unlike most other species of palms, Bamboo Palm plants grow in shady, low-light conditions and this makes them an ideal choice for keeping indoors. The plants are also good at resisting pest infestation. Find it at : Plantz 8. Areca Palm (Chrysalidocarpus Lutescens) Areca palm, with its long, large and beautiful feather-shaped fronds, is ideal for bigger rooms as well as outdoor spaces such as atrium or screened patios. And as we have already mentioned, it ranks right at top as an indoor air-purifier plant and cleanses all tested indoor air toxic elements. The plants are easy to care for and with their outward-arching large feathery fronds growing out of multiple reed-like stems, they give a nice tropical feel to any indoor space. Find it at : The Home Depot or Etsy 9. Rubber Plant (Ficus Robusta) Another excellent air purifier, rubber plant is also famous for its toughness and can withstand extremely low temperatures. The plant comes with a high air purification score of 8.0 and will remove most indoor air pollutants, although it is especially effective in eliminating formaldehyde. The rubber plant thrives in low light and in proper conditions, will grow as high as 8-10 feet. As a high toxin-absorbant, the plant can be harmful to cats and dogs, so make sure to keep your pets away from it. Find it at : Etsy 10. English Ivy (Hedera Helix) This ivy plant is found to be especially helpful in reducing airborne fecal-matter particles. It is also good at soaking up carcinogens from small areas, so it’s an ideal choice for a family with smokers. The plant grows easily and quickly in direct sunlight and requires little maintenance, however you must see to it that the soil stays moist for most of the time. Also, in view of the invasive nature of its growth, it is wise to choose a relatively large pot for this plant and to not keep it too near any other plant. Find it at : Etsy or Amazon 11. Dwarf Date Palm (Phoenix Roebelenii) Another palm which comes with a high air purification score (7.8) and is good at removing most airborne toxins, though especially effective in cleansing the air of xylene, a chemical found in most paint thinner and solvents. The plant also works well as a natural air humidifier and is easy to maintain. It normally thrives in direct sunlight (although the growth rate is somewhat slow), but it will be alright even if you place it in low light areas. And just like bamboo palms, this adorable-looking mini date palm tree will give a real tropical feel to your room. Find it at : Etsy 12. Aloe Vera (A. Barbadensis) According to NASA ratings, Aloe Vera may not hold the top ranks when it comes to purifying indoor air, but all the same the plant does a good job of clearing the indoor air of chemicals like benzene and formaldehyde. But the plant is known to come with a range of other benefits as well which is why we mention it in this list. Aloe Vera leaves, for instance, secrete the aloe gel which is believed to have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties and has been used for many centuries to treat conditions like burns, scrapes and other wounds. Recent researches reveal evidence that the gel can be useful to treat difficult skin conditions such as psoriasis. Aloe is normally used topically, but if one prefers, one can also use it internally by way of making smoothies from aloe leaves. Read: 5 Incredible Health Benefits of Aloe Vera All in all, Aloe Vera is a handy plant to keep indoors, maybe at your kitchen. Just keep it in mind that the plant requires proper drainage to thrive, so make sure there is never any standing water in your aloe pot. Find it at: Amazon or Etsy 13. Gerbera Daisy (Gerbera Jamesonii) This daisy plant is extremely effective in filtering out pollutants like benzene and trichloroethylene. Like all daisies, Gerberas thrive in direct sunlight and require well-drained soil. So make sure to place this plant in a bright, sunny place and choose a pot with multiple holes for good drainage. The plants come with large green leaves and multi-colored blooms with satiny petals, all of which makes them an excellent choice for keeping in your living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom—just about any place you like, as long as it gets enough sunlight throughout the day (We suggest windowsills as the best place for your daisy pots.). You may also consider using a water-soluble mild fertilizer every two weeks on this plant, especially when the flowers are in bloom. Find it at : FTD or Amazon 14. Chrysanthemum (Chrysantheium morifolium) Another native to warm climates, Chrysanthemums, just like gerberas, make an excellent choice for an indoor plant that serves the double function of purifying your indoors as well as beautifying the space. As they are often referred to, the ‘mums’ do a pretty neat job of clearing the indoor air of benzene and the plants are also known to be used for flavoring and medicinal purposes. Good drainage and direct sunlight are essential for growth, so choose a sunny or brightly-lit position for your mums. Also, since you will be planting indoors, make sure to choose a floral chrysanthemum and not a garden variety. Find it at : The Flower Factory or Etsy 15. Chinese Evergreen (Aglaonema sp.) Chinese Evergreen is one of the easiest air purifying plants to grow in your house and is also very good at removing a variety of indoor air toxins. This tropical plant normally prefers humid air, but will tolerate and grow well pretty much in all conditions. However, occasional misting is a good idea if the plants are kept in too dry an air. They thrive pretty well in low light areas too, so you needn’t bother about where you place the pot. The gray, silver and glossy green leaves of the plant with their streaks, spots and stripes also add a nice touch to any décor.

"['Mosquitoes…ugh! We all hate seeing them around the house and will do anything to prevent them from coming inside our homes. As the weather warms up, these pesky critters can become extremely irritating to both you and your pets inside and outside your home and they can cause certain health problems too since they carry serious diseases. Of course there are numerous chemical sprays on the market that you can use to get rid of mosquitoes, but these commercial products contain toxins that can cause various other medical problems that are detrimental to your health. Your other option for getting rid of mosquitoes is to go for the natural alternatives like the following 11 mosquito repellent plants that work just as well as any commercial product available. I’ve used a few of these mosquito repellent plants in my home last summer and I was able to relax without the fear of getting bitten. Popular Posts Now 15 Air-Purifying Plants You Need in Your Home 11 Unexpected Ways to Decorate Your Home With Plants 1. Lavender Lavender is a beautiful purple plant that gives off an equally beautiful scent, but did you know that it does wonders for keeping those annoying mosquitoes away? Although pleasant to you, the aromatic smell of lavender is repugnant to mosquitoes and will stop them from attacking you both indoors and outdoors. Plant it directly in your garden or in pots close to doors and windows to keep mosquitoes at bay. Crushing the leaves and rubbing them directly onto your exposed skin will give you even more protection against these pesky critters. 2. Marigolds These pretty, colorful little flowers with their strong, aromatic smell, are also great to use as mosquito repellents. The reason for this is because marigolds contain a substance called pyrethrum, an ingredient used in numerous commercial insect repellents. Positioned in pots around the doors and windows of your home will look great, but will form an invisible barrier that will stop mosquitoes from entering your home. 3. Mint Besides its refreshing, clean “minty” smell that is way better than the chemical smell of any commercial insect spray, mint is also an effective, natural mosquito repellent. According to a report by the Malaria Journal, studies conducted showed that mint, when applied to exposed body parts, stopped mosquitoes from settling on the skin. It was also discovered from these studies, that mosquito larva died a day after being sprayed with a mixture of water and peppermint oil. 4. Lemon Balm With the leaves having the scent of lemon with a slight minty smell, it is no surprise that lemon balm is part of the mint family. Apart from its many healing properties, lemon balm is also used by many people to keep mosquitoes at bay. If mosquitoes are making your life miserable, crush a few lemon balm leaves between your fingers and rub them onto any exposed skin. Grow lemon balm close to your doors and you will have a quick and easy mosquito repellent handy to use indoors as well. 5. Catnip Besides being hugely attractive to cats, catnip is also deemed to be one of the most effective natural insect repellents around. This particular plant contains nepetalactone, a natural chemical which is effective as both a cat attractant and insect repellent. According to the American Chemical Society, one of several studies conducted discovered that catnip is in fact, about ten times more successful than DEET at repelling mosquitoes. Apart from growing catnip to repel mosquitoes, you can apply the crushed leaves to your exposed skin for maximum protection against mosquito bites. 6. Citronella Like many other people, you probably also use citronella candles to ward of mosquitoes, but do you know that they contain harmful chemicals that can be damaging to your health? More effective and with no risk to your health at all, is the citronella plant (citrosum), frequently referred to as the mosquito plant, that you can grow in your garden to use as a mosquito repellent and when you need to. The citronella scent is found in the leaves of the plant and when crushed and applied to the skin, helps to repel mosquitoes. 7. Rosemary While this lovely flowering plant is frequently used to flavor food, it is also extremely effective at repelling mosquitoes. Rosemary can be grown in your garden or in pots inside your home, provided that they are placed in a position where they can enjoy full sun every day. The growing plant, as well as cuttings from it, is great for keeping mosquitoes away. If you’re camping or having a BBQ in your garden, toss a few sprigs of rosemary into the fire and the smell it gives off while it is burning, will keep mosquitoes away from you, as long as you’re close to the smoke. 8. Basil Basil, one of the most aromatic herbs, is one of the easiest, most effective plants to keep mosquitoes away. Unlike other plants, there is no need to touch or crush the leaves of the basil plant to stop mosquitoes from attacking you, although applying the crushed leaves to your skin will give you ultimate protection. Simply grow basil in pots and place them at strategic places in your garden or on your patio to stop an invasion by those irritating mosquitoes. A study conducted in 2009 reported that basil essential oil, when sprayed onto mosquito larva, kills them off within 24 hours! 9. Scented Geraniums Many gardening sites and gardeners recommend scented geraniums for use as a mosquito repellent, with the lemon-scented variety being the most effective. The scent of these plants is similar to citronella, which is well known for being one of the best for keeping insects at bay. Plant them in your garden close to windows and doors to stop mosquitoes from invading your home. Scented geraniums can also be grown in pots on your deck or patio, but should be pruned regularly to keep their prolific growth in check. 10. Pennyroyal Another plant well known for its natural insect repellent properties, pennyroyal is most effective for the fight against mosquitoes. Planting them in the soil around your house will prevent mosquitoes from coming into your yard. You can also place vases containing sprigs of fresh pennyroyal around your home to kill off any that come into those areas. Pennyroyal can also be grown in pots inside your home for added protection. If you are going to be in an area where you know you will be plagued with mosquitoes, simply put some crushed pennyroyal leaves in your pockets and the mosquitoes are guaranteed to stay far way from you! 11. Sage Crushing sage leaves and rubbing them on your skin will keep mosquitoes away, but for maximum effectiveness, go for a higher concentration of sage in the form of sage essential oil to keep mosquitoes at bay. Tossing some sage into the fire when you’re out camping or entertaining guests around a BBQ will give off a sage-scented smoke that will keep the irritating pests away. As mentioned above, it is the natural smells in the oils found in the leaves and flowers of certain plants that make them effective natural insect repellents. You can plant them in pots on your deck or patio, close to your front and back doors, or directly in your garden, whichever suits you best. By doing this, you will not only have colorful, wonderfully-scented plants to beautify your home and garden, but some of the best and most effective natural mosquito repellents too, to keep these irritating insects at bay.

"['Since the start of the year, I’ve devoted myself to living a more active lifestyle. It’s a choice I made because…a). I wanted to drop a couple of pounds and b). start taking better care of my health now that I’m in my thirties. We’re 3 months in to 2018 and so far the changes I’ve made in my life has made a strong impact on my body and mindset. I’m at the gym at least 3 to 4 times a week and I’ve changed my diet to include healthier food options. I feel and look great, and I’m so close to hitting my target weight loss goal. This new lifestyle has rejuvenated me and made me go back to an old passion of mine: gardening. The days have become more beautiful, thanks to spring’s arrival, and I thought what better time than now to add more colors to my flower garden. I like gardening a lot because I still get some moderate exercise and it’s a great reason to be outdoors and enjoy nature. After about an hour or two of being in the sun, I’ll go in the house and grab an ice cold beer, like Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold to cool down and relax. What I love about Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold is that it gives you the permission to make healthier choices, while still ending off the day with an ice cold beer that you can feel great about drinking.

"['The excitement of a road trip can sometimes be slightly dimmed by the difficulty over what to pack. While on one hand you may be willing to travel light, on the other, you don’t want to be relentlessly berating yourself for the items you left behind. So whether you are planning to drive across a state or across the continent, here is a road trip packing list of 50 essential items that you need to take with you: Road Trip Packing List: 50 Essentials 1. Music/Playlist: Your mood is likely to change quicker than you think, especially when you get into unlucky situations. So before you even put key in the ignition , ensure that you have at least 30 playlists for the trip. I mean serious, what’s a road trip without music. If you need a fresh set of tunes, try Tune In Radio app at Apple iTunes or Google Play . You can choose from list of 50,000 radio stations from around the globe. This is also an opportunity to learn the names of new artists. Don’t forget your headphones! 2. First Aid Kit: Whether you accidentally cut yourself while gathering wood for a camp fire or you have just eaten a wrong snack on the road, first aid kit will come in handy than you think. 3. Camera: You will need to take some photos to remember the trip and memorize that delighted look on your face when you reached your favorite destination ( Great gift idea! See Amazon’s Most Wished For List ). 4. Snacks/Food: Your wallets will get empty sooner than you think when you are constantly eating out. Though eating at different restaurants is often one of the most exciting parts of a road trip, you can always do your wallet and health a favor by carrying your own snacks/food. 5. Mosquito Spray: Gotta keep the bugs away! 6. Sunglasses: To protect your eyes from those harmful UV rays. Definitely a must! 7. Hand Sanitizers: You can’t predict the amount of dirt your hands will be exposed to. 8. Auto Essentials: A spare tire and some motor oil, among other motor essentials can help you a great deal when you wind up with a minor accident or when you misjudge the distance from destination A to B. 9. Sleeping Gear: There are unprecedented numbers of places that you can sleep under the stars if you wish not to waste your hard earned cash staying in a hotel every night? If you do need to stay in a hotel, I would suggest booking a room in advance, through Vacay Bookings . At least you can save some money with their price comparison search engine. 10. National Identification card or Driver’s License: These will confirm that you are indeed a homosapien who pay bills and taxes. 11. Travel Alarm Clock: Hotel wake up calls can sometimes be bothersome. You need a familiar sound that will wake you up without a problem. 12. Good Friends: Your company is ultimately what will make your road trip worth it. 13. Portable Power Device: To keep your phone and tablet charged at your convenience take a portable charger . Never rely on rest stops and hotels to recharge your electronic essentials. 14. Journal: A record of those weird local jokes, breakthroughs, surroundings, and thoughts will help you process them later. 15. Keys: You cannot afford to get very far without them. 16. GPS: Your phone’s GPS will be great until you find yourself in No man’s land with no internet or network coverage, and worse a drained battery. So, I don’t recommend using your phone’s GPS. Instead, A GPS like Garmin or TomTom will come in handy when you hit heavy traffic and need to find alternate routes. 17. Sofa Cushions: No matter the number of songs that you listen to or the number of stories you tell, eventually boredom will set in. This is the time that your friends in the backseat will need to build a fort out of the cushions. 18. Map: Navigating your destinations with a real map is not only a fun challenge but makes you feel like a real explorer as well. 19. Phone: Besides updating your friends about the destination that you will be spending a given night, you can jam to your favorite music playlist while updating your Instagram feed from the road. 20. Sunscreen: A road trip without sun protection is a recipe for disaster. Be sure to lather up on sunscreen periodically throughout the trip. 21. Water: You have to stay hydrated throughout the trip. Don’t even think about soda or juice ; they will make thirst worse. 22. Extra set of Keys: You never know when you will lose the set you are used to. 23. Binoculars: There will be several moments when you will want to whip out your binoculars to get a clearer look at stuff off in the distance. 24. Appetite: You will be snacking on those chemically loaded snacks you never thought you would, under normal situations, put in your precious body. 25. Hygiene Bag: You will hardly come by showers while on the road. A hygiene bag with deodorant and towelettes will help cover those unfriendly stenches of sweat. Also bring eco-friendly shampoo and shower soap if you’re lucky enough to stumble upon a lake or outdoor shower. 26. Safety Pins: To mend some of your wardrobe malfunctions, clasp the zippers of your day packs together, tack your kid’s pant legs, especially when they are hiking through a mucky terrain among other uses. 27. Pocket Knife: You cannot simply count the number of times that you will use or need to use a pocket knife . 28. Lucky Charm: To keep you free from those bad road juju. For ladies, this will allow you to easily find keys amidst piles of lip glosses, hum packs and old movie stubs. It’s a great item to add to your road trip packing list. 29. Games and activity sets: A deck of cards or backgammon will break up the monotony of the trip. 30. Roadside Emergency Kit: This kit will come in handy in case something goes wrong. 31. Rain Gear: People get rained on even in the desert! A rain gear or waterproof jacket will be useful when you visit misty destinations as well. 32. Tote Bag: To toss around picnic and beach items. You can also use them to cordon off dirty laundry items in your suitcase to preserve the freshness of the unused items. 33. Comfortable items: Wearing comfortable clothes during your time in the car is a given but you should also bring a blanket or a sweater in case you travel through a mountainous area at night or you disagree about an appropriate level of air conditioning with your travel mates. 34. Reading materials: A book or magazine will help you pass time, especially if you like reading. 35. Folding Shovel: A definite must-have in my road trip essentials list. You may need a folding shovel to dig out your truck’s tires from unexpected snow or to fill spots where you are stuck in the mud. 36. Good Walking Shoes: Though this sound like a normal road trip gear, you will seriously need them, especially if you find yourself wandering in grounds where flip-flops or flimsy shoes just won’t do. 37. Travel Mug: To stash transport sunglasses and other delicate souvenirs in your hotel room. Remember, a coffee-stained mug is an unlikely target for thieves. 38. Garbage bags: When you plan a long drive, it is always a great idea to have a few garbage bags to empty trash after each day’s drive. 39. Toilet paper: This will be very handy whenever you think about having that Big Gulp from 7-Eleven. 40. Voting system: To guide you and your team on how you decide on when to stop or where to eat. 41. Silicone Travel Bottles: Generally, TSA-approved mini travel bottles are often considered old news to any avid road traveler. 42. Duct Tape: From bandaging your exploded items to removing lint from your clothing, duct tape will always earn its all-purpose reputation. 43. A cooler: To stuff restaurant leftovers, roadside snacks, soda and anything you want to keep cold. This is a lot cheaper than constantly buying beverages and related food stuffs at roadside stops or gas stations. 44. Underwear: Bring more of them (even 10 more pairs) than you would practically need. 45. Positive Attitude: Nasty things that will push your buttons will obviously happen on the road. You need just to have a positive attitude and remember that pretty soon you will be back home on your comfortable couch. 46. Bandana: The list of obvious uses for this versatile carry-on is long—you can use it as a lens cleaner, hair tie, hand towel, scarf, head band or a cooling devise (when you dampen it). 47. Ziploc Bags: To prevent sandy beachwear from soiling your items and to protect some of your delicate clothing from snags. 48. Multi socket Power strip: This will help you charge most of your electronics at a go. Besides, plugging all your electronic in the same place, a multi socket power strip lessens your chances of leaving any behind. 49. Disinfectant Spray: It’s convenient when you plan to stop by public places like a restaurant or hotel. 50. Plan B: No matter how prepared you are, sometimes a road trip may not work out. Reveal your alternate vacation plan early to avoid crying out loud if things don’t go as planned. Your road trip packing list plays a major role in the outcome of your road trip, especially if you are not used to long trips. Remember to always be well-prepared and hopefully this road trip essentials list will help make packing easier for you.

"['Ever wondered what the nutrition secrets of athletes or celebrities are? Well now you don’t have to because below are 15 healthy habits to incorporate into your own get-in-shape regimen that will not only help you get skinny fast, but in the most healthiest way possible. For starters, change your attitude about food. Lastly, your goal to get skinny should come second because it’s more important to improve and maintain your overall health. Keep in mind the following habits that has helped me stay on track of my own weight loss goals: How to Get Skinny Fast: 15 Habits 1. Say “No” to a Rigid Diet When most people start a diet, they usually eliminate foods or place certain foods as off limits. You need not start a rigid diet to the point of depriving yourself of foods you love. Focus on what you CAN eat. I always say the secret on how to get skinny fast is accepting diets don’t work. You may want to consult a nutrition expert and update your knowledge on foods laden with essential nutrients to help correct years of poor diet. If you keep labeling certain foods as off limits, you end up craving for them even more. `Not eliminating certain foods’ does not mean continuing to gorge on bad stuff, though. Regular consumption of meat-containing fast food, for instance, can lead to accumulation of LDL or bad cholesterol in the body. If you’re a coffee drinker or have a sweet tooth, you need not abruptly stop the caffeine or sugar intake. You can make sugar an occasional treat, but not a diet staple. Eat (or drink) in moderation, and keep in mind other health tips, so read on. Additional Resources Why Diets Don’t Work Why Dieting Can Cause Weight Gain in The Long Term 2. Find healthy alternatives for favorite foods Healthy food substitutes can be easily obtained. All-natural food stores in your neighborhood may offer a wide assortment of healthy options that can replace old favorites and inflammation-causing and cholesterol-laden ingredients in your meals. If you cannot resist eating a slice of cake each day, opt for a light, flavorful or even a sugar-free option. Just a few cautions, though. You may be ditching high-fat foods and opting for low-fat products, but some food manufacturers have added sugar to make their offerings more palatable, causing some effects when consumed too much, like making the body go haywire. Avoid the pesky insulin spike that can be triggered by consumption of simple carbohydrates. Instead of eating white rice everyday, go for brown rice, a complex carbohydrate that has more nutrients and will keep you fuller longer. Healthy fats are also important. Instead of regular mayonnaise, choose a healthier condiment like mustard. To help control blood sugar and support your weight loss plan, switch to safflower oil or other healthy cooking oils. Instead of regular ground beef, you may opt for extra lean. Choose natural peanut butter over reduced-fat peanut butter that may contain more sugar and additives. If you usually buy whole milk, switch to part-skim milk. Instead of buying instant oatmal, get the steel-cut type. Instead of flavored yogurt, go for plain yogurt and add a fresh fruit or two with a little honey. Your body will benefit from the friendly bacteria. The list goes on, when considering health food substitutions. Turn to authoritative health sites for a comprehensive guide to healthy substitution. Even if you’re eating out, you can find healthier versions of your favorite foods. Additional Resources Top 10 Food Substitutions for Healthier Cooking 83 Healthy Recipe Substitutions 3. Develop a routine and stick with it It is easy for most people to begin a healthy eating plan, but follow-through is important. You need to convince yourself that you can lead an authentically healthy life, and it starts with a firm resolve to get healthy & stay healthy. If you just tell yourself that you really need to lose weight and begin eating carrots, greens, tofu and brown rice, you need to stick to that healthy eating plan. Online articles and videos may offer motivation and inspiration, but listening to your body signals, realizing the benefits of healthy eating and feeling a whole lot better, depend on you. You can start developing a power eating plan by knowing which foods can offer you antioxidant protection, which ones can give brain power boost, and which ones can energize. A high-performance nutrition plan may incorporate your old favorites, like mixing ice-cream for instance with a quality protein shake. The amount of not-so-healthy stuff can gradually be reduced. Once your body gets accustomed to healthier foods, you develop a taste for them and chances are, you will no longer yearn for the unhealthy stuff. Another routine you may want to start, after consulting with your doctor, is a weight loss management program that’ll help you attain a trimmer, healthier physique. Additional Resource Selvera: The Last Weight Loss Program You’ll Ever Need 4. Reduce stress Keeping stress at a minimum can benefit your body in many ways. Stress, doctors say, inhibits the immune system. By beating stress, you keep illnesses at bay.

Work through emotional issues caused by emotional obesity You may project a strong persona, but there may be times when you don’t feel fine, or you cannot seem to get it all together. You may go home with feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, resentment, anger, or with negative feedback loops. Instead of expending time on wishful thinking or other non-productive stuff, you can look at your own emotions and find a way to fix what’s bothering you. Problems linked to you interpersonal relationships that contribute to stress may prompt you to reach for comfort foods or overeat. This can lead to weight gain. By learning how to manage your emotional problems, you are in effect taking food issues and unhealthy weight gain out of the equation. Additional Resource Tips to Stop Emotional Eating 6. Eat clean foods Clean eating has far-reaching benefits. If you’ve long been eating convenience foods or foodstuff like burgers, all that food can turn out to be your enemy. You may begin to feel sick. Power eating is all about putting good food in our body. Think organic produce. Think pork from real pastured pigs with more omega-3s, and beef from grass-fed cows. You can have fun even if you opt for all-natural or organic eats. Just mix them up a bit. Instead of regular eggs, try free-range eggs with more micronutrients, cooked & serve with other healthy eats. Purchasing clean/wholesome foods may be costly, but they actually offer more bang for the buck. Additional Resources Eating Clean Groceries List- Approved Foods List 10 Clean Eating Recipes 7. Have an accountability system When you’ve embarked on a weight loss regimen, remember that you are accountable for your own actions. A fitness trainer, a nutritionist, or a naturopathic doctor may help you. You can choose to be a fit & trim product of your healthy decisions, rather than thinking that you are destined to be fat. Once you establish an orderly and healthy eating plan, you can devise other ways to succeed in it. You may use a buddy system when working out, to help you not only to lose the excess pounds but keep them off. Once in a while, you may get lax and feel like indulging a bit. A weight loss partner may remind you of your goals, but the decision to reach a healthy weight ultimately depends on you. 8. Control your portions For most people, portion control may seem easier said than done. Veer away from super-sized meals and upsize offers. At buffets, it can be pretty challenging to resist filling your plate with different kinds of food, but think about how sick you’ll feel if you gorge. Let several minutes pass after eating, before going back (if ever). When buying food at the grocery store, read labels. Remember that portion control is one effective way to blast fat, so try not to ignore this tactic that can lead to a trimmer figure. 9. Tracking food You can track your nutritional intake, which is not just a matter of counting calories, using several ways. You can jot down what you regularly ingest in a food diary. You can also use online tools to log and track your food consumption. By tracking what you eat, you can more easily get the right balance of nutrients. Additional Resources Download a “blank” food diary from Eating Well How to Keep a Food Diary 10. Exercise! Much has been said about the myriad health benefits of exercising. Yet many people, including those who want to get skinny fast, need constant reminders about how incorporating regular exercise in their schedules will not only raise their metabolism and burn calories fast, but also improve their overall wellness. When you attain a certain level of fitness due to regular, vigorous activity, your mind also improves, and you feel more responsive & enthusiastic about life. My favorite gadget to have on hand is the Fitbit (great gift idea!) because it can tell me how active I’ve been throughout the day. It tracks your steps, distance, and calories burned. Get the Fitbit on Amazon here . Additional Resources The Ultimate Guide to Get Fit and In Shape 11. Eat every few hours Eating small meals frequently, which may be around five to six meals each day, can help you control food cravings. It’s a time-tested technique used by individuals concerned about their expanding waistlines. You can ensure that each small meal you take has quality protein like a hard-boiled egg. Complex carbohydrate like brown rice, a piece of fresh fruit or vegetable, as well as nuts, are nutritious and filling options. Eating small meals several times a day will help keep your blood sugar under control. 12. Detoxify your body Your body can better absorb the nutrients it needs if you’ve lightened up the toxic load. Expelling toxins from the body can be done by drinking lots of purified water and loading up on superfoods. Veggies like artichoke, cabbage, kale, carrots and garlic help purge the liver of toxins. Blueberries, beets, avocados, beans, seeds (like chia seeds) and nuts that contain important nutrients also help eliminate toxins from the body. There are also detoxifying beverages, like green tea, that aid in weight loss. Cut back on refined sugars, saturated fats, alcohol and caffeine. Additional Resources 11 DIY Juice Cleanse Recipes to Make at Home 13 Snacks That Detox Your Body 13. Hydrate your body Staying hydrates keeps the body in good working condition. Drinking enough fluids, including purified water, protein shakes, green tea and freshly squeezed juices also help cleanse the body of toxins. Drinking lots of water can also suppress appetite and aid in weight management. Additional Resources 6 Reasons You Should Drink More Water 3 Fruit Infused Water Recipes to Delight Your Taste Buds 14. Cook at home If you cook at home, you have the upper hand in ensuring that you and your family members will get sufficient nutrients. Cooking at home also removes worry about hidden ingredients like gluten, which may trigger an immune response. 15. Never stop trying If you’ve tried everything and nothing seems to be working to blast fat, seek professional help. Even if you’ve ruled out health issues, don’t stop trying to reach a healthy weight. There are products, foods, techniques, and experts who can guide you towards getting a trimmer, healthier body. Seek help or devise an all-natural plan tailor fitted for you, but don’t throw discipline & determination out the door.

"['You might recall a post I wrote two weeks ago about Dove’s new Clear Tone deodorant . You also might remember me pledging to take a 2 week challenge where I ditched my old deodorant for Dove Clear Tone to reduce the dark marks under my arms. Well, two weeks have passed and I’m ready to share my results. Here’s what Dove had to say about the deodorant: Dove® ClearTone™ Deodorant was designed to visibly reduce the appearance of dark marks under the arms and evens out skin tone caused with shaving in just 2 weeks! It’s made with Calendula and Sunflower Seed extracts, which moisturizes to help accelerate natural skin processes, helping the skin to repair itself. So you’re probably asking yourself if it solved the main problems I always encounter when shaving or buying new deodorant. Well, let’s find out! Like I mentioned in my original post, my main challenges with new deodorants include: white marks left on my clothes white flakes left underneath my arms weak odor & wetness protection First off, let me just say I was very impressed with the results. It’s not too often that you find a deodorant that can do everything. I just don’t understand why it’s so hard to find a good deodorant! Anyway, within the two week time frame, I did see some significant improvements. The dark patches caused by shaving started to go away. I’m still shocked by the results I’ve seen thus far! I’m happy, but also relieved because I no longer have to feel insecure or uncomfortable when I wear sleveless tops now. Do you understand how great of a feeling that is? The deodorant also provided all day odor & wetness protection. I tested the deodorant while getting my Zumba on and it stood up to my sweat. It also left my underarms so smooth (not one bump) and flake-free, and no white marks left on my clothes. Dove Clear Tone is hands down a winner and my new favorite deodorant! Did you know? When underarm skin is irritated by shaving, it can respond by creating dark marks. The solution – NEW Dove® Clear Tone™ Pink Rosa Deodorant. With calendula and sunflower seed extracts, Dove® Clear Tone works with your body’s natural chemistry to visibly reduce dark marks in just 2 weeks* while providing 48-hour odor and wetness protection *vs. basic deodorant roll-on without moisturizer, based on those who expressed preference in a survey Disclosure: Compensation was provided by Dove via Glam Media.

"['Skin care often takes a backseat to other winter health woes such as the flu or the common cold; however, neglecting your skin can be a mistake — particularly if you love outdoor winter activities. Keep your skin soft and smooth all winter long with Nivea Extended Moisture Daily Lotion. Nivea Extended Moisture Daily Lotion is a luxurious, non-greasy lotion, that provides up to 48 hours of relief for dry, tight skin. Infused with Pro-Vitamin B5, and NIVEA’s Hydra-IQ technology, Extended Moisture lotion gives ultra long-lasting, skin nourishing moisture. Formula I’ve been using the Nivea Extended Moisture Daily Lotion for over a month now and it’s great on my dry skin. It’s strong enough to relieve skin tightness around my legs, elbows, and hands yet light enough to use on my face. My face tends to get super dry in the colder months so it has been a great daily moisturizer that doesn’t leave a greasy residue. This lotion also claims to provide up to 48 hours of relief for dry, tight skin and I say it fulfills its mission of making dry skin look and feel better. Initially I noticed at least 24 hours of relief but after a week of using it, I definitely saw a change in my skin. The lotion truly hydrated my skin and stayed soft for up to the 48 hour claim. It works especially well after bathing when your skin is still moist helping to seal in that moisture. Price As for the price, I consider $7.99 a steal compared to other high-priced lotions with similar benefits. Overall, this lotion did meet my expectations and I would highly recommend this product to dry skin or eczema sufferers. Have you tried Nivea’s Extended Moisture Daily Lotion?

This lightweight oil is so hydrating on my skin. For someone with oily skin, I was afraid that it would leave me with an oily shine or cause me to breakout, but that was definitely not the case. Instead, the dry oil left me with soft supple skin and a healthy natural glow. I use this twice a day, after applying the cream, and I apply it on my face, neck, and décolleté. After trying the products out for two weeks, I’ve enjoyed seeing the benefits play out on my skin. Miles high in the Swiss Alps, in a world of sheer ice crystals, beauty transcends time.

"['While SPF and ultra-moisturizing skin care may be more commonly attributed to the warmer summer months where you spend more active time under the sun’s scorching rays, but believe it or not, your skin still needs plenty of TLC during the winter, too. In fact, with the winter’s cold drying air and the not-as-obvious sun exposure, your skin may be extra neglected during the colder months, meaning it needs more help than ever to stay nourished and healthy! As a result, I’ve rounded up some of the best winter-friendly (and all-year-round awesome) products to keep your skin in tip-top shape, rain, snow, or shine! For one, it’s important to wear a daily SPF, like Clinique City Block Sheer, which doubles as a primer so you can wear it under makeup without it feeling oily or caked-on. Just because it’s winter doesn’t mean your skin isn’t exposed to regular sunlight — and if you’re a snowboarder especially, you know the feeling of a surprise sunburn by the end of the day! Similarly, keep lips protected and moisturized with a heavy-duty lip balm like Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm — this brand may usually cater to men, but it definitely does the trick! In cold weather when you’re skin is bound to be extra dry, it’s important to find a gentle cleanser that doesn’t skimp when it actually comes to getting clean — Avon Winter Solutions Cleanser gets the job done without drying out your skin further. For extra winter-time pampering, use a hydrating mask like Sisley Flower Gel Mask which tones and firms weather-stressed skin and leaves your face feeling fresh, clean, and moisturized. And finally, if you’re dealing with the after-effects of a little winter neglect, First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream helps soothe winter irritation and protects against further damage! – Alex Gambardella Need help for your holiday shopping?

"['For years I’ve been wearing the wrong bra size. I knew it too but I was either to poor or lazy at the time to do anything about it. Whenever I went bra shopping, the bra was either too large a band size or too small a cup size. My bras would also leave gaping at the top and I’m always adjusting the straps. So annoying. Just when I started to believe I’d never find a good bra, I discovered Soma Enhancing Shape Bra, also known as “the ultimate age defying t-shirt bra.” It claims to eliminate gaps at the neckline with its top shaping pad technology. This bra sounded like the answer to my prayers so I headed over to the Soma boutique in Manhattan Beach to get a bra fitting and the experience was wonderful. The associate measured me and she gave me a few bras to try. I learned my true bra size that day- 38B. So, I tried the bra on and I was completely shocked. I thought, “Wow, it feels fantastic! This bra is perfect.” I can’t recall the last time I felt this good about a bra. It flatters my shape and feels so comfortable even after I return home from work. I sometimes forget that it’s even on. The bra also lifts and supports my girls and when I’m laying on back, no gaps! I just love how it looks under my clothes whether I’m wearing a t-shirt, sweater or dress. Soma’s Enhancing Shape Bra is now part of my regular bra rotation. See all the benefits of the Enhancing Shape Bra: It’s age defying! Instantly restores natural shape It enhances the shape of your bust instantly for a great fit under clothes The top shaping pad technology eliminates gaps for a perfect fit It’s completely smooth under clothes It’s designed with padded straps for comfort It comes in 8 solid colors and 4 beautiful patterns (Mochaccino is my fav!) It comes in 27 sizes in cups A-DDD This bra is also featured in this month’s issue of InStyle as THE solution for filling the gap at the top of the cup. Here’s an excerpt – “If age or breast-feeding has left you less, shall we say, well-rounded, this bra will more than mind the gap(s). Instead of providing a simple push-up, it’s padded at the top to fill in what’s turned more concave.” Giveaway Since this bra has done wonders for me, I want to give someone else the opportunity to enjoy it. One lucky reader will have the chance to win a $60 gift card to purchase one. You can visit your nearest Soma boutique or order online . How to enter: Fill out the Rafflecopter entry form below.
