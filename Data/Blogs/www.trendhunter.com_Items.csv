She begins by talking about how she\'s always able to remember former students of hers, as well as where they sat in her class, and who they were seated beside. She says she is able to remember this because she sees everyone keep to the same habits, and remain close to those they feel most comfortable with. The problem with this kind of social narrowing is that many students graduate only knowing a small group of people with similar views to them, which prevents them from gaining a network that\'s more diverse. Although this has always been common practice for most people, Menon shows just how limiting it can be to one\'s development. Keeping this in mind, Menon explains how her audience can break free of this habit using simple strategies. One method that she brings up is to ""use a more imperfect social search engine,"" meaning that people should change their routines to meet new people. In addition, she explains that it\'s important to be aware of the filters one uses to judge someone, which prevent them from widening their social world.

Whether it is promoting biodiversity or generating renewable energy, these buildings represent the future of sustainable design. One of the most interesting innovations in modern architecture is the effort to make homes and office buildings more energy efficient. For example, there are houses that feature solar panels capable of generating enough energy for entire neighborhoods. There are also breathing office towers that are equipped with natural ventilation systems that do not run on traditional energy sources. Beyond efforts to reduce energy consumption, eco-friendly architecture is also characterized by a respect for the natural environment. Rather than destroying natural resources, many architects have found ways of incorporating natural elements into new structures. Some of these sustainable designs include expansive rooftop gardens, living wall units and even plant-based insulation.']",80cb075c07fa38762c8776008922a302a5e05f18,5730-4b9a-be6d,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.trendhunter.com/slideshow/ecofriendly-architecture

While not yet changing enough to halt the constant progression of climate change, industries are becoming increasingly aware of their impact on the environment and the need to adopt ideas and innovations that will reduce this impact. Some of the more prominent themes associated with this trend exist in the form of sustainable architecture and the slow but progressing transformations of industries that have a particularly strong negative impact on the environment. \'Passive House\' is a voluntary standard for energy efficiency in buildings, and an increasing number of architects are using this measure when creating homes to be more friendly to the environment. The company BC Passive House takes this one step further – it not only provides prefabricated panels for houses built using this standard, it also employs the standards in its own factory. As consumers become more focused on lessening their personal environmental impact, the term ""fast fashion"" is slowly becoming a bad word among those who understand its consequences on the environment. Fast fashion companies are taking note of this fact and are slowly beginning to incorporate more eco-friendly practices into their business models. An example of this exists in Urban Outfitters\' limited edition \'Rework\' collection – which features clothes made from scrap fabrics. While the fast fashion industry will never be truly environmentally friendly due to its very definition, its attempts at becoming so indicate a significant shift in consumers\' priorities and values. There are many ways in which eco-friendly practices can be incorporated into brands\' and companies\' business models, whether it is in their production processes or in the causes they financially support.

Suave Professionals wanted to change that perception, and came up with a fake concept brand to do this. It named the brand 'Evaus' (Suave spelled backwards), and packaged its regular Strengthening Honey Infusion shampoo in sleek, minimalist bottles. The brand then asked women to try the Evaus brand without them knowing that it was really Suave, and filmed them complimenting it and its quality.

Some of the ways that this can be seen occurring is through simplified wedding traditions and social media-friendly trends. As many people cannot afford the high costs of weddings, or just prefer to remain low-key and minimal, simple wedding concepts are becoming increasingly common. One such example is 'Cadi Jewelry Studio' – which creates simple gold and silver wedding bands. The bands feature indents on them and when rings are connected between partners, the indents come together to reveal shapes. The concept is simple, but creative and personal enough that it retains the distinctive feel that is unique to weddings and marriage. Weddings are the most picturesque events that most people will throw in their lives, and brands are unsurprisingly capitalizing on this by making them even more so. A new social media craze that can be seen on Instagram exists in the form of 'donut walls' – walls that are covered in donuts of different colors to add a delicious and photo-friendly addition to weddings. On top of being excellent for photos, donut walls function as a quirky alternative to the cakes and cupcakes that are now so common at these events.

['2017-06-13 00:00:00'],"[""Greek photographer Andreas Kamoutsis became fascinated with the mirrored world that emerges after rain has passed and has thus been working on a series of reflective rainy day photography. Titled 'Hidden Reflections' each photo is taken through water in the streets of Copenhagen or Vienna. The result is a magical distorted view of the world where natural light reflects through the water. The photographs are so poetic and warped that they almost resemble paintings. The images he produces allow for a magical view of the world in an almost dream-like state. Some shots in this series of rainy day photography are taken both during and after rain, but all of the images have the same introspective feel.""]",203e0c5c48d9cde072f33718966673dc3297fdc6,5730-4b9a-be6d,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/rainy-day-photography
