It means that pool season is here, time for the beach, outdoor sports and a host of other fun activities. What it also means is that the days are longer and the UV rays are stronger. You know that here at Dr. Bailey Skin Care, we advocate protecting your skin all year long because the sun damage happens in winter. That said, we focus intensely on the topic as the weather warms because we know our readers will be outside more, wearing less clothing to protect their skin and UVB is stronger in spring, summer and fall. Skin cancer is real, it’s the most common cancer on the planet and it can happen to anyone. In an effort to raise awareness of this, and specifically, melanoma, the American Academy of Dermatology designated the first Monday of May as Melanoma Monday . According to the Skin Cancer Foundation , melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. “…these cancerous growths develop when unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells (most often caused by ultraviolet radiation from sunshine or tanning beds) triggers mutations (genetic defects) that lead the skin cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumors.” Here are some sobering (motivating) facts on this deadly form of skin cancer from the Skin Cancer Foundation: Melanoma is caused mainly by intense, occasional UV exposure (frequently leading to sunburn), especially in those who are genetically predisposed to the disease. It kills an estimated 9,940 people in the US annually. One person dies of melanoma every hour (every 57 minutes). While it is not the most common of the skin cancers, it causes the most deaths. Melanoma accounts for less than two percent of skin cancer cases, but the vast majority of skin cancer deaths. The American Cancer Society estimates that, at present, more than 135,000 new cases of melanoma in the US are diagnosed in a year. In 2015, an estimated 73,870 of these will be invasive melanomas: about 42,670 in males about 31,200 in women 1 in 50 men and women will be diagnosed with melanoma of the skin during their lifetime. Melanoma is one of only three cancers with an increasing mortality rate for men, along with liver cancer and esophageal cancer. Women aged 39 and under have a higher probability of developing melanoma than any other cancer except breast cancer. Anyone who has more than 100 moles is at greater risk for melanoma. About one in every 10 patients diagnosed with the disease has a family member with a history of melanoma. Each person with a first-degree relative diagnosed with melanoma has a 50 percent greater chance of developing the disease than people who do not have a family history of the disease. Compromised immune systems as the result of chemotherapy, an organ transplant, excessive sun exposure, and diseases such as HIV/AIDS or lymphoma can increase your risk of melanoma. More than 419,000 cases of skin cancer in the US each year are linked to indoor tanning, including about 245,000 basal cell carcinomas, 168,000 squamous cell carcinomas, and 6,200 melanomas. For more facts on melanoma, you can visit www.skincancer.org One of the most important methods of prevention is, of course, using sunscreen. Dr. Bailey covers this topic extensively in her many of her blog posts, including 5 Steps for Smart Skin Protection , How to Pick the Best Sunscreen , and How to Know Which Broad Spectrum Sunscreen is Right for You . Another way to stop melanoma in its tracks is to do a mole check regularly. You’ll be looking for the A-E of Skin Cancer: Thankfully, The American Academy of Dermatology created a video, helping to explain what the process looks like. Melanoma is on the rise. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, of the seven most common cancers in the US, melanoma is the only one whose incidence is increasing. Between 2000 and 2009, incidence climbed 1.9 percent annually. This is why Melanoma Monday is an important part of preventing cancer by raising awareness of this deadly disease.

In my dermatology medical practice, I treat skin problems like acne, rosacea, psoriasis, dandruff, people with multiple skin cancers, eczema and many other skin problems. An important common denominator to these skin problems is inflammation and the resulting immune dysregulation because of it. Your diet can fight or fuel inflammation – which means that your diet can support or fight your skin problems . How is your diet helping or hurting your skin? It’s no surprise that skin, your body’s biggest organ, behaves like the rest of your body when it comes to health and disease. The dietary connection to diseases like diabetes, heart disease, arthritis and other common diseases is well established. Now, the connection between those diseases and skin problems like psoriasis is well established too. For years I’ve been writing about the connection between your diet and your skin’s health . I’m one of the first dermatologists to go out on a public limb and claim a connection between skin problems and diet. I couldn’t feel good about writing prescriptions for medicines that have side effects if I wasn’t also teaching my patients about how they could make diet and lifestyle choices that would help heal their skin – so they could get off of those same prescriptions. What is your skin problem? What topics do you want to learn more about? My Alkaline Food Diet Guide has all of my diet recommendations. It also has my Alkaline Food Pyramid which you can use as an easy guide. Yes, the Alkaline Diet is still controversial in some medical circles – and I’m waiting and waiting for that to settle down. By my research and analysis the evidence is clear: a diet full of processed foods, refined carbs, and animal products leads to acidic body pH, especially with age because the kidneys can’t remove it all as we get older. The kidneys ‘borrow’ what they need from your muscles to regulate body pH, making you lose muscle mass. The entirety of what is going on also leads to inflammation – with resulting health and skin problems. The bottom line – it gets bad and it all starts with diet.

['2016-02-29 09:05:26'],"['Cystic acne is a particularly troublesome form of acne that leads to deep, painful pimples. The pimples themselves often have trouble coming to the surface and fester deep under the surface of your skin, frequently traveling to and connecting with adjacent pores. It’s rare to meet anyone who hasn’t experienced one of these epic types of pimples. Unfortunately, there are many people that suffer with constant breakouts of cysts. We call it cystic acne, and sadly, it can go on and on for years. The biggest problem with this type of acne is that it can lead to devastating scarring. As a dermatologist, I am dedicated to preventing this from happening. Aggressive acne often requires aggressive measures, and it is my commitment to my patients to effectively address it and prevent it in the future. In this blog post, I will briefly touch on some of the cystic acne treatment options we have at Advanced Skin Care and Dermatology Physicians . I am not afraid to use any of these tools when appropriate and needed – for me, cystic acne is a war with a sense of urgency in order to prevent devastating scarring. Topical Treatments Retinol Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream Foaming Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Treatment Cleanser In mild cases where people only get the occasional outbreak of deep pimples, topical acne products may be sufficient to control acne breakouts. We often attack acne at multiple angles. In my practice, everyone who has acne is on some sort of retinoid . This topical, prescription medication works to keep your pores unclogged. Retinoids can be prescription strength, or they can come in a milder form called retinol . The second best medicine to add to your skin care for cystic acne is benzoyl peroxide because it works to kill bacteria and also helps unclog pores. Understand that a clogged pore is the first step in a cascade of events that leads to a pimple. Bacteria then flourish in clogged pores. A great benzoyl peroxide cleanser for people with acne is our Foaming Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Treatment Cleanser . It’s an easy product that cleans skin and medicates to fight acne all in one. However, we recommend using the benzoyl peroxide in the morning and waiting until your evening routine to use a non-benzoyl peroxide cleanser at night with the Retinol Cream. This is because benzoyl peroxide and retinol work best when they are not directly combined. Ultimate Acne Solutions Skin Care Kit Benzoyl peroxide can also be applied as a lotion and paired with other medicated ingredients in cleansers. This is the basis of our Acne Treatment Kits . Here, salicylic acid and glycolic acid are used in cleansers and treatment pads and followed with benzoyl peroxide applied as a lotion. We recommend using the Foaming Acne Cleanser, followed by the Treatment Pads and Benzoyl Peroxide during the day. At night, we advise using the cleanser then the treatment pads and the Retinol Cream. This combination is as strong and intense as acne treatment gets without a prescription. Oral Antibiotics Antibiotics work to kill bacteria involved in acne (called Propionibacterium acnes). Antibiotics can also work to decrease the inflammation in the skin that make acne worse. The problem, however, with antibiotics is that they may stop working after a while. Some people may not even see any improvement on antibiotics. It’s important to realize that not every antibiotic will work for acne, and that antibiotics alter the good probiotic germs in your body. The best way to approach antibiotics is to see a dermatologist to help you choose the best medicine you can get on and off of as fast as possible with precision results. Spironolactone This medication works particularly well for women with “hormonal acne.” Hormonal acne has a classic appearance in that it’s more pronounced around the jawline and chin and tends to flare with menstrual cycles. This type of acne is more common in women who have something called polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a condition in which women have enlarged ovaries, abnormal menstrual cycles, excess hair growth and a body metabolism prone to obesity. Hormonal acne can happen in any female, however, and just because they have this type of acne does not mean they have PCOS. The medication spironolactone is also used in conditions like heart failure and liver failure to help get rid of excess fluid. It also has anti-testosterone effects so can be helpful in treating hormonal acne. Testosterone drives the production of sebum and makes acne worse. But, when used in the right way, this medication can be a safe and effective treatment of acne. Isotretinoin (Accutane) This medicine is the pill form of a retinoid. It is the most effective treatment of cystic acne that we, as dermatologists have. It’s the only medication that can “cure” acne. It attacks acne at all levels, most importantly by shrinking the oil glands. It is such a powerful medication that it can cause birth defects if a pregnant woman is exposed to it. This is why isotretinoin is so tightly regulated. However, it’s an extremely effective treatment of acne. One course of treatment is often enough, but sometimes people have to go through treatment more than once to get rid of their acne for good. Whatever your acne troubles may be, we have the tools to treat it! Don’t let your acne get to the point of developing scars – come in as soon as possible since we have so many options to help you.

Sunscreen stored in excessively hot or cold temperatures (like your car or beach bag) can break down. What about sunscreens that don’t have expiration dates, are they good for years? No! The FDA requires that a sunscreen product remain stable for 3 years after manufacturing but that’s not helpful because heck, when was that tube of sunscreen made that you’re holding? And again, how was it stored? If you don’t know with certainty where your sunscreen has been and how old it is, don’t trust it. Sunburns are bad, period! According to Neil Box PhD , Investigator at the University of Colorado Cancer Center and Assistant Professor in the Department of Dermatology at the School of Medicine, “We’re still waiting for a definitive one-sunburn study to show us exactly how much melanoma risk increases with one blistering burn, but to the best of our knowledge, it seems like the answer is about 50 percent. One bad burn as a child makes you half-again more likely to develop melanoma as an adult,” It’s easy to make a mistake. At my house, even though we have an in-house dermatologist, we’ve still fallen for the ‘it looks perfectly fine so we’ll use it’ old sunscreen ruse. For years, my earnest and hardworking husband would climb on the tractor to mow the high grass in early spring slathered with sunscreen he pulled out of our kitchen ‘junk drawer’. Armed with a hat, a face mask for pollen and his skin coated in old sunscreen, he would spend a beautiful spring Saturday driving back and forth on our country property….. and he’d get burnt. He be stunned. That old tube of sunscreen looked ok on the outside and never exceeded its expiration date, but it had been around, which was how it made it to the junk drawer.

['2010-09-07 01:21:35'],"['Anyone with rosacea knows how frustrating it is and how few good treatment options there are to sustain a remission. I’ve long been treating my rosacea patients with medicines and skin care recommendations that are more art than science out of necessity. I developed my recommendations based on what worked for my many rosacea patients. Recent scientific studies are giving us some interesting information that supports my art-based treatment methods and I’m thrilled. As scientists learn more about rosacea, I’ll be able to build on their findings and refine my treatment recommendations even further. Rosacea is a common, frustrating and often disfiguring inflammatory facial rash. In spite of years of excellent scientific studies, the cause of rosacea remains elusive. In the entire 25 years that I’ve practiced dermatology, the standard rosacea therapies have relied on oral and topical antibiotics. Many of my patients are unwilling to use antibiotics long term so I’ve worked hard to find alternative treatments to help them. What’s new is that scientists are starting to rethink the significance of mites in rosacea. We’ve always known that every person has Demodex mites in their skin pores (yes, it’s unsavory but true). We’ve also always known that people with rosacea have even more mites in their pores than normal. Because everybody has Demodex mites doctors have ignored their presence. I haven’t. I’d see mite stuffed pores under the microscope as an incidental finding on skin biopsies. I’d noted that it often correlated with run-away rosacea. So I’ve been treating Demodex mites for years and found that my rosacea patient’s skin improves when I do! Results of recent scientific papers suggest a significant role for Demodex mites in driving rosacea in both facial skin and eyes. Even more interestingly, one of the papers suggests that it’s not just the mites, it’s a protein on a bacteria that the mites carry that causes some of the inflammation of rosacea – wow, this could be why antibiotics have helped all these years! So, what are my current skin care recommendations for my patients with rosacea? Building a complete skin care routine made of compatible products always yields the best results. Complete skin care involves the 4 essential steps of: cleanse, correct, hydrate, protect. With rosacea the hydrate is important because barrier integrity is weak in rosacea-prone skin. Skin won’t heal if it is not properly hydrated. Protect is important because UV exposure can trigger rosacea flares. Here is what a rosacea skin care routine often looks like in my practice: Cleanse twice daily. Perhaps mites can be washed off if they are outside of the pores. If possible use a Clarisonic Sonic Brush system to pulse cleanser into the pores to help them get out. At least once daily use Calming Zinc Soap fortefied with a full 2% pyrithione zinc to help balance a skin yeast germ called pityrosporum that also grows abundantly on rosacea-prone complexions. If necessary, I may chose a cleanser with sulfa drugs in it for non-allergic patients. If skin is dry or irritated, a soapless cleanser such as Toleriane Cleanser or Extremely Gentle Foaming Cleanser may be soothing. Always rinse skin really well after cleansing because retained cleanser will irritate skin and continue to pull skin lipids out of skin layers. Correct out of balance skin inflammation with Green Tea Antioxidant Skin Therapy. I always have my patients apply this first, right after toweling skin dry. The pharmaceutically pure and stable green tea polyphenols are equivalent to what is extracted in 500 cups of green tea. This topical product loads the skin’s antioxidant reserve to help fight skin stressors – perhaps from the living conditions of what is going on in the pores?! If topical medicines such as Metrogel, Finacea or Soolantra (which specifically kills demodex mites) are being used we layer those on top. Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5% can also possibly address mites. It can be irritating but can often also be very uniquely appropriate for only oily pustular rosacea. Hydrate with Daily Face Cream for Normal to Oily or Normal to Dry skin Protect with a mineral zinc oxide broad spectrum sunscreen. My top choices for rosacea prone complexions include EltaMD Daily, EltaMD Clear , Suntegrity 5 in 1 BB Cream or Sheer Strength Mineral Matte or Spray Sunscreen. The new research results are exciting and I expect that soon we’ll have new treatment medicines for facial Demodex mites, and that these medicines will help to control rosacea.

['2016-04-07 06:30:25'],"['The question of when to change your skin care regimen can be complex. The simple answer is that you often need to change your skin care regimen. But, the longer answer helps you understand why, when and how your skin care regimen needs to change. What are some of the most common reasons your skin care routine needs to change? Seasonally harsh weather will be harsh on your skin. Like bundling up in warm winter clothing, your skin care routine needs to protect your skin from the elements too. For your complexion to stand up to harsh, cold and windy weather, you need to enhance the barrier strength of your skin. You also need to more deeply hydrate your skin to compensate for moisture lost to these elements. Dr. Bailey Advice for Seasonally Harsh Weather Use only gentle cleansers and lather just the parts of your skin that really need it. Apply deeply hydrating products within 3 minutes after toweling off. Here are the product options that I like to add to winter skin care: For Your Body: Use our Naturally Best Bar Soap for showering followed by our All Natural Lotion . Use our AHA Body Kit twice a week. Since your hands always need special care in the winter, I recommend our Hand Care Kit to treat and prevent dry hands. Dr. Bailey Body Recommendations for Your Skin Care Routine For Your Face: Use our Toleriane Cleanser for facial cleansing. Include our Instantly Luminous Serum to your routine to ensure firmer, brighter and smoother skin. Apply our Green Tea Antioxidant Skin Therapy to calm skin redness and fight sun damage. Utilize any of our Daily Face Creams . Keep your lips moist all the time with our Nutritic Lip Balm . Dr. Bailey Facial Recommendations for Your Skin Care Routine Summer or warm climates bring you outdoors more. With this, you can expect more sun exposure. You need to understand your sun exposure risk and be certain to apply the right sunscreen as often as needed. Our sunscreen comparison chart can help provide you with the guidance you need when selecting sunscreen. You may also need to stop using exfoliating skin care products when you expect extreme sun exposure. Dr. Bailey Advice for Summer or Warm Climates Effective Sun Hats Be sure to use a water resistant product for wet and sweaty activity and reapply after swimming and/or every 2 hours for prolonged sun exposure. Also, add a hat and sun protective clothing. Our Pinterest board has some great options for fashionable AND sun protective clothing. During times of extreme sun exposure, you may need to stop using exfoliating skin care products such as scrubs and rough cloths, retinoid products and even glycolic acid products so that your skin can thicken up to better deflect UV rays. Conditions that provoke flare ups of your skin problems require you to change your skin care. Examples include the seasonal flare of rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis (a.k.a., dandruff) and psoriasis. Athletic and sweaty activities may exacerbate a form of sweat-induced acne called pityrosporum folliculitis . Stress, poor eating, hormone changes and a lot of other triggers that we may never identify may exacerbate acne. When these types of skin problems plague your complexion, your skin care routine obviously needs to change ASAP. Sometimes, you can predict the change and make a preemptive strike to control it before it is out of hand. At other times, your routine will change when the problem crops up.

Times when you want to intensely focus on anti-aging skin care goals. Beyond the use of daily broad spectrum sunscreen, there are times when your activities and exposure to harsh climates or UV rays are lessened – this is when you can ramp up your anti-aging skin care regimen. The two best ingredients to fight the signs of skin aging are glycolic acid and retinoids. Both of these exfoliate skin and are best used when you can protect your skin adequately. Vitamin C and antioxidant products, on the other hand, are best used year round. Dr. Bailey Advice for Anti-Aging Skin Care Goals Retinol Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream Use a broad spectrum sunscreen daily, and a retinoid at night such as Retinol Night Cream . Add a glycolic acid cream during the day or at night along with the retinoid IF your complexion can tolerate it. Continue with antioxidant products such as Green Tea and Vitamin C Serum. Use the Instantly Luminous Serum mentioned above to counter any skin dryness. If pigment problems are an issue you can add Skin Fading Pads. How often do you change your skin care regimen?

['2016-04-11 03:30:49'],"['Rosacea is a very common issue, but sadly, there is a lot of misinformation about it. April is actually Rosacea Awareness Month , so I want to inform you about what’s really happening. In short, rosacea encompasses a skin type that has aspects of some but not necessarily all of the following features: facial flushing, facial redness, pimples, eye inflammation and sometimes, enlargement of the nose. People who easily flush are at risk for developing rosacea. There are four different subtypes of rosacea: Erythematotelangiectatic : In this type of rosacea, people may not have pimples. Instead, they may just have pronounced facial redness. Over time, people may develop broken capillaries, which are best treated with a procedure called Broadband Light (BBL). Dr. Bailey explains exactly how BBL works to help rosacea patients in her blog post called “ Broadband Light: The Cosmetic Procedure to Slow Aging Skin .” Papulopustular : This is the type of rosacea in which people have recurrent red bumps and pustules (pimples) on their face. Oftentimes, the pimples feel somewhat itchy. Sometimes patients with this type of rosacea require an oral antibiotic to quiet the inflammation down. Phymatous : In longstanding rosacea, some people develop an enlargement of the oil glands leading to disfiguring enlargements of certain facial parts. In most cases, this leads to an enlarged, bulbous nose. But, other areas such as the chin, forehead, ears and eyelids may also be impacted. These enlargements sometimes require surgery to improve. Ocular : This is the type of rosacea that just affects the eyes. It can lead to red eyes and the sensation that something gritty is in the eye, which can be very irritating. People with this type of rosacea often have blepharitis (inflammation around the eyelashes) as well. The most effective treatment for this type of rosacea is oral antibiotics or special eye drops prescribed by an eye doctor. What factors contribute to rosacea? Green Tea Antioxidant Skin Therapy – Replenix Power of Three We know that there is an increase in inflammation with rosacea, which is why we use products to “cool down” the skin. A green tea-containing moisturizer such as our Green Tea Antioxidant Skin Therapy is an excellent way to put rosacea’s fire out. This moisturizer is packed with antioxidants that fight free radicals associated with inflammation. A good moisturizer is also important because we know that people with rosacea lose more water from their skin, which leads to even more irritation and inflammation because our skin cells don’t protect us from the environment as well without hydration. Citrix Sunscreen SPF 40 UV rays can also make rosacea worse. This is particularly true of the erythematotelangiectatic type of rosacea listed above. UV rays cause blood vessels to over-proliferate. Thus, it’s very important to use a zinc-based sunscreen such as our Citrix SPF 40 , which is also our clients’ favorite sunscreen. Unfortunately, there is another very important problem to address when it comes to rosacea. You may not want to hear it, but there are mites that live in our skin naturally! (Gasp!) These mites are usually few and far between in “normal” skin, but they overgrow in rosacea skin. Mites help to drive the inflammatory process of rosacea, so killing them is our mission! A new prescription medicine called Soolantra Cream has been proven effective in reducing facial mites. We also find that rosacea-prone complexions improve with Dr. Bailey’s Calming Zinc Bar , which has pyrithione zinc, an ingredient that helps address another facial germ that causes inflammation called pityrosporum. It also has redness calming properties. I usually tell people to use this bar of soap once or twice daily. Calming Zinc Bar Soap If you use Calming Zinc Bar only once daily, consider washing with another gentle cleanser too. This is a very important step, and one of my favorites is Vanicream Soap because it lathers so nicely without drying out your skin. Diet can also drive rosacea flares. Spicy foods, hot beverages, and alcohol (especially red wine!) among other things can drive flushing. Of course it would be a good idea to avoid these triggers, but I also know this can be an unrealistic expectation! Rosacea can be a tricky issue, and the above information is just the tip of the iceberg of information related to it. Due to the complexity of the issue, Dr. Bailey has created a free ebook that goes in depth about rosacea. Download your free copy of “ Rosacea: Understanding What It Is and What You Can Do about It ” today! If you are still having trouble with your skin despite these simple measures, make an appointment with your dermatologist.

['2018-03-02 09:44:57'],"['Greens are turning out to be the superfood to fight mental decline with age – and your complexion will look fabulous, too. I love this topic! Yes, evidence is growing that your diet is especially huge if you want to age well – and greens are uber-epic in the healthy-as-you-age diet category. Martha Clare Morris, lead researcher in a study on brain aging and lifestyle that was published last month in Neurology , said so herself. She also said that eating the fresh leafy greens is key; you can’t take them processed in a dietary supplements. Sorry. No dietary bypass pill with our croissant or hamburger. We have to eat fresh “leafys.” Mother Nature is our most brilliant nutritional chemist. She created the perfect nutrient combination in the perfect form when she made greens; you get bigger, better, more of her goodness when you eat them cooked or raw and best with a little oil. These include: Nutrients like vitamin K, folate, lutein, beta carotene, etc. And not to mention pre-biotic fiber that your fascinating intestinal microbiome needs to do its complex work to keep you happy, healthy, un-inflamed, and less-prone to gain weight. Martha Clare Morris is on this point, too. She said that based on the research about greens, it’s really the food sources of these nutrients (in greens) that seem to be important. Yep, of the top 20% of the people in this new study, those who demonstrated the best memory and mental skills ate one or more servings of green leafys a day! Yep, they ate them raw as salad greens or ½ cup of cooked greens – easy-peasy, 1/2 cup goes down fast. And it’s not rocket science or torture!', 'LINK TO VIDEO', 'Grandma was right to make you eat your greens. Amazing how smart those grandma’s are. I’ve encouraged you to eat a daily dose of greens for your complexion and want to add inspiration – your brain.']",c0a8a1daca3937b8df2f7c49ce9d46e62564c846,da2b-4d5a-8d1e,Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care,https://www.drbaileyskincare.com/info/blog/greens-skin-care-healthy-brain
