I consider Petite Heat a companion piece to the original palette since I thought it would contain a good deal of transitional shades that the original lacked. I think most of a agree that the main issue with the Heat Eyeshadow Palette was the fact that many of the colors were gorgeous but also difficult to use together since they didn’t provide much contrast and they ran all together. I consider Petite Heat quite a nice source of shades that will compliment ones in that palette however, there’s not a lot of newness here and some of the prime real estate in the palette is taken over by two lighter highlighting shades. Let’s take a closer look at my review and swatches below. Urban Decay Petite Heat Eyeshadow Palette arrives in a small, lightweight rectangle case that contains six shades which weight in at 0.24 oz. It’s neither here nor there but it deserves to be mentioned Urban Decay Naked2 Basics Eyeshadow Palette is the same price but a little larger at 0.30 oz in size. I liked the palette but didn’t love it. I think it has some great companion shades that will work nicely with the Naked Heat Palette but it doesn’t offer a huge amount of differently or more unique shades that aren’t already available in that palette. Also, the colors aren’t quite the transitional ones I expected or hopes for so in a way it doesn’t add anything to the Heat Eyeshadow Palette that isn’t already there. I also feel like the shades work a lot like the original ones in the fact they don’t contrast well and end up running together. One of the bothersome things about the palette is the fact they include a cream and a bone shade which can be found in any number of other palettes I already own. Granted if you’re traveling light and just want to toss this in your bag and go the addition of those highlighting shades is helpful. However, if you’re a makeup junkie that owns dozens and dozens of palettes you already have literally hundreds of highlighting shades. Aside from that I don’t think this would be a palette I’d travel with solely as there’s not enough variety for me to get a few looks out of the six shades. I feel like I can create one look using a few shades and maybe one or two looks just using shades individually on my lid. It’s just isn’t as functional a palette as I thought it would be. Urban Decay Petite Heat Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Strike, Inhale, Vibrate, Hot Spell, Wild Thing, Heist) On that note, I will say you can definitely pair the palette up with other shades in your collection. Below I did a look using shades from the palette but in the last look I just popped a little Dirty Talk from the original Naked Heat Palette on top of the shades and added a hint of shimmer and also just added some nice depth to the look I created. As for the formula it was fairly good for a matte palette. They texture is firm yet not dry nor chalky with excellent pigmentation and a fairly smooth application. The first three shades are sheerer but visible on my lids none the less. They didn’t crease nor fade on my drier lids without eyeshadow primer. Urban Decay Petite Heat Eyeshadow Palette isn’t exactly what I was hoping for as I did expect it to be an ideal companion to the Heat Eyeshadow Palette. It also failed a little as an all-in-one lightweight travel palette as I do think you might need more shades than this provides to get a solid few looks while on vacation. Do you need it? I imagine if you like warmer, bolder shades you might wish to indulge but honestly, you’re probably already covered if you own the Naked Heat Palette as that pretty much has everything you need in the warm, fiery range of shades.

If you didn’t know Bliss launched an entire color cosmetics line in 2015 which made a brief appearance on my wish list but gathered dust on it while I explored other items higher up on the list. I sort of forgot how much I wanted to try it until recently when it popped on SALE everywhere! Kohls.com has a bunch of items available on sale at the moment and so do stores (although the two stores I visited had a lot of opened, swatched items) and blissworld.com also has a select few items. But by far the best place to haul is from hautelook.com as everything is $9.97 and at least you know it’ll be in pristine condition when you get it versus buying it in store. I’m glad I waited as after seeing quite a few items on sale at my local stores I left disenchanted since the boxes were sort of knocked up and the contents looked used. I ended up heading home only to realize hautelook.com had a ton of the stuff! More than the store! So, I grabbed quite a few items. I’m not sure if this is a goodbye to the entire line but I imagine it is since their website seems to be completely cleared up of any of the line! Or maybe they are relaunching who knows! Still means a great sale for us! Yay! Hopefully you score a deal. Enjoy! You may also enjoy...

Revlon Ultimate All-In-One Mascara is one of those mascara that shocked me as I went into this purchase thinking hmmmm, it’s probably a one trick pony. Let’s face it most mascara formulas will either get you some great length or some great volume but rarely do you get one that are able to deliver both. But Revlon Ultimate All-In-One Mascara might just be the exception to the rule. Revlon Ultimate All-In-One Mascara comes housed in a rather slick flat packaging that will remind you of Hourglass Prodigy Lipgloss or even the Sephora Divergent Lipglosses . It has a short mini brush that looks like it was create for lower lashes versus your top ones. Revlon calls the brush a “power mini brush” and promises the unique oval shape makes for easy application as the hollow core design deposits the formula on each lash easily. The smaller brush kinda had me scratching my head and I felt for sure this wouldn’t work out well at all as it was so tiny. The brush is about a quarter the size of a normal standard mascara applicator. Personally I didn’t think the brush would successfully work on my upper lashes but I did have a moment of, “Oh well at least it’ll work on my lower lashes!” But turns out I was wrong as the brush does indeed work great on both the lower and upper lash line. This is a tube formula of sorts that’s quite wet and removes easily at the end of the day without smudging or flaking up during the wear. It isn’t a tube formula that’s dry and it isn’t one that makes you feel like you have a lash in your eye when you’re wearing it. However, as you remove it you’ll notice the little tubes break down easily and will look like little lashes on your cotton pad. To use the smaller brush I wriggle it under my lash line and at the root and pull slowly forward. It adds incredible volume to my lashes so they appear quite fuller. The brush, although small, also adds a good deal of length. And yes, it also does a fab job adding inky blackness to my already dark lashes so it is quite dramatically intense and pigmented as promised. I wouldn’t say it adds curl but it does lift lashes upwards and outwards so so far I’d say it’s batting a 5 out of 5 on its promise of adding length, volume, definition, lift, and pigment! Now it can be tricky to use at first so I recommend curling lashes prior for the best results. I noticed I got the best results when I curled my lashes as the curler pulled my lashes upwards and made it easier for me to get at the root of my lash with the brush. Yes, I was skeptical the very tiny brush head wouldn’t work for me because as I mentioned it looked more like a detail brush or a brush that would work on lower lashes. But it actually did a fabulous job lifting my lashes upward and out while adding a ton of volume to my lashes so they appeared fuller and longer. This actually quite reminds me of It Cosmetics Tight Line Mascara but it adds way MORE volume to my lashes. Revlon delighted and surprised me with this formula. It was unexpected and I really didn’t think it would work but Revlon Ultimate All-In-One Mascara isn’t just another one tricky pony mascara. This one delivers on the 5 in 1 formula it promises to add length, fullness, lift, pigment, and defination to wimpy lashes so they look fuller, longer, lifted, and more defined. Likey!

Right now the highest level is Platinum which can be reached by spending $450 in your calendar. Update: Learn more about Diamond Status and why it might just be unattainable to achieve by clicking here! Many of you are already Sephora Rouge Members but have expressed how superior Ulta’s Rewards Program is in comparison. I couldn’t agree more as every point you earn at Ulta is converted into cash rewards which can be spent on anything you want, no exclusions. Ulta also offers early access to new releases from Too Faced, Urban Decay, and more but this perk is typically offered to Sephora Rouge and VIB Members as well. Ulta’s Rewards Program also gets you 20% off your total about two or three times a year where as Sephora only offers 20% Off once a year. Needless to say Ulta’s Rewards Program is quite a good deal better compared to Sephora Rouge Membership which offers very little return on the investment of $1000 to retain your reward status. There’s no word yet what exactly the new program will be about but details will be revealed in 16 days! Ulta.com even has a countdown calendar on their site for the big day! I suspect it’s going to be quite a great addition to their already amazing Rewards Program. What do you think of this new Diamond Reward Level? What do you hope to see from it? Do share!

THEY SHIP FREE! What?! Shut up! Earlier in January when news broke about the Ulta Diamond Rewards Program launched I was pretty vocal about how I expected and wanted free shipping from Ulta. I’m happy to see that they are making some effort to make my hopes a reality. I hadn’t noticed them shipping Platinum Exclusives for free in the past so this seems new to me! One thing I find utterly odd is how they continue to promote items as Platinum Exclusive. Umm hello? What about the Diamond Reward Members? Shouldn’t they also be included in the exclusive launches? None the less, I’m still happy to see free shipping. Typically that’s reserved for their special sales like 21 Days of Beauty. But hey, I’ll take it because sometimes they’ll launch some exclusive palette that I want but I don’t want to do a complete haul just to get free shipping. Now I can pop that bad boy in my cart without spending extra cash. Thanks Ulta. But still, can you work on getting us Platinum and Diamond Members free shipping all the time? Or at least a membership service like Sephora Flash that allows us to get our goodies with free shipping? That’d work just fine for me 🙂 You may also enjoy...

This yummy little 8 pan palette contains matte and shimmer shades in an assortment of purples and pinks that’s ideal for Spring looks. Viseart Petite Pro Palette 2 is available now at Sephora.com. But let’s talk about really important news right now which is the fact that they’ll be a crossover Supernatural Scooby Doo episode airing at Paleyfest (and late in March on the CW). Dude, seriously though I think we’ve all wanted this since that meme popped up featuring an Impala and the Mystery Machine. Or maybe you’re ahem as weird as I am and read Scooby Doo and Supernatural fanfic . Don’t judge, it’s better than Wincest sometimes. The episode will be completely animated and the J’s will be meeting Scooby and the gang while solving some interesting mystery. This can play out in so many different ways. Dean and Scooby enjoying pie together, Velma and Sam being all nerdy and techy together, Dean making the moves on Daphne, Shaggy and Cass getting baked together but really you want to see Cass loosen up a little right? Remember when he watched porn for the first time? Imagine him smoking weed for the first time. There’s not much else known about the episode. They are shrouding it in complete secrecy! We’ll have to wait into late next month to see what goes down. I hope I totally made your day today with this news. You may also enjoy...

Essential Lip Balm Tint. At a mere two dollars each the new E.L.F. Essential Lip Balm Tints are a welcome treat for lips with a pop of color that might just surprise you! Do like these! E.L.F. Essential Lip Balm Tint ($2) is available in four selections and is a thick, creamy tinted balm. I actually didn’t expect much from these. First I figured, “Oh they’ll be subtle” after that I thought, “Oh they’ll probably be dense and hard and blah…!” But they proved me wrong. They come in a tiny plastic container which is a tad flimsy and temperamental as the lids screw of easy enough but sometimes don’t always screw on correctly…but hey what do you want for two bucks? They look like little jello shots don’t they? Grapefruit, Berry, Peach The formula I’d liken to products like Jelly Pong Pong Lip Cushion and Lipstick Queen Sinner Shine Hardcore Gloss . These have a gooey emollient texture which might be a turn off to some. Personally I love how thick they are! I find I have to warm them up a bit by swiping my finger across my lips a few times as I apply to thin the formula out and allow it to smear across my lips in a softer, more even finish. The texture is soft and malleable with a sweet vanilla taste. They have a bit of a chunkiness to them but as you blend them onto your lips they’ll heat up, melt down, and thin out leaving lips with opaque color and a high shine finish. I dislike the finger application and dipping into the pot, etc…due to bacteria, germs, etc…but it is unfortunately the best method for application here. The wear time varies but I can get about two to three hours before they begin to wear away. Through that wear they remain comfortable and never dry my lips out. They do like to migrate though so a transparent lip liner would be a good idea. I think the pigment will surprise many as they really are far from subtle on lips! They provide a good deal of color as well as shine. Berry Grapefruit Peach Overall, E.L.F. Essential Lip Balm Tint is a boost in the lip balm world! Plenty of pigment, a emollient moisturizing formula, and a load of shine make these a rather fab beauty budget pick up! Available now at www.eyeslipsface.com Tried ’em? Do share!

new Violet Voss The Rainbow Eyeshadow Palette for Spring 2018 launched today and includes ten colorful rainbow hued shades in a variety of finishes. Would you believe I still haven’t tried the Violet Voss Eyeshadow Palette I hauled back in November?! I need to get on that! But anyway… I know a lot of you are pretty much bored with the constant nudes lately and in this case your prays for a colorful eyeshadow palette might just be answered as this includes some beautiful pops of shades: Colors include: Flamingo (rich pinky red) Peach (dual chrome rusty peach) Buttercup (rich golden gold) Seaform (seafoam green) Figi (exotic aqua) Royal (rich deep blue) Indigo (true purple) Violet (duo-chrome pink pearl) Pearl (sheer iridescent white) Eclipse (black with glitter) So, it’s not for me sadly. I’m not much of a rainbow eyeshadow girl! It’s so weird because when I started Musings of a Muse I was NOT a nude person. I actually hated nude or brown eyeshadows. Fast forward several years and it’s about all I wear lately. I guess I got boring somewhere along the line. It’s a shame because I really love aqua, blue, green, pink but I always migrate back towards the 1000+ brown eyeshadows I have. I need to get back into color again. How about you? Loving the Violet Voss The Rainbow Eyeshadow Palette? Or are you sticking with your tried and true nudes? Violet Voss The Rainbow Eyeshadow Palette is $30 and available now at sephora.com.

I imagine this includes the store in the Palisades Mall I originally wrote about back in 2015 but I haven’t been to the Palisades in a while so I can’t confirm. It’s with a heavy heart that I write about this news today as I’m truly a huge fan of Kiko’s products especially their seasonal, limited edition releases. Moving forward they’ll likely retain their online business and at least five of their domestic stores will remain open. It comes as no great surprise they plan to close store locations though since mall traffic is at an all time low due to online sales especially around the Holidays when most shopping is done. Video killed the radio star as they say. Currently they have 29 US stores and plan to close 24 as of February 28th. Apparently their online sales are steady and even increasing in 2017 and they also sell through amazon.com now which means you can take advantage of Prime Free Shipping. So, it is quite sad news they are closing store locations but don’t worry it looks like the online sales force is strong. I know I don’t want to see Kiko disappear anytime soon as their collection are very appealing to those who like higher-end makeup at a budget price and that’s exactly what they deliver to us. Thanks to Brian for sharing this news yesterday via a comment. Right now not a lot of news outlets have covered the story so without him mentioning I might have never known. What do you think of Kiko closing stores? Do you shop at their stores often? I’m guilty of doing 99% of my own Kiko shopping online! You may also enjoy...

I know we had some rather sad news about Kiko going bankrupt and closing many of their US store locations but they still have their online shop and the bankruptcy news hasn’t stopped them from launching a stellar Spring 2018 Collection. Here are five things I need from that collection ASAP. P.S. You might need them too! Kiko Free Soul Baking Powder ($16) is a new matte face powder available in banana and peach shades which of course, had me at hello. I don’t bake my under eye area nor my face but I am an avid user of banana shaded powders to set my concealer as I like their effect under my eyes since they provide a nice brightening effect and the perfect finishing touch under my eyes. This is available in banana and peach shades and they actually look a lot like the Kat Von D Lock-It Brightening Powder. Another item to catch my eye is the new Kiko Free Soul Concealer which is a mere $12 bucks and promises a fluid formula. Fluid? I’m in. Fluids are typically easier to blend and that’s exactly what they promise. Apparently it has a baking finish effect hmmm…! And provides full coverage. We’ll see! Speaking about things for your eyes there is also a new Free Soul Blurring Eye Balm ! Let me take things way back for a minute here! Anyone remember Clarins Instant Smooth Line Correcting Concentrate and L’Oreal Revitalift Miracle Blur Instant Eye Smoother ? That’s exactly what this reminds me of! Although they do say it provides instant radiance which gives eyes a fresh look. Hmm wonder if it’ll make a good prep for concealer?! Free Soul Blurring Eye Balm Speaking of blurring there’s a new Free Soul Blurring &amp; Moisturizing Face Cream ($28) which appears to be a dupe of Clinique Pep-Start HydroBlur Moisturizer which I happen to like a lot. This smooths, hydrates, and contains collagen and hyaluronic acid to prep skin prior to makeup application. And finally the Kiko Free Soul Eyeshadow Palette ($22) in Free Spirits looks like a gorgeous selection of warmer dusky roses! With all the silliness of unicorns and mermaids making the rounds this Spring I’m happy to see a brand who actually put out a Spring Collection of wearable shades that contains not only some great color cosmetics but some great prepping items as well. The Kiko Free Soul Spring 2018 Collection is available now at kikocosmetics.com. You may also enjoy...

Kiko always has something darling up their sleeves for Valentine’s Day. I’m one of those people that isn’t really into V-Day (do we really need one day to say we love each other?! We should be doing that everyday!) but I flip out over all the decorations, chocolates, and of course, beauty and makeup that launches around this time of the year. Not a lot of brands really focus on V-Day so, it always seems extra special when someone does do a product or collection launched themed around the Holiday. One of the things I’m loving from this collection this year is the new Kiko Lip Me Lots Blush ($15). This is available in a single shade and has a sweet vanilla fragrance with a satiny finish. Last year they launched the Kiko Love Elixir Face Powder but I’m liking the looks of the new blush a lot. But it does look sheer but hopefully I’m wrong! There’s also a matching Kiko Lip Me Lots Face Highlighter ($15) is a fine golden sheen shade that matches up with the blush! Last year, we got Endless Love Lipstick with had a glossy sheen and this year the formula is revised and called Lip Me Lots Lipstick ($10) which is matte in finish sadly. But knowing Kiko it’s a comfortable matte as the brand is legendary for creating some fantastic lipstick formulas. They launched these in six shades with a very affordable ten dollar price tag. Other lip products include a new Kiko Lip Me Lots Ph Lip Enhancer ($11) which is a sheer personalized lip balm that changes color upon contact with lips for a natural, personalized shade that contains a glossy sheen finish. For a little fun they also have a new Lip Me Lots Eyeliner and Stamp Tattoo ($11) which might be a little silly if it weren’t for the fact it is dual-ended so it contains a black liquid liner on one side and a heart stamp tattoo on the other than be used on your face or body. And finally it wouldn’t be a Kiko Collection without cute accessories! This Lip Me Lots Kabuki Brush ($16) has a bright red metallic handle which is heart-shaped and can be used to buff powder, blush, or highlighter into your face! Cute collection right?

There was some dispute about how limited edition this eyeshadow palette was and if and when it would launch at Ulta but I’m happy to report it is now available so, if you have some Ulta points stored up now might be a good time to spend them. The Lorac Beauty and the Beast Eyeshadow Palette is inspired by the film that recently launched on DVD. It seems a little late coming around now post movie release but since the DVD just recently arrived I guess that would be why Lorac decided to launch this now. I think most of us would probably agree that we’d buy it ten years after the movie release! I know I would! As a Beauty and the Beast fan it’s a very appealing collector’s piece of makeup. Some feel it’s a bit childish but I thought it was a pretty cool release from a collector’s stand point. From a makeup users one thought it might not be that grand a release. Let’s take a look! Like the Pirates of the Caribbean Eyeshadow Palette , I had some down falls with the Beauty and the Beast Eyeshadow Palette but let’s discuss packaging details before we get into performance and color round up. The Lorac Beauty and the Beast Collection arrives to us in rose gold boxes and packaging with gorgeous gold accents. The eyeshadow palette looks like a book or a diary with a gold clasp to hold it closed. Inside there’s a print of a gilded mirror frame that surrounds a smaller mirror and the sentence, “Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind” printed on the bottom portion of the palette. There’s a red ribbon bookmark in the middle of the palette and the right side holds 16 Lorac Pro Eyeshadows inspired by Belle, her Beast, and other characters and locations in the movie with the words, “True Beauty is found within” printed in gold at the top right hand corner. You also get a dual-ended gold eyeshadow blending brush with the palette which had stiffer bristles but still did a fairly good job blending. The shadows are fantastic! Quite smooth, silky, and pigmented. I wasn’t disappointed in the least with their application, performance, and color pay off. Lorac has a super silky formulation that’s a bit powdery but blends and applies very well on my drier eyes. If you own Pro Palettes already and love the formula the eyeshadows in this palette won’t disappoint you. However, if you’re not a fan of Lorac’s Pro line of eyeshadows, you’ll likely not like them in this palette. There are two shades, Swept Up, and Spell Breaker, did have some glittery fall out which is worth mentioning for anyone who hates chunky glitter. One thing I have to admit hating about the palette is the fact it had absolutely no rhythm or reason for me. I’m not terribly creative combining shades to create looks and with this palette I felt it was arranged in a way that left me really lost. There was no connection between a lot of the colors. I experienced this same probably with the Pirates Palette! Not to mention none of these shades quite reminded me of Belle unless you count Enchanting which was a soft buttery gold that might be inspired by her gown. Lorac Beauty and the Beast Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Beast Mode, Enchanting, Swept Up, Look Beyond) Lorac Beauty and the Beast Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Dream It, Time Keeper, Our Guess, Impress) Lorac Beauty and the Beast Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Inner Beauty, Tea Time, Tick Tock, Real You) Lorac Beauty and the Beast Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (My Castle, Chip In, Romance, Spell Breaker) Here’s the good news… Some of the shades used individually are really quite nice on my eyes but I felt compelled to bring in other shades from palettes I own to get a nice contracting eye look because a lot of these colors were mismatched and didn’t quite jive well together. But again, I’m not terribly creative either so, you might need a lot more imagination and creativity than I have to get a solid eye look from the colors here. As for dupes, well, there are quite a few that aren’t quite identical to past Pro Palettes but pretty much will create similiar looks. Like Beast Mode, Enchanting, My Castle Look, Look Beyond, and Chip In we’ve all seen some variation of in past Lorac Pro Eyeshadow Palettes. So, I wouldn’t say this is a complete unique line up of colors. I think Lorac did a beautiful job with the Beauty and the Beast Eyeshadow Palette. It’s packaged in a way that should be very appealing to fans of the film and Disney. It’s a very nice collector’s piece of makeup but I think the actual eyeshadow contents might be disappointing for some not only because they are a rerun of shades you might already own but also because they aren’t quite shades that will remind you of Beauty or her Beast. Lorac Beauty and the Beast Eyeshadow Palette is available now at Ulta.com. Did you haul it? What did you think of it? You may also enjoy...

This lovely little eyeshadow palettes brings together 18 Lorac Pro Eyeshadows as well as a Front of the Line Pro Eye Pencil that Lorac collaborated with Disney to create. Pirates are so my jam so, I was pretty excited about this launch. I mean who doesn’t love Johnny Depp’s legendary portrayal of Captain Jack right? Let’s take a look at this new eyeshadow palette! The palette arrives in a black and gold box with a gold skull gracing the cover. The actual palette design is a black galaxy backdrop with a gold compass decorating the front. I kind of wish they had extended the skull design to the palette itself! I think the real beauty is inside the palette though. You’ll find a full-size mirror and a gorgeous night sky background with swirls of black, teal, and dark blue upon opening this up. When I originally posted about the collection someone pointed out that the palette had a little ribbon pull at the side and certain promo images showed that the side portion of the palette pulled down to reveal a drawer of some sort. When I was asked about this I replied that perhaps it held a brush. Turns out the palette has a hollow bottom which, get this, you can slide the Lorac Pirates of the Caribbean Cheek Palette into. OMG! As someone who’s always running out of places to store my rather large makeup collection I totally fell in love with this idea. The cheek palette slides right into the bottom of the eyeshadow palette which allows you to safely store both items together, travel with them easily, or makes it a little easier to store the palettes. So freaking cool! And hey, if you don’t buy the cheek palette you can probably store a few brushes in there or eyeliners. It’ll hold some small makeup items quite easily or even some blushes from the Balm since their blush packaging is a flat square box. Although, it isn’t as thin as the original Pro Palette and does have the more chunkier design we’ve seen from palettes like the Urban Decay Alice in Wonderland Book of Shadows . Anyway, package gushing aside….! This holds 18 shades for a total of 0.36 oz (0.02 oz per a shade) with a price tag of $52. Keep in mind this is considerably smaller than past palettes like the Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 for example. That palette was 0.45 oz in size, $59, and 32 shades. It’s not a big price jump but this lacks the variety of the original palettes. The back of the box states it was assembled in the US but with non-US materials. I don’t know if the palette screams pirates to me. The shades seem a little mismatched with very little rhythm or reason. I thought about the shades I would have included and realized how unimaginative I am because I just kept thinking sandy, beachy nudes combined with aquatic blues and teals. What you actually get is a mix of a different of shades. Freshwater blue, cranberry, a variety of greens, combined with smokier blacks, and light taupes. I have to admit I felt a little intimidated by the shades as many didn’t really seem to work together. Sea Haze and Menace are a nice combo as well as Treasure and Tell No Tales, or as I used in my look below Starry Night and Compass. But certain shades like Yo Ho, Silent Mary, and Bones I felt a little clueless about using in a look. If I look at the palette a little differently and get the ocean, beach, and mermaids out of my head, I can probably see a few of these shades creating a smokier look that might be inspired by Jack. I do wish they worked better together though. As for the finish there’s a variety here that include mattes, satins, shimmers, metallics, frosts, and even a duochrome (Black Pearl). I find myself struggling whether or not to label this a cool or warmer palette. To me, it feels like both as there are warmer shades as well as cooler ones here. Certain shades didn’t completely work out for me and looked a tad chalky on my skin tone like Ghostly a pure white matte and Lost at Sea a light gray. I wouldn’t say this is completely free of dupes as there are a few shades here that might be similiar to past palettes like Treasure, a dark cranberry, was a color that’s popped up before as well as Compass, a sandy gold and of course, many of the highlighting shades like Matte-y, an off white, look like something we’ve seen in a past Mega Pro Palette. Lorac Pirates of the Caribbean Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Matte-y, Lost at Sea, Pirates Chest, Sea Haze) Lorac Pirates of the Caribbean Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Black Pearl, Yo Ho, Bones, Silvermist) Lorac Pirates of the Caribbean Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Ghostly, Starry Night, Compass, Arrgh!) Lorac Pirates of the Caribbean Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Treasure, Tell No Tales, Shiver Me, Cursed) Lorac Pirates of the Caribbean Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Menace, Silent Mary, Pro Eyeliner) You’re either going to love Lorac’s formula or hate it in my experience. I happen to be on Team Love as the formula works great for my drier eyes. They colors are very, very soft with a powdery texture that isn’t dry or dense. They kick up a lot of loose powder when you swipe a brush through them so, they can be a bit messy but I’ve never experience major fall out when applying them thankfully. The texture is very silky but some shades slip off the eye easily so, I recommend a good cream base or primer to allow them to adhere well to your lid. Pigmentation was great on a lot of the shades but there were some sheerer color as well which did build easily enough. For me, the Lorac Pirates of the Caribbean Pro Eyeshadow Palette is more of a collectible piece of makeup versus one that will work easily in everyday looks. I think if you’re an average makeup user you might struggle a little with the shade line up here. This doesn’t quite live up to Lorac’s original Mega Pro Palette range as those palette had considerably more variety. But for fans of Jack, the film franchise, or pirates in general, I’m sure it’ll be a win. Lorac Pirates of the Caribbean Pro Eyeshadow Palette is available now at loraccosmetics.com and at Ulta.com soon! Will you be indulging? I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this palette!

The Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 was available last week as an Ulta Platinum Perk for one day only but the palette will launch at Ulta.com for everyone else on October 2nd! Now seemed a good a time as any to share my review and swatches of this palette which will hopefully help you decide if you need it. The Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 comes housed in a white palette with Lorac’s emblem in rose gold. It happens to be my favorite palette presentation from the three Mega Pro Palettes but it gets dirty so, so, so fast. The Mega Pro Palette has always paid home to very soft, powdery eyeshadow shades and that creates quite a big mess against a background of white. No bueno! Love the packaging but sadly it was a bad idea to house these shades in a white palette. None the less the presensation is awesome as the palette is slim with a massive mirror tucked inside and will travel quite easily without taking up a ton of space and allowing you to have 32 shades of eyeshadow on hand. It’ll also store easily enough since it is very thin. Each eyeshadow name is printed below their well in the palette and the palette is apparently assembled in the US but with non-US materials. The total size of the palette is 0.45 oz and will set you back $59. The price remains the same but the original Mega Pro contained 0.62 oz of product where as Mega Pro Palette 2 and 3 got a little smaller over the years. The palette contains two rows of shimmer shades and two of mattes but I don’t always feel like I can fit the shades into two single finishes as some shades feel metallic, where as others are satins or even frosts. I don’t feel like Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 revisits or rehashes shades although you’ll find some similar shades but not exact dupes of colors that appeared in both 1 and 2. This palette follows along the cooler nude theme of Lorac Pro 3 but also contains many, many warmer nudes as well. It’s a mix of both warmer, richer nudes as well as cooler nudes. Thankfully the warm outweigh the cooler because certain shades like Toffee, Pink Cream, and Snow are shades that I can’t really use all over my lid since they appear chalky on my skin tone. I reserve these shades as high brow highlighters. It’s an interesting line up to say the least as you can easily do a variety of looks from brown smoky to a traditional smoky look, a burgundy or mauve look, and even a rose gold one too! There’s a wide variety of shades here to create many different looks. Lorac’s formula is one I’ve loved and appreciated for a long time as a girl with drier eyes and finer lines. These shades all very smooth and almost creamy in texture. But they are very, very soft and powdery but not chalky nor dry. The colors tend to crumble when a brush is swiped across them and release a ton of powder everywhere which is why this white packaging is a nightmare. I always feel like this is a bit wasteful as I have to dust it away after and none of it is ending up on my eyes. None the less, I love the formula and I got a lot of use out of last year’s palette so, I’m happy to have purchased this one. The mattes in particular stand out as beautiful, easy to work with shades. They are soft, powdery, and quite easy to blend. You do need a good base with these too to minimize fall out and also this allows shades to adhere better to lids. MAC Paint Pots are a great prep for this formula as the formula is thick and a little bit tacky which helps the shadow to stick to your lid well plus it minimizes fall out in a major way. No doubt though, these can prove messy to work with. The shimmers are beautiful here and some look almost metallic in finish. Rust, Cide, Brown Sugar, and Olive are all shades that stand out for me! These are soft, velvety, and pigmented. Some of lighter shades apply sheer but all the others are richly pigmented with excellent color pay off. Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 Swatches (Crepe, Toffee, Mist, Vintage) Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 Swatches (Tulle, Pink Bronze, Rust, Rose Quartz) Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 Swatches (Snow, Cava, Cider, Bellini) Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 Swatches (Pink Cream, Tan, Pecan, Walnut) Lorac Mega Pro Palette Swatches (Dusty Mauve, Violet Gray, Eggplant, Dark Navy) Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 Swatches (Hickory, Maple, Bark, Jet Black) Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 Swatches (Brown Sugar, Sequoia, Glacier, Deep Fog) Lorac Mega Pro Palette 3 Swatches (Olive, Dark Roast, Pomegranate, Licorice) Like past releases, the Lorac Mega Pro 3 Palette is messy to work with but the assortment of shades, pigmented formula, and gorgeous looks you can create using this palette make it a buy for me. This is an excellent selection of colors that will offer endless work friendly and evening looks. I liked it and think it is worth a pick up without fearing that the shades in it are duplications from 1 and 2. The Lorac Mega Pro 3 Palette will be available at Ulta.com . Will you be purchasing it?

The Covergirl x Star Wars Makeup Collection is popping up now, for a limited time, at drugstores. During the initial collection news two looks inspired by the Light and Dark Side were unveiled and created by Covergirl’s Global Creative Design Director, Pat McGrath. Today I have the full look book reveal featuring Janelle Monae. Take a look below at all the Covergirl Star Wars Makeup Collection looks and maybe get some ideas to create your own! Droid A luminous look that reflects the Light Side in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” A swatch of golden eye shadow across lids and cheekbones sets the tone, with gold lipstick and gloss punctuating the lustrous palette. Droid is rocking a new metallic lip shade – Covergirl Star Wars Lipstick Colorlicious in Gold . Jedi Gorgeous golds and glowy skin to capture the radiance of the Light Side. Copper shadow across the upper lid, gold shadow smudged across the lower lash line and contoured cheekbones evoke structure and strength. The fearless and fresh look is complete with Covergirl Star Wars Lipstick Colorlicious in Nude. Mystic An iridescent look inspired by the Light Side. Glowing greens and rich purples paired with rosy cheeks radiate the mystery of the Light Side. The exotic look is pulled together with a lustrous lip shade – Covergirl Star Wars Lipstick Colorlicious in Lilac. Stormtrooper A strong and graphic look to represent the power from the Dark Side. The eyes dominate with a black winged liner and white contrasts. Lips measure up in a deep, mysterious red. Stormtrooper’s edgy look is topped off with a new lip shade – Covegirl Star Wars Lipstick – Colorlicious in Dark Purple. Dark Apprentice A rich look to represent the intensity of the Dark Side. The sinister eye look commands with bold washes of red and black across the lid, paired with deliciously deep lips. Dark Apprentice’s look is completed by a new plum lip shade – Covergirl Star Wars Lipstick Colorlicious in Dark Plum. Chrome Captain A sleek look that captures the authoritative nature of the Dark Side. The contrast of flawless, impeccable skin paired with metallic shadow, strong liner, and bold, straight brows create a mesmerizing combination. Lips demand attention with a show-stopping swipe of Covergirl Star Wars Lipstick Colorlicious in Silver. Resistance Pilot As modeled by Janelle Monae, this look embodies the confident and daring spirit of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” A blend of gold and blue eye shadow complimented by highlighted cheekbones, and a sheer, soft lip bring the allure of Star Wars to your everyday look.

Available in a Dark and Light Side shade selection the new Covergirl Star Wars Colorlicious Lipsticks are part of the limited edition Covergirl Star Wars Makeup Collection that will be popping up at drugstores on September 4th. Let’s face it Star Wars and makeup must have you excited right? As a fan girl, I’m flaying arms, running around in circles excited. Take a peek! Unlike the Covergirl Hunger Games Makeup Collection the shades in the Covergirl Star Wars Makeup Collection are not repromoted permanent shades. These six new colors will be available in a Light Side Droid color selection a Dark Side Stormtrooper color selection as well. The shades are limited edition and will be $7.99 each. Each lipstick comes housed in a square black lacquer tube with “Star Wars The Force Awakens” on the side. Sadly, each shade is not named but instead are numbered. I have #40 which is a golden shimmering orange and part of the Droid Light Side and 50 which is a dark grape-y purple which is part of the Dark Side Stormtropper side. For me the Colorlicious Lipstick range is a lot like Covergirl’s Lip Perfection Lipstick formula. My favorite shade between these two is most definitely the Gold Droid which can be used alone or as an overcoat on lipsticks. This has a slick texture with a nice easy glide on lips and a ton of shimmer. It’ll be a very nice shade for an orange ombre look. The color works fabulous on its own giving lips a golden orange shimmery finish. Or can be used on top of bright red or orange lipsticks to add shimmery and depth. It’s quite a versatile shade! It has a light vanilla taste and fragrance. Covergirl Star Wars Colorlicious Lipstick (Shade 40) Covergirl Star Wars Colorlicious Lipstick (Shade 50) Covergirl Star Wars Lipstick Swatches (Shade 40 and Shade 50) Shade 50 didn’t play as nicely! This is a slicker formula as well but the color is so dark it applies a bit patchy so you might need a lip brush for the best application. The color seemed to migrate and separate due to the moister, lighter texture of the formula. It’s a color that’s difficult to wear and apply in my opinion. But on the upside, I do find that with a lot of vampy shades of lipstick. I just always struggle with applying them and this color falls into those realms. It just seemed to want to travel around my lip line as well which wasn’t a pretty look. It is a very Fall friendly shade though. That’s part of what I liked about both shades as they are quite trendy for Fall looks! Halloween is on the way and some of these shades will make for great costume additions. I heard chatter that some fans didn’t love the collection. Honestly, I’m a Star Wars fan girl and I totally dug the idea of the collection. You’re going to run into everything from candy to toilet paper with Star Wars on it for the next three years of your geeky life so why not a drugstore makeup collection too right? I’m all hands on deck for the Covergirl Star Wars Makeup Collection so bring it on! Covergirl Star Wars Colorlicious Lipstick will be launching at drugstores this Fall (September 4th).

Granted there are some new, limited edition nail polishes but outside of that the entire display was a disappointing arrangement of past product releases. However, the new Covergirl Lipslicks Smoochies Sizzle Gloss I can’t say I’ve come across before. This past Summer, Covergirl relaunched their Lipslicks Smoochies Lip Balm with new colors, etc….and yes, they have had glosses like this new Sizzle Gloss in the past but this is new repackaged as to market to a younger demographic. Take a peek! Covergirl Lipslicks Smoochies Sizzle Gloss were $4.49 each at Harmons recently and displayed in the new Covergirl Hunger Games Collection. I imagine that the glosses are not LE and will get added to the permanent collection at some point after all the hype of the Hunger Game Collections dies down a bit. I haven’t personally run across the Sizzle Gloss before so it is apparently new but if you’ve seen it elsewhere do share. Earlier this Spring/Summer Covergirl redid the original Lipslick Collection by repackaging and renaming it to appeal to more youthful audience. The Covergirl Lipslicks Smoochies Sizzle Gloss gets the same treatment as this has funky packaging and a more younger edge that won’t necessarily appeal to those in their late 20’s/30’s and beyond. I purchased the shade Turn Up The Heat which is a sizzling orange sparkle. I really liked it and if they decide to add more colors to their general catalog I would indulge. It’s a heavier shiny gloss with a hydrating feel on lips and a glossy finish. It has a fruity flavor and scent that’s quite pleasant. The gloss has a shorter wear time of around two to three hours before needing a touch up. I liked it so much because it isn’t entirely sheer. The color in the tube is very true to application and it gives my lips a delightful slash of bright orange-y coral shimmer! It’s such a rarity that drugstore tube glosses like this have any pigment as typically they have a flavor and glossiness but no real color. Overall, this are worth a pick up if you like flavored glossy glosses with a nice bit of color. Turn Up the Heat is a lovely shade for Fall looks! Do like! Muse Approved. Available now at drugstores.

These eyeshadows seem very similiar to CG Eyeslicks but the colors are far more vibrant with shades like lime green and red! I purchased these at Harmons for $5.49 each and noticed the display had about ten shades available. I’m assuming Covergirl Flamed Out Shadow Pencils are being added to the general catalog at some point and aren’t LE. I think some of these new Summer 2013 launches from Covergirl are marketed towards a younger crowd. Let’s take a look! I admit I didn’t expect to love Covergirl Flamed Out Shadow Pencils and I didn’t but I didn’t hate them either. These are a chubby creamy shadow pencil well, maybe not completely chubby…..They are not a twist up design so a sharpener is required to keep the precise point. I’d liken them to a number of chubby pencils like NYX Jumbo Eye Pencils, etc… They have an incredibly vibrancy to them when swatched on my arm but applied on my eye they do tend to sheer out so building is required for the best color pay off. They have a creamy texture yet dense…I know hate to be confusing…but I wouldn’t liken the creaminess to better quality pencils like Bobbi Brown Long Wear Cream Shadow Sticks, Laura Mercier Caviar Sticks, etc…they just aren’t that creamy a texture but more of a lighter version. They blend easily enough but sheer out as you blend so building is required. Gold Flame Lime Green Red Hot Flame Lime Green Flame, Gold Flame, Red Hot Flame The fantastic part about them is they wore quite long on my drier eyes. Applied at around 6:30am they lasted beautifully until well after 8pm with very minor signs of wear but no issues with creasing. This was without primer too! I gotta admit they are a little pricey for what you get because there are brands, like NYX, who have these with a better formula, in a wider range of colors at a better price tag…but I had a hell of a good time with them. I purchased a gold, a lime green, and a red (which is more cranberry than red) and I spent the week mixing and cocktailing them coming up with all sorts of fun looks. Below isn’t a great representation of the red shade as I combined it with the gold to create this really great burnt orange sunset look! I used the gold and green in another look as well! And not posted here, I also used red on my inner eye and a little bit of black smudged into the outer v for a more sultry look! It just seemed so easy to blend shades together, something I’ve never really successfully tried with other shadow sticks! They just played really well with each other and other eyeshadows in my stash. Overall, Covergirl Flamed Out Shadow Pencils aren’t exactly a new or unique product nor are they a special formula. But some of the shades are worth picking up! I had fun with these if nothing else. I’d suggest grabbing them when they are on sale but not at retail prices….! Available now at drugstores. Tried ’em?

Covergirl Flamed Out Shadow Pots are available in twelve vibrant shades for Summer 2013 and I believe they will become a permanent part of the Covergirl Collection at some point. These are an interesting take for Covergirl as they are apparently marketed towards a younger girl with Pink being the model for the collection and the colors all being quite vibrant. The price point is quite nice as well at a mere $3.49 each at Harmons. I imagine once they hit CVS and Walgreens they won’t be as kindly priced but if you can snag them at under four bucks I’d say you got a bargain on your hands. How are they? Let’s take a look! Ok, so these are interesting. Flamed Out Shadow Pots do sound a little more exciting than they are. I dunno, Flamed Out, it sounds so dramatic eh? At first, I thought these were a mousse or a cream but they are actually single powder shadows. They have a little screw top with a black compact design. I’d say they are a little bigger than a US quarter. Each weights in at .07 oz in size. The package is a little flimsy so you have to be careful with them as they break easily and are quite delicate. I broke one simply on the way to and from the drugstore. The formula is also a little powdery so once you swipe a brush or applicator into them they end up breaking off chunks. Scorching Cocoa, Red Hot, Melted Caramel, Melted Gold One of my biggest complains about the packaging is the shades are not named. They do have a number on them and you can match that number on the website with a name however, the actual packaging lacks the name. WTH!? The texture is soft and velvety. They are powdery but not chalky in the least. They are most comparable to a lighter version of a Stila eyeshadow with that smooth, velvety texture that kinda feels almost creamy. Some shades have a little bit of chunky glitter in the mix but this isn’t very noticeable on lids. They apply best with sponge eyeshadow applicators as I feel like they kick up way too much powder with a regular brush. I also felt like the fall out was a pain when a regular brush was used. A swipe of sponge applicator seemed the best application technique for me and also allowed for the best color pay off. At a swatch they are sheerer but have a better pigmentation and color pay off on lids when build with a sponge. They apply sheerer using a regular shadow brush. They seem to have a fairly good wear on my drier lids at around six hours without creasing but losing some of their vibrancy at around hour four to five. With primer I got excellent all day wear but again, some of the intensity of the shade seemed to fade at around the fifth hour. Melted Caramel Melted Gold Red Hot Scorching Cocoa One thing that is nice about them is they make an excellent pair up with the new Flamed Out Shadow Pencils as you can use the pencils as a base and one of these on top. This creates a really killer eye look and the intensity is upped thanks to the vibrancy of the creamy shadow pencil as a base. As mentioned above I find they are very delicate. They seem to break off big chunks of shadow no matter what applicator you use. I would not recommend travel with these and be careful to not drop them as chances are they won’t survive a hit on your bathroom or bedroom floor. At $3.49 I can honestly say they were fairly nice eyeshadows. Nothing incredible here, if anything at all they kinda remind me of something I’d find in a massive NYX Palette or something of the sort. I’d recommend a purchase if you can find them at a fairly low cost. However, knowing drugstores and the way they jack up prices I would NOT recommend picking them up at $5-$6 each….that wouldn’t be money well spent. These are available at the moment in Walmart and Harmons but I imagine they’ll start working around the typical drugstores soon like CVS, Walgreens, etc…. If you tried them I’d love to hear your thoughts! You may also enjoy...

I’m not really sure why they needed to go here as we already have Lipslicks and I’m not seeing much difference in the two formulas. But this isn’t really the first product that Covergirl relaunched this season. Their new Creme Foundation and Shadow Pencils are also very similiar releases in new packaging. Shrug… However, if you like lip balms these might be worth exploring. Here’s my review and thoughts. Covergirl Lipslicks Smoochies are a conditioning tinted lip balm very similiar to Covergirl Lipslicks if not identical really. Perhaps what you get with Smoochies is a more modern, every so slightly reformulated and repackaged version of their Lipslicks, which really are still available on shelves as far as I know. Luv Bug, Luv U, Sweet Tweet I think the brighter packaging and the shade names (which include a hashtag) might be a big draw though especially for a younger girl, this on Covergirl’s part is excellent marketing. On lips they are just a touch thicker than the original formula but just a touch nothing you can obviously feel unless you’re really looking for it. They are a heavier balm-y texture and two of the three shades I purchased offered an opaque tint. Covergirl Lipslicks have always been a fairly nice product in my opinion and went a little above a regular old tinted lip balm and Smoochies pretty much delivers the same pigment and quality. They have a subtle fruity taste and smell that isn’t really terribly pleasant but it disappears fairly fast after applied. Although a balm I find they lack any great moisturizing benefits and my lips don’t feel particularly hydrating through the wear. I dislike how heavy they are as they are a lip product that make themselves known when worn. Wear time varies but I can get around three to four hours of color from them before they fade. Overall, I’m unsure if you need to indulge in Covergirl Lipslicks Smoochies if you already own a few Lipslicks shades. These are basically the same product and merely revised in packaging. They aren’t completely uneventful as they are a quick way to get nice color on lips with a high sheen finish however, I think they prove boring simply because Covergirl has done them before….Why the suddenly re-release of products you already have in your general catalog?!

This is a creamy foundation product in the vein of Covergirl TRUblend Whipped Foundation . Take a look! This comes in a smaller glass jar that houses 0.6 oz of the Clean Whipped Creme Foundation. I believe I paid $5.99 at Harmons but don’t quote me on that price. It’s available in an extensive array of shades so you should be able to find a suitable one for your tone. I selected 320 but it was a little too dark for me however, not nearly as bad as I imagined. It’s actually beautiful foundation. It’s rich, creamy, yet lightweight, breathable and easy to apply. It blends evenly, smoothly, and leaves behind fairly good coverage that can go from sheer to almost medium when built up but not quite full coverage. On my drier skin it has a smooth finish without accentuating flakier areas. I used primer prior for the smoothest finish but even application without produced an airbrushed effect. I’m unsure how oily skin will feel about it as it does dry down to a fairly matte finish but not so much so it’ll soak up excess oil. I also think it might be a little too rich if your pores easily clog or you suffer from blemishes or break outs. The deal breaker here is the wear time is terrible. It absorbs fairly quickly once applied and does not oxidize however, within an hour or two of application you’ll notice it completely wears away. I wear foundation to ease dullness and even out my complexion and I can see the dullness return to my skin within a fairly short time when wearing this so that in fact means it fades away very fast. I just didn’t feel like I even applied foundation after around 90 minutes of wear. Sigh. Oh well…! I actually felt their original formula had a thicker texture and better wear time. Covergirl Clean Whipped Creme Foundation is a pleasure to apply and has a very nice finish but the wear time is iffy on my drier skin. Tried it? Do share your mini review! You may also enjoy...

If you recall we got a few Covergirl Eyeshadow Palettes for Spring 2015 which I reviewed and absolutely loved as they have a slurry formula that quite reminds me of eyeshadows from Japan that you can get from brands like KATE , Visee , etc…! One of the more recent brands to embrace this style eyeshadow was Too Faced when they launched their The Return of Sexy Eyeshadow Palette for Fall 2012 . If you have this particular palette and love it you’re bound to adore the Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette. If you hate this palette, well, you’re likely not going to enjoy Covergirl’s formula. I personally love the texture, consistency, and formula of Japanese Eyeshadows as they have a creamy powder consistency that’s an absolutely joy to apply plus they look amazing on eyes. Let’s tale a look! Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette are a permanent part of Covergirl’s Collection come Spring 2016 and each will $11.49 with a range of eight eyeshadows. They come housed in a slim-line plastic case with a dual-sided sponge applicator for application on eyes. Covergirl’s Eye Shadow Quads are available in six shade selections and contain four shades each. I personally have two of these quads and I can see a few shades that looks similar to the one’s available in the Trunaked Palettes. Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette (Goldens) Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette (Goldens) Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Swatches (Goldens) Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Goldens) Covergirl RosesTrunaked Eyeshadow Palette (Roses) Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette (Roses) Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Roses) Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette Swatches (Roses) These are wonderful but not everyone will like them or agree with me on that. They have a soft, creamy texture that blend very easily and apply beautifully on lids. Although they do have some minor fall out during application. The consistency of the shadows is very soft, even softer than the formula of the quads, and almost has a hybrid-like feel that’s part cream, part powder. If you loved the Quads, you’ll love these Palettes. The buttery consistency of the shades is simply amazing, ’nuff said. The palettes each contain a mix of shimmery sparkly eyeshadows as well as mattes. There is absolutely no difference between the two finishes in regards to formula. They both have an incredible texture! I would suggest using the sponge applicator they come with to apply though as I always find it difficult to blend slurry eyeshadows like this with regular makeup brushes. It’s best to apply using the sponge eyeshadow applicator as you can pack color on way easier. According to the packaging these are “shades like a leading $50 eyeshadow palette” which I guess is a nod at Urban Decay Naked but honestly, I think it’s like comparing apples and oranges as these are nothing like what Urban Decay offers. None the less these still have a beautiful consistency and I absolutely loved them! Covergirl even took the time to list and name each shade in the back of the compact! Covergirl Goldens Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette Shades: Creme Chiffon Cookie Sunkissed Camel Ginger Ecru Sierra Covergirl Roses Truenaked Eyeshadow Palette Shades: Almond Champagne Baby Rose Gold Copper Rose Dusk Mauvegine Mousse All in all the Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette are incredible but as I said above you’re either going to love or hate this type of formula. Personally it was a love for me and I can’t wait to find the other shade selection at my drugstore. Covergirl Trunaked Eyeshadow Palette are available now at Harmons and should be launching everywhere else shortly! You may also enjoy...

Oh and concealer! Shimmer, sparkle, or glow of any kind should not be included in your concealer! It’s like putting a spotlight on your puffiness and fine lines. Thanks but no thanks! It’s one of the reasons I’ve been avoiding Amazing Concealer Illuminate ! I loved their new Hydrate Concealer but I’m deadly scared that the Illuminate will be all glow-y horror show on me. I’m waiting to see it when it pops into stores as I’m hoping I’ll be proved wrong! Foundations? Even worst. I have a round face and I always feel like glow-y foundations make my cheeks and face look plumper! But, strobing is a way of life lately so, L’Oreal Infallible Pro-Glow Foundation launches at the right time as everyone wants to get their glow as much as humanly possible. Available in 12 shades L’Oreal’s Infallible Pro-Glow Foundation promises up to 24 hours of hydrating coverage and glow. This lightweight, creamy foundation was created with dry skin in mine. It has medium coverage that provides perfecting foundation as well as an SPF 15 for sun protection. It’s arriving soon in drugstores but if you can’t wait Ulta.com has it right this very minute.

I’m in love….! I adore this formula. L’Occitane offers Pivoine Sublime Tinted Lip Balm in two shades selections and one transparent formula which is the one I’ll be reviewing for you today. Take a look! Love, love, love, love this formula! And yes, I know your mind well, you’re thinking, “We’ll do you love it more than Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment Balm !?” YES! I do. It’s cheaper, it has more sun protection, and it’s way more moisturizing. Of course, I sadly can’t speak for the tint factor as I only tried the transparent/clear formula but I hope to redeem that shortly as I’m going to go ahead and purchase the other two shades so expected updated information on that. This comes in a round metal barrel that has a twist on and off top. The barrel has some nice weight behind out giving the balm a very elegant feel and look. I love that you can twist the top off and twist it on snug as you won’t come off until you want it off. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve tossed a lip balm in my bag and the top comes off and I end up with a mess! This packaging is excellent for tossing into your bag and going without having to worry about this. I wouldn’t say this is a formula you’d love if you’re sensitive to fragrances or flavor in your lip balms. Personally, I love flavored balms so I thought it rather novel it has the same fragrance as L’Occitane’s Pivoine Flora fragrance! It’s a lovely peony scent with a subtle peony perfume flavor. I know, perfume flavors in lip balms don’t sound terribly appealing but I thought this had a rather nice sweet peony flavor! The best of the balm is definitely the moisture factor. This has a nice soft balm-y consistency that leaves lips feeling very soft. It’s one of those balms you can use under a matte lipstick to add a little moisture prior to application or something you want to tuck into your desk drawer to add a little hydration as the day progresses and your lips might feel a little drier. Add in an SPF 25 for sun protection and you have a very delightful lip balm. Well done L’Occitane! The Pivoine Sublime Tinted Lip Balm is a delightful and fancy little lip balm that I really enjoyed. I hope they keep these balms as part of their permanent collection and release new shades in the future. You can them now at L’Occitane Boutiques or pick them up online at usa.loccitane.com.

La Paz Pure Matte Lipstick is a shade that was released with the NARS Fall 2013 Collection . I wouldn’t typically purchase a shade like this for myself as 1. It’s matte and 2. It’s purple. As crazy as I am and I promise I’m crazy, I typically avoid skipping around the city in purple lipstick. In my experience, some people can rock the socks rock off a great shade of purple. I, however, am not one of those lucky few. But if you love orchid or purple NARS La Paz Pure Matte Lipstick might be your girl. I fell in love with NARS Pure Matte Lipstick when they launched the shade Montego Bay . I recall loving that shade hardcore! Now that I think about it I need to shop my stash for that color and pull it out for some looks. Later on Moscow came into my sweaty little palms and again I was surprised that I adore matte lipstick so very much. And finally Amsterdam ended up in my makeup bag and yet again I found myself adoring a matte lipstick. Too many times matte lipsticks look dry and are drying on my lips but Pure Matte Lipstick has always had a soft, velvet finish with full coverage that remained quite comfortable through the wear. NARS created their Pure Matte Formula with a soft, hydrating texture that applied fairly easily or at least in my experience that’s been the case. I can’t say the same for La Paz. This is a purplish berry shade with an opaque finish that has a good deal drier a texture than many of the Pure Mattes I’ve tried before. It has a gritty feel due to silver sparkle in the shade as well which by the way remains on lips well after color has faded. It tugged awfully on my lips on the first, second, and third stroke. It does offer opaque coverage with a goth-y purple sparkle finish. However, the drier texture is a deal breaker for myself and I’m sure many others. As much as I’d love to recommend La Paz as a must have I’d skip it unless you’re really hard pressed pressed to find purple shades of lipstick. The formula was just dreadful all around. No like! NARS Fall 2013 is on counters now. Anyone try the shade? How was your experience with it? Do share! You may also enjoy...

If you’re a fan of Sephora Luster Matte Long Wearing Lip Color I think you’ll really enjoy this set! Let’s take a look! The Sephora Minnie-ature Cream Lip Stain Set comes housed in a collectible black and gold polka tin case. Inside you’ll find five 0.10 oz Cream Lip Stains one of which has a tiny little Minnie ear charm wrapped around it. The little charm seems a standard feature across the entire collection. You can easily remove it and use it as a zipper pull or a phone charm. Sephora Cream Lip Stain is available in full size and some of the shades are available in in the permanent collection. The formula is kinda comparable to Sephora’s Luster Matte Long Wearing Lip Color but it’s a lot thinner in consistency but still has the same creamy consistency and full color pay off. I’m not sure why they call it a stain as for me it’s a liquid lipstick formula. It does apply patchy on drier lips but I noticed after testing it on dry lips and again, when my lips weren’t as dry they applied a lot more smoother. They are a bit drying on lips but I didn’t feel like there were sucking all the moisture from my lips. They wore comfortably for six hours without transferring or migrating and still remaining lightweight on my lips without losing color intensity. They do have some sort of fruity flavor and fragrance so if you’re sensitive beware. As they wear away I noticed no staining effect left behind. Sephora Minnie-ature Cream Lip Stain Set Swatches (Always Red, Whipped Blush, Mandarin Muse, African Violet, Peach Tart) Sephora Always Red Cream Lip Stain Sephora African Violet Cream Lip Stain Sephora Mandarin Muse Cream Lip Stain Sephora Whipped Blush Cream Lip Stain Sephora Peach Tart Cream Lip Stain I liked this set a lot and it made me want to purchase a few more of the full size Cream Lip Stains ! The fact that it is Minnie inspired is even better! For Disney, Minnie, and lipstick lovers alike this set is well worth a purchase.

This is a fabulous set if you love the Revolution Lipstick formula because it includes three limited edition shades exclusive to this set. But it’s also nice if as a gift for someone who hasn’t yet tried the Urban Decay Revolution Lipstick formula! The Urban Decay Full Frontal Lipstick Stash Set comes in a sturdy cardboard box that features six 0.035 miniature Revolution Lipsticks as well as a full size 24/7 Glide-On Lip Pencil in Ozone (transparent, clear lip liner). What makes the box special is of course, they three limited edition, exclusive shades which are Ladyflower (bright rose-pink), Crush (inspired by one of Urban Decay’s most-coveted Super-Saturated Lip Color shades) and Illicit (sheer baby pink). The three other shades are Gash , Liar, and F-Bomb. I think the set is a super value. You get six fabulous shades of Urban Revolution Lipstick and all are exactly spot on for the original formula. This deserves mentioning because sometimes the formula gets a little iffy on gift sets but there were absolutely no issues with this set. These are pigmented with full opaque color on a single application. The formula is creamy with a high sheen finish and a long wear of four to five hours. I will say the mini cases are a little hard to hold! They feel a little uncomfortable in my hand. Urban Decay Full Frontal Lipstick Stash Set Swatches (Crush, Illicit, Ladyflower, Liar, Gash, F-Bomb) Ozone is a welcome addition to this set as shades like Gash can migrate a little. This is a clear transparent liner that will keep your colors in place easily! Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Lip Pencil in Ozone All in all the Urban Decay Full Frontal Lipstick Stash is an excellent way to get MORE shades of Urban Decay Revolution Lipstick! If you don’t already have three of the permanent shades in this set you’re in luck! If you already do, well, you can always gift them away and just keep the exclusive shades. For those who never tried this lipstick formula now is your chance as it’s an excellent introduction set.

For lipstick lovers this is a very exciting launch as Urban Decay is renowned for creating pigment rich formulas. So those loving boldness and drama in there lipstick surely would reach for something Urban Decay produced right? Urban Decay Revolution Lipstick brings the drama but they also bring a certain elegance to this launch as well with wearable shades (no purple and blue lipstick here), beautiful yet practical packaging, and a creamy formula that’s sure to please. Take a look! For Fall 2008, Urban Decay launched their lipstick collection with a bang. At the time the packaging featured a rather lethal looking dagger poking out of the top of the lipstick, the barrel of the tube was chunky, and the floral motif surrounding the packaging was all UD wickedness. It was wonderful, it was edgy, it was fierce for 2008. Flash forward to 2013 and the package went from being incredible to a bit bulky and well, tired. As beauty lovers we evolve and what was new to us is now old news. We crave new beauty daily. So with much delight I loved that Urban Decay decided to revamp their entire lipstick line with a new formula and packaging! The original formula had a good deal of slickness to it and had a thinner consistency. The shades were pigmented but Urban Decay did take that up a notch with Revolution Lipstick. The old formula also sported a creme brulee/vanilla-like flavor and scent where as the new formula contains no fragrances or flavor. I think I’ll miss the high sheen finish, glossiness, and shimmer of the old formula as this newer formulation is very creamy with a cream finish and not a lot of the shades contain any shimmer or sparkle. Fact is, Urban Decay Lipstick grew up! This new formula is more mature, more wearable, and although it has that certain Urban Decay edge it’s also a very sophisticated lipstick. The lipsticks also now come in a slimmer case. If you weren’t a fan of the more goth-y edge of the original you’ll really love these new, more modern elegant cases. These are simple yet still lovely with a mirrored casing and the UD emblem on the top of each and Urban Decay printed on the barrel. Revolution Lipstick is grown up and with that maturity comes a new level of awesome. These are fiercely pigmented lipsticks with a creamy fully opaque pay off on a single stroke. None of the twenty-two shades I tried were lacking pigment in any way, shape, or form. They all bring it to the table. It isn’t exactly a lightweight lipstick but it is a comfortable one. I wouldn’t call it super hydrating but it isn’t dry either nor does it migrate. The colors are rich, deep, and bold and last a good five to six hours once applied. I don’t feel like they feather, move, or migrate around my mouth nor do they bleed or fade away and even when they do show some signs of wear you’re still left with a fairly good stain on lips. Some of the shades are a little tuggy to start but once they warm up they have a smooth, buttery glide across lips. I think some folks, especially those prone to drier lips, might feel the creamy formula is a tad dry but trust me, you need to apply it a few times to get the lipstick “warmed” up so to speak. After that it’s all smooth sailing. I don’t particularly like cream lipsticks but these impressed me and the great thing is with a little clear gloss on top I’m a happy camper. Like most things UD it’s really the pigment that impresses most here. They simply do not skimp on color whenever they do a product and Revolution Lipstick is no exception to the rule. 69 Anarchy Bang Catfight F-Bomb Fiend Jilted Liar Lovelight Rush Shame Strip Streak Turn On Venom Manic Naked 2 Naked Native Obsessed Protest Rapture 69, Anarchy, Bang, Catfight, F-Bomb Fiend, Jilted, Liar, Lovefight, Manic Protest, Naked, Naked 2, Native, Obsessed Rapture, Rush, Shame, Streak, Strip Turn On, Venom Overall, Urban Decay Revolution Lipstick is a winner. The pigment, packaging, formula, wear time, and sheer gorgeousness of these lipsticks is sure to please you. They do in fact gain a Muse Approval. Some of the shades are absolute must haves! I think you’ll love them as much as I do. Tried them already? Love to hear your thoughts! Do share! These are available now at UrbanDecay.com and launch soon at Sephora, Ulta, and Macys.

Being a rather fond fan of facial mists I was curious about this formula but unfortunately it addresses issues I don’t really have a problem with such as redness, larger pores, and oil. Let’s take a look! Urban Decay B6 Vitamin-Infused Complexion Prep Spray is formulated to be used prior to your skincare as a prepping mist or you can use it throughout the day if you like. Personally it is probably best suited to AM or PM use prior to applying any other skincare. Sprtiz it on, allow it to set, and follow up with other products you typically use in your skincare regime. The formula contains what Urban Decay dubs the first stabilized form of Vitamin B6. B6 is excellent for stressed out skin as it delivers better levels of oxygen to your skin which helps to reduce stress damage and prevents skin from producing oil which causes less breakout issues. There’s also Vitamin E in this and willow bark (natural form of salicylic acid). Unfortunately many of these ingredients aren’t really for my blemish-free, drier skin. The formula seems to address a more sensitive, oil-prone easy to break out skin type. It’s difficult to review something like this when it isn’t quite for my skin type so I’ll give you the basics of what I experienced using it. It has a fresh green scent that’s very pleasant. Once misted on it left my skin a tad tacky to the touch but not really hydrated. The tackiness disappears after several minutes and my skin felt a little tighter at the set. It does feel like it tingles slightly when I mist it on like I spritz something on my face that contained mint. One thing I do think deserves an important mention is you need to be sure to close your eyes very tightly when misting this on and also hold the bottle at least 8 or 10 inches away from your face. I suggest closing your eyes tight because it does cause a burning sensation even if you get a small amount in your eyes. This isn’t a fine mist so holding the bottle away from your face you’ll find that the mist is finer when applying plus you’re less likely to get much in your eyes this way. Unfortunately, I don’t have a ton to say outside of this about the spray. It didn’t really do much for me as I have drier, duller skin that’s not inclined to break out and my pores are not visible. I will say I thought the tingling/burning in my eyes was a bit unpleasant which made me dislike the product. This might be worth trying for those with larger pores and stressed skin that is prone to breakouts, redness, or has certain sensitivities. I wish I could tell you if it works on such a skin type but I only tested on myself and none of these issues are my own. If you’d like to try B6 Vitamin-Infused Complexion Prep Spray it is available now at UrbanDecay.com I’d love to hear your thoughts on this mist if you have tried it! You may also enjoy...

As a facial mist junkie I felt absolutely compelled and excited to try this but also a little wary because I disliked Urban Decay’s B6 Vitamin-Infused Complexion Prep Spray . It’s both an interesting and disappointing product. Urban Decay Quick Fix Hydra-Charged Complexion Prep Priming Spray is not the most hydrating facial mist I’ve ever tried. When you use Sana Hadanomy Collagen Mist you’ll find that nothing else quite compares to the hydrating benefits of that facial mist. The bad news? Urban Decay Quick Fix Hydra-Charged Complexion Prep Priming Spray isn’t a particularly perfect pick for drier skin types. The good news? It’ll be great for oily skin and drier skin types will grow to love it. So, here’s what goes down when you use this and here’s my recommendations for how you should use it. Urban Decay says it is inspired by the Korean water trend, yeah, but no. I don’t agree simply because Korean facial waters are a lot more hydrating than this formula. Urban Decay says this formula is even more hydrarting than their B6 Spray. Yeah, but no. B6 isn’t a formula I ever found truly hydrating and Quick Fix Hydra-Charged Complexion Prep Priming Spray is not more hydrating than that formula. Urban Decays says it softens and hydrates skin I say it softens but doesn’t really hydrate skin. It contains some very good for you ingredients like B3 and coconut water and apparently brightens your complexion as well as reduces the appearance of pores while hydrating. Let’s just say I disagree agree with most of the marketing hype but don’t worry I actually have good things to say about this. It took nearly a week but I finally figured out what it reminds me of right down to the fragrance. This actually works and smells identically to Herbivore Rose Hibiscus Coconut Water Hydrating Face Mist . Main difference is Herbivore’s formula doesn’t contain as many ingredients and happens to cost a buck more. So, here’s how I use it and how I think you’ll like using it if you have drier skin. I prep with it in the morning only. It’s the first step in my morning routine for the past week and I’ve grown to like it on many levels. For my it’s a dry facial mist, not drying, just it feels and sets to a demi-matte finish on my skin. Not a good thing for dry skin right? Not really but…it actually softens my skin a little bit but not necessarily by adding moisture. It also seems to eliminate any minimal shine or oil I have and my moisturizer seems to absorb a lot easier when I use this. My makeup also happens to look a lot fresher when I’m using this under it. Hmmm….am I imagining things? Possibly. It’s difficult to explain but it seems to cut the shine I see on my chin and forehead and also softens my skin in preparation for other skincare. Oily skin will like this as you’ll likely feel it cuts a little bit down on your shine and also won’t add unnecessary moisture to your skin that might result in shine or oil. I think it’ll prove a better pick for oily skin uses versus drier ones. It does have a very true, natural coconut scent that shouldn’t be an issue even for sensitive users. Would I repurchase it? Probably not. Urban Decay Quick Fix Hydra-Charged Complexion Prep Priming Spray will likely be a good pick for oily skin looking to prime skin for either other skincare or makeup without leaving behind oil or shine. Drier skin might find this is a good prep for skincare but won’t necessarily see moisturizing benefits from it. It’s an interesting product but like Urban Decay’s B6 Vitamin-Infused Complexion Prep Spray it isn’t a terribly groundbreaking, wow inducing facial spray. Urban Decay’s B6 Vitamin-Infused Complexion Prep Spray is available now at urbandecay.com and launches soon at sephora.com and ulta.com. Have you tried it? You may also enjoy...

Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray ($6) is a new permanent makeup setting spray that launched with the Hard Candy Spring/Summer 2015 Collection . Makeup setting sprays at the drugstore are a trending at the moment as L’Oreal released Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray a short time ago for Spring 2015. I’m a not a huge, huge lover of setting sprays. I love facial mists with a passion but actually setting my makeup with a mist kinda freaks me out. It makes me feel like I spent a ton of time on my makeup and I’m proceeding to mist myself with water right after. It’s a weird concept to me! But none the less they are very, very popular and makeup lovers adore them so I’m always willing to give them a try and see if they work for me. Up until now I’m not a huge fan but maybe, just maybe Hard Candy Fast &amp; Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray could change my mind. Hard Candy Fast &amp; Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray comes in a 2.2 oz so it is a budget option compared to products like NYX Long Lasting Makeup Setting Spray which is 2.02 oz in size at $8, Urban Decay Setting Sprays at $30 for 4 oz, and L’Oreal Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray at $17.99. Out of many makeup spray options, Hard Candy does win the budget friendly award coming in at a mere $6 bucks. Hard Candy Fast &amp; Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray doesn’t have a ton of the same ingredients as many setting sprays I own and have used in the past. It does in fact contain alcohol which isn’t a fab ingredient in skincare but it isn’t drying of that’s your main concern. It does contain Ethanol (listed as SD Alcohol 40-B on the ingredients) and this is typically an alcohol that is drying but I didn’t experience any issues. Sensitive skin might be averse to Ethanol so you want to be careful here. Ingredients aside, the spray actually does work fairly well! I spray it in an X on my face after I’ve applied all my makeup (blush, foundation, etc..full face). It sets quickly but I hate, hate, hate how it intensifies the look of my blush and just makes my makeup look wet. However, it does dry down and sets very quickly so that little weird issues disappears quickly enough. It doesn’t tighten it doesn’t nor does it leave behind a film. My foundation lasts anywhere from six to seven hours depending on what I use. For example BB Creams wear for a good seven hours on me, some of my favorite foundations like Shiseido Perfect Refining Foundation I can get a nice five to six hours from, other foundations I own are sometimes shorter at four hours. I decided to wear it with one of my foundations that wore the shortest time to see how it would hold up with this. I also purposely wore a concealer that faded quickly as well. I sprayed it once in an X motion on my face and once again straight down my face from the middle of my forehead right down to my chin in a quick burst. I gave in a few seconds to allow it to set and headed out for the day. It did great! My foundation looked fresh through a seven hour period, my concealer looked excellent, my blush remained vibrant, my makeup looked as good as it did the first time I applied it! I mean sure, I looked a little tired at the end of the day but my makeup still looked nice. I’ve used it a few times last week and was happy with the results each time. I STILL dislike the fact it makes me look like I was caught in the rain on the initial mist but after the set my makeup looks fine again! One warning for those sensitive users as it does have a cucumber fragrance. It isn’t super strong but it is there! All in all for six bucks it performs quite good! I was impressed and makeup setting sprays are something that fail to impressed me. Hard Candy Fast &amp; Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray is available now exclusively at Walmart and Walmart.com.

I happen to be a rather big fan of Hard Candy Fast &amp; Fabulous 12 Hour Long-Wear Face Primer which why I thought I’d give Hard Candy Sheer Envy Pore-Defense Primer Serum a test out for Summer as maybe I’d like it for taming mild shine and oil that I tend to get in the warmer weather. I went into this purchase knowing I likely would not be able to use this formula right now since my skin is terribly dry. However, I tested it out none the less and realize it’s better suited to drier skin than oily. Hard Candy Sheer Envy Pore-Defense Primer Serum comes housed in a 1.5 oz pump bottle. I think they kind of sort of want to market this as a hybrid formula that’s part primer and part skincare and the packaging also gives it that feel. This is a water-based formula nad you can very much feel that on the application as it is very moist. It absorbs easily into my drier skin and leaves behind a soft, smooth, dewy finish. I found this rather ironic considering it’s supposed to be a primer that controls oil and shine. But none the less it worked great with my drier skin and set a nice base for foundation to adhere to. It also extended the wear of my foundation nicely by about two hours. I noticed no fragrance during application. I don’t have visible pores on my face but do have smaller visible pores around my nose. I wouldn’t say this filled or blurred those pores, unfortunately. Hard Candy Sheer Envy Pore-Defense Primer Serum is a rather confusing product. They might want to remarket this for drier skin versus oily. I thought it highly moisturizing and an excellent base for drier skin that needs a smooth, softened base to apply foundation. It’ll work nicely as a lightweight moisturizer to if you want to multitask with it. I wouldn’t rule it out completely for oily skin, but those purchasing in the hopes it’ll curb shine and oil while blurring pores will likely be disappointed with the outcome. Hard Candy Sheer Envy Pore-Defense Primer Serum is available now exclusively at Walmart and Walmart.com. P.S. We don’t have to rehash the trainwreck that was BvS but this video that’s circulating is too funny! The good news? We have JL #50 to look forward to in May! Happy Monday everyone!

Hard Candy Sheer Envy Hydrating Primer Mist is one of many primer slash makeup setting sprays to launch this season. I find many of the formulas are one trick ponies and in this case I do believe that Hard Candy’s formula performs one particular task best and is a bit wishy-washy with the others. Here’s the deal! Hard Candy Sheer Envy Hydrating Primer Mist is a water and glycerin based formula which is exactly why it is so hydrating. Personally my dry skin loves it but I would avoid it if you have combination or oily skin as it does tend to make skin tacky and dewy to the touch which, in my opinion, is not something oily skin will love. I typically mist this on prior to applying my moisturizer in both the AM and PM. It allows my moisturizer to absorb easily into my skin plus it provides plenty of moisture all its own. Honestly, if I wanted to I could easily get away with this as a lightweight moisturizer of sorts as it leaves my skin plush and dewy to the touch. I wouldn’t say it provided 12 straight hours of moisture but it did leave my skin feeling quite moist for a few hours after use. I wouldn’t say it preps well for makeup without some leg work. I think misting it on and simply following up with makeup isn’t way the way to go because it leaves my skin a little too dewy and sticky. I typically apply it, followed by my moisturizer, and finally followed by face primer to curb the dewy finish it leaves behind before applying my foundation as a last step. Honestly, I prefer using it after my shower and letting it kinda dry down a bit before I even attempt putting anything else on top of it. The moisture benefits are here but they tend to be a bit sticky and dewy and might not be comfortable at all to those who don’t have drier skin. As a refresher or a setting spray I’d say it was a no go. Using this after makeup or even in the day to freshen up makeup is a bad idea. It tends to leave me quite sticky and moist which results in a shiny, oily finish on my face even though I’m far from oily. Hard Candy Sheer Envy Hydrating Primer Mist is a nice face mist but I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a primer or even a setting mist. It adds a ton of moisture but it also adds a good deal of dewiness and tackiness which isn’t always a great look for heading out in.

This is the first drugstore makeup setting I’ve ever seen so you could say L’Oreal is a pioneer here launching such a unique item to drugstore makeup fans. Although most have relied on Skindinavia for years and more recently Urban Decay Setting Sprays, I’d say that L’Oreal Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray opens some new doors in the drugstore makeup world. Let’s take a look! I purchased my L’Oreal Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray at Bed, Bath, and Beyond for $13.79. Bed, Bath, and Beyond has coupons constantly so you’ll save a little change on this if you happen to have one. I’ve read a few reader’s had purchased it at CVS for $16 to $17.99 and I am not surprised. I had a funny feeling once it hit mass retailers such as Walgreens and CVS the price would be considerably higher. I have mixed feelings about a $17.99 drugstore makeup setting spray. On one hand, you’ll likely never pay that much courtesy coupons and a variety of sales that many drugstores have. On the other hand, what if there aren’t coupons when you want to purchase or no sale at that time? In that case your $18 might be best used towards Urban Decay or Skindinavia….the price is highly debatable and sure to be a hot topic. L’Oreal Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray is marketed as a makeup setting spray to be used after makeup application to extend the wear of makeup and give it a long lasting finish. I picked Skindinavia Original Makeup Finishing Spray to compare L’Oreal Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray ingredients to. Skindinavia Original Makeup Finishing Spray ingredients: Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat, PVP, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Ethylhexyl Isononanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Sodium Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Dimethicone PEG-7 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, PPG-3 Benzyl Ether Myristate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Glycereth-5 Lactate, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance (Parfum), Methyl Diisopropyl Propionamide, Poloxamer 407. L’Oreal Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray ingredients: Many of the ingredients are the same but L’Oreal’s version has a few more including silicones. Skindinavia comes in a 4oz bottle and L’Oreal a 3.4oz bottle. The difference in price is considerable if you’re purchasing L’Oreal’s version at Harmons or Bed, Bath, and Beyond as Skindinavia is $29 versus the rounded off retail price of L’Oreal’s verison at $14. If you head to mass drugstore retailers this is a bit smaller with $29 versus around $16 to $18 but either way you’re saving a bit of money. This comes in a rubberized bottle so it does pick up grime super fast. Just a warning! There’s a small instructionional card attached to the bottle which explains how to do the infamous X and T motion to apply. I actually never knew about the correct method of makeup setting spray until Urban Decay did a video and since viewing it I’ve used the X and T method because I feel less “wet” when applying this way. I’m typically bothered by makeup setting sprays because I always feel like I’m removing my makeup….who wants to do all their makeup and proceed to mist themselves down after?! It feels pointless to me. I’ve gotten used to it somewhat but I actually rarely use makeup setting sprays and I’ll tell you why in a second. I will say this is a fine mist so I’m not too moist or wet after I use it. However, it does take a second to set so my face remains wet and kinda slick looking until it dries down within several minutes. It has a fresh subtle scent and doesn’t leave my skin sticky or tacky or tight. I use liquid, cream, BB Cream, CC Creams, etc…I personally think makeup setting sprays are not meant for use with liquid or cream foundations. They do nothing to extend the wear of my cream or liquid foundation nor my color cosmetics. I have dry skin so I prefer cream foundation therefore it’s rare I use a makeup setting spray. Whether it’s L’Oreal Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray, Skindinavia, or Urban Decay I feel like none work for me when I’m using cream foundations. I do not see an extension in the wear of makeup and heck I even feel I kinda ruin my makeup when I mist after application. On a positive note I think on occasions when I do wear a mineral or a powder foundation I have some success with makeup setting sprays. Misting after powder foundation refines the finish of the powder. The mist gives it a soft focused finish and should you experience issues with the powder clinging to areas the mist will help loosen up and refine the finish of those areas so your makeup looks more smoother. It’s a handy tool to have around. I’ve had good success with it extending my powder foundation wear as well, mostly I like Urban Decay’s Oil Slick Makeup Setting Spray because it keeps my foundation wearing long and also minimizes the shine on my forehead. L’Oreal Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray? Not as great I fear. I used it for nearly a week with my beloved (and almost gone) Lancome Oscillation Power Foundation and I didn’t really see a major difference in the length and wear of my foundation. If I use Urban Decay’s Oil Slick I can typically get around two to three hours of extended wear with L’Oreal’s version I don’t see that in the least! I think L’Oreal Infallible Makeup Extender Setting Spray might be something you’ll want to try for yourself not only for curiosity’s sake but also because it’ll perform differently on a variety of skin types. Personally, I didn’t really see any extended wear using it but who knows you might just love it? For me, I’ll stick to using Urban Decay Oil Slick Makeup Setting Sprays on the rare occasions I do wear powder foundation.

Honestly, scoring $5 buck lipstick with a great formula is a rarity in my humblest opinion so count me shocked and delighted by the texture, wear, and pigment that Hard Candy Plumping Serum Lipstick brings to the table. Yes, you need it! Hard Candy Plumping Serum Lipstick Swatches (Admired and Victorious) Hard Candy Plumping Serum Lipstick comes packaging in a mirrored barrel featuring a see through window displaying the color located on the top of the tube. Each lipstick weights in at 0.11 oz in size. The packaging has a nice weight behind it giving the look and feel of a mid-range lipstick! It also isn’t as bad a magnetic for fingerprints as I thought it would be. The Plumping Gel Sticks Lipstick is apparently a plumping formula infused with mango butter that has a cushiony feel on lips courtesy a gel formula. A plumping agent adds volume to lips and diffuses the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles supposedly. No worries, this isn’t injected with cinnamon or anything else! I hear plumping and automatically assume that it’s going to taste like a stick of Big Red gum but this has absolutely no flavor or fragrance nor does it sting or give lips a bitten feel. I actually didn’t experience the plumping effect but none the less adored the formula. Hard Candy Admired Plumping Serum Lipstick Hard Candy Victorious Plumping Serum Lipstick I’d liken the texture to a creamier version of Tarte Amazonian Butter Lipstick and dare I say as much as I love Tarte’s formula, Hard Candy’s is even better! These have a light, creamy texture that glides onto lips easily without a skip! My lips are prone to dryness but these have a smooth, even application and finish. The texture is lightly creamy and weightless on lips. They don’t migrate or feather through the four hour wear time and they keep my lips very, very pleasantly moist and softened through that wear. The finish is cream but has a very slight shine that makes them appear fresh and moist even on my dry lips. Pigmentation is beautiful! I tried two of the several shades that have available and both shades applied opaque on a single pass. I can’t believe I paid $5 for lipstick this good! All in all Hard Candy Plumping Serum Lipstick put together a fabulously budget friendly lipstick that’s a pure pleasure to wear! The quality here rivals a lipstick that you may pay $20 or more for. It’s light, creamy, hydrating, and packs a nice bit of pigment. What more could a girl want? Loves it! Hard Candy Plumping Serum Lipstick is available now at Walmart and Walmart.com.

L’Oreal has launched a selection of Infallible Eye Crayons which are a new cream eyeshadow pencil that can be used to shade and line with! This is a risky move because cream eyeshadow pencils are a dime a dozen from brands like NYX and Rimmel. Are L’Oreal Infallible Eye Crayon worth your time? L’Oreal Infallible Eye Crayon will likely get a big push for Spring 2015. At the moment I’ve seen them at Bed, Bath, and Beyond for $6.99 each but I have a feeling they’ll be around the $10 mark at CVS and Walgreens or even more. L’Oreal Infallible Eye Crayon Swatches (Resilient Green, Forever Taupe, Everlasting Gold, Impressive Brown, Always Aqua, Midnight Charcoal, Always Purple, Enduring Rose) Is there anything different, special, or unique about these when comparing them to NYX Jumbo Eye Pencils or Rimmel Scandaleyes Shadow Stick ? Yeah, mainly, the price. NYX Jumbo Pencils are $4.50 each and Scandaleyes Shadow Sticks are $3.79 to $4. If I’m right about the pricing on L’Oreal Infallible Eye Crayons going up when they reach more mass drugstore retailers you’re likely looking around a $5 to $6 price jump compared to the cheaper Rimmel and NYX formula. So for $10 bucks you can get nearly three shades of Rimmel Shadow Sticks or at the least two NYX Eye Pencils versus one L’Oreal Infallible Eye Crayon. Ouch. And I haven’t even compared sizes. L’Oreal gives you 0.10 oz, Rimmel gives you 0.2oz, and NYX gives you 0.15 oz. So….we haven’t touched on the formula and already L’Oreal Infallible Eye Crayons seem like a not so great purchase. I’ll also say that many of the shades in the eight color permanent collection from this launch are all very dupeable. There aren’t any really unique shades here and all eight colors can easily be located in the NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil catalog. Strike 2 L’Oreal, another one and you might be out of this game. The formula is a lot like Bobbi Brown Long Wear Cream Shadow Sticks for me in terms of texture but it also happens to have almost an identical formula as Milani Shadow Eyez Eyeshadow Pencils as well as Rimmel Scandaleyes Shadow Sticks. The creaminess, the slick, easy glide formula, and the ease of blendability is most like Bobbi Brown, Milani, and Rimmel’s formula and texture. I think they are considerably slicker and creamier in texture than shadow sticks like NYX Jumbo Eye Pencils and Covergirl Flamed Out Eyeshadow Pencils . L’Oreal Midnight Charcoal Infallible Eye Crayon L’Oreal Impressive Brown Infallible Eye Crayon L’Oreal Enduring Rose Infallible Eye Crayon L’Oreal Always Aqua Infallible Eye Crayon L’Oreal Resilient Green Infallible Eye Crayon L’Oreal Always Purple Infallible Eye Crayon L’Oreal Everlasting Gold Infallible Eye Crayon L’Oreal Forever Taupe Infallible Eye Crayon I have no problems with the formula. It glides on beautifully, never tugs, and has a nice slick creaminess. I do however, experience issues with blending. These sheer out considerably once applied so you have to build a good deal to get colors to look as intense as they do when swatched. During the initial application they apply very opaque and very vibrant on my lid but as I blend them out they sheer out considerably and the color ends up looking very faded. So…I have to go back and add at least three more layers sometimes four to see the intensity and vibrancy you’ll see in my pictures above. They don’t set quickly so building isn’t a problem but I feel like I make quite a mess during the blending process. Eyeshadow pencils are supposed to be a snap to use and not as complicated as a powder. Swipe, blend, go. Unfortunately, I felt like I was doing a lot of extra blending so the colors looked just right and in this I ended up with shadow everywhere…my fingers, the side of my eyes, and on upper cheeks. I dunno what was going on but the color seemed to be transferring all over the damn place as I blended. I ended up using a flat cream shadow brush to swipe across my eyes as I blended to avoid the mess. When they did finally set (about a minute) they had a fairly good wear of around six hours. The color did not fade during this time but around hour 7 I noticed considerably creasing right across my lid. This is easy enough to fix as a quick pat blended the issue away. However, if you have oily lids I kinda suspect these won’t set for the 24 hour wear that L’Oreal promises. There’s a moral in every beauty story and the moral is don’t fix what’s not broken. There are too many brands that have already paved the way for cheap, inexpensive, and well formulated eyeshadow pencils. If you had plans to introduce a shadow pencil you should have had a more unique shade selection, a competitive price, and a formula that rocked my socks off because there are too many brands that already have so your formula should do something even more amazing. Unfortunately, L’Oreal Infallible Eye Crayon are too expensive and not formulated in a way I can rave them. Milani, NYX, Rimmel, they’ve all done it better and for cheaper. Sorry L’Oreal.

I’ve been wearing them this week and testing them out so I thought I’d finally review them today! I love how creamy these are and I ended up purchasing a few back ups when they ended up popping up online. Here are my thoughts! Milani Shadow Eyez 12 HR Wear Eyeshadow Pencil aren’t a new product as they launched in Summer 2012 as I recall. However, Milani Naturally Chic Collection is a range of six natural, nude colors that are available for a limited time exclusively at Walgreens, HEB, and Fred Meyer or online www.milanicosmetics.com . Black Ink, Espresso Line, Cafe Au Lait Almond Cream, Sand Dunes, Golden Bronze I think part of the appeal of this collection is the shades are not only Summer friendly but ideal for those of us who prefer a more nude, natural eye look. The original collection included more vibrant shades of color so if you lean towards more subtle colors Naturally Chic is the Collection for you! One of the start in this collection is Almond Cream (so much so I purchased two back ups). This is a shade that is equivalent to colors like Bobbi Brown Vanilla or MAC Bare Study. It’s a solid shade of matte creamy beige which makes for an excellent all over color wash to brighten eyes up or to act as a base for pigments and shadows. It creates a perfect base to add vibrancy and intensity to all of your color shadows or works incredibly all its own for a nude eye look! It’s well worth picking up! The collection includes four matte shadows and two metallic. Considering the original release is lacking in mattes this is an exciting launch for those who favor the finish. One of the only colors that I felt like I didn’t need was Black Ink since I have a ton of black pencils but you might care to pick it up if you do a smoky eye often. These are far more creamier, especially the mattes, than the original shades. They do not tug or pull during application and have a creamy, dreamy formula that applies and blends very easily. I think the metallic ones are a little drier compared to the matte but they still apply perfectly. The mattes have a slower dry down time so you have plenty of time to blend and play around before they set. The metallic are a little quicker to dry down so you’ll want to blend quickly for the best results. Once set they do not crease or fade on me and wear a solid eight hours without primer under them. I have a drier eye area so just take that into consideration when purchasing. If you do have an oily lid just make sure you apply primer and powder on your entire lid to absorb excess oil before application. Espresso Line Golden Bronze Sand Dunes Almond Cream Black Ink Cafe au Lait Black Ink, Espresso Line, Cafe Au Lait, Almond Cream, Sand Dunes, Golden Bronze Pigmentation varies from pencil to pencil but five of the six shades all have excellent color pay off. The only shade that runs a bit sheerer would be Sand Dunes, this shade is disappointing as it isn’t as true as the swatch you see on my arm and has a more subtle color on my lids. I think both Sand Dunes and Golden Bronze come across very frosty on my lids as well so pay proper care when blending to avoid this. You can use the pencils to line with as well but I always find chubby pencils are challenging to use as an eyeliner so I think they are best suited to use as an all over eyeshadow. Overall, some of these shades are stunning and well worth picking up at this price. They have excellent pigmentation, ease of application, and very good wear time without fading or creasing. The Naturally Chic selection of colors are a welcome addition to my collection, I just wish they weren’t available for a limited time! Hopefully Milani decides to move them to the permanent collection come Fall. I didn’t compare these to my Urban Decay Pencils so I’m unsure if any are dupes for those shades. I know many of you purchased them already! I’d love to hear your thoughts! And fav shades! Do share! You may also enjoy...

Oh Rimmel you outdid yourself with these! Three out of the four shades are matte in finish and well worth a back up! I picked up Trespassing Taupe and I had a moment of, “OMG Why didn’t I get a backup!?” I think it set me back $2.79 at Harmons after I used a $1 off coupon that was attached to the display. It’s a shade I’ll easily use in simple, daily looks to get a wash of taupe-y goodness on my eyes for quick yet really pretty eyes. Let’s take a look! Rimmel ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Sticks are chubby little cream eyeshadow sticks that you can use for all over shading or as a liner and definer. They have a soft, creamy texture that blends easily onto lids without tugging. The texture is quite lovely and isn’t stiff or dry plus it wears very well on my drier eyes without creasing or fading for about seven hours! I have several shades I own already as these are available in a range of permanent colors! Rimmel ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Sticks Swatches (Limited Edition Shades) (Gold Digger and Trespassing Taupe) I was delighted to discover the Holiday 2014 shade selections recently at Harmons. I thought the matte brown and black were a little ho-hum but I did grab up Trespassing Taupe which is a smokey brownish taupe that’s matte in finish. This is really a color I love on my lids as it adds just the right smokiness but isn’t so overkill that it accentuates my finer lines or dark circles. Another shade I purchased was Gold Digger. Out of the four shades Gold Digger is the only shimmery shade. This is a sparkly buttery gold. This is one of those festive shades of gold that wears easily and if you want can be paired up with either brown or red for a more festive eye look! Rimmel Gold Digger ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Stick As nice as Gold Digger is I thought the real winner here was the delightfully matte and easy to use Trespassing in Taupe! It’s a keeper for those wanting a quick yet elegant smoked out eye! Rimmel Trespassing Taupe ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Stick Needless to say both Rimmel ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Sticks limited edition shades are a winner! Not only easy on the wallet this creamy formula applies easily, wears well, and makes for some great eye looks! Keep your eyes out for the Rimmel Rockin’ Around ScandalEyes Collection for Holiday 2014 at drugstores soon! You may also enjoy...

I already featured two other shades in a post I did last week and I was so impressed with those I decided to go back for backups and in the process picked up the colors I didn’t get! At a glance, I had thought the two other shades in this collection were a matte brown and a matte black. Turns out it’s a matte navy blue and a matte brown duh! My eyes do deceive me. I honestly have plenty of brown eyeliners, eyeshadows, etc but the ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Stick formula impressed me so I thought eh, why not grab it. Each pencil was $2.79 after using a coupon for a $1 off that was located on the display at Harmons. Rimmel Bootleg Brown ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Stick Swatches Rimmel Bootleg Brown ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Stick is a dark bark chocolate brown with a matte finish. It’s a actually a fab color for wearing sheered out or built for intensity or under your favorite brown eyeshadows as a base. The texture is super creamy and easy to blend and the chunky shadow stick doubles up as a color you can either shade with or line eyes with. On my drier eyes I find the color stays in place for up to eight hours and removes easily at the end of the night with eye makeup remover. The shade is quite versatile. At first it was just a bit meh to me and on some levels it still is because it’s a basic rich brown of which I have many of already. But the nice thing about the color is it multitasks as an all over shadow shade or it can be sheered out for a smokier look and of course, if you’d like to add intensity brown powder shadows in your stash using this as a base prior can really create an intense eye look! Do you need it? Maybe not if you already have a ton of browns in your stash but at this price I can’t deny Rimmel Bootleg Brown ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Stick is a lovely matte shade that works in any number of looks!

How many ScandalEyes Mascaras do we have at this point? I’ve lost count! The big difference and draw with the Rimmel Rockin’ Curves ScandalEyes Mascara formula is a new “first ever” broken heart shaped brush that’s supposed to create big, curvy, “rockin” lashes due to the cleverly designed application that twists and curves around lashes. Take a look! If I’m honest the Rimmel Rockin’ Curves ScandalEyes Mascara brush looks cool but actually makes a bit of a mess if you’re going to be twisting and turning it as you apply. This brush proves a little difficult to use as it doesn’t exactly fit the contour of your lash line in a conventional manner which for me means a clumpy, uni-lash looking finish. I had a little bit of a learning curve for the brush! Maybe I’m getting old. Finally after getting comfortable with it I was finally able to apply the mascara without have my lashes clump together. The formula seems pretty standard and pretty much like any of the ScandalEyes Mascaras I’ve tried in the past. No crunchy, stuff lashes, and a nice fringe of more natural looking lashes since the brush distributes a really light coating of mascara on lashes. It’s probably not going to win any awards for curling, lifting, or creating super long lashes. It does give my lashes some volume but not enough to get me excited! Unfortunately Rimmel Rockin’ Curves ScandalEyes Mascara has an awkward brush that doesn’t really work to lift, lengthen, or curl my lashes. After a brief learning period I was able to get some volume and a more natural fringe of lashes but nothing as dramatic as what the new “broken heart” brush promised.

Naughty Navy is actually a shade I originally thought was black when I saw the Holiday display but my reader/friend Christina said, “Hey, it’s not black it’s blue!” so I quickly went back to grab it up. Naughty Navy is actually permanent though! There are two limited edition shades in this collection which I’ve already featured reviews and swatches for but if you own a lot of Rimmel ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Sticks already just check your stash and be sure you don’t already have this shade prior to a pick up as it’s simply repromoted. I didn’t have it so I went ahead and indulged! Rimmel Naughty Navy ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Stick isn’t a shade I’d typically navigate to. This is a matte, creamy navy blue that’s quite dark. I dislike darker shades on my drier, finely lined eyes and I tend to avoid them because they accentuate my problem areas. However, I love pairing up blue with gold and I just happen to have purchased the Rimmel Gold Digger ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Stick and Naughty Navy went perfect with it! I used it below on the outer corner of my eye with Gold Digger all over the lid. It’s a really nice dark navy and I always feel like navy goes great with gold so there you have it. Rimmel Naughty Navy ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Stick Rimmel Naughty Navy ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Stick Swatches This formula is divine. It’s creamy, easy to apply, and it doesn’t set super quickly so I have plenty of time to play around with it and get blended just the way I want before it dries down. It wears quite strongly on my drier eyes without fading or creasing! I love quick swipe and blend products and I think the ScandalEyes formula def has that down right. If you’re a cream shadow formula I’m positive you’ll love this formula. And for those new to the formula this repromote is a great way to catch your attention at the drugstore as you might not have tried the sticks before! I located the Rimmel ScandalEyes Eyeshadow Sticks in both the limited edition and repromoted Naughty Navy shade at my local Harmons. You may also enjoy...

the best mascara every? If you said Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes you’d be right! And better still is Tarte repromoting it for Summer 2014 in a waterproof formula. Ok, well, they always have Lights, Camera, Splashes hanging around but for Summer 2014 it does come in a limited edition packaging. And hey, if you never tried it here’s your chance to do so. I’d like to make a note and tell Maureen please when you reintroduce this next Summer I’d like to see some LE packaging that’s NOT limited to the outer packaging girl! I’ll likely not toss this cute festive little box but I wouldn’t mind if the box packaging matched up with the mascara tube’s design too. Just sayin’! I’ve actually stopped looking for my HG (holy grail) mascara because I’ve found it. Holy cow…shifty eyes…did I just say that?! No…the hunt is the fun part! I sometimes secretly hope I’ll NEVER find my HG products so I can continue to buy more makeup and try out new products. The hunt is the fun part. And the whining about how, “oh this is good but not HG material” is the second fun part haha! No but seriously, aside from Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes and It Cosmetics Tightline Full Lash Length Black Mascara Primer I don’t really need anything else in my mascara loving life. This is pretty basic mascara…regular old straight line brush, lightweight formula, doesn’t make my lashes terribly stiff or crunchy…! There’s really nothing amazing here but for some reason it WORKS and it WORKS well. It pulls my lashes up and out giving them GREAT length. Perhaps not a ton of volume but I’m not complaining because the length acts to give my lashes a fuller, longer look. Do like! Now the regular formula works a treat for me but when Summer comes I switch it out for the Splashes formula to ensure it wears long and strong. I rarely have an issue with either the regular or Splash formula in regards to flaking, smudging, or smearing! Plus it removes easily at the end of a long hard day. Loves this stuff. It is and remains one of my favorite mascaras. The limited edition Tarte Lights, Camera, Splashes Mascara packaging will be available at Sephora, Sephora.com , Ulta, Ulta.com , and online at tartecosmetics.com. P.S. Don’t forget Tarte is 20% Off this week! Do you use it? What are your thoughts? Do share! You may also enjoy...

I Like!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.musingsofamuse.com/2016/06/it-cosmetics-sunshine-compact-review-swatches.html</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>I am surprised to say that It Cosmetics Sunshine In a Compact works a treat for me. I know right? Shade seeker I am , I’m amazed I actually like a bronzer for once. This is a complete matte bronzer so, shimmer and sparkle haters rejoice! I actually like radiant or shimmery bronzers myself because they always seem a touch more wearable to me but I’m slowly realizing that less is more when applying a ton of shimmery bronzer on your face. It Cosmetics Sunshine In a Compact ($34) is a talc-free matte bronzer that apparently contains Drops of Light Technology that adds radiance without glitter or shimmer. Uhhh yeah, I can’t really say I noticed anything radiant about the finish here but I will say this is a dense yet easy to blend powder bronzer that looks very, very good on my skin. In the pan, I think it looks a bit too orange-y tan but it actually applies with just the right amount of warmth on my cheeks and face. I think the reason I like it is the fact it looks very smooth and natural on my skin without making me look orange or dull. The density of the powdery allows me to apply just the right amount and it can’t be overdone even when you’re as heavy handed as I am. Add to the fact that the powder doesn’t cling to my drier areas and has an incredibly smooth, second-skin finish! If you’re looking for a touch of warmth but not the orange or dullness that bronzers typically bring with them, I think you’ll really enjoy It Cosmetics Sunshine in a Compact as it’s as natural a tan as you’d get from standing out in the sunshine!

I’ve used a lot of Japanese sunscreens over the years but three featured in this post are ones I come to back to again and again and again because I love how well they perform, how great they look and feel under makeup, and how fabulous the formula is. Unfortunately, the US market hasn’t quite caught up to the Japanese one when it comes to creating lightweight, easy to absorb SPF formulas. I truly believe the Japanese excel at this which is one of the reason I purchase sunscreen products from Japan. They also happen to be affordable picks as well! Let’s take a look! Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ This is by far one of my favorite gel based SPF sunscreens! This is actually promoted to “apply like water” and can be used on both your face and body. The texture is that of a gel and absorbs into skin so easily without leaving behind a heavy, sticky feel. There is not pastiness or chalky finish with this product and it leaves skin feeling quite hydrated. It’s unfortunately not waterproof nor a particularly good choice if you prefer a more matte SPF. It was actually discontinued last year but recently became available again in new packaging and reformulated to meet Japanese SPF standards plus, as pictured on the left, it now comes in a limited rose fragrance formula (the original has a subtle citrus scent). Biore UV AQUA Rich Watery Mousse SPF 50+ PA++++ This is actually just as lovely as the Watery Essence formula (although I like the Watery Essence a bit better) with a mousse-like texture that absorbs equally easily into the skin and features hyaluronic acid that adds moisture and helps retain it. The texture is interesting in the fact it has a whipped up mousse formula that quickly breaks down and turns watery as you apply it on skin. It’s very light and leaves my skin nicely hydrated. It’s unfortunately not waterproof but absorbs easily into skin. Kanebo Allie Extra UV Gel Mineral Moist N SPF SPF 50+ PA++++ Allie’s Gel Mineral Moist is actually one of the formula I use the most often! This absorbs SO easily it’s like a lightweight moisturizer! The gel texture was newly formulated and acts to bond to the skin making it perfect for warm weather as it resists water, sweat, and sebum allowing it to remain on your skin for a longer amount of time offering better protection. Swatch Above: Watery Essence, Watery Mousse, Mineral Moist These are just some of the many great SPF and Sunscreen formulas that can be found in Japan. The main reason I love Japanese SPF formulas is the fact they absorb so easily and feel like I’m applying moisturizer versus SPF. Here in the US many SPFs are formulated with a very heavy texture that don’t absorb easily. Sometimes you’re forced to wait several minutes to apply your makeup as well! Not the case with Japanese formulas! They tend to apply easily, absorb easily, and allow for instant makeup application. These are a few that top my “Best of” list but there are literally dozens and dozens of others that are equally great! You can shop these and others from Ebay.com seller AlphabeautyUK.

This is Kao’s latest formula of their popular UV Aqua Rich Watery which I absolutely adore. This protects with an SPF 50 PA+++ like the original but this new version is tinted to brighten skin up, ease dullness, and even out skin tone. Take a look! Kao Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery BB is the same great consistency as the original though this time around it isn’t a whipped texture but more of a gel which absorbs easily into skin leaving it delicately hydrated with a subtle citrus scent. It’s one my favorite sunscreens due to the watery texture which applies easily onto skin without leaving behind any odd film on skin. All SPF formulas should have such a great formula like this. This contains a skin tone correcting powder that promises to brighten, ease dullness, and even out skin tone. The shade is a peachy beige color which actually applies fairly transparent but does leave a white cast to skin which in turn results in the brightening effect. Outside of this I didn’t actually see much of a tint from it. The original version doesn’t leave a pasty look behind so really all this does is lend a whitish finish to skin but doesn’t necessarily provide color or color correcting benefits. I do like the gel-like consistency of this version and felt like it absorbed even a little bit better than the original if that’s possible. If you already use and love the original no reason to switch things up for this version. I liked the general idea of a tinted sunscreen that would brighten up skin but it didn’t really have a long term effect that could replace BB Cream, CC Cream, or foundation products. Anyone use the original? How about this new version? Do share! Sasa.com sells much of the Kao Biore Collection. You may also enjoy...

a funny thing about facial masks I’ve tried SO many but can’t say I’ve tried a variety from Japan. In most cases my facial sheet masks come from either Korea or Taiwan. For all my love of Japanese makeup you’d think that I’d have tried more brands of facial sheet masks from Japan but that’s simply not the case. Needless to say when I noticed the publicity that Lululun was getting in Japanese magazines I was quite curious about the brand and decided to order some of the masks and try them out. Take a look! Lululun Facial Sheet Masks come in three formulas total so there isn’t a huge variety to try. The one I have here is the Transculent Light Whitening formula. Supposedly the mask is free from oil, alcohol, and fragrances which makes them ideal for sensitive skin. The masks come in a variety of sizes but the more common is the seven piece variation. This is a single package with a ziploc seal that contains seven individual masks. The packaging is something I instantly disliked. I prefer masks that come in a box and are individually wrapped. The masks come in a huge chunk (you can see what I mean below) so they are pretty much clumped together in the package which means you have remove all seven masks from the package, peel one off, and drop the rest back into the package and reseal. This isn’t exactly hygienic nor can it be good for the masks having to remove them every single time to grab one off. These are a very thin, delicate cotton fiber that don’t have a great fit on my face. The thinner cotton tends to tear easily during application and during wear. I typically pat gently at the mask through the wear and this unfortunately results in tearing so avoid touching it once you apply. It has cut outs for your eyes, nose, and mouth however, it fits so poorly I felt like the mouth portion was down around my chin and the eyes were up around my forehead. It was just a weird fit overall which also results in tearing as I tried to situate it on my face correctly. It’s saturated decently with essence but unfortunately not the amount of essence I’d get from a My Beauty Diary or My Scheming Facial Mask . It seems the essence dries up super fast so the mask treatment only lasts about 10 minutes at the most where as I typically wear a mask for 20-30 minutes. After removal I didn’t really feel like the mask did much for my skin. I didn’t feel any more or less hydrated, my skin wasn’t really brighter, nor did it look any different. At best it moisturized a LITTLE bit but nothing incredibly hydrating here. Overall, Lululun Face Masks are apparently are a victim of over publicity and hype. These are just awful and not worth a pick up in my humblest. I got mine directly from Japan recently but Imomoko.com just started selling them if you’re curious to try them out for size yourself. Tried ’em? Love to hear your thoughts! As for me, I say, AVOID them! You may also enjoy...

They recently repackaged (and possibly reformulated?) some of their mascaras so I decided to try out one of the several formulas they offer. I should probably start this review telling you I’ve used their Little Witch Moisture Mascara in the past but wasn’t terribly impressed. This is actually abnormal as I typically love Japanese mascaras with a passion. I decided to give a try out to Flowfushi MoteMascara Comb in the hopes it would perform better. Flowfushi MoteMascara Comb are available with several brush applicators I choose the comb one in the hopes it was as good as the Majolica Majorca Lash Extender I adore so much. This has a long, thin comb for application with smaller notches in the head that capture lashes to pull them up and out. The mascara formula is an ink black lacquer with a glossy, wet look on. I was surprised to find the comb didn’t perform as well as I thought it would. Since it doesn’t saturate with a ton of mascara I expected little trouble when applying but some reason it ends up making my lashes look like a spikey gooey mess. I was shocked considering the comb doesn’t have a ton of product on it when you remove it from the barrel! As I applied it also ended up smearing on my upper lash line making a bit of a mess. It did end up adding some length but not a lot of volume. I see it working best for shorter, stubbier lashes but being messy if you have longer ones. It does set well without flaking or smudging but does make lashes a bit stiff. The nice thing is it wears very well without smudging yet it easily removes with soap and water! All in all Flowfushi MoteMascara is a little over hyped for me. The formula was messy, I only got a bit of length from it but no real volume, and it didn’t really make my lashes look as dramatic as everyone seems to rave. Oh well! All hope is not loss though as this one seems like a good pick for those with super short lashes. Flowfushi MoteMascara is available from amazon.com sellers as well as from AlphabeautyUK on Ebay.com.

Micellar Cleansing Water Ended Up in My Garbage</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.musingsofamuse.com/2016/07/e-l-f-micellar-cleansing-water-review.html</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>My nearly full bottle of E.L.F. Micellar Cleansing Water ended up in my garbage within minutes of using it but let me digress for a moment and tell you a little about this new micellar cleansing water. E.L.F. Micellar Cleansing Water is a new gentle, oil-free cleansing water (note the word gentle, it’ll come into play later on in my review) that promises to remove makeup easily without drying out skin. E.L.F.’s a little late to this show because the micellar water trend is starting to die down and cleansing balms are becoming more popular. But none the less, the beauty world still has their eye on micellar water as an easy way to remove makeup in a hurry without stripping skin. Weirdly enough, E.L.F. Hydarting Gel Melt Cleanser made an appearance before their micellar water did. So, E.L.F. definitely has their ear to the beauty trend ground but I guess they decided to launch well after the trend has come and gone! Hey, better late then never though right? Plus we all love on E.L.F.’s cheap pricing and this micellar water isn’t badly priced at 5 oz for $7 bucks. Although if you want to be technical about it, Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water All-in-1 Cleanser+Waterproof Makeup Remover is around the same price at over double the size. I’m not much of a micellar water fan but lately I find I use it a lot more since I’ve been cleansing with Lush Ultra Bland. Typically I use Ultra Bland and follow up with micellar water to remove the film Ultra Bland leaves behind at times. Honestly, a washcloth soaked in hot water removes most of Ultra Bland but I still like to use micellar water after just to get any traces of it from my skin plus it preps my skin nicely for my other skincare. Micellar Water, for me, is the lazy girl’s guide to removing makeup! It’s great but I never feel fully clean when I use it. So, on a late night when I can’t be arsed to double cleanse and do the entire remove my makeup bit that’s when micellar water comes in quite handy. But, E.L.F. Micellar Cleansing Water won’t be one I’m adding to my skincare line up! Reading through reviews on this new micellar water was quite entertaining and although there are many poor ones most don’t mention the one biggest problem I had. One person asked the question, “Does it burn your eyes due to the alcohol?” got a reply of, “Nope!” Ok, obviously, I must be in the minority here as this is exactly the reason I tossed it. I used it once and once only and it burned my eyes to the point they were red and watering for hours after. So much for gentle! Ahhh yeah, that’s a call for the trash can. Take into consideration it does contain alcohol which might be where the burning comes into play but let’s not forget you likely don’t want to cleanse with alcohol due to not only drying but a host of other issues that it can cause. Does it remove makeup? Well, I can’t speak for eye makeup as I gave my eye a single swipe with it and after that couldn’t test further since it stings like crazy. It does remove most surface makeup though such as foundation, BB Cream, blush, etc…and does so surprisingly without making my skin tight or dry nor leaving behind a sticky or tacky film. Sadly, the stinging was a huge deal breaker. Micellar waters are formulated to be gentle enough to use all over your face to remove all kinds of makeup including eye makeup. I find a cleanser I can’t use around my eyes fairly pointless. Strangely enough there is no warning about not using it on your eyes and the directions even say to swipe over eyes for makeup removal. Personally, I’d avoid it if you have sensitive eyes (or even if you don’t). It’s just not worth the sting. E.L.F. Micellar Cleansing Water is happily resting in peace at the bottom of my trash can.

Kale everything lately, including your skincare and makeup. Funny story I attempted to make my own kale chips last month and it turned out crazy bad. I burn boiling water so, I think you can imagine what I did to those poor, poor pieces of kale. Back to Whole Foods to grab up the pre-made ones. But I digress, I’m curious about this new micellar water ! I really like Nip + Fab’s new Kale Moisturizer so, if this kale thing is causing all that great moisture I might just be a happy girl about micellar water that’s infused with it.

What is micellar water? You might want to check out my article to get you up to date on this skincare trend before reading this review to catch up! Now people are quite excited about Simple Cleansing Micellar Water for a few reasons one of which is the fact it’s inexpensive and easily to get your hands on at the local drugstore. And secondly, Simple Skincare is notorious for keeping things, well, simple! Their formulas are very gentle and ideal for sensitive skin types so it is exciting to get your hands on a simply formulated cleansing water sans any harsh ingredients like fragrance! Let’s take a look at Simple Cleansing Micellar Water. If you read my cleansing water, is it necessary to your makeup removal post, you probably already know I’m not a HUGE user or fan of cleansing waters. I wear a lot of makeup so I feel like I need to do more than use a cleansing water at the end of the night to remove it all. But I can’t fault cleansing waters for several reasons one of which is their simplicity. When you’re tired, you get home late, and your mom’s voice is in your head saying “Don’t go to bed with your makeup on!” well, that’s when cleansing waters are a gift from the skincare gods above. Saturate a cotton square and swipe it across your face and you’ll get off your makeup in a hurry. Plus your mom will mentally nod her head in approval that you didn’t go to bed with makeup on. The other thing to love about cleansing waters is their gentle formulas. When you’re dealing with hard water situations or your skin is sensitive or super dry that’s also when cleansing waters are fab. Cleansing Waters are typically really gentle on skin so you aren’t drying yourself out further, you won’t feel super tight after cleansing, and sensitive users will feel like they are simply using water to remove their makeup. Right now, my skin is just crazy! Anything I cleanse it with seems to dry it out further than it already is. I recently discovered Cerave Hydrating Cleanser which really helps a lot but cleansing waters are equally great as I don’t feel like I’m sucking moisture from my skin when I use them. Simple Cleansing Micellar Water is a simple, easy to use formula. Wet a cotton square well with the solution and swipe your makeup off. It works fine around the eye area and didn’t sting or burn for me however, I was very sad to see the back of the bottle stating “avoid getting into eyes”. I wear eyeshadow, mascara, etc daily so if I can’t use this around my eyes for quick clean ups when I’m lazy it proves pointless. Note, they don’t say it’s not “safe for eye use” but I won’t take chances like that. I did try it though for this review and it removed non-waterproof mascara and eyeshadow ok but I still felt it left behind a little bit of my eye makeup. It does not work on waterproof makeup unfortunately. The formula is fragrance free and very mild and even contains some very decent ingredients so the fact you aren’t rinsing off after using it proves beneficial to your skin. Unfortunately as with most cleansing waters this is not adept at removing waterproof mascara or long wearing makeup. You’ll find it gets around 75-80% of your makeup off but it leaves behind a good deal as well! I find this is a fabulously low maintenance way to remove my makeup when I’m in a hurry. It’s super gentle and doesn’t dry my skin out! If you wear very minimal makeup you won’t need much more to get your makeup off. Personally, for myself, this is something I like using when I’m in a hurry and just want to go to bed. However, it isn’t something that will become a daily staple to remove my makeup as it’s simply not enough to get EVERYTHING off! Simple Cleansing Micellar Water is available now at drugstores or online at drugstore.com. Tried it? Share your thoughts! You may also enjoy...

everyone and their mom is loving on Micellar Water lately right? Because, hey, totally the lazy girl’s/guy’s guide to quickie makeup removing on the sly. You know the drill…….You’re out late partying like its 1999 and you come to your nice, warm bed only to realize, “Wait, I have to remove my makeup!” Shut up! I dunno about you but makeup removal is like a long process at the end of my day. I have a product to remove my eye makeup, a product to remove my face makeup, plus I double cleanse, and sometimes I exfoliate too, and…and….and…. It’s a process. But when I’m tired and I just wanna go to bed right away that’s when Micellar Water suddenly become all the awesome. Even better yet? Ulta Micellar Water Cleansing Pads ! Simple has Micellar MakeUp Remover Wipes but I LOVE the idea of Ulta’s Micellar Water Cleansing Pads even more. These are small fiber cottons that come per-saturated with micellar water so no clumsy bottle no reason to buy cotton pads. Just pop open the lid on these, slip a disc out, and start swiping away your makeup! Done! Cool right? A 30 pack of Ulta Micellar Water Cleansing Pads will set you back $8 bucks at Ulta and Ulta.com. I’m a buying ’em! Curious how they’ll work! You may also enjoy...

My first experience with micellar water was with Mandom Cleansing Express Water from Japan back in 2008. Honestly, at the time micellar waters weren’t seeing the popularity and trending they currently are from both mid-range and budget friendly brands so it was a bit of an innovative product for me. I loved Mandom’s formula but the cleansing water thing never really caught on for me as I always feel like I have a bit of left over makeup on my skin after I use one. But honestly, Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water is a formula that actually deserves all its ravings. It really does do an excellent job of removing makeup plus it’s very gentle on skin. Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water is available in a three sizes the best value though is the $19.95 16.9 oz size in my opinion. If you take a moment to add up the amount of eye makeup remover you’re buying and replacing quite often plus cleansing oil or cleansing foam you’ll realize that spending a twenty dollar bill on a 16.9 oz size of Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water is a deal and a half. As I mentioned above I never feel fully clean using cleansing waters BUT…! I will say I keep a bottle of this around the do a primary clean or a quick clean. So if I get home late and I’m too lazy to go through the entire cleansing process I just saturate a cotton pad with this and it removes all my makeup easily! On the nights I have a little more time I typically use it to remove my eye makeup and I swipe my face with it too before following up by cleansing my face with water and my regular cleanser or cleansing oil. The thing you have to love about this formula is how gentle it is. Unlike cleansers it never dries your face out nor does it leave your face feeling tight. It doesn’t strip skin in the least and it contains absolutely no fragrance or ingredients like alcohol that will break down collagen. It does a surprisingly job with mascara and heavier eye makeup as well and removes about 95% of it which is impressive for a cleansing water! This doesn’t leave a residue behind either so no sticky, tacky film is left on your face after removing your makeup. I’m still not convinced its the end all to cleaning my face but I will say that Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water is one of the most impressive micellar waters I’ve had the pleasure of using and one of the gentlest. If you have sensitive skin or even skin that tends to dry out easily after cleansing this is one product you should add to your cleansing routine. You can purchase Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water from beautylish.com. Muse Approved. Do you use a cleansing water? Which one? You may also enjoy...

Originally when I noticed this pop up at Ulta I thought it was eye makeup remover but later upon purchasing it I found it you can use all over your face much like Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water All-in-1 Waterproof Makeup Remover &amp; Cleanser . You might recall I loved Garnier’s formula but I stuck to using it as an eye makeup remover only as I didn’t love the feel of the bi-phase formula on my face. It felt like I was rubbing Lancome Bi-Facil all over my face. It just left an icky film. I actually feel the same way about Cetaphil Gentle Makeup Remover! It’s fantastic as an eye makeup remover but I’m not convinced I love it as an all over makeup remover. Cetaphil Gentle Makeup Remover comes in a 6 oz bottle and ranges in price from $8 to $12. It’s actually a little expensive compared to the much larger Garnier Micellar Water which is 13.5 oz in size and $8.99. Honestly, I don’t mind the price much I liked the formula and felt it removed eye makeup very well. If it works, I don’t mind paying the price but for this review it does deserve mentioning the price differences between the two formulas. Last year, I had a severe problem with flaky eyelids and for the life of me I couldn’t find the culprit. Thankfully, after Winter was gone and the warm weather set in my lids went back to normal but this formula might have been a good pick for me at the time as it contains some great ingredients like aloe and glycerin. It does a very good job removing all makeup but as I said above I didn’t love the film it left behind on my face. If you already use Garnier’s waterproof formula and you’re comfortable with it, I’m doubtful the Cetaphil formula will bug you at all. But if you felt like it left behind a sort of oily film you might want to stick to using it exclusively as an eye makeup remover as I have done. It does a good job removing both makeup from my face (even though I dislike using it like this) as well as removing eye makeup including waterproof mascara and eyeliner. It did leave me with a little blurry vision after but nothing that didn’t disappear quickly. All in all, Cetaphil Gentle Makeup Remover did an excellent job removing makeup. It’s not exactly the cheapest option for removing makeup but I’m always looking for a good and fairly cheap way to remove my eye makeup and this did a great job of it. Cetaphil Gentle Makeup Remover is available now at ulta.com , target.com , walmart.com , and amazon.com. Muse Approved. You may also enjoy...

Yes to Cucumbers Micellar Cleansing Water comes housed in a 7.77 oz bottle which has a handy flip top lid pump that allows you to press down to dispense the cleansing water right onto your cotton pad. You’re likely very familiar with this packaging if you love and use Bioderm’s formula as they have a fantastic pump dispenser that was released for a limited time but is now available permanetly. I highly recommend that packaging (and that formula as a matter of fact!). I was excited about this packaging as it’s quite a mess-free way of getting your cotton pad saturated with cleansing water. Sadly, it doesn’t quite work out as great as the Bioderm one. First of all, you have to press down very, very slowly otherwise the water shoots all over the place and makes a mess. Even when you’re doing it slowly you still end up with quite a mess on your hands. The pump doesn’t quite work well and micellar water either squirts everywhere or drips down the sides of the pump. I also had an issue getting this home as I purchased it at CVS but it only had a piece of tape holding the bottle closed. I didn’t think anything of it but when I got home I realized it the pump was dripping and I lost a good deal of the water. Thankfully that was the only thing in the bag otherwise, I’d have had a mess to clean up. I’m unsure why we need this formulation in the line up since Yes to Cotton has a Micellar Cleansing Water available and that, too, was created with sensitive skin in mind. It seems odd two different formulas for sensitive skin types. Depending how cheap you are or what a stickler you are for ingredients you may or may not see this as a good value. Garnier’s Micellar Water is the same price, does a better job with removal, happens to be 13.5 oz in size, and it’s the same exact price. On the upside, Yes to Cucumber’s formula is apparently created with 95% natural ingredients and free of parabens. Although it does have a good deal of fragrance. It’s odd to me that they even include fragrance considering it is created to sooth sensitive skin. I found the fragrance very strong. It’s a fresh, fake-ish cucumber scent that was pleasant enough to my nose but it’s likely too strong for sensitive users. Notice that the back of the bottom says to avoid contact with eyes. To me, this translates as you can’t use it near your eyes. I find a lot of different micellar waters and skincare products have this warning lately. Yes To has a lot of different products they they suggest not using near eyes. I don’t know about you but if I can’t remove my eye makeup with a micellar water the product becomes a little pointless to me. Micellar water is sort of my lazy girl’s guide to makeup removal. It’s when I’m tired and just can’t take the time out to do my normal double cleanse routine with a separate eye makeup remover. It’s what I use when I want to get bed fast. Swipe, no rinsing needed, and I can head right to bed. If I have to use a separate eye makeup remover that adds extra time on what should be a quick task. I did, for the sake of this review, use this on my eyes. It stings a little tiny bit but nothing too bad. Note, it contains niacinamide and I don’t know if this is something you want to get in your eyes. It did an ok job with eye makeup removal but I had to use a few cotton pads as well as a good deal of the water to remove my waterproof mascara and after that a lot still remained on my eyes as the next day I woke up looking like a racoon. Likewise for my face! I used several pieces of facial cotton and A LOT of the cleansing water to get all my makeup off. The good news is there is no sticky, tacky feel after using this formula. I wouldn’t say it left me hydrated but it didn’t dry my skin out eiter. Would I buy it again? Probably not. I’ve run across far better formulas that are eye safe! Yes to Cucumbers Micellar Cleansing Water just didn’t cut it in term of formula, size, price, and value. There’s a lot to be disappointed about here unfortunately. Yes to Cucumbers Micellar Cleansing Water is available now at ulta.com and amazon.com. You may also enjoy...

My skin is kinda freaking out lately! I’m pretty dry but also a little sensitive in the fact that the less I use on the better because everything seems to dry it out further. Typically micellar water isn’t my pick for removing makeup as I’m one of those people that never feels truly clean after cleansing like this. But with my skin the way it is micellar water is actually a good pick for cleansing as it doesn’t strip or dry me out further. I kinda sorta like the idea of pre-soaked micellar pads. I dunno why…maybe because they’d travel so easily? Maybe because I just like the idea of not having an endless supply of facial cotton hanging around to use my micellar water as hey, these already come in a pad! Who knows but I do so like the ideas of these. Here’s my thoughts! Ulta Micellar Water Cleansing Pads come in a big old tub that holds 30 pads which will either set you back $8 (or use coupon code 409797 and get $3.50 off your order of $10 or more bucks!) or you can buy any 2 Ulta Beauty products and get 2 free! Now, you’re either going to like these a lot of you’re going to be freaked out they come in a big old tube as each time you open it well, bacteria! Running away, arms flaying! You’ll likely use them all up before anything nasty happens but hey, if you’re a germ-o-phobe I totally get it. These are saturated well with product because there is nothing worst than getting eye makeup remover or makeup remover pads that are dry as century old bones. Each of these pads is soaked nicely so I can use one pad for my entire face and another for my eyes. They have absolutely no fragrance and they remove my facial makeup super fast and super easily. Unfortunately they struggle a little with waterproof mascara and eye makeup. I’d say I was able to get 90% of my eye makeup off but I still had a bit of mascara left and did have to tug a little bit during removal! But most Micellar Waters are the same as they tend to hiccup with really harder to remove eyeshadow and mascara. All in all Ulta Micellar Water Cleansing Pads are a nice, gentle way to remove your makeup without stripping skin. I didn’t feel like this formula dried my skin out nor made it tight! I also liked how I could easily travel with these versus bringing a big old bottle of water with me. Ulta Micellar Water Cleansing Pads are available now at Ulta and Ulta.com. You may also enjoy...

L’Oreal Miellar Cleansing Water is actually already available in a variety of countries including the UK, Canada, and Asia but we are just getting this formula here in the US. Although some may disagree since many ingredients in this formula re the similar to those in the Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water All-in-1 Waterproof Makeup Remover &amp; Cleanser and considering L’Oreal is Garnier’s parent company one might argue we’ve technically already seen his formula in the past. But nope, there are vast differences here. I ran across L’Oreal Micellar Cleansing Water recently at Walgreens for $9.99 in 13.5 oz bottle in both the regular formula and the waterproof makeup remover formula. I originally paid $8.99 for my Garnier Micellar Water but Target sells it for $6.99 and it is the same size as L’Oreal’s new formula. Not only is the Garnier one a better value but it also has a superior formula in my opinion. These new micellar waters are confusing to me lately as they recommend them for use on lips, eyes, and face but most of them like the E.L.F. Micellar Cleansing Water , Simple Cleansing Micellar Water , and even the Garnier formula typically state “avoid contact with eyes” or “do not get into eyes”. I find it puzzling that the formulas are ophthalmologist tested but there’s a recommendation to rinse with water if you get it in your eyes (yes, that’s what it says on the Garnier bottle). Guess what? The L’Oreal bottle says the same thing! “Avoid getting in eyes, rinse eyes thoroughly if contact occurs. Most with argue that this means you shouldn’t pour a bottle directly in your eye. I saturated a cotton pad very well with the cleansing water and even with my eye shut some does seep in. It concerns me that something they market for eyes has such a warning. On that note, I will say that this formula doesn’t burn if you do get it in your eyes but the waterproof formula did leave my eyes slightly cloudy after use. If you aren’t familiar what cleansing or micellar waters are I’d recommend reading my “ What is micellar water? ” post to get yourself up to speed. As I mentioned above this comes in two different formulas one of which is a regular cleansing water formula and one has a bi-phase formula. The bi-phase formulas are fairly new to the micellar water and Garnier, as far as I know, is one of the first brands to introduce a waterproof micellar water to the market. Now this isn’t to say that micellar waters all their own don’t remove waterproof makeup as many do like Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water is a real champ tackling all makeup removal without the need for a bi-phase formula. I have to admit I do like the bi-phase formula though as it does a really good job with waterproof mascara but I’m not particularly keen using it all over my face. I actually don’t use L’Oreal’s nor Garnier’s waterproof formula on my face because I dislike the weird oily feel of it on my face. It makes me feel like I’m using eye makeup remover all over my face which isn’t pleasant. I do love Garnier’s formula though for eye makeup remover (aside from the fact you can’t get it in your eyes!?). Oddly enough, a quick glance at the ingredients revealed that L’Oreal’s formula has many of the same ones as the Garnier formula yet for some reason it struggled with my waterproof mascara. Both the waterproof and non-waterproof formulas left a good deal of mascara behind when I used them on my eyes. Both formula also happened to leave behind traces of makeup as well which surprised me. One of the key selling points of micellar water is the ease of use and the fact it removes makeup quickly without the need to rinse. After I use L’Oreal’s formula I could visibly see blush left over on my cheeks. I also did a test where I used Garnier’s formula right after L’Oreal and my cotton pad came back with a mascara and other color cosmetics on the pad. This really baffled me as I felt like maybe L’Oreal’s formula was simply a repackage of the Garnier one but that’s not the case at all because the Garnier formula does a far better job with makeup remover than these new L’Oreal ones. L’Oreal Micellar Cleansing Water is an exciting launch to finally see here in the US but I’m sticking with the Garnier formula. Both of the L’Oreal’s formulas struggled a bit with both regular and waterproof makeup. If you do want to try these I’d recommend waiting for a sale. L’Oreal Micellar Cleansing Water is launching at drugstores now and I imagine it won’t be long before they pop up on Ulta.com and Target.com. Tried them already? Do share your results!

Nip + Fab utilizes kale (mmmm kale chips!) and watercress extracts to not only remove dirt and makeup but also to hydrate your skin. Let’s take a look! So everything and anything I use to cleanse my skin lately dries out it out horribly. Ah Winter! Gotta love that cold skin damaging weather! So for quickie clean ups and ones that don’t strip my skin of every single ounce of oil in it I use Nip + Fab Kale Fix Make-Up Removing Pads. Housed in a big old tube of 60 for $12.95 these little wipes are fab to quickly remove makeup without stripping skin. Granted they do struggle a little with waterproof mascara but aside from that they do a rather fab job quickly getting my makeup off easily without drying my skin out. I wouldn’t say they were “ultra-moisturizing” as promised but they leave my skin nice and soft and not tight and dry the way some cleansers do lately. I typically remove my eye makeup first with eye makeup remover and than I use two Kale Fix pads to remove the rest of my makeup. These are fab if you get home late and just can’t be bothered to go through the entire nightly cleansing routine. Or if you’re like me and your skin is busy not cooperating they are gentle enough to remove makeup without stripping! For lazy makeup removers, dry skin users, and chronic travels alike the Nip + Fab Kale Fix Make-Up Removing Pads are a great little product to have around for quickie makeup removal.

But what about brands you can find right not, easily at your local drugstore? There’s one moisturizer I’ve purchased time and time again that I absolutely love for my drier skin. Honestly, this formula should work for a variety of skin types but I love it on my drier skin. Nip + Fab Soften Kale Fix Moisturizer is a brilliant little moisturizer that contains kale extract which is rich in Vitamins A C, and K as well as aloe vera and shea butter. This absorbs in flash, doesn't leave my skin greasy nor oil, wears well under makeup, and provides excellent lasting hydration throughout the day that smooths skin. I think the thing I like most about this moisturizer is the fact it provides lasting moisture without making me greasy, shiny, or oily. It's very lightweight and smooths and softens skin dramatically. I think Nip + Fab is a mix of good and over hyped products this particularly one stands our as one of their best picks! I can't rave or recommend this one enough! Do try it! Available now at amazon.com , ulta.com , and target.com. Tried it already? Do share! P.S. Happy Monday! Ugh!

thought I’d do a post today on some of the best cushion foundations for sheer, lightweight coverage. Spring is here and Summer soon to follow so I’m sure many of you are lightening up your foundation routines and trader in higher coverage formulas for more sheerer, lighter ones. There’s nothing as bad as wearing a ton of foundation on a hot, humid day! I’m actually one who likes sheer, lightweight coverage throughout the year. I have dull skin that’s drier but I do not have visible pores, blemishes, or acne to conceal. So, lighter foundations to even out my skin tone, brighten it while easing dullness is about all the coverage I require. I started using cushion foundation in 2012 just around the time it started to gain popularity of Korea. Many Korean brands offer higher coverage in their cushion formulas but I’ve lucky enough to discover some very, very nice lighter fluid cushion foundations right here in the US. Here are my picks of the best cushion foundations for sheer, lightweight my skin but better coverage! Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Talc-Free All-in-1 ABC Cushion Foundation SPF 50 $16.99 (Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off at Ulta.com ) One of the more surprisingly cushion releases this Spring would be from Physicians Formula. Well, maybe it shouldn’t come as such a surprise considering I’ve always had great success with some of Physicians Formula’s foundations as they do a very good job at easing dullness and brightening up my complexion. Their new cushion is available in three shades and has a fantastic brightening formula that eases dullness, brightens my complexion, evens my skin tone, and still has plenty of coverage for those seeking to conceal minor redness or darkness. This formula is creamy, light, and sets to a smooth, even finish on skin. It’s turned into one of my favorite cushions released this year! Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Talc-Free All-in-1 ABC Cushion Foundation (Medium) Sephora Wonderful Cushion Foundation $24 Sephora’s new cushion foundation came and went in the blink of an eye. At the moment you’re unable to get this online but I’ve seen a variety of Sephora stores that do carry it! I hope this doesn’t mean it is discontinued because I really love this one. Light, creamy, with buildiable coverage this cushion gives my skin a fresh, natural look! Sephora Wonderful Cushion Foundation (Beige) It Cosmetics CC+ Veil Beauty Fluid Foundation SPF 50 $38 It’s expensive, it’s small, and it’s the best. It Cosmetics CC+ Veil Beauty Fluid Foundation isn’t for everyone but it is and will likely stay one of my holy grail foundations. It’s sheer, it’s brightening, and it feels heavily on my skin. This is your skin but way better! This is the type of foundation that will take your own good skin and make it better! I love this stuff!

Urban Decay Perversion is most definitely one of my very favorite eyeliners but the drugstore has some pretty awesome offerings that are cheaper and just as great as UD’s fantastic formula. So, here’s a list of the Best Drugstore Eyeliners That Are as Good As Urban Decay Perversion plus they are all under $10 bucks! If you told me when I started my blog I’d be raving drugstore eyeliner I’d probably call you a liar. Why? Because drugstore eyeliner was not something you’d rave about nearly 10 years ago! Most of the formulas available with dense, dry, and almost painful to apply. Ask my older sister and she’ll tell you a lighter was necessary to apply eyeliner back in her day! Why? Because you had to melt down the formula to make it soft enough to apply. Fast forward and the last ten or so years the drugstore eyeliner has evolved and become as fantastic as many mid and high-end brands! My top three that I absolutely love are L’Oreal Infallible Lacquer Gel Eyeliner ( Review ), L’Oreal Infallible Silkissime ( Review ), and L’Oreal Extra Intense Liquid Pencil Eyeliner ( Review ). These are all super pigmented, rich, glossy, and long wearing on my drier eyes. I absolutely adore how intense the color pay off is on these eyeliners and how soft and smooth they apply without skipping or tugging. Needless to say this aren’t your mom’s eyeliner! If black isn’t your thing, no problem, Silkissime launched in quite a few shades for Fall 2014! L’Oreal Infallible Silkissime, L’Oreal Extra Intense Liquid Pencil Eyeliner, and L’Oreal Infallible Lacquer Gel Eyeliner Swatches If you’re looking for blacker than black eyeliners with excellent application and and beautiful wear these won’t fail you! Best part? Their super budget friendly price tags! Get ’em now at your local drugstore or shop them at Ulta.com , Target.com , amazon.com , and walmart.com. What’s your favorite drugstore eyeliner?

Aerin Matchbox Gift Set ($20) is a perfect way to introduce yourself to Aerin Fragrances. For $20 you get five 0.07 mist samples of Aerin perfumes. The set includes: Gardenia Rattan captures the spirit of summer with sparkling wet marine notes and a blend of white flowers that exude lush femininity Amber Musk blends sensual florals, distinctive amber, and creamy musk Lilac Path weaves a delicate story of crisp greens, rich blooms, and delicate petals Ikat Jasmine is the impeccable pairing of Jasmine Sambac and Jasmine Egypt enhanced with subtle intensity and luminous depth as captivating as the woman who wears it Evening Rose is vibrant with contrast. Juicy blackberry and rich cognac blend with voluptuous rose centifolia and Bulgarian Rose Absolute like the lingering memory of an unforgettable evening I wasn’t sure I was going to like this set as I’m more a fruity floral kinda girl and Aerin is all about fresh, delicate floral fragrances. The good news? I loved all of these fragrances. They are so pretty and delicate, very un-aggressive and wearable! The bad news? It’s going to cost me a fortune buying them all in full size 🙂 The Aerin Matchbox Gift Set gets a Muse Approval and can be purchased now at Sephora.com. You may also enjoy...

It’s a funny thing about Juicy Couture Fragrances, I used to hate them! I was really not a fan but after finally purchasing my first Juicy Couture perfume I ended up becoming incredibly hooked on their fragrances. They truly take sugary sweet florals to the ultimate height. So, if that’s not your thing no need to read further. But for my sweet gourmand fans, this one is for you! I mean, really, sucre literally translates to sugar so, what do you expect? 🙂 I think the first thing that should be discussed with Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy Sucre is the bottle yes? I mean how cute is this bottle? Juicy has always favored decorating their fragrances ou with big old bows and cute little charms but they went above and beyond with Sucre. This reminds me of a big old cupcake or even a bon bon. The entire bottle is housed in a faux foil paper lining that you’d find on a cupcake or a truffle. It of course, features Juicy’s emblem in gold in the middle and the bottle has white chocolate or fluffy white frosting dripping down it. And of course, the crystal top nas a big old pink polka dot bow. Childish, whimsical, cute, and totally Juicy Couture right? I’ve read a few thoughts on Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy Sucre across fragrance and most users are saying it reminds them a lot of Ari by Ariana Grande. I’m also hearing that they feel it smells a lot like the original Juicy. I don’t really agree with either. This is a lot sweeter compared to the original Viva La Juicy fragrances and Ari which has a lot more of a cotton candy element. At first spray, there’s a sugary hit of red currant and mandarin which are drenched in a cream notes. If you close your eyes and take a moment you can pick apart some of the notes here like hints of peach nectar that mingles with almond cream and orange flower. But I find it challenging to pick the notes apart because the first mist is a syrupy, sugary treat that never lets up even during the dry down. As it sets and dries down the sweetness remains full frontal and hints of vanilla come out to play at this point. If sugary, sweet florals are something you adore, this won’t disappoint you as it’s like walking into the garden and sprinkling sugar and juice from a jar of maraschino cherries all over the flowers. The wear is quite good at around 5 hours with a nice linger and a little bit of a mellowing of the fragrance as at around hour four it loses some of it’s initial sweetness and gives way to more vanilla. If Viva la Juicy isn’t sweet enough for you I doubt Sucre will disappoint. This takes sugar and sweetness to a way higher level. The scent is girlish, youthful, with plenty of cuteness thrown in. Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy Sucre is available now at sephora.com , ulta.com and HSN.com and there’s a new Juicy Couture Viva la Juicy Extrait de Parfum as well! Are you a Juicy fan?

Electrified Web Nail Polish is a new nail enamel shade launched with the Revlon Electric Chrome Spider-Man Collection . Each of the six new shades are inspired by the The Amazing Spiderman 2 film and will be available for a limited time at drugstores. Revlon Electrified Web Nail Polish should be an eyeshadow for Summer! It’s a gorgeous burnt orange! Yum! Take a look! Each of the new Revlon Electric Chrome Nail Enamels has a Spiderman themed packaging with a golden web that decorates the top. It’s a really cute and understated nod to the comic book hero. Some of the shades in the collection have a duochrome look but mostly I’d call them purely metallic on nails. Electrified Web is a fiery lighter burned orange with reflect gold and green iridescence. Once applied I find you can’t really see the green in the color but you can see a hint of the gold. They have a liquid metal finish on nails. First application is a little weak in color but after three layers you get a solid opaque finish. The color has a nice shine to it as well for added drama. I’m not really a nail girl but I adore this collection. I’m a complete nerd for manga and comics so just the packaging and the fun names really had me hyped. Revlon Electrified Web Nail Polish and the Revlon Electric Chrome Spider-Man Collection is available at drugstores now (my friend located this for me at Walgreens).

You can actually get the Revlon Spiderman Collection at 40% Off as Ulta and Ulta.com has a great deal on drugstore cosmetics this week so do take advantage of you love this shade (or any of the shades in the collection). Revlon 1000 Volts Nail Polish is a gorgeous duochrome with excellent color shifting. The shade is a gorgeous gold metallic with a green and peach shift. It does need at least three coats for a full opaque finish but is well worth it as the color is stunning! Indoors I find the color is merely a metallic gold but in the sunlight it has a golden green and peach reflect! In my swatch you’ll only see the gold unfortunately but believe me the duochrome effect is stunning in different lights. 1000 Volts is probably my favorite shade from the collection. As with all the packaging in this collection there’s a nod to Spidey with a bottle top that features a golden web that decorates the top of the bottle. Some of these shades are wonderful and will make some great nail looks for Spring and Summer but the true joy of the release is the fact that it’s Spiderman themed! Loves it.

If you’ve been having a difficult time locating the collection it just launched at Ulta.com recently so you can now purchase it online! Let’s take a look! Revlon Spidey Sense Nail Polish is a bright metallic raspberry with a red undertone. Although in the bottle it appears to have a duochrome effect on nails I find there is no color shift and the finish is more of a liquid metal. The color is reminiscent of Peter’s Spiderman costume. I find the color applies sheer and needs at least four coats before it delivers a nice solid opacity. The color isn’t particularly glossy but it has a smooth, even, metallic finish. Revlon created special edition packaging to go with the Spiderman theme so each nail varnish has a black topper with a gold web spun around it! These shades have likely been done and redone in past collections especially from brands like China Glaze who favors shades like this but the real joy is the fun names and Spiderman themed packaged that makes them so great. If you’re a comic fan I’m sure you can appreciate these! They are available now at drugstores for a limited time. What did you think of the collection? Do share! You may also enjoy...

Revlon Sparks Fly Super Lustrous Lip Gloss is one of three limited edition shads of gloss launching with this Spring 2014 Collection that is inspired by the Spiderman movie and its characters. Take a look! Revlon Sparks Fly Super Lustrous Lip Gloss is a warm glittering fiery orange red. It’s stunning in the tube to say the least. This comes across as a super glossy red with hint of orange to it on lips. I actually get a good deal more red than orange once I apply it which disappointed me slightly as I love me a burnt orange lipgloss shade! This is laced with golden sparkle but it doesn’t translate to lips as heavy as it does in the tube so I get a good deal of glossiness but not a ton of shimmer. Nor does it leave shimmer behind when color wears away. Sparks Fly isn’t fully opaque on a single application but built up it produces a nice layer of color. Revlon Lustrous Lip Gloss has a nice hydrating feel without being stick or tacky with a lightweight, glossy finish. I find the formula is very comfortable to wear as it lends a nice moisture to my drier lips. The gloss sticks nicely without migrating. Funny thing as I have a few of these and none are nearly as gloss as Sparks Fly so that’s definitely an improvement. They wear for about two to three hours and I need a touch up at around hour three as color and shine begins to fade. They do not have a flavor or fragrance that I detect. The really nice thing about this collection is it is Spiderman themed so it has special edition packaging which includes a black top with a golden web decorating it. It’s understated but really cool none the less especially if you’re a Spidey fangirl or guy! Revlon Sparks Fly Super Lustrous Lip Gloss is available for a limited time at drugstores. Lord knows it probably requires a back up just due to the fact it’s Spiderman themed. Will you be hauling it? You may also enjoy...

Revlon Lash Potion Volume &amp; Length Mascara is hitting drugstores this Spring with a formula that offers longer, fuller lashes with a formula that strengthens lashes with proteins, vitamins, and amino acids so your lashes. Take a look! Cast a spell on your lashes and wave your Revlon Lash Potion Mascara wand to create fuller, longer lashes with this new mascara. Revlon takes us back to our mascara roots with a simple yet bushy brush applicator with their new Lash Potion Mascara. No bells, no whistles, no crazy spikes, or curves…this basic brush creates longer, fuller lashes in a quick swipe without all the fanfare I’ve noticed lately with other mascaras. I love the idea that it not only lengthens my lashes but also treats them to a strengthening formula loaded with good for my lashes ingredients. The formula is lightweight so it doesn’t leave lashes stiff or crunchy and washes away easily but doesn’t smudge or flake through the wear. My lashes are full already but this is a my lash but better look. It gives some fairly great length while giving my lashes a fuller yet softer appearance. It’s rare that I find a mascara that offers both volume and length but Lash Potion seems to perform several great tricks at once. Cast a spell on your lashes starting May 1st when Revlon Lash Potion Mascara launches at drugstores nationwide. Loves it. Muse Approved. You may also enjoy...

This is a permanent collection of products so if you don’t find it in drugstores right away no worries it’ll pop up shortly. I always think of it as Physicians Formulas customary Valentine’s Day release as their products for Spring always seem so romantic and cutesy for not only the season but the Valentine’s Day holiday too right? These new palettes come in flesh colored square compact with a sweet metallic pink bow gracing the front. Take a peek! I’ll be honest I didn’t love Physicians Formula Sexy Booster Sexy Glow Blush and I’m not really in love with Physicians Formula Nude Wear Glow Nude Blush. I know many people really love the Sexy Glow Blush but the formula just wasn’t all that great to me. Nude Wear Glow Nude Blush is really pretty but the texture and the color pay off just isn’t for me. This comes in a square compact as a I mentioned above with a dual compartment featuring the blush on top as well as a mirror and blush on the bottom. I mentioned in my Nude Wear Glow Nude Powder review that the brush was awful and unfortunately same falls true here. It’s very scratchy and it sheds horribly. Physicians Formula Nude Wear Glow Nude Blush is marketed as a no makeup blush that gives a glow from within look and a bare skin effect. Honestly that’s about right as the pigmentation is very sheer here although it can be built up to some extent. The blush is available in a Natural and a Rose shade. Natural is the shade selection I liked best and the one that had the best color pay off where as Rose is a more delicate pastel shade selection that didn’t really go well with my skin tone. Although I will say I felt a little too made up as I was kinda sitting here trying to build and build and build to get the best color pay off and in doing so the formula clung to my drier areas so I ended up having the a reverse effect of a very made up look! The blush is broken down into four cubes each ranging from lighter to darker shades with a over spray on each cube with a single letter spelling out “Nude”. They include one very light shade that acts as a highlighter of sorts and adds a touch of a glow-y finish once applied. I dislike the addition of the shade as it takes away from the darker shades and sheers them out. I’m not really getting the makeup less look here because the blush has a very velvety, powdery consistency that clings to drier areas on my face. I also felt like it was a touch chalky as well. Apologies as my swatches below do not include individual swatches of the Natural shade just the shade blended all together but this post will be updated with them shortly. Natural and Rose Physicians Formula Nude Wear Natural Glow Nude Blush Physicians Formula Nude Wear Rose Glow Nude Blush I think some people are going to adore Physicians Formula Nude Wear Glow Nude Blush. I’m just sadly not one of those people. If you liked the Sexy Glow line of blushes I’m positive you’ll adore the Glow Nude ones as well! Personally my skin is a bit too dry to enjoy this powdery texture…I just feel like I’m wearing too much makeup and the sheerness of the blush is disappointing as well! These are available now at drugstores. Wearing Natural I’d love to hear if you enjoyed or didn’t love the Sexy Glow Blushes and if you have plans to purchase the Glow Nude ones! Do share!

The Jane Cosmetics Makeup Collection is now exclusively available at Ulta and Ulta.com. I remember Jane from way back in the day! Like high school days! Either way it’s back and better than every before. I had the check myself a minute because when I used one of the new Jane Cosmetics Shimmer Eye Shadows recently I could have sworn was using a buttery, beautiful shade from the Urban Decay Naked Palette . What?! True story. Check it! I only tried one shade of Jane Cosmetics Shimmer Eye Shadow but if all the shades (and there are a lot of them! Over 30 of them in the shimmer finish alone!) are like this one I am it is on like Donkey Kong! Truffle is a dark chocolate brown with a soft, velvety texture and excellent full color pigmentation. What you see in the pan is exactly the shade you’ll get on eyes. The texture of the shadow is positively luxurious! I had to check myself and make sure I was playing around with a four dollar eyeshadow because this feels like something far HIGHER end. The smooth, velvety formula glides on lids, blends out to a picture perfect finish, and wears without creasing or fading all through my day! Wow. Impressive. Possibly the best budget drugstore eyeshadow I’ve tried in a VERY long, long time. Needless to say I was floored and quite surprised. I think I’ve been slightly conditioned to believe that drugstore shadows are sometimes not all that great but Jane Cosmetics blows that theory out of the water. As I said, if all the shades in this collection are as beautiful as Truffle I just might have to own THEM all! And I won’t break the bank doing it either. LOVE! Highly Muse Approved. Get Truffle, try it out, I bet you’ll ADORE it. Available now at Ulta and Ulta.com. Tried these already? Do share! You may also enjoy...

When you’re looking at drugstore eyeliners I’d say this is one of the more extensive shade selections you’ll get in a cream eyeliner especially with vibrant shades like Lime Green, Aqua, etc….I think drugstore liners tend to navigate to more traditional shades so it is surprising to see a variety of shades for under six dollars! Take a look! I tried two shades of Jane Cosmetics Water-Resistant Eyeliner and was quite impressed. They aren’t a dupe of Urban Decay 24/7 Eyeliners in any way, shape, or form but they are a close second if you’re on a budget. The wide selection of shades, creamy, long wearing formula, and cheap as chip price tag of six bucks makes them an appealing beauty budget pick for those seeking cheap thrills or just for those who are on a strict beauty budget. The liners are retractable so a sharpener isn’t necessary. I find the formula quite creamy with a hint of shimmer in some of the shades. They line beautifully without tugging or skipping. The shades have a strong wear on my drier eyes without smudging or flaking off yet still having an easy to blend out formula if you wish to smoke or smudge them out. On my waterline wear time is a little weaker at around three hours (in some cases I was unable to wear on my waterline due to shimmer in the formula so this is based on a single shade only, other shades might wear longer) and on my lash line for 10 hours. Deep Purple Sky Blue Sky Blue and Deep Purple There are quite a few brands that have some vibrant, bolder eyeliner shades such as Milani , Jordana , etc…however, Jane Cosmetics Water-Resistant Eyeliner definitely brings their A game to the table with this collection and offers a wide variety of colors across the board with an excellent formula that wears strong and promises cheap thrills with its mere six dollar price tag.

Jane Cosmetics recently had a brand relaunch with new products, packaging, and formulas and I must say so far the products have been fab. Loving the Jane Cosmetics Shimmer Eyeshadows! What’s the new Jane Cosmetics Water-Resistant Liquid Eyeliner like? Pretty darn awesome. Jane Cosmetics Water-Resistant Liquid Eyeliner is available in 13 shades, nope, they didn’t skimp on the shades. So you have a wide range of essential shades like black and white but there are also fun shades like gold, baby pink, and this guy I’m reviewing today Golden Black (it’s more of a golden khaki brown). I don’t regularly use Liquid Eyeliner but this could change my mind. This has precise thin brush applicator for application. It applies easily with a fairly thin line thanks to the thinner brush. I love the shade…! It produces a pretty golden khaki brown line which works great with a smoky natural eye look or even a smoky green one. The formula sets with 30 seconds of application. Once set it has a glossy finish with a formula that doesn’t flake, migrate, or smudge on my drier eyes. I didn’t have a hiccup during the wear and the shade didn’t lose intensity through a twelve hour period of me running around at work, enjoying some dinner and a movie with friends, and finally home to do laundry and clean up a bit before bed. It’s what you want from liquid liner wear yes? All in all a rather budget friendly liner with a nice variety of shades to choose from. Do like! Jane Cosmetics are now exclusively sold at Ulta and Ulta.com. Don’t pass them buy! They are everything you remember about your first years of makeup but just with a brand new improved formula and packaging. Have you tried any of the newest Jane makeup products? Do share!

The new Satin Split Sticks will be available in five shades and get a launch this September at Kohls and on Jane Cosmetics website. Let’s take a peek! I recently tried out Jane Satin Split Sticks in the shade In the Buff which contains a dusky mauvey rose and a nude peach shade. I wish I can say I could see the contrast on my lips but once applied it seems like the nude overpowers the rose of this shade! I love the idea of split lipsticks but they never quite work for me. Jane Satin Split Sticks Swatches (In the Buff) This have incredible creamy formula. Wow! They glide on like butter with a thicker, creamier consistency that wears for a solid five hours without feathering or migrate. The cream finish is quite thick but doesn’t feel heavy on lips. They are highly pigmented and provide a full color pay off on a single application. The soft, supple formula is very impressive with an easy, no tug application on lips! If you love cream finish lipsticks I’m sure you’ll adore Jane Satin Split Sticks! These are gorgeously formulated with a smooth, buttery satin finish!

Shades now include: Extra Light (pale alabaster) Light (pale ivory) Light Plus (light beige) Medium (warm beige) Medium Plus (tan beige) Medium Dark (caramel beige) Dark (deep caramel) Dark Plus (neutral tan beige) Dark Deep (rich golden bronze) Medium Plus, Medium Dark, Dark Dark Plus, Dark Deep Prep + Prime Beauty Balm is a lightly tinted BB Cream that can be worn alone or acts as a primer to even out skin tone and create a smooth, even surface on skin. It contains an SPF 35 as well for added sun protection. I’m actually not a huge fan of it myself as as MAC markets it more as a facial prime than an actual blemish balm cream so don’t expect any real coverage here.

Elizabeth Arden BB Cream is a first for the brand and marries the benefits of skincare and foundation into a single product packed with a hydrating formula and plenty of skin loving ingredients that are sure to please. I absolutely loved this BB Cream but had a minor issue with it… There are ismuch to love about Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference Multi-Targeted BB Cream but colors do run a little dark but more on that later. Like any good BB Cream this comes in a squeeze tube with a formula that helps to brighten skin as it primes, protects, hydrates, and offers coverage. Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference Multi-Targeted BB Cream is supposed to be suitable for all skin types but I do think it would be best suited for drier more mature skin. This has an incredibly creamy, hydrating formula. So hydrating in fact I am comfortable recommending you skip moisturizer prior to application. It is quite rare I say that as I have drier skin and I’m always craving more moisture. However, this BB Cream formula is extra moisturizing and provides a dewy to the touch finish that give dry skin a soft, supple feel and finish. It’s formulated with hyaluronic acid which not only provides moisture but aids skin in retaining it. It also contains a Vitamin C Derivative as well as licorice extract that helps fight free radicals and keep skin bright and healthy looking. An SPF 30 provides broad spectrum protection. The texture is that of a richer, creamier gel that absorbs easily into skin and doesn’t accentuate drier areas or pores. It has a soft, even finish that lays on skin naturally and weightlessly. I’d liken the texture to Clarins BB Cream which I adored. Although they promote Shade 1 for fair complexions with pink undertones I must say it ran quite dark. This was the disappointing aspect for me because I tried both Shade 1 and Shade 2 but neither fit my tone very well, both being simply too dark. I think they intentionally made them darker as they feel you’ll make more use of this in the Summer months and your skin might be a bit tanner during that time. I have duller skin though and using a shade this dark just emphasizes that dullness and makes me look tired and stressed. One thing to look for is the fact that it adjusts a little bit upon contact with skin so although it appears quite beige and dark in the tube or even swatches once applied it does go lighter. Shade 1 and Shade 2 The texture really is something to rave here as it applies like a dream. It has a cool refreshing feel on skin with a pleasant cucumber-like subtle scent. It’s very no nonsense to apply and blend out, no rocket scientist degree required. It wears for a shorter time than your average BB Cream simply because it is extra hydrating which means it has a knack for fading. So you’re looking at around four to five hours of wear before some minor fading into hour five and completely disappearing by hour six. I typically can go morning to night with BB Cream but the more hydrating texture here does prevent a longer wear for me. It does not oxidize thankfully. If you liked Clarins BB Cream or even Shiseido Perfect Hydrating BB Cream I think you’ll adore Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference Multi-Targeted BB Cream. I wish the shades were a smidge lighter but otherwise the formula is incredible here plus if you’re having a hard time locating a BB Cream for your tan or darker skin tone this is an excellent way to experience a BB Cream in a selection of darker shades.

We’re plenty used to Korean brands offering the best and most brilliant BB Cream formulas for so much less but when it comes to cheaper BB Creams here in the US, well, the market is a little lacking. So when I run across one for $10 bucks I’m all over that as hey, this might be the one to thrill me! Take a look! Avon Ideal Flawless BB Beauty Balm Cream promises a 10 in 1 formula that contains minerals, antioxidants, and vitamin E plus SPF 15 to keep skin happy and healthy. Although that SPF is sorely low for my tastes….! Meh! This promises to hydrate, even skin tone, reduce redness, conceal flaws, and smooth skin. According to Avon your skin will look even better AFTER the BB Cream is removed. Ha, fancy that? I’ve been using it near three weeks and I can’t say my skin is looking anymore or better after use to be honest but I’d love it if with continued use that I might actually see some goodness! As a BB Cream this is disappointingly sheer and lower SPF, well, all that adds up to not such a fab BB Cream formula. As a tinted moisturizer…well, it’s ace however, it has one quirk I’ll explain shortly. Light Medium This is a gel-like formula with a creamy texture that has sheerer coverage. Although sheer there’s enough pigment here to perfect and conceal minor problems such as redness or darkness, and just generally create a more even, flawless finish on skin. I actually like the formula a lot as it brightens my skin up, eases my dullness, and provides lightweight, even coverage so my face looks, feels, and appears more flawless. On the downside the wear time is a bit iffy. Since it is so hydrating I can happily skip moisturizer prior to use (or at least in the warmer weather I can). It absorbs fairly easily into skin and hydrates just enough leaving behind a semi-dewy finish that keeps skin feeling supple through the wear. On the down side that hydrating factor actually means it fades faster. I also feel like it has a knack for creating oil and making my face shiny after about an hour to two hours after application. Typically my skin goes more combo in the warmer weather so I see a little bit oil and I’m drier around certain areas of my face. I think this might be more suitable for cooler weather as my skin is drier than and this might not produce as much oil in the cooler weather. Overall, it makes for a very nice tinted moisturizer, actually, if you wanna be technical on some levels it is even nicer than a tinted moisturizer. Not factoring in the oil and shorter wear time this would actually be a great formula however, those two issues could create a host of problems for folks that want their makeup to stick around long and not make them shiny. Perhaps the Winter will prove a better time of the year for Avon Ideal Flawless BB Beauty Balm Cream. Is it worth trying? Sure! If you’re skin is super dry! However, if you’re more of an oily or combination skin type best wait until the cold weather sets in for a try out. This comes in five shades and is available now at http://shop.avon.com Tried it?

Typically we run into cream to powder products but Iman CC Correct &amp; Cover Powder to Creme Concealer is actually a loose powder formula that dissolves into a cream when applied. Do I have your interest? You might recall Mally Beauty Liquid Light Eye Brightener that released back in 2009….! I’d liken Iman CC Correct &amp; Cover Powder to Creme Concealer to that formula. Iman CC Correct &amp; Cover Powder to Creme Concealer is available in five deeper skin shade selections and comes housed in a small shake jar that’s 0.14 oz in size. The powder has a small sifter located on the top and you can gently shake a small amount out for application. The velvety powder is a thicker yet silky consistency that dissolves into a drier cream upon blending. The formula is supposed to offer a soft focused, hydrating finish that fills fine lines as it conceals. The formula is supposed to be a companion product to be used with Iman BB Cream for light to medium coverage and contains an active botanical complex with vitamins and nutrients that even out skin imperfections like under-eye darkness, blemishes and hyperpigmentation while conditioning the complexion. In theory the idea is innovative and quite great. They really loaded up on the abilities of the concealer with a ton of different benefits such as ingridents that supposedly increase skin elasticity while firming and hydrating it to reduce the appearance of fine lines with amino acids and Vitamins B, C, E, and beta carotene. They even have hyaluronic acid in the mix to aid in hydrating and retaining moisture plus an SPF 15. To begin application I tap a small amount onto the back of my hand and mix it with my finger. It dissolves very quickly from a silkier powder into a drier and slightly thicker cream. I wouldn’t say this is your average everyday cream texture mind you as you can feel and see at one point in its life it was a powder but none the less the transformation is fun and different. I tried the lightest shade offered which is sand medium but unfortunately it is FAR too dark for my skin tone so this one is meant for deeper complexions. As a spot concealer it might just do the trick but as an under eye one I had my issues. Although not a match for me I was keen to try it out none the less so after it transformed from powder to cream I gently tapped and blended some under my eyes. It really is very sheer and likely won’t conceal major under eye issues. I’d like to say go ahead and apply directly from the bottle to perhaps get better coverage but that would be too messy. They do provide a sponge which you can use to gently pat it under eyes and this really helps minimize it from falling into finer lines and giving it a more airbrushed appearance. But…it also sheers the product out which means my dark circles are still hanging out for the world to see! Once patted into place it seems to pill a bit and requires a bit of tugging to get a smooth, even finish. It falls into my fine lines and doesn’t quite work well under my drier eyes. I couldn’t help but think if you have oily lids and eyes you’ll likely see better results than I did during application. I don’t typically use concealer on my face but this might prove a better product for spot concealing versus under eye concealing however, the sheerness might not hide major issues or problems. Overall, the idea is interesting! You don’t commonly see products or formulations like this which makes this unique but the application process and the drier formula just didn’t quite work out for me. I need a good deal more coverage than this provides in a more hydrating formula. I felt like I spent too much time tugging to apply and once applied the product didn’t quite want to live happily under my eyes but instead wanted to hibernate in my finer lines. I would however, recommend testing it out for yourself because it is so very interesting. And interesting products deserve to be tried out. Who knows? It might just work for you! It hits drugstores this January so look for it at Walgreens, Target, and Ulta, or grab it at drugstore.com. Tried it? Do share! You may also enjoy...

Earlier last Spring, Physcians Formula Super BB All-in-1 Beauty Balm Concealer launched however, this new formulation is more about correcting versus major concealing. Take a look! Physicians Formula Super CC Cover Concealer is available in a single Light/Medium shade which is a soft ivory with very light beige undertones. This a shade that won’t work that will work best for medium fair, medium, and lighter skin tones as it is sheerer so you’ll find it works good to color correct but won’t be pasty in finish courtesy to the sheerness of the product. It comes in a twist pen with an attached brush for application which makes it friendly for travel and touch ups on the go. I like using it over my concealer and to contour with but you can also use it under concealer as well. It is not meant for use on its own due to the sheerer finish unless you’re only looking for lighter concealer coverage. Personally I need a lot more coverage than this provides. However, a touch over my concealer brightens up my eyes, diminishes darkness that my concealer might not have addressed, and completes my entire look. I also like to use it in the space just about my cheek bones, right under my eyes, to create a bright contouring effect that gives my eyes a more awake appearance. The formula is creamy with a satin finish that doesn’t crease into my finer lines or add dryness to the area. It blends fairly easily as well without tugging or dragging across my skin. Overall, Physicians Formula Super CC Cover Concealer is a nice touch up tool for addressing redness on cheeks or subtle dark circles or shadowing on your face. It isn’t a full coverage concealer but does have nice correcting abilities to address minor facial skin and under eye problems. I like to use it as a brightening pen of sorts to brighten certain areas around my face and eyes up as it does an excellent job addressing problems like fatigue or dark circles that need diffusing. The Physicians Formula Super CC Collection which includes a brand new CC Cream as well as this concealer will be available at drugstores shortly.

This CC Cream is formulated with an SPF 20 and is supposedly 100% free of harsh chemicals, preservatives, parabens, synthetic fragrances, and colors and is also 100% Cruelty Free. Take a look Physicians Formula Organic Wear CC Color Correction Cream is available in a Light and Light/Medium shade selection. This is formulated with natural and organic ingredients according to the brand to brighten and perfect while hydrating and protecting. It supposedly has organic lemon to help reduce dullness and brighten skin as well as light reflecting pigments that blur the imperfections as well as blue agave for moisture and acai palm which improves the surface of skin so moisture locks in. Reading the box it sounds like an absolute dream product. Personally, thus far, many US CC Cream formulas are terribly disappointing to me. CC Cream is typically available in a single white self adjusting shade in Asia and is less pigmented than a BB Cream formula and acts to correct skin which can be used alone or under your favorite BB Cream. In the US one of two different things happened with CC Creams which is brands either went beefier with the formula and they got more pigmented or the brands went even lighter with the texture so you get very sheer color without any true correcting abilities. This is the case with Physicians Formula Organic Wear CC Color Correction Cream, it’s just too sheer. I grabbed up the Light/Medium and it is suitable for medium and tanned tones as it is quite sheer and the color is quite dark, dunno they they don’t just call it Medium. I don’t love the texture on this. It feels a bit too runny to me. It has a gel-like consistency but the watery texture feels like it separated somehow and gives the formula a more runny look. It absorbs easily when applied, doesn’t accentuate dry areas on my face, and dries down to a satin finish with a slight hydrating feel when first applied. The shade really dulls out my skin though! I already have duller, drier skin and this just adds to that appearance and doesn’t brighten it or produce a more healthy appearance. It also wears an extremely short time, my skin just sucks it up so I get about an hour in before the color just fades away. It really failed for me at the basic elements of a CC Cream. It didn’t even my skin tone, didn’t really correct due to sheerness of the product, and just didn’t give me an overall good finish. This formula just feels like a step down from a tinted moisturizer. Overall, I think Physicians Formula Organic Wear CC Color Correction Cream really misses the mark as a CC Cream. A good CC should give you a your skin but better finish but this barely hydrates never mind perfecting or even evening out skin tone. No like. You might be safe skipping it. Tried it already?

Physicians Formula Super CC Cream is available in a Light and Light/Medium shade selection with a formula contains an SPF 30 and multitasks as a color correcting foundation product that tones down rednes, brightens, and corrects imperfections. Take a look. Physicians Formula Super CC + Color Correct Care Cream is one of several new products that Physicians Formula in a new Super CC Collection. I’ve already recently reviews the concealer and powder that also happens to be apart of this collection. I grabbed this is the Light/Medium shade selection which is quite orange-y beige but actually applies considerably lighter than it looks in the tube. I was worried about the formula since I wasn’t loving the Organic Wear CC Cream’s texture but this has none of the issues I experienced with that formula. This is rich and creamy with a nice hydrating effect when applied that absorbs easily into skin and leaves a slightly dewy finish but nothing oily, greasy, or too shiny. The formula supposed has color correct pigments that correct different issues. Yellow pigment acts to blur imperfections on warmer skin tones where as green tones down redness and pink brightens and illuminates. You can’t technically see these pigments in the formula where as in the powder version of this product you do catch glimpses of them. It’s supposed to contain Lipobrite which brightens skin and some sort of AHA to exfoliate with Vitamin C as well. I’ve used it a month and haven’t really noticed my skin brightening over time but if it does, hey, I’d be a happy girl. It does claim to visibly correct age sports, dark circles blemishes, redness, fine lines, wrinkles, etc…I do see visible easing of dullness, uneven skin tone, and signs of fatigue which are also promised. However, whether it is actually treating dark spots, fine lines, wrinkles, etc that would require quite a good deal of usage and time however, I’d take those claims with a grain of salt. It does brighten when applied though. Unlike the Organic Wear CC Cream where I experienced dullness this has a nice bright flawless finish. Coverage is sheerer but considerably better than the Organic Wear’s formula so you can rely on this to ease minor redness, even skin tone, and give an overall brighter appearance to duller skin. I wanna say it’s ALMOST buildable to medium coverage but it’s best to say it is sheerer at this point but not as sheer as a tinted moisturizer that’s for sure. The finish is flawless and seamless appearing very natural and pretty. Above you’ll find swatches from left to right that include a blended version, a little bit of a heavier swatch, and the last one which is just squeezed from the tube. If I wear it with powder, which I’m not keen on, it’ll last between four and five hours. Without powder I can get about four hours of wear without fading or oxidizing. This is a considerably better product than the Organic Wear CC Cream so if you’re sitting down trying to decide between the two you have my vote to grab this as I feel it offers better coverage, a more flawless finish, a longer wear, and a superior formula that doesn’t separate or have a watery/runny consistency. This is a great product for lightweight coverage with very basic color correcting abilities such as brightening for dull skin, correcting uneven skin tone, and easing minor redness. If you like product that give you that my skin but better appearance I’d say Physicians Formula Super CC Cream does that well. It’s available now at drugstores. Tried it? Love to hear your thoughts!

You may already be familiar with the Sephora Skin Perfect CC Cream but this new variation is available in a single shade that promises a host of new benefits. Take a look! Sephora CC Care Color CC Cream is a helix design that looks like it contains a moisturizer paired up with a tinted CC Cream. It’s odd and interesting design to say the least. I’ve tried it a few times already and both the shades seem to combine when product is dispensed. I thought perhaps they’d be slightly separated when they were pumped out but they actually just squirt out already blended together. The formula is supposedly to adapt to your skin tone and promises to even skin tone, minimize redness, tighten pores, reduce the signs of aging, etc… I tried it on myself a few friends in a variety of skin tones and most everyone ended up with an orange-y beige color. It didn’t adapt so great I fear. The creaminess of the product is quite nice with a smooth, soft dry set that’s slightly satiny. It applies like a moisturizer of sorts, absorbs easily, and blends well. It produces more of a no makeup look the shade fits your skin tone but does leave an orange cast if it doesn’t. I tried it on myself and it gave me an orange-y dull look but tried it on a friend who was about two tones darker and on her it looked quite natural. It does even out skin tone but it won’t offer major coverage and the color correcting benefits you’d expect from a CC are sorely lacking here as it isn’t going to ease dullness or minimize redness, etc…! Wear time seems to be shorter at around four hours before it starts to fade away. A quick look at the ingredients doesn’t show anything extra special so at this point it’s more like a tinted moisturizer in my eyes. Not sure you need this one….! Coverage is ok, the single shade doesn’t adapt very well and in this case I’d be more happy to rave it if it did as the creaminess of the product is quite nice, however, the lack of coverage, the poor color choice, and the shorter wear time and the benefits of a CC Cream that doesn’t actually correct, well, it kinda makes it a poor choice in the CC Cream world. I’d skip this one. If you are interested it’s available at Sephora and Sephora.com. You may also enjoy...

Lorac’s new CC Cream ($28) is available in three shades and promises a six in one formula that neutralizes, primers, moisturizers, brightens skin up, and soothes it. Let’s take a look! I don’t mind that Lorac CC Color Correcting Cream lacks SPF as I typically apply my own sunscreen even when CC Creams/BB Creams have their own built in sunscreen however, this could be a deal breaker for some. I’m kinda surprised they didn’t put some sunscreen into this formula and maybe even a little bit shocked. I think with any CC Cream or BB Cream formula we expect the product to go the distance and that distance includes some sort of SPF. Outside of this Lorac has created a very, very interesting CC Cream formula. I would recommend this for drier skin and combination skin types however, it might prove a little too moisturizing for oily skin. It seems like the type of product I’d enjoy using in the cooler weather but not the warmer due to the amount of moisture it provides and continues to provide through the wear. It contains hyaluronic acid which not only provides moisture to thirsty skin but helps it to retain hydration so it’s kinda the moisture ingredient that keeps on giving. This is in fact why the formula of this CC Cream is so very hydrating! This has a thicker yet running gel-like consistency that absorbs easily into skin and blends out to a perfect finish. It’s not the type of product that will cling to less than smooth areas, larger pores, patchy and dry skin, etc…it merely melds with skin creating a soft, even layer that conceals minor issues, redness, darkness, and acne or blemishes. Although it seems to be sheer it actually builds very well and will hide a good deal of skin issues that you might suffer from. So don’t mistakenly categorize it as another US BB Cream with a tinted moisturizer formula. This is in fact a product that offers decent coverage and corrects problem areas with a formula that brightens and eases dullness while perfecting skin. Light and Medium It contains Vitamin C to brighten skin however, you’ll have to use it over time I imagine to see any of its benefits. It also contains anti-aging antioxidants like vitamins A and E with an oil free/fragrance free formula. I do warn you that it is very moisturizing so a little, at least for me, seems to go a very long way. It evens out my complexion, while easing my dullness and brightening my face prepping it for makeup. The moisture it provides seems to extend to the wear so at first application I feel very hydrated and throughout the wear time I feel equally moist. It’s a dewy to the touch finish that dries down to a soft, plush feel. The wear seems shorter for me at around three hours before it starts fading and disappearing. I’d blame this on the amount of moisture it provides and my drier skin that just wants to suck it all up. You might experience a longer wear time if your skin isn’t as dry. Overall, Lorac CC Color Correcting Cream definitely sets the stage for CC Creams this Summer. It’s one of the few brands at this point in the US offering a CC Cream formula and one of the first to launch one outside of Smashbox and Clinique . We’ll see more CC Creams as we head deeper into the season but Lorac definitely set the bar high in terms of a fairly good formula. On the down side, I do see myself using this more in the Winter due to the moisture it provides. I think me and it during a warm Summer day might be a little too much but I imagine it’ll be my best friend in the Winter when my skin can use the extra moisture. It’s available now at Sephora, Sephora.com, or www.loraccosmetics.com If you tried it I’d love to hear your thoughts! You may also enjoy...

So if you’re one of those folks that might not fit into the self adjusting CC Cream range Sephora’s version will give you a few options for color. You’ll see a harder push for CC Creams in drugstores come the Fall but right now Summer rules supreme for mid range and higher end brands that are hitting CC Creams hard. Although at the moment the CC Creams I have tried here in the US are nice enough I’m still really liking what I see from Asia and have come across a good deal of great options from our Korean brand friends. Sephora’s CC Cream option comes as a surprise as I didn’t really expect them to embrace the trend so quickly. They, like many brands, have skipped completely over the BB Cream craze and just headed right into releasing a CC Cream. I was ever so slightly shocked at the $26 price tag I must admit and that rather low SPF 20. But I tested it out and here’s what I think! Sephora Skin Perfect CC Cream, like many of the CC Creams I’ve tried in the Western market, is a tinted product. This isn’t a self adjusting CC Cream so it isn’t white as many Korean ones are. Plus you have options for color here as well, not many mind you, but most of the shades should fit into many tones since the product is so very sheer. Remember CC Creams aren’t going to offer you a ton of coverage. These merely correct but do not conceal problem skin issues. Darkness, redness, and evening out your skin tone is the job of a CC Cream. Blemishes, major redness or dark spots, freckles, would be the job of a pigmented BB Cream or foundation product. Sephora’s CC Cream is creamier and richer than one would expect with more pigment than your average tinted moisturizer. Honestly, they prob could have went with BB Cream in this case. Granted, it isn’t as pigmented as a BB Cream you’d find in Asia but the pigment is better than a tinted moisturizer and is more of a BB Cream formula we see here in the states. Although creamy it is lightweight, breathable, and blends out to a seamless finish on skin. If you like tinted moisturizer but just wanted a little more pigment in it than Sephora CC Cream is a good option for you. Swatched Fair I wouldn’t say it perfects completely as the sheerness of the product can’t really blur the appearance of dark spots or redness. It will however, ease dullness, even out skin tone, and perfect already decent skin. It contains Sephora’s Hydra24 Complex which helps to hydrate skin through the wear. Personally it feels like a semi-matte almost satiny finish on dry down with a soft, smooth texture that doesn’t cling to drier areas. It isn’t overly moisturizing for drier skin nor is it too hydrating, oily, or greasy for those with combination or oily skin. You can wear it under or over foundation. I personally like the idea of using CC Cream on its own over primer. But if you need more coverage you can use it in conjunction with your own base. It wears, on its own, solid for a good six to seven hours before showing minor wear at hour eight (on a humid/warm day). I find the SPF 20 disappointing especially if you’re outside and using this as your sunscreen. Why bother at all? SPF 20? Really? Outside of the poor sunscreen option this is a very nice product. For me it is one step above a tinted moisturizer. It’s very sheer but still manages to perfect well enough and gives skin lightweight coverage that’s perfect for Summer. I admit I’m still a fonder fan of Asian CC Creams at the moment. They seem to do a better job brightening and perfecting compared to what I am seeing from US brands.

CC Creams are just starting to become fairly popular in Asia this Summer and interestingly enough right here in the US as well. Considering it took the US market well over four or five years to actually release a BB Cream I find it interesting that CC Creams caught on so quickly. But hey, can’t say the US market doesn’t take an idea and RUN with it. So far I’ve had excellent experiences with many of the Korean CC Creams I’ve reviewed and tested. I did notice that many of the CC Creams released in the US seem to be ironically a step above the BB Creams we currently have. In Asia, that’s actually reversed with CC Creams offering less coverage and here in the US ironically CC Creams offering more. Odd how things work out. Supergoop isn’t quite known for their beauty products but more about their variety of sunscreen/skincare options so I thought it rather interesting that they launched a CC Cream for Summer. They don’t have a BB Cream so just skipped right to the CC Cream formula. Let’s have a look! Supergoop Daily Correct CC Cream is a Broad Spectrum SPF 35 Sunscreen with the built in benefit of being a CC Cream. The formula comes in a self adjusting Light/Medium (swatched in this post) and Medium/Dark shade selection. Even the lighter medium shade might be too dark for those with super fair skin as it is a creamier beige shade with beige undertones. It’ll adjust well on a range of medium skin tones but I think it might not do as well on paler or fairer skin than the medium range especially if you have pink undertones. Unlike Asian brands this is not a white CC Cream that adjusts. It is a single shade of lighter medium that’s sheerer thus giving the illusion of being your perfect shade. The formula is thick and creamy with a quick to absorb formula that offers some hydration but nothing that leaves skin too oily or greasy. It has a cool refreshing feel on my skin and has a soft, smooth dry down that’s semi-matte to the touch. Unlike a BB Cream it is meant to correct not to offer major coverage. I’d recommend it for those with fairly smooth, blemish-free skin that may suffer from minor redness, darkness, dullness, or uneven skin tone. This takes already good skin and simply makes it better by perfecting it, evening out skin tone, adding health and glow to duller skin, and minimizing the appearance of minor redness. The formula goes a bit watery on me as I apply which makes for a very cool feeling on my skin that’s quite pleasant. I find it eases dullness nicely for me but doesn’t necessarily brighten up skin. It wears best over primer in my experience as I feel I get more of an airbrushed appearance this way. On bare skin (or with primer) it has a natural finish that looks like my skin just a bit better. I wouldn’t say it has the correcting abilities or benefits of some of the CC Creams I tried from Asia. I feel those offer a more brightening effect which is something I desire from a CC Cream. It does however, perfect quite nicely and sets a near perfect canvas for makeup. Unfortunately, the wear time seems shorter to me and I feel like my skin goes a little lackluster towards four hours of wear. So I do need a touch up to get a little glow back into my skin. Overall, Supergoop is one step down from a tinted moisturizer in terms of pigmentation. It’s very sheer, subtle but still manages to do a fairly good job perfecting. If your skin is already fairly clear and smooth you’ll find products like Supergoop Daily Correct CC Cream a good way to just tip over that already great skin into the realms of perfection. The lightweight texture makes it very easy to wear for Summer as well, I just wish it contains a smidge higher of an SPF…perhaps 50?

The fact we get really busy protecting our faces and sometimes forget our neck (for the love of beauty please don’t forget your neck!)! Fact, no one wants to walk around with finely lined lips one day so now is a good a time as any to start protecting them. Supergoop! Shine-On Lip Screen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 ($22) is basically a soft, shiny topcoat that you can apply on top of your favorite lipstick and it instantly creates an invisible UV Shield. Whether or not you run around the house shouting “UV SHIELD ACTIVATED!” after application is entirely up to you. I would, just sayin’. I would also create a cape out of a towel and put my hands on my hips as I said it to evoke my inner super hero. This is a clear top coat and it provides a water-resistant finish while protecting your lips from the sun. According to SuperGoop’s brand founder,”Dermatologists say that lip gloss is similar to holding a magnifying glass on your lips and can intensify UV rays.” Whaaaa?! Great now my lipgloss is a magnet for harmful sun rays! Note to self either buy some Supergoop! Shine-On Lip Screen or stop wearing super shiny lipgloss in the sun! Supergoop!

Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 40 ($32) joins the ranks of The Glossier Invisible Shield with a weightless, invisible formula that protects your skin from harmful UVA/UVB rays. Obviously, the appealing nature of this new formula is the promise of an invisible and weightless formula. One that absorbs quickly and wears well under other skincare while playing nicely with your makeup. US skincare routines and product launches have been evolving at a very rapid pace since many, many brands started sitting up and taking notice of Korean skincare routines and techniques. Although, I have to admit there are disappointment aspects of these new launches. For example, this year is beyond a doubt the year you’ll see facial sheet masks everywhere especially at the drugstore. I’ve even reviewed a few for you that recently released like Garnier Moisture Bomb The Super Hydrating Sheet Mask and Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask. So, why am I disappointed? Well, after using Korean facial sheet masks for many, many years I can safely say they are far superior to the ones I’ve tried from US brands thus far. I’m hoping as we see more launch this year from brands like Burt’s Bees, Soap and Glory, and Simple that they’ll prove more promising. On that note, I worry that if the lightweight, quick to absorb formula sunscreens we’ve seen from Asia, Japan in particularly , do go viral that they won’t be as poorly formulated as the sheet masks I’ve seen thus far. I am utterly spoiled by products like Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50 and Kanebo Allie Extra UV Gel Mineral . Our SPFs in the US are cloying, heavy, and just awful under makeup in my humble opinion. Japanese formulas are so light, easy to absorb, and wear so easily under makeup. Hopefully, Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen proves just as lovely. Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen is available now at sephora.com.

Yeah, it’s a multitasker. Available in two shades (Light and Light Medium) Physicians Formula Super CC Cover Powder will be launching at drugstores for the Spring 2014 season along with a new Super CC Cream from the brand. Take a look! I’ve always had fantastic success with Physicians Formula powders. Last year Physicians Formula Youthful Wear Cosmeceutical Youth Boosting Mattifying Face Powder was a formula I really enjoyed upon its release and still use to this day. I also love the old mosaic powder that PF used to have (or perhaps they still do?), it was HG (holy grail) for me for a long time. Physicians Formula Super CC Cover Powder comes in a dual compartment compact featuring the powder on top along with a mirror and small brush located in the bottom. I do a lot of complaining when it comes to the brushes that Physicians Formula includes with their products but the ones with their powders are always brilliant. This is a short hair, dense brush that allows you to sort of “shave”, for lack of a better word” the powder onto your face. This results in a beautiful airbrushed finish! The brush is dense but doesn’t shed nor is it scratchy on my face. It quite reminds me of the shorter bristles you’d find on the equally awesome Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Airbrushing Kabuki Brush. The formula of the Super CC Cover is very soft and silky. It doesn’t cling to my drier areas and has a soft even finish. The powder itself has color correcting shades in it so you’ll find spatters of pink, blue, and yellow. Although I feel like these small spatters are too tiny to actually correct major skin issues such as ruddiness or darkness. You’ll find this is sheer but has enough pigment to even out skin tone and create a very nice base for makeup. It is best suited as a finishing powder over BB Cream or Foundation but can also be worn as a very sheer layer of makeup should you desire. If you are wearing alone just don’t expect it to cover or correct major problems. Physicians Formula Super CC Cover Powder has one major problem though..or at least a problem for me. Typically the Light Medium shade is an excellent pick for my skin tone but this actually has a very pasty, chalky finish and doesn’t suit my skin tone at all unfortunately….! Sadness! Overall, Physicians Formula Super CC Cover Powder is a nice powder but I’m question its color correcting benefits. It might be a suitable pick for setting the CC Cream that is releasing along with it but to actually address color correcting on its own? Not happening…! This has a good texture but I’ve actually seen much better from Physicians Formula powders in the past. This will be available at drugstores shortly (or may already be depending on your location).

I really love how pro Maybelline is becoming! They kinda remind me of a MAC or Make Up For Ever with all their more “professional” makeup releases and fix products. This year, you’ll be seeing a lot of fix or as I call them pro products launching from Maybelline like makeup setting spray, eyeshadow primers, etc…. I like the idea of these products but also, in some cases, they can be a little expensive. But on that note I will say really simple products like transparent powder is kinda sorta hard to come by at the drugstore. I mean, don’t get me wrong, NYX and E.L.F. carry budget transparent powder but brands like Covergirl, Revlon, etc…don’t readily have one available (they have loose powders but they tend to come in colors versus a straight up silica powder). So that kinda gives Maybelline Master Fix Setting + Perfecting Powder a little bit of game at the drugstore. But as I said it can be expensive. Silica powder on and around the Internet isn’t mighty expensive from a variety of indie brands. Maybelline Master Fix Setting + Perfecting Powder is 0.21 oz in size and $9.99 in price. Chances are you’ll never pay $9.99 for it due to sales and such but if you’re one for pinching pennies you may feel the near $10 price tag is a bit much to splurge on simple transparent powder. For me, well, transparent powder is transparent powder no matter what brand does it. Maybelline’s version is no better and no worst than any other transparent powder out there. It’s soft, silky, applies transparent, and sets makeup to a smooth matte finish. I didn’t have issues with it clinging to my drier areas and it applied very smooth and silky giving my skin a perfected, flawless finish. I actually typically skip out on powder as I’m drier and I also feel a little too made up with it but I’ve been known to set with powder from time to time and in most cases it is with a transparent one like this. This is great for setting concealer or foundation for all day wear and it’ll also minimize the appearance of pores or finer lines plus reduces shine so it is a nice multitasking formula. Whether or not you feel Maybelline Master Fix Setting + Perfecting Powder is expensive or not depends where you typically purchase your transparent powder from. It could prove a budget pick for you or it could be a bit expensive if you’re more of a mineral indie user and purchaser. P.S. My swatch above is looking all kinds of dry! Sorry my skin is in dehydration mode at the moment! On that note I’ll say Maybelline Master Fix Setting + Perfecting Powder is soft, silky, easy to use, and sets makeup as it should.

Sheet masks are an important role in my skincare routine. I’ve been using them several years and I’m massive fan of Korean Sheet Masks in particular. It’s a common trend in Asia that has slowly starting become popular in the US but sadly, many of the sheet masks that have come out here haven’t been as great as the ones here. Neutrogena is selling these in two formula each of which contains a one time use mask for around $2.99 to $4 depending where you purchase them. This is gel mask that contains two pieces. One piece should be applied to the upper portion of your face (eyes) and the second should be applied to your lower face (chin, lips, etc…). I’ve run across sheet masks like this before but I don’t particular likely them as I tend to pat my face mask as I wear it to allow the product to absorb into my skin. Doing so with a sheet mask that is in two parts is difficult because it ends up slipping off. Which by the way it does quite often since this is a gel-like texture and not a traditional cotton fiber mask which means as it applies easy enough but it slips off through the wear if you aren’t laying down and stationary. It’s just messy and a pain to use. Not only is it awkward to use and wear but it’s formulated with more fragrance than Hyaluronic Acid. The ingredient are terribly disappointing and not exactly super hydrating. After using it I didn’t feel super hydrated or softened after using it. There are far better sheet masks available with a host of excellent ingredients that will hydrate your skin. I was disappointed with this. I really wish that the US market will catch up with the Korean ones when it comes to creating affordable, beneficial sheet masks. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask is available now at drugstores and amazon.com , target.com and walmart.com. Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Propanediol, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Gum, Xanthan Gum, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Chlorphenesin, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Chloride, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Sucrose Cocoate, Tocopherol, Blue 1 You may also enjoy...

You know me, I’m a sheet mask junkie so, of course, I had to try out Garnier’s newest line of sheet masks. Garnier launched these in three formulas but it isn’t the first time the brand ventured into the world of sheet masks. Some of you might recall the Garnier Skin Renew Dark Spot Treatment Mask which launched a few years ago. At the time, Garnier was one of the first drugstore brands in the US to have a box of sheet masks available. Surprisingly they never did continue with the trend and it sort of died away. At this point, there are plenty of different sheet mask options available at both the drugstore and higher-end stores like Sephora. But Garnier hasn’t launched one since 2013 and needless to say, it’s nice to see them getting back in on the game again. Let’s take a look! Garnier Moisture Bomb The Super Hydrating Sheet Mask are available for $2.99 each or Amazon.com has boxes of six available for $14. I haven’t personally since them available in six packs at stores as of yet. As I mentioned above they come in three different formulas the one I have her is a soothing formula that’s free of mineral oil and petrolatum. It contains chamomile extract which apparently soothes skin. This is a water based and glycerin formula which is where it gets its hydration factor from but a quick glance at the ingredients is a let down because it does also contain p-Anisic acid which isn’t particularly great for sensitive users and also, lower on the list you’ll find Sodium Hyaluronate. According to Garnier, the mask contains Hyaluronic Acid but it’s not listed and considering Hyaluronic Acid and Sodium Hyaluronate are used interchangeable in the beauty world I assume that’s where they base their Hyaluronic Acid off of. It’s a little disappointing to say the least. Apparently each mask contains half a bottle of serum but I find that questionable considering my track record with using a variety of sheet masks that have much, much more essence. This mask was nicely saturated but I don’t think there was an entire half a bottle of serum in it. The mask is made from a durable cotton fiber that didn’t tear but the mask fit a little poorly on my face as it didn’t adhere well under my eyes and was a little too big around the mouth area. I typically like my masks to fit like a second skin and particularly like them to fit well under my eyes. As hey, I want to get good moisture under my eyes as well as on my face when I’m wearing a sheet mask. This was kind of held away from my eyes and no matter how much I patted they’d just pop back up again. If you’ve never used a sheet mask they are simply a cotton fiber mask that has cut outs for your eyes, lips, and nose which are saturated with essence. You place them on your face for 20 to 30 minutes and let them work your magic (no need to rinse after removing the mask, just pat your skin to absorb the excess essence). This particularly formula was created to calm and sooth skin while hydrating skin. But you can buy any number of different masks that address a slew of issues. The mask has a very, very, very light barely there fragrance but in all honesty, if you have sensitive skin they should have considered eliminating the fragrance all together in my opinion. It provided nice hydration and the envelope contained a good deal of essence which I squeezed out and patted on my skin after I removed the mask. It was nicely hydrating but I wouldn’t say it it provided intense moisture. I’m a little bit of a mask snob and a lot of my Asian Sheet Masks are way more hydrating than this was. All in all, it’s nice to see Garnier back in the mask game. Although, I wouldn’t say the Garnier Moisture Bomb The Super Hydrating Sheet Mask in the soothing formula isn’t quite perfect for sensitive users. It is a nice budget friendly option that will hydrate skin in a hurry but if you’re curious about sheet masks you might want to try this one out! It’s a good introduction to sheet masks and easy enough to find at drugstores. Garnier Moisture Bomb The Super Hydrating Sheet Mask is available at ulta.com , walmart.com , and amazon.com.

I have to admit I actually love these a little more than My Beauty Diary Facial Sheet Masks . Gasp I know, I should be shot for saying that. Let’s take a look! A single box contains eight individually wrapped sheet masks for $10 at Sasa.com. I think you can understand why I was averse to paying near $3 for the Banila Co Tea Party Packs I recently reviewed after seeing how much more you can get with sheet masks. This a two part mask which has a tear off packet which contains extra essence to be applied after the sheet mask. Sheet Masks are made from thinner cotton fiber and have holes for your mouth, eyes, and nose. They are heavily saturated with an essence which makes them wet to the touch. Typically you can apply them for 20-30 minutes. The Shea Butter Masks supposedly contains shea butter which aids in improving elasticity. My skin is fairly firm already so I used these as a source of moisture. They are SUPER moisturizing and really leave my skin soft and supple after use. The great thing is the more moisture my skin gets the less dull it appears so a twice weekly treatment with these leaves my skin looking brighter, happier, and healthier. The package of extra essence is a gel-like texture that leaves my skin slightly tacky after use but I don’t mind as the amount of hydration it provides is worth the stickiness. On the down side I found this mask was thinner and it tore easily when I patted it through the wear. I also didn’t love the wear as the mouth section was a little large and hung off my chin. It was just ill fitting. Aside from that minor issue I’d say the Shea Butter My Scheming formula was a win. If your skin is dry you need these. You may also enjoy...

As you already know Garnier released their new sheet masks in three different formulas one of which mattifies skin, another that soothes , and yet another that hydrates . This new one seems to be created for tired, duller skin. It just popped up out of nowhere as it wasn’t part of the original release. I’ve tried two of the three that are currently available and I’m on the fence about them. They are ok but I’m a little spoiled and really enjoy my Asian Sheet Masks much better. This new Anti-Fatigue formula is a water-based formula like the others which contains hyaluronic acid to plump, hydrate, and help skin to retain moisture. It also includes sakura extract to illuminate and add radiance to your complexion. Apparently each mask has over a half a bottle of essence/serum.

I purchased two boxes recently at my local Walgreens as, well, I was pretty darn excited facial sheet masks were available so locally. I mean, we are sorely lacking in the sheet mask scene here in the US. We have a few higher end brands that offer them but they aren’t readily available at the drugstore. Within Asia the sheet mask is extremely common with a wide variety of brands that are cheap as chips. Sadly, here in the US that selection is kinda sparse if not completely non-existent. Garnier Skin Renew Dark Spot Treatment Masks are a follow up on Garnier’s popular Dark Spot Skincare products. These masks address dark spots, dullness, and uneven skin tone. Sounds great right? Unfortunately Skin Renew Dark Spot Corrector and Skin Renew Dark Spot Overnight Peel didn’t really do it for me but I was excited to try out the Dark Spot Treatment Masks in the hopes they would actually brighten up my duller skin. These come in a box that includes ten individually wrapped masks for $16.99. Each mask supposedly contains 1/2 bottle of hydrating serum based on a 1 oz bottle. The masks are a typical thinner cotton fiber with holes for your eyes, lips, and nose. They fit very well and have a stretch so you can maneuver them around if your face is wider or longer. I’ve been through tons of masks and I must say I was impressed with the fit of this. It just fit perfectly. The eyes were lined up perfect as was the mouth. It didn’t tear easily either and remained perfectly fit through the wear. Now it addresses a host of problems from dark spots to dullness and even uneven skin tone while hydrating. It contains a stable form of Vitamin C that brightens and creates a more radiant finish according to Garnier. It’s a great mask all around. It hydrates very well and has a good deal of essence in each mask so they feel quite saturated and stay quite “wet” through the wear. My face feels nice and smooth after and more supple not sticky or tacky. It does have a fresh citrus-like scent that might prove irritating to some but I had no issues. Garnier suggests ten minutes of wear but I went ahead and did twenty without a problem. I do 20-30 anyway with sheet masks so I had no issues here. If you’re in it for the hydrating factor you’ll be pleased however, for brightening and whitening or addressing dark spots I can’t say it really worked. I killed a box off and started on a second box and their claim that using the mask three times a week will result in brighter skin is unfortunately not true in my case. I have minor darkness on my jaw line and of course, duller, lackluster skin that can use brightening up. This provides fairly great moisture but as far as addressing dullness or dark spots it unfortunately disappointed me. It also happens to be a little pricey because even after shipping you can get far better sheet masks from Asia for less than $16.99. The good news is that we’ve evolved! Finally facial sheet masks have reached US shores! Hopefully more brands catch on to the trend and we continue to see other brands introducing their own variations. It is rather brilliant being able to walk into the drugstore and purchasing a box of sheet masks without worrying about airmail prices! These are available now at drugstores. Anyone try them?

Sadness! Garnier Clean Nourishing Cleansing Oil (4.2 oz) is actually recommended for dry skin which surprised me as typically cleansing oils can be used by most all skin types as they rinse clean away. The first thought that enters anyone’s mind who hasn’t tried cleansing oil before is, “Oh that’s going to leave my skin so shiny!” But that’s not the case at all as cleansing oil emulsifies and rinses clean away! Unfortunately the main ingrident here is mineral oil. Most cleansing oils are mineral oil based however, some folks have sensitive skin or feel like mineral oil breaks them out or clogs there pores, etc…etc…I personally don’t have an issue with the ingredient myself. I admit when I purchased this I expected it to make my skin tight or dry after use but I was pleasantly surprised it did not. It’s almost as nice as Fancl’s Cleansing Oil in the fact that it has absolutely no effect on my skin at all. It doesn’t hydrate nor does it dry out my skin, it merely whisks away makeup and that’s it. That’s just right for me! It has a soft, floral scent which surprised me as Garnier is legendary for creating very powerfully scented skincare products. Apparently it contains Jojoba and Macadamia Oils to replenish moisture but I didn’t really feel it added any moisture or too any away from my skin. This is used like any Cleansing Oil formula! I personally remove my eye makeup prior to using cleansing oil. After that step I take about two to three pumps of the oil and massage it on my dry face now I use a little water to emulsify the cleansing oil and I keep massaging around my face. As the cleansing oil emulsifies you’ll notice it’ll go milky. After this step simply rinse! The formula does leave my eyes slightly cloudy after use but most do so this isn’t anything to worry about. The oil is a thicker yet runny consistency that feels very moisturizing going on but rinses clean away after use. It doesn’t leave a film, stickiness, or oiliness after use. It removes all my makeup beautifully and easily. Garnier recommends following up with a cream cleanser after. Typically I do a pre-wash with cleansing oil and follow up with a foaming cleanser of some sort but if you’re feeling lazy this does a fairly perfect job of makeup in a flash so no need for a secondary cleanser! I wouldn’t say this will break down harder to remove waterproof mascara but as I mentioned above I remove my eye makeup prior anyway with an oil based eye makeup remover so don’t rely on it to completely get off eye makeup! Garnier Clean Nourishing Cleaning Oil is really good. I don’t love the smaller size (4.2 oz) and the bigger price tag ($9.99)….I’d love an 8 oz bottle at this price but overall, the formula is excellent and worked beautifully for me. I’m quite happy about this as I’m sure I’ll still want to buy any and all new Asian Cleansing Oils that release but I love that if I need to restock on cleansing oil I won’t be waiting on airmail anymore! I can simply hop to the drugstore and grab this up! I’ll def be repurchasing in the future. Tried it? Love to hear your thoughts! You may also enjoy...

Skin Renew 5 Second Blur Instant Smoother is a newly launched facial primer that’s available at drugstores for the Spring 2014 season and will later becomes apart of Garnier’s permanent line of skincare products. Garnier Skin Renew 5 Second Blur Instant Smoother is a take on L’Oreal Revitalift Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother Finishing Cream with a far nicer price tag of $16.99. Considering silicone primers are a little sparse in the drugstore world this is potentially an excellent pick up for those who love and enjoy products like Smashbox Photofinish Primer. Take a look! Garnier Skin Renew 5 Second Blur Instant Smoother is a classic take on the silicone facial primer formula. They market this as a way to blur the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and pores in as little as 5 seconds. Simply apply a small amount after moisturizer and prior to makeup to prep skin for foundation. For a drugstore facial primer this isn’t a bad thing to go with especially if you’re just looking for something to fill and blur smaller pores. Essentially it is made up of dimethicone so not really all that much goes into the ingredients or the fanfare of the product. You get 1.0 oz of product per a squeeze tube and it should literally last you ages because a little goes a long way. I have drier skin so it doesn’t do me any favors sadly and I think even oily skin might have a hiccup or two with it as it does have a fairly greasy feel. You definitely get that traditional mix of creamy velvet-ness versus a powdery dry down but there’s also a slickness to the formula as well. I do not have larger pores and I do have drier skin however, around my nose I do have smaller visible pores that I like to cover up with primer. This does ok blurring the look of those pores however, applied all over I feel like it sits rather unnaturally atop of my dry skin. It isn’t itchy thankfully which is a common problem I face with Smashbox’s Photofinish. It doesn’t pill either (roll off in tiny pieces) which is good but I feel like it’s a touch too heavy and on my drier areas it seems to catch and cling although not visibly if that makes sense. I have a strong feeling those with oily skin might not love the mattifying abilities here as it seems to create a good deal of slickness going on and might potentially create shine as the day progresses rather than actually curb it. The formula is a creamy consistency and of course, has that soft powdery silicone feel with a very light translucent pink shade. Unlike many Garnier products this does not have a fragrance so good news for those sensitive to fragrance in their skincare. I’m really on the fence about Garnier Skin Renew 5 Second Blur Instant Smoother since I’ve only been able to test on my drier skin. I’d like to see how it performs when I’m a bit more oily in the Summer. In the end, I think I’m feeling like I enjoyed L’Oreal Miracle Blur a good deal more than this. It is nice to see so the drugstore facial primer world catching up the the mid-range brands though as I think the variety of facial primers are a bit sparse at the drugstore. Do I think you need to indulge? Maybe if it goes on sale but don’t run out the door for this one quite yet. Tried it? Love to hear your thoughts on it do share! You may also enjoy...

Well, maybe not completely pore free. L’Oreal latest facial primer takes on pores and shine with a new formula that refines and smooths the look of your skin. I mean we already have L’Oreal Miracle Blur do we need another face primer? Obviously we do PEEPS so here it is a way to vanish pores for good? Maybe. I dunno. Probably. Not really. Last year L’Oreal created Miracle Blur and sort of made a break through into the drugstore facial primer world with it. This Spring the trend continues as Garnier competes by releasing their new 5 Sec Perfect Blur Primer. Granted it’s not to say that we didn’t have facial primers at the drugstore before but they are kinda limited aren’t they? Plus they next generations formulas promise to treat skin as well as primer which even mid to high end brands dare not go to. L’Oreal Youth Code Texture Perfector Pore Vanisher ($24.99) does not have an SPF but it is apparently marketed to improve overall skin time over time. Targeted LHA micro-exfoliates according to L’Oreal smooth the skin’s surface and absorb excess oil for a shine-free finish for up to eight hours and the high concentrate of perline-p strengthens and tightens pores which means they apparently shrink over time. I don’t have large visible pores but let’s be honest for a second here. If you do have larger pores at this point you have probably tried everything to shrink them and nothing has probably worked so I do have my doubts whether L’Oreal Pore Youth Code Texture Perfector Pore Vanisher is going to all incredible shrinking woman on your pores. Off topic, dontcha love the Little Bar of Soap song from that movie? So for silicone haters like yours truly you’ll be happy to know this is a traditional texture. It isn’t velvety or powdery and it just doesn’t have that odd silicone-free that I associate with products like Smashbox Photo Finish. It does however, have silicones. It’s tinted a nude flesh shade but doesn’t actually even out skin tone or offer any coverage. It has a slight fresh scent but nothing too dramatic. The texture is that of a gel which absorbs easily at first application but has a semi-matte finish after fully blended out. I have larger visible pores on my nose and it did blur their appearance slightly but honestly, Miracle Blur does a better job of this. I’m doubtful anyone with larger pores on their face will be terribly impressed with the end result as it only does minimal blurring duty it seems. At first my drier skin loves the texture but I was surprised how oily my t-zone and lower jaw line got about three hours into the wear. The texture does have me doubting it’ll curve super oily skin and in my experience may even create shine and oil. Interesting idea but I think Miracle Blur is a better product. L’Oreal Youth Code Texture Perfector Pore Vanisher just didn’t cut it for me. Love the texture but the actually mattifying and blurring abilities are called into question after my tests with it. You might wish to pick it up if you find it on sale and give a try for yourself. If you do, I’d love to hear what you think! Available now at drugstores. You may also enjoy...

This new 24 hour hydration formula is a new take on L’Oreal Revitalift Miracle Blur Skin Smoother that released last year. I really liked the original formula and I have drier skin so I was excited about a new hydrating formula in this product. Let’s take a look! I’ve been using L’Oreal Revitalift Moisture Blur Instant Skin Smoother Moisturizer for about two weeks now under my makeup and as a primer. They call it a moisturizer and it can act as a sort of lightweight moisturizer but I do prefer it as a facial primer versus a daily moisturizer. I prep my skin with SPF and moisturizer as I normally would and when I’m done with my hair I proceed to do my makeup and the first step is applying this to prep so I use it as a facial primer. Of course, it doesn’t have a good deal of moisture so it could work as a lighter moisturizer should you prefer to use it this way plus it does provide continuous moisture as the day progresses and this is surely is a very big plus. Apparently it addresses and corrects fine lines and wrinkles over time while firming skin. It also offers Opti-Blur technology which diffuses the look of finer lines and wrinkles blurring their appearance while giving skin all day hydration. It contains the same Revitalift Pro-Retino A that can be found in many of the Revitalift Skincare products which aids in reducing fine lines and wrinkles over time. I don’t have finer lines or wrinkles on my face just under my eyes. However, I like the original Instant Skin Smoother because it did a great job blurring the appearance of the larger pores around on my nose. I have smaller pores everywhere else but this did a nice job of blurring the appearance of the ones on my nose. I have drier skin and the original formula was quite nice. It left my skin soft, smooth, and prepped well for makeup. It also extended my foundation wear as it gave my base something to grip on to which in turn allowed it to remain fresher for longer. I have drier skin so who am I to say no to a new formula that addresses such a problem. This isn’t as thick as the original nor does it feel as silicone-like in texture. I’d liken it to a thicker version of Clinique Superprimer Universal Face Primer . There are cones to be had here but the creamier consistency of the product absorbs easily into skin and doesn’t sit on top of skin the way a more traditional silicone face primer would. There’s plenty of moisture here…I wouldn’t say 24 hours worth but enough to keep skin smooth and hydrated through an 8 hour period especially skin that may suffering from dryness caused by aging skin. The primer gives skin a smoother appearance and it does indeed blur the appearance of the pores around my nose just as well as the original formula. I like the soft, smooth finish it gives to my skin and how easily my foundation applies due to this. BB Cream typically lasts a full eight hours on my skin where as regular foundation products tend to fade around hour five this gives me an extra hour or two when I’m wearing regular foundation and keeps flaky, drier areas smooth and soft so my foundation isn’t laying patchy on those areas! Overall, if you liked the original Instant Skin Smoother formula I’m positive you’ll adore L’Oreal Revitalift Moisture Blur Instant Skin Smoother Moisturizer as well especially if your skin is dry! L’Oreal released this just in time for the long winter ahead when my skin really needs the extra hydration! Likey! Available now at drugstores (I purchased mine at Walgreens). Tried it? Love the original? I’d love to hear it! You may also enjoy...

I actually love the original L’Oreal Revitalift Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother but didn’t experience the oily skin phenomenon that many people did with their first use. However, in the Summer I have to say, those people that ranted, were right! It seems like Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother’s formula gives me the option to fry french fries on my face in the warmer weather should I like! Few holy slickness Batman! So needless to say the new L’Oreal Revitalift Oil Free Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother was a tasty little morsel for me to purchase and tuck away for Summer use when I shelve the regular version. Here’s some thoughts! L’Oreal calls it the 30 second miracle to blur the appearance of wrinkles, lines, and pores and actually I experienced that with the original. Not that I have finer lines or larger pores but it just softened and smoothed the entire appearance of my face and completely erased the larger pores I do have on my nose! The original formula had an SPF 30 but Revitalift Oil Free Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother does not have any SPF. I’m not really keen on this new version. The original was a creamy silicone consistency and this is a clear, thicker silicone much like Smashbox’s Primer (which I dislike). Thankfully it doesn’t make me itch like the Smashbox formula however, it does pill when I apply it so be very careful during application. The original formula could be used over foundation however, this is a more traditional facial primer and is meant to be worn under foundation or alone after moisturizer (seriously, I never wear primer alone who does that?). It has a slippery yet velvety feel with a semi-matte finish. I’m doubtful it’ll curb oil for very long but the initial application does create a smooth semi-matte finish. It does a fairly good job concealing the pores on my nose and just creating a more uniformed smoother appearance across my face. I didn’t experience a longer wear in my foundation using it however, it sets a nice canvas for makeup. I do prefer the original version but I imagine those who want something oil free would enjoy this formula. Dare I say it kinda reminds me of the consistency of Monistat (which has been known to act as a facial primer for some). I think I’ll skip on this one and stick to the old formulation. Tried it?

Clinique Superprimer Universal Face Primer takes us back to the basics. No tint, no color correcting abilities, just an awesomely hydrating primer that aids foundation in looking its very best. Take a peek! As you know the main line of Clinique Superprimers have color correcting abilities. But what if you don’t really need or want a color correcting primer? Personally I tried some of the color correcting Superprimers and thought them a touch to subtle to color correct well however, I also took took notice they were a silicone based primer and I personally prefer something a touch more hydrating for my skin type. In steps Clinique Superprimer Universal Face Primer! This is a completely different texture than the other Superprimers as it has a hydrating creamy feel and look. This absorbs easily into drier skin and provides basic moisture which allows foundation an easier glide onto skin and provides a solid base for that foundation to adhere to. This result is your foundation looking smooth and less patchy on uneven, drier areas of your face. It seems to provide fairly good moisture for me so my skin is nice and soft throughout the day but not greasy or shiny. It won’t mattify for those with oily skin but such a skin type can easily use it if you prefer a facial primer with less of a powdery, velvety feel that’s clearly silicone formulated. It will fill smaller pores but if you have larger pores or finely lined skin I do suggest a more silicone-like texture to not only fill these areas but also blur the appearance of them. If you’ve been shopping the Superprimers but having a hard time deciding on a formula I think Clinique Superprimer Universal Face Primer covers drier and combination skin types perfectly. It’s an ideal primer for those looking for a primer to ease their foundation application and allows skin to retain moisture while setting the canvas for extended makeup wear. I liked this one a lot and could see myself using it daily. It’s available now at Clinique counters or online at clinique.com Tried any of the Superprimers yet? Do share! You may also enjoy...

These new primers aren’t only prep for makeup but are also tinted for color correcting benefits as well. The discolourations formula is a peach shade which benefits uneven skin tone and darkness. Let’s look at the discolourations formula. Clinique Discolourations SuperPrimer Face Primer is a light shade of peach which addresses discolorations on skin or unevenness. Thus far I’ve tried a few of these primers and have been disappointed with the tint being so subtle. The discolorations formula is actually the only formula that’s worked for me so far. It doesn’t actually even out my complexion or take care of darkness but it just gives a brighter appearance. I admit I’ve even gone so far as to use it alone sans any foundation on top as it gives a nice natural finish to my skin. It is however, a little disappointing if you expect it to even out your skin tone completely as it is a little subtly tinted to do that. Apply a small amount of the primer to prep skin and follow up with foundation. It has a soft creamy texture that dries down to a powdery feel. It is silicone based but it isn’t itchy or uncomfortable and it will provide a matte finish but that doesn’t accentuate drier areas in the least. I find it blurs the appearance of the smaller pores on my nose well and lays a good canvas for my makeup to adhere to. The Clinique Discolourations SuperPrimer Face Primer was one of the best formulas in this release. I liked how my face looked wearing it and felt like it gave me a nice natural appearance even without the addition of foundation. However, it still is a little too subtle to offer major correcting abilities. Tried it? Do share! You may also enjoy...

There are several color correcting formulas available in this new face primer so depending on your issue you’ll find a match for your skin tone, type, and issue. Just like foundation, Clinique offers their new Superprimer Face Primers in a diverse range of tones to address complexion issues we all face daily and help to bring us a step closer to the flawless finish we desire. Take a look! Considering I suffer from duller, tired skin the Clinique Dullness SuperPrimer Face Primer formula is an ideal pick for me. This comes in a squeeze tube bottle and is a pale shade of baby pink. I’ve actually been recommended colors for dullness before such as lilac but never pink so I was curious how I’d feel coming out of this experience. These new customized primers help prep and correct skin prior to foundation application. The texture is a creamy velvety feel that you’d commonly associate with a silicone primer however, the creaminess lends a certain lightness to the product which means it wears quite comfortably for me. I typically have problems with silicone primers being itchy but this was quite lightweight and comfortable to wear. It does indeed contain silicone polymers to fill pores, blur the appearance of finer lines, and create a more uniformed smoothness to skin. It’s oil-free so it’s perfect for sensitive skin types. Once applied my skin feels smooth and soft with a velvet-like finish that’s almost powdery. I don’t have visible pores on my face but do have ones on my nose and this does a fine job of filling and blurring their appearance perfectly. The extra layer the primer creates will keep oil at bay as well so skin has a smooth, semi-matte finish for foundation to adhere to allowing it to wear longer and stronger. Now the Dullness formula is pink as a mentioned above and is supposed to create a more vibrant, radiant finish on skin. I think it’s a little too sheer for my skin to ease dullness completely so as a primer it works out fine but for color correcting I thought it was a touch too sheer. You’ll notice it brightens just a smidge or at least it did on my skin tone and after this you’ll have to rely on either your BB Cream or foundation to create a more flawless finish that eases dullness. Overall, as a primer Clinique Dullness Superprimer Face Primer works a treat but you might need a little more help when it comes to the correcting abilities.

you’re keeping up with the latest foreign beauty imports you probably know that late 2013 and into 2014 the popular Japanese Konjac sponge is getting some publicity here in the US. The Konjac sponge is made from the root of a konjac plant and starts out life as a hard, gritty sponge that gets super squishy and soft when you dampen it with water. It’s used in Asia because of its ability to dislodge dirt, oil, and blackheads aiding in giving you a deeper facial cleansing experience. Konjac sponge not only get your skin squeaky clean but also gently exfoliate your skin as you clean it. It also helps you use a lot less cleanser since it creates literally mounds of lather and foam. It quickly dries out once you’re done using it and this supposedly prevents bacteria and mold from building up however, you still have to toss it after a few months of uses. Konjac sponges are particularly great for those with clogged pores as the fibers of the sponge gently unplug pores! Which is why you might be slightly intimidated by the $18 Boscia Konjac Cleansing Sponge so why not check out the konjac trend and craze at a cheaper price? Eco Tools now has their own Konjac Pure Complexion Facial Sponge at a mere $5.99. I haven’t yet tried it but at $5.99 it’s considerably easier on your wallet and you won’t have to go E-bay or online shopping for a cheaper Japanese Konjac when you can pick one up at your local drugstore. This natural vegetable fiber sponge contains exfoliating bamboo charcoal that is handmade with 100% natural ingredients, including konjac vegetable fiber and bamboo charcoal.

Recently, Sephora launched two new shades of their Microsmooth Baked Sculpting Contour Trios in Sublime and Spirited for Spring 2015 and Sublime is a perfect little switch up for the more expensive Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powders. Take a look! Sephora MicroSmooth Baked Sculpting Contour Trio is made up of three gradating shades of soft, silky highlighter powder. I know people who automatically see the words “baked” cringe! Personally I’m a huge fan of baked shadows, baked blushes, etc…don’t let your hate of baked sway you from trying this palette as the texture is divine and very close to the silkiness of Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder. The soft shimmery, beige peach shades remind me of my own Radiant Hourglass Palette and also reminds me of shades in the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Palette ! Not exact dupes mind you but the texture and look of the shades on skin do very much remind me of Hourglass’s much more expensive formula. The Microsmooth Baked Sculpting Contour Trio has a very soft shimmery finish. I wouldn’t recommend it all over use but you can use it in key areas around your face to add a touch of luminosity. It’s especially handy to have around if you contour your face as this makes for a perfect way to follow up with a highlighter. The texture is divine on this powder. It’s very soft, silky, and easy to blend. The colors are quite universally flattering as they’ll look great on lighter skin and even better on darker. If you’re not looking to spend near $50 bucks on Hourglass’s powder, I’d say that Sephora MicroSmooth Baked Sculpting Contour Trio in Sublime is a nice little switch up!

Ya know, some folks said these reminded them of Milani Baked Blush but I’m getting more of a Laura Geller Blush n Brighten from them. Anyone try ’em yet? One thing that surprised me about these was the size. The compact are actually a bit smaller than the Hourglass Ambient Lighting ones! The consistency reminds me of the matte Laura Geller Sugar Free Blush n Brighten. It’s a very soft slightly chalky texture. For some reason I thought they’d have a good deal of shimmer and sparkle but these are very, very low key in the sparkle department. Radiant Magenta, Diffused Heat, Dim Infusion, Mood Exposure Hourglass Diffused Heat Ambient Lighting Blush Hourglass Dim Infusion Ambient Lighting Blush Hourglass Mood Exposure Ambient Lighting Blush Hourglass Radiant Magneta Ambient Lighting Blush I haven’t yet fully tested them so I’m working through them now and will review as soon as I have. I still want to pick up the other two shades available but they sold out before I had the chance! Anyone try these yet? I’d love to hear your thoughts! They launch officially this February at Sephora, Sephora.com, and at hourglasscosmetics.com. You may also enjoy...

Unlike traditional finishing powder, Hourglass Ambient Lighting filters out harsh light and refines the appearance of your complexion for a beautiful, luminous glow. Giving skin that lit from within glow with a soft, smoother, more youthful finish. The powder is available in six shades to fit a variety of different skin tones. Take a look! I tried out the Hourglass Radiant Light Ambient Lighting Powder which is a golden beige with subtle golden shimmer. It was created to add warmth to the complexion of your face. On my skin this gives a faint peach tint to my skin and creates a smother, softer appearance. It has a hint of peachy orange to it with a finer golden shimmer. The powder is very, very soft and feels like silky. It blends easily and doesn’t accentuate my drier skin in the least. It has a soft, translucent powder texture and adds warmth and a soft glow to my cheeks and face whenever I wear it. It isn’t completely without color because anytime I wear it I feel like it gives extra depth and intensity to my blush shade and adds a glowing warmth to my skin. I use a bushier brush or a fan brush to gently sweep it across my face after I apply BB Cream and Blush. It sets makeup to a perfect finish and allows my base foundation or BB Cream to wear a little longer. I’m not typically one for recommending highlighting powders because I find them difficult to use but Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder is actually a no brainer. Simply sweep it on for warmth, radiance, and a luminous soft glow on skin without any no how, fall out, or mess. Beautiful! Very worth picking up. It’s the ideal way to complete your makeup look!

This was released some time ago in a QVC Special Value Set but Laura has never actually made the Dreamsicle Blush available outside of that set. GASP! Horror! I ended up hauling it off Evil-bay for a reasonable $20 price tag so if you’re wanting it after this review best get your auction shoes on. Laura Geller Dreamsicle Blush n Brighten is a sweet selection of orange-y coral, pink, and banana cream shades. It evokes a beautiful flush of orange coral on my cheek bones with a natural glow. The formula is a baked design with a silky smooth texture that applies and blends onto cheek bones. I’ve always been a huge fan of Laura’s Blush n Brighten and have practically all the shades she’s done so scoring Dreamsicle almost completely my collection. If you’re a lover of cooler peach tones I think you’ll adore the shade. It’s one of Laura Geller’s best colors in my humble opinion! Hopefully one day she actually launches it permanently!

Delizioso Pink Baked Powder Blush ($7.99) is one of two new Matte Baked Blushes that Milani released for Spring 2014. You might be privy to the original Baked Powder Blush formula which was all ABOUT sparkle but these two new shades are smooth, matte, and shimmer-free. Take a look! Milani Delizioso Pink Baked Powder Blush is the more subtle of the two newest shades. Granted, it isn’t any lightweight as it is a beautiful bubble pink! But it is the shade that’s a bit less dramatic. Milani Delizioso Pink Baked Powder Blush This is a pretty cool shade of medium pink with a soft, matte finish. It’s a little chalky but this isn’t a bad thing as it packs incredible pigment with a beautiful soft focused finish. The color is rather true to pan but it does have more of a reddish undertone on my cheeks versus a blue one as seen in the pan. It’s a very soft, finely milled textured that blends easily. I would suggest using a bushy brush for application since you can easily over do this one. A bushier brush ensures you get light, even color on cheeks but without a clown-y finish! It wears for a solid eight hours on my face without fading. Milani Delizioso Pink Baked Powder Blush Swatches I really wish Milani would revise their packaging. This comes in a mirrored gold dual compartment that features the blush on the upside and a brush in the compartment below. For me the packaging is a little cheesy and it gets scratched up really fast. Milani really should do something black and basic for their collection in my humblest. The brush included is actually quite nice! Soft bristles, no shedding, and handy if you’re applying on the go but you can easily over do this shade with this style brush so go lightly if you are using it on the go! Milani did a fabulous job launching their Baked Powder Blush in matte finishes. I love the old formulation just as much but sometimes the shimmer can be a little much! These are smooth, easy to apply, and long wearing. Hopefully they consider doing more matte shades in the future. Available now at drugstores. You may also enjoy...

Milani brought back last year’s very popular Rose Blush Collection in four new shades for the Spring season. These were so popular last year and sold out quite fast. Up until now they have been kinda hard to find but recently I’m noticing more and more Walgreens putting out displays so if you’re in the New York area be on the look out. Milani Tea Rose Rose Powder Blush is a dusky medium shade of pink with a matte finish. These blushes have been getting a bad wrap for being too dry, powdery, even chalky and hard to blend. I really didn’t have too many issues with them and I actually love them…! If anything at all they are too PIGMENTED! I find that the best application is with a bushy brush because they are powdery and as I swipe a brush into them I come away with a good deal of product. A bushier brush allows you to easily tap off excess and blend out lightly for a sheerer a finish as they are pretty fully on if you aren’t careful. They blend quite nicely on my cheeks but I recommend a lot of prepping prior as I can see them possibly applying patchy on drier cheeks. I have drier skin so I know! But I can get a lovely seamless finish just by lighting dusting onto my face. I get a bit of dryness and I can see why people say they are chalky but the shade blends out to a fairly nice finish for me with a wear of around five hours before showing minor fading at hour six. If you have ruddiness or redness in your cheeks already this honestly isn’t going to help the problem so again I suggest prepping well prior to application. Tea Rose is bright and vibrant but can easily be sheerer out for a more natural flush or on darker skin tones I’m sure you’ll appreciate the vibrancy and pigment. Of course, one of the most appealing aspects of the blush is the pretty rose design. The blush has a 3D, slightly raised rose in full bloom shape. The design will last through many uses as it isn’t an imprint or an over spray! Overall, I honestly loved Milani Tea Rose Rose Powder Blush and I’m looking forward to trying the other shades!

I’ve had hit and miss issues with the newer Milani Rose Blushes. Some are great but some are a bit too dry and bright and this falls true for Lady Rouge. Take a peek! Milani Lady Rouge Rose Powder Blush Milani Lady Rouge Rose Powder Blush is one of four new, limited edition Rose Powder Blushes that launched this Spring. I’m starting to see more and more displays of these at Walgreens so now is a good as any to discuss them. This is a matte finish blush with a dryer, dense texture. The dryness actually isn’t much of an issue or at least it hasn’t up until now. I thought Lady Rouge was a touch to difficult to work with. It’s a bit powdery and has a drier, almost chalky texture that applies patchy and proves difficult to blend out. It’s extremely pigmented and I think that’s one of the reasons I had issues. The incredible pigmentation and dryness come together to create a very poor blending experience so I end up with patchy, clown-y cheeks as I can’t sheer the shade out well no matter how hard I work at it. Even applies very minimally I find the shade is just too pigmented and requires a very heavy hand to blend it to the best finish possible. Beware you need only use a tiny amount as this one packs pigment majorly. I think if you spend the time and effort to blend it well it looks incredible. The color is smooth without clinging to drier areas and has a certain airbrushed appearance. However, it takes a lot of effort to get it applied and blended out correctly to obtain that look due to the over pigmentation and drier formula. Milani Lady Rouge Rose Powder Blush Swatches Overall, Milani Lady Rouge Rose Powder Blush wasn’t my favorite shade of the four releases due to the trouble I had blending it. If you have time and patience this one might be worthy of a pick up especially because the shade is truly gorgeous especially for Summer looks and over a tan! However, if you lack the patience this color can easily frustrate users and too much can look patchy and even clown-like if you aren’t careful!

There’s already a wide array of beautiful Baked Blush shades that Milani offers in their permanent collection but they are sadly lacking in any matte shades. I imagine this is exciting for those who aren’t fans of shimmer! Take a look! Milani Bella Rosa Matte Baked Blush is a bright almost rosy red pink with absolutely no shimmer, sparkle, or glitter of any kind. This is unique shade that will really pop on darker skin tones. The formula has a dense yet soft, silky texture that isn’t powdery or chalky and blends easily onto cheeks leaving behind a sheer was of color or with a heavier hand a majorly dramatic finish. This is the color that gives you that just walked into from the cold look. If you have ruddiness in your cheeks or you’re super pale it may not exactly work for you as it is pretty bold! However, if you’re determined to own it and make it work might I suggest application with a fan brush? The blush comes in a dual compartment which features the blush on top and a smaller well for the brush below. The brush is a nice extra with soft bristles however, I prefer using my own blush for application. I’ve said it in the past but I must admit that as gorgeous as the formula is I’m shallow enough to say I dislike Milani’s gold packaging. It scratches up easily, attracts fingerprints, and it just looks old and used after a single use. I wish they’d update there packaging slightly! Aside from my packaging rants I have to say that Milani Bella Rosa Matte Baked Blush is a winner! It probably won’t be a sad that works for everyone but if you love vibrant, pigment packed blushes that aren’t going to cost you an arm and a leg this is a great formula! Do buy!

I love these and I will own them all at some point in my makeup life. Lipstick Queen Cupid’s Bow was launched last Spring and I can’t believe I’m just now reviewing them! Lipstick Queen Cupid’s Bow Lip Pencils are a chubby little pencil that 0.07 oz in size. This a sharpen pencil that comes with its own sharpener. The idea of the pencil is it acts as a lipstick a liner all in one and the precise point creates that perfect cupid’s bow. I love this formula. It’s velvety, it’s thin, and it has a moisturizing satiny matte finish that wears comfortably without drying my lips out. This isn’t a thick, velvety matte lip pencil with a creamy texture. Nope! None of that! This is very, very thin texture with an almost slick glide across lips without tugging or skipping. It hugs lips in very weightless comfortable color and although it gives that coveted matte finish everyone is crazy about right now, it doesn’t give a dry, difficult for my lips to breath feel which I’m all about. The wear is about five hours on my drier lips and color remained intense through that wear and very smooth without accentuating my drier, flakier lips. It didn’t migrate, feather, or crack in that time and looked very fresh and beautiful. Lipstick Queen Cupid’s Bow Swatches (Desire and Golden Arrow) I have to rave Golden Arrow as a much get shade. It’s gorgeous! This is a soft blush shade on lips that truly is a my lips but better finish. It enhances my natural lip color beautifully and adds such a delightful blush of color like someone just kissed me. It’s very pretty. The other shade I got was Desire which is a true, bright red with excellent opaque color on a single layer. I have to admit that after finally trying these I need more! Lipstick Queen Cupid’s Bow Lip Pencil is truly a great formula. If you’re looking to embrace a matte shade of lipstick but simply hate the finish I urge you to try these thin, lightweight pencils as they truly have a comfortable wear with a classic finish that’s gorgeous. Don’t miss on Golden Arrow! Truly it is a must have shade.

Lipstick Queen Velvet Rope Lipstick is a completely new lipstick for the brand as it is a bit more upscale with a formula that’s incredibly complex, luxurious, and oh so beautiful. I’m going to throw it out there and say this is the best matte lipstick I have ever had the pleasure of using! Lipstick Queen Velvet Rope Lipstick ($50) will be available in five pigmented packed shades. The lipstick is formulated with dense pigments that glide onto lips like butter with a smooth, velvety formula and a luxurious, weightless matte finish. The texture isn’t drying, it isn’t tight, it barely feels like you’re wearing anything at all on your lips yet it still manages to provide completely opaque color on a single stroke. As strongly as I dislike matte lipsticks or matte anything for that matter it comes as a great surprise how much I adore this lipstick. Truly a lot of love went into this formula. The lipstick packs incredible pigment which in turn provides a very dramatic and old Hollywood look. A new ingredient, Silicone Elastomer, makes Velvet Rope Lipstick glide lightly onto lips and requires very little pressure to get the color intensity you see in my swatches and look below. The formula is packed with moisturizing waxes as well as Apricot Oil and Vitamin E so lips remain moist and hydrated through the wear and the lipstick won’t flake up, tighten, or migrate around your mouth. I had no issues with color transferring, feathering, or taking a road trip around my mouth. Color wears strongly for a solid five hours without losing intensity and begins to show minor fading at hour six with a staining effect left behind just into the six and half hour point. Brat Pack Even the packaging is elegant as the lipstick comes housed in a vintage gold style square tube with a magnetic closure and the Lipstick Queen’s emblem inscribed on the top. This is truly a stunning formula that isn’t to be missed if you’re a lipstick girl! Lipstick Queen Velvet Rope Lipstick is a luxurious formula that will convert anyone to a matte finish lipstick. A formula like this will spoil you for all lipsticks that come after it! Amazing! Muse Approved. YOU NEED this. Available now at Barneys New York, Space NK, and lipstickqueen.com for $50 each.

Lipstick Queen Endless Summer Aloha Lipstick takes everything I LOVE about Lipstick Queen Medieval and packs in more color, more shine, and brings it to me in a stunning fiery red! Yeah, I’m pretty sure Lipstick Queen Endless Summer Aloha Lipstick is my new must have Summer shade! Poppy King is simply the master of creating stunning lipstick formulas and Lipstick Queen Endless Summer Aloha is testimony to her work. Housed in a slick metal orange casing, Lipstick Queen Endless Summer is inspired by the iconic 60’s surfer movie, The Endless Summer. This formula not only adds color and moisture to lips but protects them too with an SPF 15! It’s a soft, nourishing lipstick that feels even more moisturizing than Poppy’s Saint Lipstick formula. It applies with a melty, almost oily feel and leaves lips with slick, shiny, and opaque color. It wears for around five hours and through that wear lips remain moist and hydrated with a lovely shine! I simply love lipsticks that look like I applied gloss over them and this gives that illusion! It contains candelilla wax as well as Vitamin E to give it that beautiful glossiness. Lipstick Queen Endless Summer Aloha Lipstick Lipstick Queen Endless Summer Aloha Lipstick Swatches The color is to die for as well. It looks like a red lipstick in the tube with a hint of orange. But applied it turns into this wonderful reddish orange. It isn’t a true orange shade mind you and leans towards more red but there’s enough orange here that you easily see it in the shade. The lovely thing about the color is the fact it’ll look different across a variety of skin tones so the shade is quite unique to each skin tone that wears it! If you’re looking for a stunning Summer glossy lipstick shade I’d highly recommend Lipstick Queen Endless Summer Aloha Lipstick! Loves it. Muse Approved.

You just might want to boogie down with Jungle Queen this Summer as she’s the perfect on trend orange for warm, Summer-y looks. And to think I thought she was going to be coral! Lipstick Queen Jungle Queen Lipstick was developed to be paired with animal prints. How weird is that? Poppy King, creator of Lipstick Queen products, was inspired by fierce animal prints when she created the Jungle Queen shade. She actually calls it a coral pop and a juicy papaya shade. Personally it’s a full on orange for me…but strangely enough I tested it on my friend Jai and it comes across as a lighter papaya on him. Apparently the shade is suitable for all complexions so obviously the color has a little switcharoo when applying it on different skin tones. On me it was a juicy orange with hints of redness! There wasn’t a lot of warmth to the color for me but it was more a cooler on trend sizzling Summer orange. Lipstick Queen Jungle Queen Lipstick Swatches They call it a semi-sheer formula but I find it applies opaque where as the formula feels more like a sheerer lipstick. Like it’s cousins, Jean Queen, it has a buttery, soft glide across lips with a little slickness and full opaque color on the first application. It has a hint of shine and incredible wear of around five hours without migrating, fading, or feathering. Poppy always amazes me with her formula as they wear so lightweight and comfortable yet they pack such incredible pigmentation. If you’re a fond fan of the orange lipstick trend for Summer I’m sure that Lipstick Queen Jungle Queen Lipstick will be an instant pick up for you! Loves this! Muse Approved. Already tried it?

I always think of red lipstick as something to be worn in the evening but not so much in the day. I’m even a little wary of wearing it to a meeting or to meet a client as it seems a little too bright sometimes and not entirely appropriate. And add in the fact that I’m not always comfortable in red lipstick and sometimes feel like I look like a clown and well, I’m not always up for wearing red. That’s where Lipstick Queen Eden comes into play. This sheer yet wearable shade of juicy apple red is perfectly subtle for that power meeting and still delightfully playful for a night out. Take a look! When Eden released a lot of fans were like, “But I already have Medieval!” Doesn’t matter, you still need Eden! The shades are different. Medieval is a blood red shade where as Eden is more of an apple red with a pink undertone. Eden is much more playful and flirty! Now Eden does make an appearance in the Saint Lipstick Queen Collection but I don’t own that shade so I’m unsure if this version of Eden is newly packaged yet the same shade as the one from the Saint Collection. Just keep that in mind prior to a purchase as you might want to compare your shade of Eden to the new version if you already own it! This comes housed in a bright apple red barrel with Lipstick Queen’s logo decorating the cap and her initial’s printed on the inside. If you own a few of the special edition lipsticks like Frog Prince, Hello Sailor, Queen Bee , etc…I’m sure the package will be a nice little addition to your collection! The formula is simply amazing but I really didn’t expect anything less from the brand. Truly you get what you pay for with Poppy’s lipsticks as they are all formulated beautifully. Eden has a soft, moisturizing feel that applies with a slick, lightly emollient glide on lips. The finish has a juicy, glossiness with a high shine which is lightly moisturizing through the 5 hour wear. I had no issues with color migrating or feathering and it remained pleasantly moist through the wear. The shade is sheer yet leaves behind a lovely wash of apple red on my lips. It’s a shade of lipstick for all of us that fear wearing red! All in all Lipstick Queen Eden is truly a gorgeous little red lipstick for Spring and Summer wearing. It’s also a red lipstick you’ll happily reach for daily without the fear of looking like a clown. Anyone can wear this red as it imparts beautiful shine and just a touch of perfect red on lips! Loves it! Muse Approved. Lipstick Queen Eden is available now at Ulta, Ulta.com , Nordstrom.com , and beauty.com. You may also enjoy...

prince has come! Well, kind of! Lipstick Queen Frog Prince Lipgloss ($25) doesn’t exactly turn into a prince when it hits your lips but it does turn into a rather gorgeous shade of dark, sparkly berry! It’s not Fall yet but I’m dreaming of all the ways I’m going to incorporate Frog Prince Lipgloss into my Fall looks! Lipstick Queen Frog Prince Lipgloss is a new color changing gloss formula that joins Lipstick Queen’s Frog Prince Collection that also includes a lipstick and a blush . Frog Prince Lipgloss comes housed in a flat lipgloss barrel that holds 0.2 oz of gloss and resembles Hourglass Cosmetics lipgloss packaging but is a little thicker in size. In the barrel, it’s a gorgeous sparkly shade of emerald that might intimidate you but fear not this gorgeous green transforms upon contact with lips. It’s a pH-reacting, color changing formula that’s suppose to create a rosebud shade on lips but almost everyone I know who has tried it gets a deeper berry from it! Which is great considering how many pH lipglosses I already have that turn into bubblegum, Barbie shades of pink! This is a refreshing change. It actually takes a minute to transform as once applied you’ll have a layer of sheer green, sparkly gloss on your lips. As it warms up it’ll begin to color shift into a gorgeous, dark berry. The formula is thin and loaded with blue-ish green micro-shimmer. The shimmer is actually really low key on my lips and much, much more prominent on the initial application but disappears considerably as the color shifts. The gloss is very comfortable to wear without being sticky or tacky and has a lovely moisturizing feel courtesy shea butter and hyaluronic acid. It has a high shine finish that fades within two hours of the four hour wear time. As I mentioned above, this shade is rather refreshing. It’s a lot more deeper and richer than other pH lipglosses out there and reminds me of a Clinique Black Honey-like shade. I don’t think everyone can pull off your typical popping pink gloss, Frog Prince Lipgloss is much, much more wearable especially for those with medium or darker skin types! Question, is would I rather have the prince or the gorgeous berry lipgloss? I’ll go with the lipgloss ;-D Lipstick Queen Frog Prince Lipgloss is available now at Ulta, Nordstrom , Ulta.com , and lipstickqueen.com. You may also enjoy...

I would just like to express how I ran around in circles and squealed when I heard about Frog Prince Blush. I just love the idea of having a matching shade of blush to go along with my beloved Frog Prince Lipstick. This enchanting green shade of gel blush tinges your cheeks a delightful shade of Shrek green so, you can feel as glamorous as Princess Fiona! I’m kidding, I’m kidding! But I suspect it is the shade of pretty pink that tinges Fiona’s flawless green complexion! This little blush comes housed in a pink metallic palette with a mirror and weights in at 0.7 oz. It might be green but it won’t turn you green. Unfortunately, because I had a brief moment where I was like, “Wow, wouldn’t green blush totally be cool!” After that I had a flash of, “Yeah, you’d look like the dork you are wearing green blush…!” No need to bring more attention to the fact I’m already a dork right? 🙂 Unlike the lipstick and the lipgloss which lean towards being a darker berry shade, Frog Prince Blush is all about a healthy shade of pink. Or if you will, as the brand calls it, fairytale pink. Makes me feel like the princess I’m not when I call it fairytale pink. In the pot, it is in fact a shade of frog green but directly after application on cheeks in shifts to a pretty bright pink on my medium fair skin. It’s quite straight because swatched on my arm I could not get it to change from a berry grape but when I applied it on my face it instantly turned into a pretty, natural pink! I loved it because its my ideal minimal, natural makeup blush and go kind of color. Fresh, pretty, and natural! The color is supposed to adapt to your skin tone according to your pH level but I only tried it on myself so, I’m not sure how it’ll look on other skin tones. I do think it’s pigmented enough to work on a variety of lighter and darker shades but those with ruddy or redness might want to conceal well before application. The formula is a thin, lightly emollient formula that has a dewy finish. It contains Vitamin E, shea butter, avocado, jojoba, and olive oil. The formula is quite hydrating and doesn’t feel tacky or sticky nor does it cling to drier areas on my face but oily skin might want to apply with a blush and buff color into your skin to tone down the dewy finish! I’m pretty picky with cream blushes as they tend to fade fast on me. Frog Prince Blush lasts a nice solid six hours for me before showing some signs of fading. As the weather starts to warm up, lighter, fresher makeup is most definitely the rage and Frog Prince Blush will be a delightful way to get a natural, youthful pink blush on your cheeks that’s lightweight and very flattering! Loves it! Muse Approved. Lipstick Queen Frog Prince Blush is available now at Ulta, Ulta.com , Nordstrom, Nordstrom.com , and other fine retailers. Own it already? Do share! You may also enjoy...

my fair of skin friends! Jane Iredale Glow Time Full Coverage Mineral BB Cream is your savior! I tried two shades in this BB Cream and I must say they run quite fair so if you’ve had a problem finding a paler BB Cream I’d recommend checking this out. But don’t check it out just for the shades because this formula is well worth a rave! Jane Iredale did a stupendous job getting the concept of a BB Cream down perfectly. Take a look! Jane Iredale Glow Time Full Coverage Mineral BB Cream is a mineral based formula that protects skin with an SPF 25 that’s available in six shade selections. I was a little worried when I read about this for the first time due to the name “glow time”. Seriously, when you combine glow and BB Cream together I tend to run. I have a fuller face so any foundation or BB Cream product that has a glow-y finish is a big no for me. However, I’m quite happy to report there is no glow here, only healthy, natural coverage. This is one of the rare BB Creams I’ve run across that launched here in the US that actually has the creamy, thicker texture of a true Asian BB Cream. It offers sheer to medium coverage that’s buildable to full coverage. So it will act to diffuse the appearance of redness and dakrness while perfecting skin with an airbrushed appearance. The creamy texture allows for easy application and it blends into skin beautifully with a satiny semi-matte formula that will be a pleasant experience for those with oily skin. Even though my own skin is dry this still offers smooth, even coverage without adhering to my drier areas. I personally want a BB Cream that will perfect my skin and that’s exactly what this formula does. It creates a photo ready finish with a perfect canvas for other makeup products. Wear time is a solid twelve hours without oxidizing or fading. Unfortunately the SPF is a little lower so I personally recommend using your own sunscreen prior with a higher level of protection so you can stay out doors longer (at this rate it’ll only be good for about 40 minutes of protection). The shade selection does appear to run quite light. I tried BB5 which is a lighter peach with beige undertones and BB3 which is a creamy ivory with strong pink undertones. BB3 and BB5 If you haven’t really wanted to venture into Asian BB Creams or you’ve tried them and haven’t found one fair enough for your skin I’d highly suggest checking Jane Iredale Glow Time Full Coverage Mineral BB Cream. This formula is ideal for paler skin and the formula is the closest I’ve seen to a true Korean BB Cream. If you tried it, I’d love to hear your thoughts on it. Do Share! You may also enjoy...

I’m always looking for the next best thing to hydrate my lips and lord knows as much as I love me some Hourglass Cosmetics new No 28 Lip Treatment Oil that stuff is lethal on my wallet and as much as I love it can get mighty expensive quickly. So, yes, I’m always looking for the next best thing and now my sights are on Jurlique Hydra-Gloss with Nutri-Oil Complex for softening and moisturizing these dry lips! I actually had hopes Jurlique Hydra-Gloss with Nutri-Oil Complex would not only act to soften my lips but also as a nice little gloss for touch ups through the day. This is little lip treatment is available in two shades so on top of moisturizing and acting as a lipgloss I also had hopes it would give me a nice, nude lip look as the shades seemed to point in the natural direction. Bad news. Technically I’m not into wearing these out and about or using them for touch up as the formula gives lips a milky, zombie look. Not pretty. The two shades are I’m Neutral which is a light, milky peach and I’m Blushing which is a light milky peachy pink. Both shades looks nice in the tubes but they apply with a translucent milkiness on lips and it isn’t very flattering to go out and about with in my humblest. Jurlique Hydra-Gloss with Nutri-Oil Complex (I’m Blushing and I’m Neutral) On that note I will say this formula is divine for softening lips and adding much need moisture! The gloss has a peppermint taste and fragrance with thicker yet soft, emollient texture that goes a bit thinner and oily when applied. They kinda sorta remind me of a thinner more comfortable to wear version of Jack Black Lip Balm. I find the formula very soothing with plenty if Vitamin E to add moisture and nourishment to lips. If you have drier lips the Jurlique Hydra-Gloss with Nutri-Oil Complex are a nice little treat to add much needed moisture. I just wish they were a little more wearable for daily use….! The colors just aren’t flattering enough for me to walk out of the house with so I have to deduct a few points for that. But the moisture levels are outstanding so you might want to overlook that little flaw. Jurlique Hydra-Gloss with Nutri-Oil Complex are available now at feelunique.com. You may also enjoy...

Pix Nourishing Lip Polish is a multitasking hydrating, shiny lip treatment does double duty as an lip scrub on the sly which launched with the new Pixi Skincare Collection for Spring 2016. Take a look! Pixi Nourishing Lip Polish is likely the first lip exfoliator that has an applicator which makes it easy to carry around with you and to casually apply at your desk at work. Promise no one will be the wiser your sloughing off dead skin from your lips, it’ll just look like you’re applying your lipgloss. This is a thin, slick, clear transparent gloss that has tiny grains of sugar that act to gently exfoliate lips. It’s a funny little product as it feels and looks like a clear lipgloss with a ton of shine but if you run your tongue across your lips it feels grainy and sandy. You can actually leave it on if you want as the grains are not visible and unless you’re kissing someone no one will be the wiser that you have an exfoliating scrub on your lips versus a lipgloss. I think that’s kinda why I like it because I don’t have to tissue it off after I use it! I simply leave it on because it provides light moisture and shine to my lips. The applicator is the real star of the show though. It’s a slanted applicator which has tiny spikes that act to gently buff your lips as you apply the product. I simply swipe the applicator across my lips a few times and this combined with the graininess of the formula will act to buff away flaky, dry skin. I buff it on using the applicator and a thin layer is left behind after which adds shine to my lips and light moisture. It’s a bit sandy but not uncomfortable so I just leave it to add moisture to my lips after my scrubbing! My lips are dry as heck at the moment and this did a great job smoothing them out and whisking away flakes while providing nice, light moisture. I loved the fact that it has an applicator as that makes it perfectly portable. This is pretty unique as most lip scrubs come in little pots with a screw top lip making them not very travel friendly! For sensitive users this has a sweet citrus-y flavor and fragrance I found pleasant but not be for everyone. All in all I loved this little lip polish and thought it a great addition to my makeup bag. If you have dry lips do pick it up! Muse Approved.

Being a lover of Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment I was, of course, excited about their new Sugar Shine Lip Treatment. I mean it would be incredible to have the benefits of the lip treatment but in more of a lipgloss formula ya know? A little something different… But… Fresh Sugar Shine Lip Treatment ($18.50) is kinda a glorified lipgloss really. This promises a high shine with a formula that moisturizers and makes lips soft and supple. According to the Fresh it’ll preserve the moisture of lips up to six hours. I wore it from Friday of last week all through the week up until today to test it out and honestly, in that time I can’t say my lips had much of a change. So maybe I need to use it for a few months to see results. I will say in that time I only experienced the joys of using a regular and uneventful lipgloss. This is a pale milky pink with a hint of golden shimmer. It applies transparent on lips and provides some shine with a slightly tacky finish on my mouth. It has some shine but not a ton with a medium texture that isn’t too thick nor too thin. It has a faint lemon sugar flavor that isn’t as powerful as you taste with the regular Lip Treatment Balms. It wears nice enough but proves boring really…I wouldn’t mind so much if I actually felt it was treating drier lips. My lips felt soft enough wearing it but I didn’t feel like it was major moisturizing or adding any extra hydration that my lips didn’t already have. Meh…. Honestly, I’m hearing some great raves for this and perhaps I’m just a shy to nit picky but in the end this just seemed like a mediocre gloss product. Skip it. There are far too many glosses to choose from which offer shine, color, and hydration. But if you are curious it’s available now at Sephora and Sephora.com Tried it? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

I’ve mentioned it before but it always deserves a re-babble but nude lip colors like Hourglass Cosmetics Femme Nude Lip Stylo are terrifying for me. I want to embrace a nude lip look but I always look like such a dead girl wearing one. Let’s take a look at these lip crayons and see how they turned out. Hourglass Cosmetics Femme Nude Lip Stylo are an elegantly packaged lip crayon with a twist up design so no sharpener is needed to keep the precise point. Shades were carefully selected by Hourglass to suit a variety of skin tones and give those tones the most flattering nude lip look available. The crayons allow you to line and fill with creamy, opaque coverage that Hourglass calls a satin finish but personally I feel these are more a matte to semi-matte one. I adore them. I think with the right eye look a nude lip is very possible even for those of us, like me, who are quite afraid of looking like a zombie in such a lip look. However, they are NOT the most user friendly of formulas when it comes to creating that look. The drier texture really accentuates every single nook, cranny, and line on your mouth. They apply opaque but the finish is sometimes patchy and uneven even showing bare skin underneath due to that patchiness. I personally can’t wear them without gloss. A little gloss evens out the color and creates a very wearable shade of nude for me. However, without gloss my lips look dry and very living dead girl-like. The best application is exfoliating well prior to use with some sort of lip sugar scrub and follow up with a little lip balm. Apply the Femme Nude Lip Stylo shade of your choice and after application run your finger gently over your lips to get the color even. Now reapply to build color and again pat gently on your lips to even color out. You can leave it as is now or I personally like a little clear gloss on top to make the drier, matte finish a bit more wearable. Nude No 4 and Nude No 5 Nude No 4 Nude No 5 I can’t say that Hourglass Cosmetics Femme Nude Lip Stylo aren’t without there issues but if you can get pass some of the problems you might just be delighted with the outcome. The application, finish, and formula is a bit temperamental and high maintenance but I ADORE how they look on and in that case they might just be worth the extra effort. They are currently available at both Sephora and Sephora.com or www.hourglasscosmetics.com You may also enjoy...

I tend to avoid Etude House’s lip stains. Well, really, I mostly avoid Korean lip stains in general as I find their formulas terribly drying. But that didn’t prevent me from purchasing five of the Berry Delicious Color in Liquid Lips Juicy shades. I guess I’m a glutton for punishment but I had to try these. And I’m glad I did grab a few shades as I love them. If you’ve had issues with dry lip stains in the past I’d highly suggest this formula as it is much, much kinder to lips. Etude House released these in ten shade selections and each comes in special edition strawberry themed packaging. They do have a faint sweet fragrance and flavor that’s berry-ish but not full on strawberry. Etude House Berry Delicious Color in Liquid Lips Juicy Swatches (RD306, PK014, PK015, RD305, and RD304) The formula is a little difficult to describe as a lot is happening here. The texture is a watery fluid that has a gel-like consistency with a wet, juicy finish as per the name. I wouldn’t say it’s a shiny finish but it does have a wet look! Almost as if you took a sip of water and some dewiness remains on your lips. I find the formula very pleasantly cool and refreshing with an easy application that doesn’t migrate around. The wetness stays for about an hour into the wear but disappears after that leaving behind a mere staining effect. I find color and wear varies from shade to shade. The two lightest pink shades I purchased (PK014 and PK015) wore the shorter time with the least staining left behind at around three hours. The darker reds I purchased were much, much better in terms of pigmentation and longer wear. I thought these had the strongest wear at around six hours and the colors were much, much more intense compared to the pinks. RD306 was the longest wearing red at six hours. Of course, the wetness wore away after about an hour but the stain itself remained a deep, rich red for at least five more hours after. Etude House Berry Delicious Color in Liquid Lips Juicy (RD306) Etude House Berry Delicious Color in Liquid Lips Juicy (PK014) Etude House Berry Delicious Color in Liquid Lips Juicy (RD304) Etude House Berry Delicious Color in Liquid Lips Juicy (PK015) Etude House Berry Delicious Color in Liquid Lips Juicy (RD305) Initially these feel very moist and lovely on lips but I wouldn’t say they were moisturizing through the wear but they weren’t drying either. I thought they were very comfortably with a lightweight, barely there finish that wasn’t drying in the least. You don’t have to go too wild picking up a variety of shades as I felt many of them looked a lot alike on my lips. The stand out shade for me was RD306 as this was a very rich, pigmented red! Etude House Berry Delicious Color in Liquid Lips Juicy were a pleasant surprise and one of the better stains I’ve tried from Korea. I really enjoyed these and I don’t some of the shades were rather outstandingly pigmented and beautiful on lips! Muse Approved.

They keep repackaging, revamping, and re-releasing it to intentionally confused me. For shame Etude House for shame! They know I’ll keep buying it that’s why. And you should consider buying it too because it is THEE bestest lip stain ever. Tired of stains drying your lips out? Etude House Kissful Tint Chou is for you my dears! Etude House Kissful Tint Chou is available in four shade selections and comes in a tiny tube. Don’t quote me but I believe they repackaged it recently when they launched the new Water Color Blushers . I picked it up in the Tangerine Chou shade which actually runs more towards being a lovely coral with some orange-y elements but it actually applies as pink on my lips! The thing that’s so fab about Kissful Tint Chou is definitely the texture and wear of the product. This has a gel-like texture with a water base so it applies like a looser glossier lip product. This results in a glossy finish and a comfortable wear that doesn’t dry lips out. The glossiness and the thinner layer of the product wears away within an hour or so but it leaves behind a staining effect that will last around three hours without eating or drinking. At first application it feels like a cool drink of water on your lips and doesn’t have a drying set. After it wears away a little the stain also doesn’t leave lips feeling dry nor does it leave your lips with a cracked look that accentuates the finer lines, nooks, and crannies we all naturally have on the skin of our lips. In this fact it makes a far superior lip stain when compared to using a liquid one such as Benetint. This isn’t really a new product for Etude House. They’ve literally had it around for ages and I reviewed at least two variations of it in the past. This newest version seems even better than before but perhaps I am imagining it. Either way I loved it a few years ago and still do now. And with Summer so creeping closer this makes for a perfect, natural way to get lightweight color on lips. Do love! Muse Approved.

what my skin needs more of is the unusual Ettusais Puru Puru Serum! Or not? This odd little moisturizer slash serum looks like a peeling gel of some sort (think Cure Natural Aqua Gel ) but it isn’t…! I’m so confused. Ettusais Puru Puru Serum was recently launched in Japan and comes housed in a tiny screw top pink jar. At a glance it looks like a scrub as it has a grainy texture but swatching it you’ll find it feels more like an Asian peeling product of some sort. It’s very chunky and grainy in consistency with a gelatine-like consistency that wriggles and could possibly be alive and preparing to take over the world (this last part is unconfirmed). Those tiny granules you see here actually “burst” or melt down as you apply the product. The jelly-like texture actually absorbs fairly faast and leaves skin velvety and almost matte in finish. According to Ettusais those small grains or beads are moisture capsules that have all sorts of good stuff in them like hyaluronic acid, fermented royal jelly and water-soluble collagen. They actually plump up and improve the appearance of visible pores supposedly but I can’t say if that is working as my pores aren’t exactl visible. It’s recommended as the last step in your skincare for morning and night use. It’s actually a very interesting product not only because it looks like a scrub or a peel but also because of the semi-matte finish it provides yet still allowing for plenty of moisture as well which makes it a suitable serum for both oily and drier skin types. According to the brand it is fragrance free but I detected some fragrance when I smelled it….! I don’t mind at all but sensitive users might wish to beware prior to a purchase. I dunno if I need yet another moisturizing product in my life but this sure makes a fine prep for makeup as it allows my foundation to glide on easily and provides a good base for it!

I happen to be all about getting brighter under eyes and I’m also a concealer junkie so I jumped right on board to snag the Mally Ultimate Performance Brightener &amp; Hydrator when it debuted earlier this month! Let’s take a look! The concept behind Mally Ultimate Performance Brightener &amp; Hydrator is a good one but the formula doesn’t quite live up to what it is supposed to do. First off, this is only available in a light and deeper shade which means not everyone will use it. However, both shades have a very strong yellow base it’ll work on many skin tones but some tones might find the yellow doesn’t quite work well for them. I’ve seen people on youTube that contour under their eyes with Benefit and in some ways this is exactly what the Ultimate Performance Brightener &amp; Hydrator does. It isn’t necessarily a full on concealer but it does brighten under eyes and gives more of a lifted look while diffusing darker circles (not really blue based ones though) by using yellow pigment. Unfortunately, the formula is marketed as a drink of water for skin. This references the hydrating factor but I didn’t find it terribly hydrating. The good news would be that it isn’t drying either and has a thinner, creamy texture that blends well under my drier, finely lined eyes. They also call it “supreme coverage” but again that’s over marketing as this is sheer, brightening yes, but not really sheer! I wish I can use it as a concealer but I do need more coverage than this provides! So it does work best over concealer which I hate simply because concealer plus something else on top, well, it’s just a bit too much makeup! Mally Ultimate Performance Brightener &amp; Hydrator (Deeper) Mally Ultimate Performance Brightener &amp; Hydrator (Lighter) Mally Ultimate Performance Brightener &amp; Hydrator Swatches (Lighter and Deeper) I think Mally felt you might carry this with you for touch ups through the day but I rarely touch my concealer throughout the day so I don’t really carry it around with me. I mention this because it doesn’t have a longer wear! At first application my tired eyes do look quite bright but the effect only lasts for around four hours. I did see some minor creasing during that wear but nothing a tap from my finger couldn’t clear up! I also should mention at the moment this is sold in a duo for $35. So you get two of the same shades for that price. I really don’t need two of anything even items and products I really love. I rather not be forced into a purchase of two anything. But unfortunately that’s how it is currently sold! Mally Ultimate Performance Brightener &amp; Hydrator sounds dreamy! Hydrating, supreme coverage, brightening…but unfortunately, it’s a one trick pony that brightens but doesn’t really hydrate or offer “supreme” coverage in the least. Those who contour might find this a helpful tool but anyone who doesn’t like layering (as it works best on top of concealer in my experience) might not love it. If you don’t have a ton of issues to conceal it might just make for a nice, lightweight concealer that brightens but unfortunately I have puffy, tired looking eyes that need more coverage! Tried it?

Essence Gloss is available in Pink, Red, and Beige. Since I loved the red in the promo images so much I decided to pick up that shade. Here’s a look! Ettusais Essence Gloss actually makes this look a heck of a lot more pigmented in promotional images than it actually is. It’s a flavor and fragrance free lipgloss with a sheerer red tint and a thicker, highly gloss formula. I think the red color adds a nice tint but also just emphasizes my already pink lips and gives them the illusion of a fuller look. The high shine finish is almost quite as nice as my very favorite gloss but long gone gloss from Too Faced, Mirror Mirror. It is slightly tacky and not completely weightless but I don’t mind in the least as it wears comfortably for me and leaves my lips highly glossy. On its own the red shade lends a slight tint to my lips but is no where near as opaque and full red in color as they show on the promotional model. It is a pretty basic gloss so I’m unsure if you need to track it down for yourself. Although I will say I do like having this around for touch ups, to wear on its own, or even over my favorite lipsticks as I really LOVE high shine glosses and they seem to be rather sparse or I’m just picky!

Seriously, it’s a moisturizer and it has Tweety’s sweet little face on it, how can I resist stuff like this? Oh did I mention it smells like limes? Tweety sold me but lime scented anything drives me crazy! Love! Take a look! The Nature Republic Tweety Jelly Moisturizer comes in a tiny pump jar and acts as a toner and a moisturizer all in one. I wouldn’t recommend this for sensitive skin as the fresh squeezed lime scent is delightful but it feels like something that will likely break out sensitive or blemish prone skin, just a word of warning! At first application it actually feels like a peeling gel much like Cure Natural Aqua as it has that same gel-like consistency with little chunky bits suspended in it. It’s rather watery and runny and the chunks do feel odd on skin at first but they do absorb quickly enough into skin (sorry for the blurry photo below, my cam refused to focus but at least you can get an idea of the chunky texture). If you have drier skin I wouldn’t recommend it as it seems to suck any and all oil from my skin after I apply. Granted, it doesn’t mention sebum control so I imagine it is loaded up with alcohol thus the drying effect. At first application it feels cool but not terribly hydrating especially for my drier skin so it might possibly be better suited to oily skin. Tweety sold me for sure but in the end this wasn’t a great moisturizer. If you are interested in purchasing some of the Tweety Collection I recommend skipping this Jelly Moisturizer. It’s not really something you need, trust me! E-bay sellers have it at a variety of prices very close to retail. You may also enjoy...

Don’t quote me but this one released in Japan about a year and a half ago or so and I’ve been using it daily for about that long now (actually I’m on like my fifth bottle of this stuff). I’m actually one of those rare breeds that likes Hada Labo Rohto Goku-jun Hyaluronic Milky Lotion versus the Clear Moist versions. But Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion was getting so many ravings across Asian forums I visit as well as many mentions in Japanese magizines that I decided to check it out. This review comes at a great time considering that I just posted my thoughts on the new Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Serum which I thought was too expensive and too small for the price. So, if you really wanted to add a hyaluronic acid product to your current skincare routine I’d recommend skipping Peter Thomas Roth’s version and going for Hada Labo’s Premium formula. You won’t regret it. Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion contains 5 different hyaluronic acid and is considered a more beefier version of the original Moist formula . This is the version you’ll want to reserve for nightly use or the one that would be best suited for drier skin or mature, aging skin. You can definitely feel the difference in the formula after application as it leaves skin considerably more hydrated and even a little moist and dewy to the touch after use. The idea of the lotion is not only to hydrate your skin but most importantly to help your skin to retain moisture. This results in smoother, softer, and visibly brighter less dull skin. I tend to have drier, duller skin. I wouldn’t say I have a lot going for me, I’m pretty your average girl but my skin is one thing that looks great and I would blame a majority of that on Hada Labo. It’s a product that will visibly improve skin, keep it looking youthful and plump, and most importantly, allow it to retain any moisture you’re applying to it. This formula is a gel-like serum which needs to be worked into the skin or “palmed” and massaged in. It’ll leave you feel tacky and a bit sticky but the more you work it the less sticky it’ll become. I apply a quarter size amount every single night after my essence and emulsion. I give myself a massage with it and gentle place the palms of my face to warm up the formula and allow it to absorb easily. You’ll know you’re doing it right when the skin on you face begins to stick to the palms of your hands. I know, sounds freaky, but don’t worry the more you do it the less your hands will stick and that’s when you know you’re done and it is fully absorbed. Plus, giving yourself a small facial massage at night is a good thing. The video below is exactly how you want to apply it (maybe a little less slapping haha). You’ll see towards the end how the skin of her face sticks to the palm of her hand, this doesn’t mean you should stop, keep going and as I said the stickiness will ease. The less sticky your face becomes the more you know you’re at the end of your application. I think it’s a product that takes a little getting used to. I know I personally thought it was awful the first few times I used it. But over time you get used to and even begin to appreciation the way it feels and works. You’ll find your other skincare will absorb more easily, your skin will appear plumper, it’ll look much brighter, dullness will ease, and you’ll find your skin is much, much more hydrated. Your skincare will work better in my opinion. Sometimes, I’ll purchase a new moisturizer and it’ll lay on top of my skin. I think the addition of Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion goes a long way at allowing my moisturizer to work a lot better for me and the absorb more easily. As I said above this formulation is much, much more moisturizing compared to the other versions. I would recommend it for drier skin or for nightly use as it is quite a powerful boost. If you’re serious about moisture, this is the product for you. I really can’t Muse Approve Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion or any of the Hada Labo lotions enough. They are fabulous and truly one of the reasons why skin looks fantastic and youthful. Hada Labo is available on amazon.com. You may also enjoy...

You know me, total concealer h0r! One thing about this concealer is it is costly at $19 for a 0.3 oz of product. It’s concentrated yes, but not nearly as much as other concealers I own which are far larger and around the same price tag. Let’s take a look and see if it is worth the price! I purchased two shades in Em The Great Cover Up Concealer one of which was Light Neutral and the other was Medium Neutral both of which were excellent shades for my skin tone. The thing is Light and Medium actually didn’t have a ton of difference to them and almost looked like the same exact color….! The good news is I really like how there shade selection works at Em Cosmetics. They have both neutral, warm, and cool shade selections which is such a rarity with makeup as I’m forever always trying to guess my correct undertone…am I neutral, am I warm, cool? I always feel like I’m between warm and cool….! Needless to say it is challenging to find a shade that’s an exact match for any woman or man using makeup. I just felt like at my first shot out with this concealer I found a perfect match and that’s rare. Light Neutral and Medium Neutral The thicker, creamy formula feels like it has a built in primer of sorts as it seems to fill lines and blur their appearance as I apply. It has a smooth, easy, glide, and blends out very easily during application without being drying but not being very hydrating either. The application was very fuss-free for me and I didn’t feel I had to endlessly prep my dry eyes prior to applying to avoid creasing or poor application that involved tugging. Coverage was fairly good with sheer to medium pigmentation depending how much was applied. A reader commented recently saying someone reviewed this on youTube stating it would conceal tattoos. I fear that’s not the case my friends. But it will indeed conceal darker circles very well and neutralize them (or at least the beige undertones in the two shades I tried helped to diffuse the look of darkness) while covering up puffiness and fine lines and brightening up your eyes. I admit, I’m surprised. The brand is fairly new and fairly expensive too (ouch on some of the palette prices) and Em The Great Cover Up Concealer is kinda small for the price but I’m going to say that I actually like this just as much as I do my It Cosmetics Bye Bye Undereye Concealer . If you didn’t like the more emollient texture of Bye Bye Undereye you’ll actually really adore the Great Cover Up Concealer because it has excellent concealing power, doesn’t crease, and wears strongly for a solid eight hours.
