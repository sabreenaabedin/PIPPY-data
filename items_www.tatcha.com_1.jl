Between rows of lacquer-handled lip brushes and packages of pretty potions, she picked up a couple of colorful washi envelopes. They were filled with finely milled rice powder, she said, and were used to gently exfoliate the skin. Intrigued, I bought a small sleeve of it to take home myself. “The luminous skin I had been trying to create with makeup and other treatments was achievable with this pure, simple ingredient.” That night, after I rinsed the rice powder from my face, I was shocked by the glow and baby-soft texture of my skin. After some research, I learned that the active ingredient in the rice powder is komenuka, or Rice Bran. In that moment, I realized that the luminous skin I had been trying to create with makeup, prescription topical and other treatments was achievable with this pure, simple ingredient. The inspiration for all of our Polished Rice Enzyme Powders is Rice Bran, which is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, UV absorbers, moisturizers and skin-safe brighteners. For additional benefits to the skin, we formulated with active ingredients for each skin type: Classic : is ideal if you have normal to dry skin, with crushed pearl for conditioning and nourishment; Deep : is ideal if you have normal to oily skin, with Japanese Wild Rose and Leopard Lilly to visibly tighten pores and clarify skin; Gentle: is ideal for dry skin, with licorice root extract to moisturize and help prevent tightness; Indigo : is ideal for sensitive skin, with natural Japanese indigo to calm and soothe As we tested various formulas, I realized that I could customize my exfoliation and treatment to meet the changing needs of my skin. Using the other formulas was helpful depending on changing factors such as stress, hormonal fluctuations, environment or even a lack of sleep. I personally like to use the Deep Rice Enzyme Powder once a month for a more traditional scrub, especially after wearing heavy makeup for a television appearance. For an even more intense exfoliation, I make a gommage with a few drops of Pure One Step Camellia Cleansing Oil and the Classic Rice Enzyme Powder, and gently massage the corners of my nose, lips and hairline for a more invigorating exfoliation. When traveling, I prefer the Indigo Soothing Rice Enzyme Powder because it keeps me glowing even when I’m between multiple time zones. During warmer months, when the air draws moisture away from my skin, I switch to the Gentle Rice Enzyme Powder. These daily fluctuations can be balanced through different enzyme powders. Adjusting your rice enzyme powders is the easiest way to tailor your skincare ritual. I love hearing how some of my friends like to blend different types of Rice Enzyme Powders, or use one for the morning and another for the evening.

The islands are abundant with vibrant hibiscus, orchid blossoms and eye-catchingly colorful birds. In addition to its natural beauty, Okinawa’s residents are famous for their health, vitality and happiness that extends into their long lifespans. But deeper into the network of Okinawa’s islands are quiet lagoons and the precious coral reefs beneath the surf, where the secrets to its luminosity lie. Seaweed and marine algae, a dietary staple in Okinawa, grow rich in minerals and vitamins. One variety of red algae, known as Betaphycus gelatinum , is especially prized by locals and called “treasure from the god of the sea.” On festival days in Yaeyama district, bundles of this red algae are set as temple offerings. In daily life, it is even used while washing hair and cleansing skin and is essential to keeping skin supple and luminous from the inside and out. Once I came across this exceptional, yet simple ingredient in the Miyakofuzoku Kewaiden , the first written account of classical Japanese beauty rituals, the Tatcha Institute and I began to research the science behind its benefits for the skin. Okinawa Red Algae is a vital source of Beterhelin, a natural polysaccharide which enhances skin’s barrier function. It also replenishes skin’s natural moisture reservoir and moisture-retaining abilities. Our Luminous Collection combines this secret from Okinawa’s seas and the timeless wisdom of Japan’s beauty rituals with new innovations in skincare. Rich in hydrating Okinawa Red Algae, every item in our Luminous Collection leaves skin with a dewy, youthful glow.

Daniel Martin was one of these angels, a supporter who saw what we were trying to bring to the world, championing our cause from our earliest day and becoming a lifelong friend in the process. As a celebrated editorial makeup artist, he is on speed-dial for the world’s top beauty editors, dressing the faces that grace magazine covers every day, creating the looks on the world's top runways and inspiring many of his friends and colleagues (myself included) daily. He is, in fact, the inspiration for one of the newest additions to our collection: the Luminous Deep Hydration Firming Serum . Daniel reached out to tell me that he loves the firming, plumping qualities of our Luminous Deep Hydration Lifting Mask , but there were times when he didn't have 15 minutes to prep the skin before applying makeup on his famous faces. Instead, he asked, could we somehow bottle it? And that was when the Luminous lightbulb went on. I am honored to call Daniel a friend, and delighted to share some of his beauty secrets. Q: When painting a face, you begin with a blank canvas. What inspires you? A: Depending on the occasion or shoot, inspiration can come from something I just read or something I saw on Instagram. That's the beauty of makeup—it's open and endless! And if you mess up, you wipe it clean and start over again. Q: What items do you always have with you to get red-carpet ready? A: Besides my suitcase full of makeup, skincare, my arsenal of brushes, japanese table-setting cloth and my black velour velvet face puffs from Spain. Q: There is a dizzying world of skincare and beauty products available. How do you keep your routine simple? A: For me, it's about balance and toning when it comes to skincare. I need the skin to be at its best before makeup so that it will affect the longevity of whatever I put on top of the skin. Q: How do you incorporate the Luminous Deep Hydration Firming Serum into your red-carpet ritual? A: The humectants in the Deep Hydration Lifting Serum act as a magnet or binder to the foundation I put on top of it. This moisturizes the skin underneath while locking down the foundation and melding it for long wear. Q: The women you work with are busy ladies—just like the geisha. What are your secrets for gorgeous skin in minutes? A: The key to gorgeous skin in minutes is to even out the complexion with a proper skincare regimen and use either foundation or concealer on areas of the face that need more coverage. This cuts your time in half once you have your skincare rituals down... Q: What is one thing that anyone can do to be their most beautiful selves? A: One doesn't need a full face of makeup to look beautiful. You should approach makeup as an accessory rather than look at it as something you need. You will gain this kind of confidence as soon as you're comfortable not having anything on your face but your skincare. Trust! Q: You regularly work with some of the most beautiful women in the world. How does that shape your definition of beauty? A: Like the saying goes, \"beauty is only skin deep…\" What I find beautiful is the confidence women have when they don't wear a lot of makeup. For an actress, wearing all that makeup is part of the job so on their down time, most aren't wearing it. It takes a confident woman to not leave the house with makeup on and to me that's admirable."],"Title":["Daniel Martin’s Tips for Looking Luminous"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"d6c2-4ec4-9651","_cached_page_id":"e1360195e4f8c7b29e476294d08a9127d78d1587"}

As synthetic dyes became more ubiquitous, the demand for the botanical diminished and growers turned to more profitable crops. Only one indigo field remains along the Yoshino River today, on a farm run by many generations of one family dedicated to keeping this traditional plant—and its beneficial extracts—alive. Junichi and his wife, Miki, have dedicated their lives to cultivating the crop, a notoriously finicky member of the buckwheat family and fermenting it according to techniques passed down from generation to generation to procure pure, perfect pigments coveted by artisans, holistic healers and others. From the first moment I met them, and later when I visited them during the annual harvest, I was impressed by their passion and knew that this most genuine source of Indigo was a perfect fit for Tatcha. I’m delighted to share their very special story for you here. Q: Why have you continued to grow indigo here when so many have not? A: We are eight generations of farmers, and we have always grown indigo alongside our other crops, but now that we are the only ones left we want to help preserve this very special part of Japanese heritage and history. I also suffered from an extreme case of psoriasis all over my face, which was aggravated from the stress my work as a rescue firefighter. It was especially bad on my face, and I had tried all kinds of medications and treatments to get rid of it and nothing worked, so I feared that I would live with this disfigurement for the rest of my life. My wife was researching some homeopathic remedies and found one that used Indigo, so she made some soaps with ground up Indigo leaves. It felt really good but what shocked me was that within a few months my face changed completely. What used to look like a monster became completely normal. Q: Anything else surprise you about Indigo over the years? A: One of the most interesting things is that if you remove an Indigo leaf from the plant and place it in a cup of water, it will sprout roots directly from the stem—that is how strong its life force is! We also use it for calligraphy ink, eye shadow, all kinds of fabric dyeing. You can even use it in pasta and desserts to turn them blue, but it doesn’t really taste like much. If you roast the leaves it makes a nice tea too."],"Title":["A Botanical Legacy"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"d6c2-4ec4-9651","_cached_page_id":"9e515b9dba63709033150d0bd2f4f9b7e26fcc41"}

As many of you know, the skincare rituals of the geisha inspired me to create TATCHA, formulating the collection after their recipes, honed by generations. Japanese culture is steeped in centuries of tradition and symbolism, a heritage I sought to honor in designing the collection. Designer extraordinare and TATCHA co-founder Stanley Hainsworth helped breathe modern life into these traditions, and I am excited to share with you some of the meaning behind our packaging. • Japanese tea ceremonies are a crucial part of the culture, dating back centuries to the Muromachi Period. In creating our ritual, we were inspired by the traditional tools of the ceremony. The shape of our jars is based on the natsume , small vessels used to carry the powdered tea, while the small golden spoon on top references the utensil used to scoop precious tea from the jar. • When seen in person, a geisha’s iconic white makeup is almost translucent, with the warmth of her skin showing through the color. We recreated this warmth on our jars with a combination of white urushi lacquer and a layer of pearl pigment so that it would reflect this uniquely luminous quality. • Centuries ago, only the Imperial Family was permitted to wear clothes dyed in purple, due to its rarity and expense. We chose the traditional hue to represent both the quality of the products, and our utmost respect for our customers for the silk ties atop our Supple Moisture Rich Silk Cream . The ties are made by a kimono artisan outside of Kyoto, hand-dyed and woven of the same silk created for kimonos. It is inspired by the kimono worn by the geisha and the naturally silky softness of her skin. • The box carton carrying each product is shaped after hikidashi , Japanese drawers used to store treasures like kimono and family heirlooms. These drawers are embellished with a traditional Japanese moongrass pattern used as a natural motif. • The interlocking hexagon pattern on the stickers is called kikko , or tortoise shell, which represents longevity, health and happiness. The seal itself represents freshness and promises the quality of the product inside. Japanese history and symbols are rich with meaning; we are still finding ways to incorporate them into our collection. I look forward to sharing more stories and heritage with you as our collection continues to grow.

Since then, I have been simply obsessed with this exquisite part of Japan’s history and culture, returning again and again to explore its significance. I’ve learned that gold serves as a mark of quality and reflects the utmost form of artisanship in Japanese culture. Marco Polo dubbed Japan Zipang (or “country of gold”) during his world travels. He wrote of temples, sculptures and paintings gleaming with paper-thin gold leafing. Solid gold thread was even incorporated into luxuriously woven patterns. Due to its exclusivity, gold was most often featured in sculptures of Buddha and shrines to show respect and deference. I am fascinated to see how frequently—and how differently—gold is used in the West by contrast (solid-gold toilets, anyone?). In Japan, gold leafing is considered a handcrafted art, historical and delicate. Its presence is considered a mark of authenticity (a truth I share when asked about the transfer of little glittering flecks from our Aburatorigami papers to skin). With such a rich history, I was eager to revisit it with our newest GOLD collection .

The sun was setting, and she seemed to materialize out of thin air—a sight that literally took my breath away. Her makeup looked translucent in the fading light, creating a perfect backdrop for her iconic red lips. As she spoke and laughed, I was entranced by the vermillion rosebud of her lips. They were the perfect shade of crimson, not too red, not too bright, but demure and defined enough to be truly elegant. In a world filled with red lip color, hers seemed distinctive in a timeless way, and I never forgot the stunning effect. Years later, when a makeup artist asked whether I’d help create a special lipstick shade for an actress’ upcoming red carpet appearance, I thought instantly of the vivid geisha I met that evening in Kyoto. The next six months were spent experimenting with textures, tones and pigments to find the perfect combination—when we opened one of the most recent boxes from our lab in Japan, we knew in an instant that we had found the magical match. Its undertones were traditional, rooted in a shade known as shu-iro : a distinctive vermillion that is one of the most symbolic colors in Japan, often used to paint shrines, gates and other landmarks because of the belief that it brings happiness, good luck and protection. The formula, however, is thoroughly modern—a universally flattering, long-lasting matte finish that brings out the radiance of every skin tone while keeping lips hydrated and soft at the same time. Its unique combination of pigments makes it a \"neutral\" red that instantly illuminates the complexion of everyone who wears it. The actress—whose red lips are part of her signature look—loved the shade as much as we did. So many others asked if they could purchase it that we knew we wanted to make it available to women everywhere.

In this abundance, I find it challenging to be present and make the most of the moment, as I am pulled between Kyoto and San Francisco, between work and home. Building a personal morning ritual has been my secret to achieving this presence of mind. Creating a ritual is simple. Although each step is repeated, with an effort to be mindful, it is a new experience every time. In Japanese, this idea is embodied in the phrase, ichi-go, ichi-e , which translates to “just this one moment, once in a lifetime.” Ichi-go, ichi-e speaks to the unique beauty of each moment, added up to make the sum of a life. Every morning, I wake up early to give myself time for my ritual, while the house is still and quiet. I cleanse my skin to awaken my senses, using the Pure One Step Camellia Cleansing Oil to give myself a one-minute lymphatic massage and then follow with the Polished Classic Rice Enzyme Powder to start the day with a smooth, bright canvas. After cleansing and moisturizing, the Luminous Deep Hydration Firming Eye Serum is a new favorite essential in my morning ritual. I pull this new treasure out of my fridge, where the naturally-cool ceramic applicator receives an extra boost that makes applying the serum a refreshing experience. The Eye Serum instantly smoothes and firms my under-eye area, which can be prone to puffiness. After caring for my skin, I brew a pot of green tea, letting its sweet, grassy fragrance awaken my senses. I began drinking green tea in the mornings after so many encounters with my geisha friends. The familiar, crisp flavor of green tea always reminds me of them and the meditative tea ceremonies they host. Over a steaming cup, I reflect on my intentions for the day. With a focus for the day, I am ready to embrace Alea’s boundless energy and be fully present when we talk about what the day ahead of us looks like. My morning isn’t complete without my breakfast with Alea. Now, mornings at home are made more lively by our two new kittens—Romeo and Juliet. Sometimes Romeo swats at Juliet’s tail, other times they curl up together, sweetly purring. But, always, they are present for breakfast. As I go about my day, the Eye Serum has become my go-to for touch-ups, especially during longer days. I apply it over makeup, especially while traveling or for meetings with press. If your concealer tends to settle, the Eye Serum evens it out by smoothing fine lines while leaving eyes feeling refreshed. Okinawa Red Algae, the cornerstone ingredient in every treasure in the Luminous Collection, replenishes skin with moisture, plumping thirsty areas. A fine dusting of 23-karat gold brightens shadows, deflecting light so that I don’t need to reapply concealer. Taking a moment to touch-up with this Eye Serum is transformed into a mini-ritual and gives me a moment of tranquility and self-reflection. Following my ritual gives each day a beginning that feels special. Whether it’s remembering the way Alea kisses my cheek that morning, or giving my skin a little extra care, or something our furry friends did during breakfast, these beautiful little moments in the early hours are the foundation of my day. What is your morning ritual? I would love to hear how you begin each day, too.

Alea in particular manages to get herself into weekly scrapes. With this history, I was not entirely shocked when she arrived home from daycare coated in black marker – I have long stopped asking questions about what happens in daycare. Although I hadn’t tested the Camellia Cleansing Oil on marker before, it seemed worth trying. Fortunately, just like waterproof makeup, the marker melted away and was gone before she could start fidgeting. In my career in the skincare industry, I’ve heard a lot of fact and fiction around face oils. Alea’s squeaky-clean face (at least until dinnertime) reminded me to share some of the knowledge I’ve learned over the years. So here it is: the truth about face oils, as inspired by a three-year old. Firstly, not all oils are created equal. Different oils have different molecular weights and structures, so some (like cocoa butter) can cause breakouts while others (many botanical oils) are non-comedogenic. Some of our favorites include squalane, camellia oil and macademia nut oil. Non-comedogenic oils can benefit all skin types – yes, even oily skin! Like dissolves like, so a good oil cleanser will melt away excess sebum, in addition to debris, sunscreen, and makeup without stripping away natural moisture. Certain botanical oils are particularly compatible with the skin and have anti-oxidant, anti-irritation and anti-microbial properties.Oils are also wonderful as a leave-on treatment. They create a light barrier to keep in your skin’s hydration and protect it from the environment. Leave-on oils are more appropriate for dry or combination skin, but still should not cause breakouts as long as they are non-comedogenic. Since I got over my fear of oils, they have become part of my daily routine. And once Alea finds her way into my makeup supply, I’m sure she will rely upon them, too! I hope this helps some of you venture into the world of oils and try something new. I think you’ll be glad that you did.

Like their diet, ingredients they use on their faces are focused on balancing and calming the body, ideas which are rooted in traditional Eastern medicine. “Efficacious, anti-inflammatory ingredients, such as Japanese Indigo, soothe the skin while repairing and healing the damage caused by inflammation.” What is referred to as excessive “internal heat” in Eastern medicine parallels modern science’s recent focus on inflammation. Current research links premature aging to chronic inflammation, a condition in which the body’s natural immune response becomes unregulated and begins to cause systemic harm. The skin reflects this imbalance, causing redness and irritation. Efficacious, anti-inflammatory ingredients, such as Japanese Indigo, soothe the skin while repairing and healing the damage caused by inflammation. That’s why these timeless ingredients are at the heart of our ritual for sensitive skin, and have such a comforting effect. Calming the complexion is one way to bring the skin into balance. Many aspects of the classic Japanese lifestyle embrace a balanced approach to living, too. Here are a few tips I’ve learned from my travels to Kyoto that reduce chronic inflammation, from the inside and out: Brew and enjoy a cup of green tea . The meditative practice of preparing and sipping green tea relaxes the mind and reduces stress. Green tea’s anti-inflammatory effects and high levels of EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) make it a powerful, anti-aging ingredient. Eat with a variety and savor every bite . Unlike many Western meals with an entrée starring at the center of the plate, most traditional Japanese meals offer a variety of different small dishes, served together. This principle is called ichi ju san sai (one soup and three side dishes, plus rice) and is essential to the Japanese diet. Beautifully arranged, these meals delight all of the senses and feed the soul. If you like seafood, try eating more fish . Fish is a staple source of protein in Japan, and is rich in fatty acids that have anti-inflammatory benefits for the whole body. Walnuts and almonds are an excellent vegetarian option to benefit from the same fatty acids. Add turmeric . In the southernmost region of Japan is Okinawa, which is also called the “Longevity Island.” Okinawans are famed not only for having the world’s longest life expectancies, but also aging healthfully. One reason for their long and healthy lives is the turmeric tea they drink. Turmeric has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. You can easily make your own at home by adding a teaspoon of ground turmeric to approximately four cups of boiling water. You can also benefit from turmeric by adding it to your cooking. Let your skincare ritual reflect most of these principles . Many anti-inflammatory ingredients that soothe the body internally are also efficacious on the skin. Calmness, from the inside or the outside, restores skin’s natural glow. I hope these tips I’ve picked up along the way help you discover simple ways to find more balance. If you’re already mindful of inflammation, please share your own ways of soothing and balancing the body from the inside out!

I called my friend Yoko, a wise and wonderful translator who was helping me in my research, and asked her what an “Ama” was. I could hear her smile through the phone and she said, \"Oh Vicky-san, you will love the Ama. They are Japanese female free divers who farm in the sea.\" Fascinated by the idea of these strong, beautiful sea-farming women, I began to read more about them. I found that Japanese Ama female free divers are responsible for some of the early reports of mermaids. Clad in only a loincloth, these women would dive to depths of 80 feet to harvest the treasures of the ocean. Their traditions have been documented for the last 2,000 years (references to Ama have been found in an 8th century book of poetry). Ama are extraordinarily in touch with the natural world. They were among the first to notice the ocean’s rising temperatures, and eschew modern trappings like oxygen tanks in favor of traditional free diving. To protect themselves in frigid ocean waters, Ama took advantage of camellia oil benefits for skin and would coat their bodies with Japanese Camellia Oil—the same Camellia Oil responsible for the lustrous hair and gleaming skin of the Oshima Island girls. Geisha learned of the incredible, proven benefits of Camellia Oil for skin and began applying it after bathing to protect their own skin, leaving it nourished and glowing. I have always found inspiration in the past, and this story is particularly striking to me. Centuries of history and generations of wisdom surround this delicate, beautiful flower and the oil it imparts.

The native camellia japonica begins blooming in February, even through the snow, earning the nickname “rose of winter.” But it’s the oil, cold-pressed from the plant’s seeds, that is the true treasure. A member of the same botanical family as the plants cultivated for tea, camellia oil is similarly rich in antioxidants and beneficial vitamins. It has one of the highest percentages of omega-9 oleic acid of any natural oil – higher than olive oil and avocado oil – yet its molecular structure allows it to be more easily absorbed by the skin, resulting in a lighter and more velvety feel. This means it will not clog pores, leave a residue on the surface of the skin or cause breakouts; just a few drops provide deeply nourishing hydration. While camellia oil is a novel discovery in some parts of the world, Japan’s geisha have long prized it as one of the most important parts of their beauty rituals. They massaged onto the face to melt away thick stage makeup, keep their skin soft and give their hair a sleek, lacquer shine. Sumo wrestlers and kabuki actors also used it to sculpt and condition their hairstyles, and chefs kept small bottles in their kitchens to keep their knives sharp and prevent discoloration. The light, flavorless composition of camellia oil is also used for cooking and frying, which makes for a beautifying treat inside and out. I hope you love this precious botanical as much as I do.

The complex flavor of the fermented rice spirit, at once sweet and dry, celebrates a grain that has been a beauty and dietary staple for centuries. Though enjoyed year-round, Oct. 1 is officially designated as Sake Day because it marks the traditional beginning of the brewing season. “Though enjoyed year-round, Oct. 1 is officially designated as Sake Day ...” Geisha were among the first to discover sake’s beautifying benefits, inside and out. Every time I visit, my geisha friends insist on pouring me a glass, telling me they drink at least two small glasses (called ochoko ) a day keep skin soft and radiant. As sake warms the body internally while simultaneously stimulating circulation, it is thought to help the body eliminate toxins and comfort aching muscles. Two ochoko were believed to be “just right” to warm the body without overheating it (not to mention making the rest of the day feel a little lighter, too). Another favorite part of the geisha beauty ritual is pouring a bottle (or up to two liters) of sake into a steamy bath and soaking for at least 30 minutes. Rich in enzymes and 20 amino acids resulting from the fermentation process, sake gently exfoliates the uppermost layers of skin while the minerals and vitamins boosts skin’s natural moisture-retaining properties. Sake has also been used as a brightening, refreshing treatment when applied directly to the skin. Simply dip a cotton ball or a cloth in some sake and pat gently onto a freshly-washed face.

Whenever I am feeling tired or in need of a boost, I find myself returning to these truths and find myself feeling better before long. 1. A large part of the allure of the geisha stems from the fact that they’re a little bit unknowable. I’m no longer single, but if I were I would definitely take some learnings from that. It's a good thing to be a little bit mysterious. 2. Red lipstick looks good on everyone. 3. True beauty begins in the heart and mind. 4. There are many attractive women out there, but it is hard to not be attracted to someone who is confident, courageous and has a point of view. 5. When it comes to showing some skin—less is more. When in formal kimono almost every inch of their body is covered. The only areas exposed are the hands and the nape of the neck, tantalizing the imagination. 6. Although the West has largely misappropriated the geisha as concubines, they are in fact highly trained professional dancers and musicians, very well educated and very good at what they do. Being excellent at what you do is undeniably appealing. 7. There’s a lot to be said for dressing up. Especially in this land of hoodies and jeans, putting on a dress or something special not only feels good, it celebrates your feminine side. 8. Wash your face every night. Because purification is at the heart of the geisha beauty ritual, taking the time to properly cleanse my face every evening makes me feel like I am getting a truly fresh start. 9. Stay out of the sun! I will walk across the street to stay in the shade and always wear sunscreen . Long before science proved how damaging UV rays are for the skin, the geisha knew that staying out of the sun kept their skin looking healthy. Using a deeply hydrating moisturizer, like the GOLD Camellia Beauty Oil, is one of my favorite ways to end the day. 10. Some of the most attractive, mesmerizing geisha I have known are the ones who were in their 70s and beyond, because they have honed the art of being an interesting person over all those decades. In the West, we are obsessed with youth and beauty, but these women have taught me that beauty is something to be gained over time, not something that is lost over time."],"Title":["10 Things I learned from a Geisha"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"d6c2-4ec4-9651","_cached_page_id":"0324ce6238af43a2d7ed662bd1dbfdf69f7fd9f3"}

While searching for an alternative to steroid treatments for my eczema though, I was intrigued to learn that Japanese Indigo, or Indigo Naturalis , ( polygonum tinctorum ) is actually a beautiful plant with powerful healing benefits that has long been prized in Eastern medicine as a dietary supplement for internal inflammatory conditions. Knowing this, researchers have investigated natural Japanese Indigo’s unique chemistry and its potential for other medical uses. Current clinical studies have found that the active compounds in Indigo have significant anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anti-fungal properties. Curious as to whether this would work for my eczema, the scientists at Tatcha Institute and I began running experiments and to my delight, it did heal my eczema, which had become resistant to steroids and light therapy. The more we experimented over two years, the more we came to understand and appreciate the potency of this fascinating botanical. Three active compounds in natural Japanese Indigo—trypanthrin, indirubin, and isatin—provide its anti-inflammatory effects. Specifically, recent research has shown that Indigo is especially effective for patients with psoriasis, a proliferative skin disease, when applied topically. Because it worked so well in creams, I thought it could also be beneficial in our exfoliating Rice Enzyme Powders. Even though the formulas are very gentle, those with eczema, psoriasis and other sensitive skin conditions tend to avoid exfoliation in order to prevent further irritation. Though it may seem counterintuitive, daily exfoliation is essential for restoring skin to its natural, healthy balance. Eczema and other inflammatory experiences actually kill skin cells, leaving behind rough patches of skin that actually prevent lotions and treatments from penetrating. By gently sloughing away those irritated, itchy patches, the skin is able heal itself. Adding calming Colloidal Oatmeal to the formula provides skin with immediate nourishment and soothing protection, which helps skin retain its natural moisture—an essential part of restoring balance. Colloidal Oatmeal (a fancy name to describe oats that have been ground, boiled, steamed, and then finely milled) is another time-tested ingredient. Even a millennium ago, oatmeal baths in Ancient Egypt were a common remedy for dry, irritated skin. The actives include lipase, an enzyme that gently breaks down long-chain proteins in old skin cells so they can be easily sloughed away. Gamma oryzanol, another rice active, has anti-oxidant properties that protect against UV-induced damage for protection as well as nourishment. With Tatcha Institute , our research and teaching group, our mission is to keep finding ways to create new efficacious formulas firmly rooted in the wisdom of the past. It’s humbling to realize that seemingly simple ingredients have proven so effective. It was even more humbling when a dear friend told me he was suffering from bumpy eczema patches on his face. I sent him some of our new Indigo Soothing Rice Enzyme Powder to try for himself. Within two weeks of regular use morning and evening, his patches faded away and his skin was back to bright and glowing—so much so that when he went back to his dermatologist for a check-up, even she was surprised. I hope that the new Indigo Soothing Rice Enzyme Powder will bring you the freshest skin possible especially if you have had trouble finding something gentle enough to use every day.

The first wash was always cloudy and milky, eventually running clear. We would wash our faces with the first wash – my mother insisted it was what kept our complexions clear and spotless. Later on, as I began researching the ingredients from our inspiration book , I came across rice extract in almost every recipe. I wanted to learn why, and my search led me to sake brewers. Also known as toji, these men are actually farmers for three seasons out of the year, so the skin on their faces and arms is predictably weathered from being exposed to the elements. During the winter, when the ground is frozen, they brew sake to make a living. Despite their worn faces and arms, the toji are legendary for their ageless-looking hands. To discover for ourselves if this was true, we traveled to one of the most revered and oldest sake brewers in Fushimi, Kyoto called Masudatokubei-shoten. The owner, Tsukino Katsura, is a 14th-generation sake brewer, and he was kind enough to let us watch the brewing process. When we arrived, there was sweet-smelling steam rising from the rice, and the room was full of elderly men singing, to keep their rhythm for mixing the rice. Sure enough, they had beautiful, youthful hands, which contrasted starkly with their weathered faces. With our scientists, we learned that rice contains essential ingredients such as gamma oryzanol and inositol, both of which are natural UV absorbers, antioxidants, and moisturizers which are incredibly healthy for the skin. We knew we had to incorporate this in our formulas and share them with the world.

But this is not the case in many parts of the world, and that inspires me to understand how I can celebrate my face and body at every age. While traveling in Japan I heard the phrase “Bijin ni toshi nashi,” means “Beautiful women have no age,” something I agree with wholeheartedly. Understanding your skin’s natural process is the key to acceptance, and appreciating that there are two basic kinds of aging: internal and external. Diet, exercise, genetics, smoking, sun exposure -- even gravity – all play a role in skin’s appearance. But there are many things you can do to keep your complexion looking its best. Here are some of our favorite tips: In your 20s: Breakouts, sunburns and inconsistent cleansing can stress the skin. Our advice: invest in a great cleanser/exfoliator. Wear sunscreen every day and avoid prolonged exposure and tanning beds! In your 30s - 40s : The childbearing years take a hormonal toll and breakouts can still be an issue. This is also when the first signs of aging appear – including fine lines, dry patches and dullness. Our advice: Leave the teenage acne products behind because they are too harsh and drying (as are foaming cleansers, alcohol-based toners). A daily moisturizing treatment is a must. In your 40s - 50s: With careers in full swing, travel and stress can wreak havoc with hydration. The loss of fullness around the orbital bone and cheeks can lead to sagging, Our advice: Targeted moisturizers like eye creams and serums are essential, as is daily exfoliation, which keeps skin cells turning over at a healthy rate for a fresh, healthy looking glow. In your 60s - beyond: Skin becomes thinner and more delicate, leading to a loss of elasticity. Spots may appear more pronounced. Our advice: Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize – and smile!

I learned from local artisans that geisha and kabuki actors were the first to discover that the papers once used to create whisper-thin gold sheets are also ideal for keeping makeup petal-fresh. Up to that point, and like so many in the Western world, my understanding of geisha was almost entirely limited to the book Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden, and I had a vague idea that they might be courtesans. Growing up, however, I had often heard that Asian beauty regimes originated from the geisha’s rituals, thus I began my quest to meet a modern-day geisha and learn about her beauty rituals. Since that time, I’ve had the opportunity to meet and learn from a number of amazing women who are, indeed, modern-day geisha. During our time together, they’ve not only shared their highly evolved beauty rituals, but they’ve also imparted great wisdom about their artistry and impossibly beautiful world. At TATCHA, we work tirelessly to create a resource that not only mirrors the geisha’s rituals but also offers a glimpse into their world, a mysteriously alluring place so often misunderstood. Here are a few introductory points to begin: - Geisha literally translates to “person of art”. These women are highly trained, elite performers who share an artistic lineage with kabuki actors. - Geisha are often confused with courtesans when, in fact, they are actually respected artists dedicated to preserving time-honored arts including classical dance, playing musical instruments, hosting select clientele and supporting religious ceremonies for local temples. - A geisha’s kimono can weigh up to 40 lbs. and requires the aid of a professional dresser, who is the only male allowed in her all-female living quarters. - Geisha work 7 days a week training and entertaining, taking only 2 days per month to rest. This training continues until retirement as geisha believe there is always something new to learn. - Geisha are revered amongst artists in Japan for their tireless devotion to their craft, which requires years of intense training across the arts. - Geisha have been revered as beauty icons for centuries. The well-known white makeup that geisha are often known for is called oshiroi, and was originally used so that the audience could see them perform by candlelight. - The Western perception of a geisha is always accompanied by her iconic makeup: snow-white skin, red lips, impeccably lined eyes.

The thought and care applied by each artisan—whether making sake (a lovesong to Japan’s cherished staple, rice), whisking green tea (a symbol of Japanese hospitality) or wrapping a gift (a way to show love and care)—makes even the humblest activities feel luxurious. This Japanese artistry and attention to detail inspired us when we began creating our Silk Lipsticks. We wanted both the Kyoto Red Silk Lipstick and Sunrise: A Plum Blossom Silk Lipstick to be more than just lipsticks--they had to feel like works of art, from Japan with love. To bring these lipsticks to life, we collaborated with celebrated designers and engineers from the U.S. and Japan. It took over a year to develop our lipsticks, from the jewel-like faceting of the bullets to the way they feel in hand: Custom tooling : we created custom tools to engineer each lipstick. This means each lipstick requires special attention and care, and can’t be reproduced outside of Japan or in large quantities. Bespoke metalwork : the golden touches on each lipstick is inspired by Rinpa , a Japanese school of art from 17th century Kyoto. Rinpa art is known for incorporating painting and metalwork, which informed the finishes of our golden mon logo. Iconic colors : in designing Sunrise: A Plum Blossom, we chose a creamy white color for the case to represent the blanketing of snow (plum blossoms are a winter bloom), the perfect backdrop for the gleaming band of gold that recalls the touch of an illuminating sunrise. One-of-a-kind faceting : each bullet is fashioned into a diamond-like shape, making it easy to apply in clean lines without lip liner. Texture and weight : the materials for the lipsticks were chosen not only for their practicality but for their weight and the way they feel in hand with each swipe of color. While the outside is meant to stand as a work of art, the inside should feel just a beautiful, especially when worn. The cool pink color of Sunrise: A Plum Blossom comes from the first blooms of Japan’s winter (the plum or ume blossom), often seen peeking out from beneath a dusting of snow. Plum fruit and Silk extracts in the formula richly hydrate lips so it feels barely-there when worn. The 23-karat gold gives the color a subtle, flattering hint of brightness. Together, our custom-made case and formula are an homage to Kyoto’s craftsmanship, a token of which you can hold in your hand, or wear on your lips. When you purchase any item in our collection, it’s not just a formula or a pretty package that you receive, it’s a small piece of the beautiful tradition, heritage and artistry found nowhere else.

As I walk its cobblestone streets, I look for one of my favorite signs of a beautiful spring to come: the vibrant, pink blossoms of the Japanese Plum trees. One bright, crisp morning, I was lucky enough to spot these plum pink blooms, peeking from a snow-powdered branch. As the golden sun illuminated their blush-toned petals, my heart was filled with wonder by these hopeful flowers. In that moment, my spirits were lifted by the blossom’s unique gift of cheer and I wanted to share its beauty with my friends. I turned to my dear friend and talented makeup artist, Matthew Vanleeuwen, to help me capture this moment of inspiration. Matthew, who has created beautiful, glowing looks for his celebrity clientele and countless editorial features, has a deep understanding of color undertones and what shades flatter individual women. Together, we studied Japanese Plum Blossoms and looked to the natural, blush-toned hue found on the lips of my geisha friends to create a beautiful lip color for every woman. Sunrise: A Plum Blossom Limited Edition 23-karat Gold Illuminated Lipstick is our gift of love to you. Its cool pink brings a natural blush to lips, like the natural flush of a baby’s lips, and a fine hint of 23-karat gold combined with Silk and Plum extracts provides a hydrating, creamy lustrous finish that wears beautifully all day. This plum pink treasure has quickly become an everyday favorite of mine. I can wear it comfortably during the day, and if I find myself at an event that requires sophistication and glamour, Sunrise: A Plum Blossom complements the occasion perfectly. Our geisha-inspired Kyoto Red Silk Lipstick will always endure as my signature lip color for occasions that require a more striking statement. I am honored to share Sunrise: A Plum Blossom Limited Edition 23-karat Gold Illuminated Lipstick with you. Like Kyoto’s precious Plum Blossoms, this limited-edition lipstick is available this season only.

In Japan, as in other parts of the world, many families have a crest, called a mon , used to decorate everything from formal kimono and swords to vanity sets banners outside the home. These symbols, used as historical representations of a family’s lineage, were first used in the 9th century by nobility and later extended to the wider population. Just like monograms and coats of arms, these motifs communicated more than a name alone could convey. So it was only natural that we were creating TATCHA, we wanted a mon of our own. Nami Onodera, our Senior Director of Product and cultural advisor, found a stunning book containing over 20,000 family crests and their meanings. I loved the detail that each entailed: A fan, for example, represented a family of dancers; a chrysanthemum symbolizes loyalty. Our mon, created by our co-founder Stanley Hainsworth, is a representation of the petals of a single standing flower, a visual extension of the meaning behind our name and the promise of the purity of the products we create. Like other familial banners waving from rooftops across Japan, our mon is a symbol of pride, purpose and heritage – which is why its included on each and every item we make.

I always wear my wedding band, of course, and a simple coin necklace given to me by one of my dearest friends. When we created our Luminous Deep Hydration Revitalizing Eye Mask , we shaped the eye mask after magatama, a traditional and beloved Japanese symbol and accessory. The comma-shaped beads first appeared in prehistoric Japan, originally shaped from earthen materials but eventually crafted from jade and other precious stones. Our natural eye mask continued with this tradition and the eye mask pattern reflects that of magatama. In addition to serving as jewelry, they were used as ceremonial objects. Along with a sword (representing valor) and a mirror (representing wisdom), the magatama is one of the sacred treasures of the Imperial family, representing benevolence. The shape of the magatama, and our eye mask, is far from accidental. It derives from the yin-yang symbol, created in ancient times by recording the shadows cast by the sun in concentric circles on the ground. The markings resulted in the classic form that is so widely recognized today, signifying the harmony of the sun and the moon, and the belief among many that it bestows the wearer with protection, longevity and prosperity. I was awed to hear about the deep symbolism behind this innocuous shape—especially because when utilized as an eye mask pattern, it also was the most effective shape for targeting the area around the eyes for treatment. During testing, I realized magatama had the additional benefit of being uniquely versatile, fitting equally well on men and women, those with various eye shapes and face sizes. It seemed like a sign from above that we were on the right track. I love that this shape gives our simple eye mask much more meaning. And I hope that, as we approach the Vernal Equinox, the magatama brings you the fortune of the sun and moon combined.

There are many things to love about this season, but this year I am particularly enchanted with the minimalist aesthetic. Crisp white shirts and bare skin are center stage, with bold red lips and graphic eyeliner in key supporting roles. “Fall is really all about the freshness and health of the skin ... Sometimes it truly does seem that everything old is new again! The geisha knew long ago that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, especially when it came to their beauty rituals (and their iconic white performance makeup accented with red lips and black eyeliner). Caring for their skin every day created the very poreless canvas that graces the pages of today’s glossy magazines. So when my dear friend and celebrity makeup artist Matthew VanLeeuwen stopped by for a visit, I asked him to share a few secrets about how he helps his famous friends look modern without being trendy. “Fall is really all about the freshness and health of the skin, not covered up, not heavy, so it really comes down to good skin maintenance,” he said. Gentle cleaning, exfoliating and lots of moisturizer will keep skin looking fresh and healthy. “After that, you do something strong with just one of your features.” Here are some of his other tips: • Start with your eyes: “I like to start with the eyeshadow, line the eye, curl the lashes and apply mascara, because it’s easier to tidy up and you’re 80 percent done with your look before focusing on the rest of the skin.” • Limit your foundation and concealer: “Avoid using any more than what your skin needs, and stick with the smallest amount you can get away with.” • Contouring is key: “Using a bronzer provides depth and definition, which is essential for not looking too washed out.” • Glow on: “Use a light gold or other pale shimmery shade to highlight the inner corner of the eye where it meets the base of the ridge of the nose. This looks good on everybody as long as you stick with a true shimmer shadow (not glittery or iridescent). It also looks terrific on the upper orbital bone under the outer part of the eyebrow. You can also apply a narrow line along the top half of the nose, which creates length and keeps the energy of the look on the upper part of the face. Imagine a triangle from the top of your brows to the bottom of the nose and keep highlights to that area for the best and most natural effect.” • Lip Reading: “To find the best bold color for your lips, try on a lot of classic, bright, matte tones to get a feel for which one feels easiest. If it doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t. Once you found The One, use a light shimmer pencil to very subtly outline the cupid’s bow on the lip and blend very well to really make it pop.” • The Color Purple: “Even though black is the most popular, I love lining the eyes with a deep plum. It’s a color that works on everybody, and has a softer feel than black. It also reacts well with other colors. With black mascara, it really helps the lashes jump forward. It’s a great way to take a trend and make it more wearable for everyone and looks less harsh than black liner with black mascara. I almost never line with black, actually. I just find plum to be very magical.” • Get a Little Misty: “Don’t forget to use a few sprays of Luminous Dewy Skin Mist which imparts that incredible sheen and helps set the makeup.” What are you most looking forward to this fall?

So it’s no surprise that timeless beauty icons from geisha to Marilyn Monroe to Taylor Swift embrace this striking color as a signature look, versatile for daytime and evening. Personally, I spent years thinking I couldn't pull off a red lip, and opted for muted, paler shades of pink. Then, a dear friend who is also a celebrity makeup artist, asked me to create a custom red for a beloved A-lister. At the Tatcha Institute, I began experimenting with all kinds of pigments and formulas and was surprised to find myself growing more and more fond of the look as we worked on a shade that would look good on everyone every time, everywhere. Now Kyoto Red is my go-to shade—it always boosts my mood, especially when I’m facing a challenge or a new experience. Working in skincare and with my appearances on QVC, I often feel pressured to have luminous skin, even after a long journey. I've found that Kyoto Red instantly illuminates my skin, giving me the glow of a good night's sleep. Because there are so many red lipsticks in the world, we knew we had to make one that would truly flatter every skin tone, last all day without drying, and most of all, feel luxurious. Creating the Kyoto Red Silk Lipstick required advanced technologies and rare ingredients, including pure silk powder and a blend of brilliant, high-intensity pigments. The base pigment contains a touch of yellow to counterbalance the undertones in the lips, which creates a neutral foundation. Microscopic spheres of warm and cool-toned red pigments are blended together to reflect light and create a unique illuminating effect for everyone who wears it. With a matte finish, Kyoto Red not only looks good on everyone, it also looks a little different. Kyoto Red will appear more blue or red depending on your skin tone, because it is a true neutral and compliments every undertone. So get ready to receive lots of compliments whenever you wear it, because I promise you will. And I would love to see what it looks like on you, so please share a photograph of yourself wearing this iconic color on our Facebook page, Instagram or in the comments field below with #KyotoRed.

Thus, I only saw them in full costume with the flowing kimono, delicately painted white faces and vermillion lips. Pictures rarely do justice to their otherworldly appearance because the harsh glare of a flash bounces off the white makeup and creates an extreme effect in photography. In person, the geisha’s makeup glows under the moonlight and has an almost transparent quality. As the geisha began to truly welcome me into their world, I started to spend time with them as they rested between classes. This was when I realized the real story behind a geisha’s beauty: Underneath their iconic white makeup is the most breathtakingly pure skin I had ever seen in my life. I have met trainee geisha as young as 19 and senior geisha as old as 70, but regardless of age they all share the same exquisite complexion. The Japanese actually have a name for skin like this. They call it “ mochi hada ,” which refers to the pure, gleaming, soft quality of a baby’s skin. Given the demanding hours geisha keep, the full makeup they constantly apply and perspiration that comes with their intricate and demanding dances, I never expected these women to have such beautiful skin. Naturally, I had to ask what their secrets were and, amazingly, their ritual is simple and straightforward: Purify: Removing makeup and environmental impurities from the face is the most important secret to mochi hada skin. Geisha must be diligent about this step because of their white makeup, so they use a tsubaki (camellia) classical cleansing oil to melt away the day. Polish: Gently releasing dead skin from the surface of the skin daily not only leaves skin with a soft, healthy gleam but also improves the efficacy of any treatments used afterwards. For centuries, they have used komenuka ( Japanese rice bran ) to polish the skin. Brighten: When geisha are not in performance makeup, they are required to keep their skin fresh and free of makeup, but they are still expected to have porcelain complexions. As a result, they are keen on addressing age spots and have found licorice root extract extract to be amongst the most effective natural ingredients for preventing and improving the appearance of hyperpigmentation—without sensitizing the skin to the sun as so many modern day brighteners do. Nourish: The final step in the geisha’s ritual is nourishing and sealing in moisture with luxuriously lightweight creams . A popular classical ingredient for such moisturizers is silk extract, which forms a weightless, invisible network on the skin to hold moisture in all day without the heaviness of oils and butters used conventionally in the Western world. Blot: During makeup application and throughout the day, keeping the skin petal-fresh without disturbing their intricate makeup is essential to keeping the geisha’s complexion clear. This is how they discovered the benefits of the gold-leaf beauty papers .

Between the lines of text in one of our foundational manuscripts, the Miyakofuzoku Kewaiden , I saw a glimpse into these beauty treatments in a woodblock illustration. According to the text, geisha and noble women brewed essences of tea leaves, flowers and herbs and steamed strips of leftover kimono silk over this enriched elixir. Geisha then placed the essence rich silks on their faces, letting these vital extracts sink in. Inspired by this classical beauty treatment, I wanted to create a modern mask of our own that could hold moisture to the skin the same way that enriched silk drapes over skin. In our research, we came across a unique material designed to quickly aid in the healing of burn victims’ wounds. Made of coconut-derived biocellulose, these sheets formed a hydrating, protective layer over the skin. When I tried it on for myself, I was amazed by the way the sheet conformed to my hand: it didn’t budge or slide when I moved. To create one of Tatcha’s signature, ultra-concentrated treatment masks, the coconut water of one whole coconut fruit is treated and purified until it turns into a flexible, gel sheet. These sheets are then immersed in a special blend of Okinawa Red Algae , hyaluronic acid and our proprietary, anti-aging Hadasei-3 Bioactive Complex. Okinawa Red Algae, a marine botanical harvested from Japan’s southernmost tropical islands, is prized for its ability to replenish skin’s natural moisture barrier and enhance skin’s barrier function. When applied to the skin, the highly concentrated sheet of coconut water forms a special occlusive layer over the skin. Beneath the sheet, skin is flooded with our hydrating, anti-aging blend of botanicals. This special layer makes it possible for the skin to receive the treatment benefits in a matter of minutes. Once the treatment mask is lifted away, the texture of the newly hydrated skin is smoother, skin looks brighter and fine lines are visibly plumped, making for a truly youthful, luminous complexion. We are thrilled that so many of our friends tell us they get the same results from a Tatcha treatment mask as they would from a facial at the spa. Even in independent clinical testing, we saw instant, beautifully stunning results. After a fifteen-minute treatment with a Luminous Deep Hydration Lifting Mask, clinical measurements showed that on average, women experienced a 197% increase in the hydration of their skin and 100% agreed their skin felt firmer and smoother after one use. The results are not only in the numbers, but most visible on the photos from the study participants. Our Deep Hydration Lifting Masks are a weekly part of my ritual, especially when my skin needs an instant renewal. I love being able to carry along an envelope that contains everything I need for a spa-quality glow at any time. When I’m on the road, sheet masks are an essential—so much so that I like to call them my cheat sheets for sleep. The immediate plumping effect, from the flush of hydrating botanical extracts and the unique, coconut-derived mask, leaves my skin glowing and lifted. As with all of our discoveries, they bring me most joy when I can share them with my friends. This treatment is a simple and effortless addition to any skincare ritual for a visibly plumped, luminous complexion without having to leave the peaceful comfort of home.

I stepped inside and was amazed at the delicate, colorful world before me. The shop specialized in silk and embroidery for kimonos. Seeing it up close, I was mesmerized by the elaborate details and the delicate, whisper-thin fabric. In addition to his array of silks, the owner kept a library of the history of the kimono, which stretches back centuries. I knew that silk has been treasured since ancient times, when its use was reserved for emperors and royalty. But I was fascinated to learn that treatises and precious documents were written out on silk paper, and a length of silk cloth was once so valuable it was used as currency. In Japan, the fabric has become so ingrained in the culture that there is a beautiful saying about maiko, or young apprentice geisha: “If you look closely at a maiko’s skin, it is made of pure silk.” When studying our centuries-old beauty book detailing timeless geisha rituals, I had always been struck by one illustration in particular. In it, young women are poised over an elegant tub, washing themselves with swatches of fabric. The translation explained that geisha would often use leftover strips of kimono silk to wash themselves, finding that it left their skin smoother and softer.

It was nearly flawless and I had no idea how lucky I was for that—until later in my career when I had the opportunity to work with some of the biggest beauty companies in the world. After months of product testing for some of the most expensive brands on the market, I developed acute dermatitis. This is commonly defined as including rashes, blisters and crusting. But the words don’t do it justice. The hives, bleeding blisters and scaling covered my face, including my lips and eyelids. It was difficult to face people. It took a year of topical and oral antibiotics and steroids to regain control and doctors told me that, even then, my skin would never be the same. They couldn’t tell me exactly what had caused my reaction. It could have been just about anything. (On that note, a 2006 study conducted by Chemical Safe Skincare Research found that the average woman absorbs over five pounds of toxins annually from her bath, body and skincare products.) For a time after that, I became a “green freak” using only all-natural and organic products. These didn’t prove to be any better. Believing there simply must be a better solution, I headed out in search of a more evolved approach to skincare. Remembering my mother’s wisdom, I traveled to Japan where I was fortunate enough to encounter the rituals of the geisha. I still have minor scarring, and my skin is permanently sensitized (which makes me a perfect tester for the line!), but using the geisha’s beautiful, simple, time-honored ingredients truly healed me.

The most unexpected lesson has also become my favorite: Beauty begins from the inside out. This means two things to them: one, that beauty begins in the heart and the mind; and two, that skincare goes far beyond what you put on your skin. They explained to me that your skin is your body’s largest organ, so it makes sense that the superfoods that are so prized in the Japanese diet would be the most beneficial for the skin—Rice, Algae and Green Tea. Each of these has stood the test of time, and this powerful trio is now at the heart of our newest discovery, The Essence . RICE—A NOURISHING ESSENTIAL In Japan, it is often said that a beautiful woman’s skin is like ‘polished rice’—bright, translucent, smooth and soft. The longtime dietary staple also made its way into their skincare rituals, appearing in face washes, body scrubs and moisturizers. Today we know that rice contains Vitamins E and B, nourishing essential fatty acids, natural antioxidants and proteins. These skin-loving ingredients help to enhance the immune system and fight free radicals to help prevent the signs of premature aging. We use rice from Akita, Japan, beloved for its perfect environment for beautiful skin.

GREEN TEA—A POWERFUL PROTECTOR Green Tea is often called liquid jade in Japan—not just because of its beautiful color, but for its powerful health benefits. Known to detoxify and prevent signs of premature aging, Green Tea has been a beloved part of the Japanese diet for generations. The many benefits of this treasured botanical also make it essential in any skincare ritual. The unassuming leaves are a rich source of Epigallocatechin Gallate, or EGCG, widely regarded as one of the most powerful antioxidants available. Its polyphenols target free radicals, particularly those caused by UV-induced oxidative damage. It also helps support the immune system. Whether mixed into a tonic, applied directly onto the skin or steeped in a teapot to enjoy in quietude, Green Tea has long been a staple of the geisha’s beauty rituals. Uji, Japan is the prestigious home of green tea in Kyoto, and the place where our beloved Green Tea comes from. ALGAE—A TREASURE FROM THE SEA Algae is found in almost every meal in Japan, whether in the form of a crisp sheet for a snack or enjoyed cold in a seaweed salad. It offers natural polysaccharides to benefit the body and skin alike. Today, we know that Algae is proven to enhance the skin’s barrier function, replenish the natural water reservoir and increase its moisture-retention capabilities. Our Algae comes from Mozuku, Okinawa—it has long been referred to residents as a treasure from the god of the sea, and is believed to contribute to the longevity of the island’s residents. In creating The Essence, we were inspired by the efficacious natural actives in these three superfoods. We worked with food scientists to create the formula, comprised of 98.7% Green Tea, Rice and Algae. These timeless ingredients are fermented to increase cell turnover and resurface skin for a smooth luster. The water-light formula instantly doubles the hydration of skin above and beyond a moisturizer alone, to soften and plump lines and wrinkles. Skin channels are left flushed with lasting hydration, delivering treatments more deeply and making all skincare more effective. Although The Essence is one of our newest discoveries, its history stretches back centuries—proving that science can only illuminate what nature learned long ago. __________ Our Superfood Recipes Matcha green tea cookies Makes 18 large or 36 small cookies Matcha is essentially green tea in powder form. You can easily add the powder to any baked good to add a dose of antioxidants. My daughter loves to make cookies, especially the Giant Rainbow Cookies from How Sweet Eats, and we simply sift in the matcha powder along with the flour and baking soda. My daughter also likes to add in white chocolate chunks instead M&Ms. 2 cups + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon matcha powder 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) of salted butter, melted and cooled 1 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup sugar 1 egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 cup coarsely chopped white chocolate Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Sift together flour, matcha powder and baking soda in a bowl and set aside. In a separate bowl, mix butter and sugars until combined. Add egg, egg yolk and vanilla and stir until mixed. Slowly add flour mixture and combine until a dough forms. Fold in white chocolate chunks. Portion out the dough into ¼ cup portions for 18 large cookies, or 2 tablespoon portions for 36 smaller cookies. Shape into a ball and then pull apart into two equal pieces, then squish the smooth halves of the ball together so the rough sides are facing out. This is a weird trick but really works! Place dough rough-side up on baking sheets with space in between. Bake for 12-15 minutes (large cookies) or 8-12 minutes (small cookies) or until the edges are slightly brown. The centers should be soft and puffy. Let cool completely then dig in! Japanese green rice and chirashi sushi Makes 5 servings of rice Two superfoods in one! The green tea rice provides a wonderful base for chirashi sushi, a convenient and delish dish sometimes referred to as “sushi salad.” It also helps clean out your fridge when it’s getting a bit full. 3 cups uncooked rice 1 tablespoon green tea Dash of salt Anything in your fridge (green beans, baby corn, mushrooms, carrots, tofu, eggs, etc.) Mix dry green tea with uncooked rice, then cook as normal. The green tea will soften when cooking and add flavor, like a Japanese version of parsley rice. While the rice is cooking, prepare your add-in items as needed. Scramble the eggs, saute mushrooms, julienne carrots for topping, and so forth. Once the rice is cooked, let cool for about ten minutes and mix in the other ingredients. Seaweed salad dressing Makes 1 bottle of dressing Sheets of dried seaweeds are my go-to snack, but this dressing is lovely on seaweed salad or crispy lettuce. 5 tablespoons soy sauce 4 tablespoons rice vinegar 2 tablespoons sesame oil 1 tablespoon cane sugar Whisk together and drizzle on top of wakame seaweed or algae.

When I start to feel that way, I think back to Kyoto. In Kyoto, I love how time stands still. People are busy, but never rushed. People think of Kyoto as a place of temples and geisha, but it’s as modern as it is ancient. Did you know Nintendo is headquartered there? I love the way they are able to marry the efficiency of multitasking with the grace of mindful living. One of my favorite philosophies that applies to both life and skincare is Ban-no : all-purpose and all-mighty. Your things should work hard for you so that you don’t have to work as hard. Tatcha crafts each formula to deliver multiple benefits, offering skin everything it needs and nothing it doesn’t. Our newest treasure, The Water Cream , is an anti-aging moisturizer to hydrate, balance and refine skin in one step. The unique, oil-free formula is a burst of zen for your skin, transforming upon application to release refreshing hydration and powerful Japanese botanicals. The result is smooth, poreless skin that is perfectly prepped for makeup - one less thing for you to worry about. These are some of my favorite philosophies for mindful multitasking at home. Wabi sabi : Imperfections make things more unique. We can so often feel pulled off-balance by a desire to do each and every thing perfectly, in work and in life. This philosophy teaches us to embrace the flaws. For example, cooking a meal for a loved one doesn’t have to be Instagram-worthy—a chipped plate or a crooked sushi roll only makes it more treasured. Ichi-go, ichi-e : Just this one moment, once in a lifetime. This saying reminds us of the preciousness of each interaction we have. There are ways to multitask while also allowing us to spend time with the people we care about. For example, instead of taking a work call while making dinner, multitask by catching up with a friend or loved one while chopping veggies. Omakase : Entrust to others. This word is most often encountered at sushi bars, but also applies to our lives. When ordering, it gives the chef authority to make what they want for you, at the price they set. In life, it reminds us to trust and lean on the people who surround us to help us achieve what we need to do. Kaizen : Make small, continuous improvements. It might not seem like much, but kaizen teaches us to take small steps, towards the change we want. It’s much easier to multitask when you’re working on small changes towards a goal, rather than trying to accomplish something radical. Shankankan: The beauty of taking your time. It is easy for us to rush through our work, turning them into mindless endeavors. Shankankan reminds us to slow down, to take time and even enjoy the work at hand. Nyunanshin : Have a flexible mind. Originating in martial arts, the concept of nyunanshin says that we should maintain an open mind and be receptive to new teachings. There are always more efficient or better ways of completing the task at hand. Whether it’s advice from a successful friend or listening to a productivity podcast, seek out new perspectives. Chisoku : Know when enough is enough. Chisoku comes from a zen principle that says there is no limit to human desire. As such, it is up to us to know when to be satisfied. It can be easy to lose ourselves in a flurry of work, but chisoku reminds us to know when our work is done, so we can step away and enjoy other things. Yataiki: Find joy in small things. Even when tasks seem mindless, there are ways to make them uplifting. In the same way a child finds joy in the smallest things, allow yourself to notice the beauty of the flowers as you run, or the sound of your favorite song as you work. I hope these beautiful philosophies are as transformative for you as they were for me.

In a busy life, it can be easy to get swept up among the to-do lists, swim lessons with my daughter and morning meetings. Often, an hour of meditation feels out of reach. However, many of the practices—and benefits—of meditation and zen philosophies can be incorporated into even the busiest of days. I wanted to share with you a few of my favorite easy ways towards a more worry-free day. The most important is to take a moment for self-care. Particularly these days as the seasons change, it seems like there can be so many things to worry about in our skin, whether it’s too oily in some areas, too dry in others, if our pores look too big, or there’s a pesky last minute breakout before a big event. Tatcha’s new Water Cream was created to bring zen to your skincare ritual. The unique oil-free formula bursts on skin to release refreshing hydration and powerful Japanese botanicals for smooth, poreless skin, making your skin one less thing to worry about. With its pure, minimal ingredients formulated with everything you need and nothing you don’t, it’s even easier to be worry-free. Some other zen-inspired daily tips: Wash your face each morning. Before walking into a temple or shrine in Japan, each person washes their hands to refresh and purify their minds—a clean beginning. Starting the day with a clean face and hands allows you a new beginning, each and every morning. Single-task. There is a zen saying: “When walking, walk. When eating, eat.” These days, multitasking is a fact of life, but it’s worth focusing on the things that matter. When your mind is not juggling many things, it reduces stress to bring skin a rosy glow and clear complexion. Forego your headphones. When meditating, you can either sit in a quiet room to think inward, or in an open room by the garden to better connect with the sounds of nature around you. I like to turn off the radio on my drive into work, or go for a walk with only my thoughts for company. It’s an opportunity to get more in touch with your breath and your body. Spend time with friends. I recently fell in love with the KonMari method—inspired by Japanese essentialism—of simplifying your life and focusing instead on what sparks joy for you. Forego the gym membership for a weekly walk with friends, or cleanse your closet and reward yourself with a new purchase. Give someone a sincere compliment. One core principle of zen is serving others, through volunteering or acts of humility. Although it can be hard to find the time to serve others, this can be incorporated into every day. Even a bright smile or a kind word helps to improve someone’s day, giving you—and them—radiance from the inside out. Don’t be swept away. There is a beautiful Zen saying about the futility of stress: “If the problem has a solution, worrying is pointless as in the end the problem will be solved. If the problem has no solution, there is no reason to worry, because it can’t be solved.” Instead of fretting over things that you can’t control, focus on the things you can. Look at a tree. Inspiration from nature is core to Japanese meditation practices. One beautiful analogy from a Buddhist monk says to observe how a tree sheds its leaves and twigs, but maintains a strong core. This illustrates how we can consider a new perspective, without compromising what is important. Find a mantra. Do you hope to be more calm? More present? Grateful? Reciting a mantra comes from Japanese meditation practices. Choose a mantra that focuses on your goal and repeat it to yourself whenever you think of it, silently and aloud. Think about your body. Many people think that meditation is about quieting your mind—which can seem like a daunting task. Instead, close your eyes and focus on different parts of your body. Are you sore anywhere? Feeling a breeze? Focusing on the sensations you feel is much easier than trying to think about nothing, but has the same de-stressing effect. I hope these tips and tricks will bring some everyday zen into your life.

It’s a beautiful way to appreciate the season, and a wonderful time to spend with friends and loved ones. TATCHA's Cultural Advisor and Senior Direct of Product, Nami Onodera, recently shared with me her favorite meal to bring to a flower viewing. It’s called “chirashi sushi,” or “scattered sushi”— and unlike the better-known and more traditional rolled sushi, this can be made by just about anyone, even kids! It's essentially sushi rice with a light seasoning and your favorite ingredients mixed in or sprinkled on top (sometimes aranged in pretty flower patterns or other colorful patterns). I love that it’s easy to make and endlessly customizable. In addition to being quick and simple, it's also packed with the same ingredients as our skincare collection. The rice and seaweed offer nourishing actives and powerful antioxidants, keeping you beautiful from the inside out. This recipe tastes best when served beneath blossoming cherry trees, but is delightful anytime the weather is warm and you are in for a treat. Here's a basic recipe to get you started, feel free to experiment. Enjoy! CHIRASHI SUSHI 2 cups warm, freshly steamed rice 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar or sake 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon salt Assorted toppings: Nami's favorites include cooked shrimp, smoked salmon, lightly boiled snow peas, nori (dried seaweed) cut into strips, beni shoga (pickled ginger) cut into thin strips, kinshi tamago (sweetened scrambled eggs) and ikura (salmon roe). 1. Combine the vinegar (or sake), sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and warm, stirring, until the sugar and salt have dissolved. 2. Put the warm freshly cooked rice in a wide, shallow wooden bowl. Drizzle in seasoned vinegar little at time and gently fold it into the rice. It helps to fan the rice while doing this, to help it absorb the dressing and add shine. Taste the rice as you go and adjust the seasoning. 3. Spread the sushi rice on a plate, in a layer about 2/3” thick. Cover the toppings evenly over the top. I love when the different-colored toppings mix together, creating a beautiful spring-like look."],"Title":["A delicious springtime tradition"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"d6c2-4ec4-9651","_cached_page_id":"63c9f8bd252d65788161056a66c7916a760a42ea"}

These ubiquitous plants are dokudami (Houttuynia cordata), a medicinal herb famed throughout Asia for its healing benefits. Dokudami is also called juyaku, which means “ten roles” in Japanese—a nickname that highlights how many ailments it helps alleviate. In traditional Japanese medicine, dried dokudami leaves are served as a tea to cleanse the body from the inside. With the arrival of cooler temperatures in the fall, many in Japan, including geisha, still brew cups of dokudami tea as a health drink during the cold and flu season. “Japan’s eldest elephant, Hanako, drinks dokudami tea several times a day .. In fact, Japan’s eldest elephant, Hanako, who is 68, is served dokudami tea several times a day to keep her healthy. Clinical studies have proven the anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory benefits of dokudami. Specifically, dokudami extract has a strong antimicrobial effect against the bacteria most commonly associated with acne. When I learned that, I knew it would be the perfect addition to our Polished Deep Rice Enzyme Powder to help balance acne-prone skin. While dokudami possesses incredible health benefits, it’s also an understated beauty and a symbol of resilience. Dokudami is a stellar example of a botanical ingredient I want to appreciate for its function and its form. Flourishing in spring and lasting through late autumn, dokudami thrives wherever its seeds land, making it a significant part of the landscape in humid climates. Although the leaves appear thin, a single stem of dokudami can withstand the wind and other elements, bending gracefully without breaking or withering. Everytime I see the modest dokudami, it reminds me to keep my mind and eyes open when I’m treasure hunting. Sometimes, an astonishing history and healing power can lie in the most unassuming places—even right in front of you."],"Title":["Beauty by the Cupful"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"d6c2-4ec4-9651","_cached_page_id":"dbdb3b56ca0f4b5815a3aa785e5ee2552c260b24"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["#journey-signature { width: 98px; height: 50px; } Victoria Tsai Chief Treasure Hunter"],"url":"https://www.tatcha.com/blog/10-life-lessons-from-a-buddhist-monk/","Text":["Before I began traveling to Kyoto, it often felt like every day was “busy.” It seems like everyone these days feels rushed and preoccupied, but so often that means lots of activity with little movement. In Kyoto, I began to spend some time at the Buddhist temple in the heart of the oldest green tea garden in Japan. A monk there helped walk me through a guided meditation, with a beautiful zen garden providing the perfect backdrop. Taking those few moments to calm my “monkey mind” and remind myself to be present were transformative as I returned home to San Francisco. Now, I make sure to spend some time with him on each trip. On my last visit, we spoke about small changes that can create a big difference. I found myself incorporating his suggestions into my daily rituals, and wanted to share them with you. Practice self-care first thing in the morning . Whether it’s a quick stretch, washing your face or enjoying an actual breakfast, the first thing you should do in the morning is to take care of yourself. Look at nature. Cut through the park on your commute to work or take a Saturday morning stroll through the trees, or even just face a window while doing your emails. Play with your breathing. Meditation is not about thinking of nothing. Instead, choose something to focus on, like your breathing, and think purposefully about taking deep breaths in and out. Vocalize words of happiness. Saying aloud that you are grateful for someone, or you wish someone joy, lifts your mood and someone else’s. Practice forgiveness. Let go of unhappiness by wishing well for people you may not love or agree with. Clean your space. No need for a full overhaul every day—simply wiping down a surface or decluttering your desk is a form of detoxing. Unplug. Take a walk and leave your phone at home, or put it away while getting ready for bed. Even the monk says this is the hardest one for him! Pause for a moment. Most of us don’t feel like we have time for meditation, but even pausing to take a deep breath before we do something helps to focus and be more present. Take a few seconds before eating to better appreciate your meal, or pause before meeting a friend for coffee so you are fully present in the moment. Find a fresh perspective. When we feel stress or anxiety, it can cause us to be stuck in one way of thinking. Take a moment to deconstruct your thoughts. Look at a tree—it always sheds its leaves and twigs, but maintains a strong core. Take care of your face and your hands. Just as a craftsman takes care of his tools, you should be caring for your face and your hands. They get you through your life. Because skincare is such a big part of my life and my work, I wanted to apply these philosophies into my skincare rituals. This is why we created The Essence , a small 7-second ritual to soften skin the way that meditation helps to soften my mind. We believe that when it comes to life and skincare, less is more—and even small changes can create a powerful difference. Whether it’s caring for your skin, walking in nature or spending time with loved ones, I hope that you find small ways to make a big difference in your life.

Long before I appreciated the beauty of the peony, it was a subject of fascination in both China and Japan. Many artists have painted the delicate blossom. Referred to as the “Queen of Flowers” in Japan, it has long been used as a seasonal descriptor. Peony has also been used medicinally for centuries to boost microcirculation, treat inflammation, stop bleeding and relieve pain. More recently, it has been recognized for its anti-oxidant powers (comparable to Vitamin E).

Centuries ago, samurai would wear garments dyed with Japanese Indigo. In addition to fending off snakes and mosquitos, the botanical would help heal their wounds and injuries sustained during their travels. - In Japanese, the rich blue shade is referred to “ai-iro”, which translates to “Indigo color” or “color of love.” It has long been of interest to color theorists, who say Indigo symbolizes wisdom, personal thought and profound insights. - Japanese firefighters benefitted from the plant as well, and the traditional uniform was made of indigo-dyed cotton to protect against burns. Once a year there is a ceremonial festival when they still don these traditional outfits. - Even today, Indigo blankets and clothing are traditional baby gifts, in the belief that the properties in the natural dye protect newborns from illness.

For most of my life, my skin was naturally resilient and problem-free. Then about a decade ago, I noticed some mild redness and stinging on the back of my neck. The rashy, red bumps transformed how my skin looked, and felt. Every minute, every motion brought an itchy, uncomfortable reminder that something was not quite right. “Trying to narrow down the cause of the reaction was a slow and tedious process, and letting go of my favorite beauty products one-by-one was a tremendous disappointment.” In addition to abandoning my cherished skincare products and cosmetics, there were other major lifestyle changes I had to make — trying all kinds of fragrance- and chemical-free detergents, shampoos and soaps. Although I tried my best to be mindful of what I was using, I didn’t always have a choice. While traveling, I’d worry that the detergent used on the bed sheets at a hotel might trigger a reaction, which happened more than once. Doctors prescribed powerful topical steroids to reduce the inflammation, but my skin remained rough for weeks after an outbreak. I longed to go back to using my favorite, familiar creams, but because I didn't know exactly what ingredients were causing the problem, they stayed stashed in a drawer. When I walked through stores, I felt like I was missing out on cutting-edge skincare and beauty products, which have long been a passion of mine. It didn’t feel like those products were for me anymore, and I missed being able to sample the latest releases. Since starting Tatcha and working closely with the world’s leading formulators and chemists, I’ve never forgotten what it was like to long for elegant skincare with exquisite textures and anti-aging benefits that would suit my finicky skin. That’s why all of Tatcha’s collection is non-sensitizing and dermatologist-tested, and why we promise not to use known irritants like PEGs. When we discovered the powerful, anti-inflammatory benefit of natural Japanese Indigo a few years ago, I knew this was a promising step towards creating a collection of creams that not only restored skin’s suppleness, but also offered other anti-aging benefits to the skin. The newest addition to the collection is our Indigo Soothing Triple Recovery Cream, which blends skin-soothing Japanese Indigo extract and calming Colloidal Oatmeal with our anti-aging Hadasei-3 Bioactive Complex. This daily, nourishing facial moisturizer was created with sensitive skin in mind, but is also a beneficial addition for all skin types. Inflammation may be most immediately visible in sensitive skin, but is recently recognized as a leading cause of premature aging in general. At Tatcha, we’ve found that the best botanicals to revitalize and heal sensitive skin are some of the most effective anti-aging ingredients. Whether your skin is feeling sensitive, in need of extra hydration, or you’d like to help it stay glowing, the timeless ingredients in our Soothing Triple Recovery Cream are at the forefront of anti-aging care. Sometimes it's comforting just knowing that you're not alone in having sensitive skin, or being bewildered and frustrated about all the ways it affects your daily life. And I hope you take comfort in knowing that we will always keep creating the very best formulas we can so that everyone can enjoy the secrets of simple, effective Japanese skin care rituals that leave your skin smooth, supple and radiant once again.

They explained that geisha have been using beauty waters for generations, gently patting a handful into their skin after cleansing but before applying any treatments. These botanical-infused waters are an essential step to restore and soften their skin. This beauty secret has spread far beyond the geisha community—today, 97% of women in Japan use an essence (modern-day beauty waters) as part of their daily routine. I asked our Tatcha Institute scientists about what made this step so vital, and they taught me a new secret to skin health and making anything you put on your skin work better. They explained that treatments and moisturizers need to be able to penetrate the skin to be effective. Oftentimes, this can be hard for two reasons: Firstly, the top layer of the skin is comprised of dead skin cells. These protect the delicate skin beneath, but can prevent active ingredients from penetrating deeply, where they are most needed. Secondly, the channels that carry ingredients down to the deepest parts of the skin are like trickling creeks, and often not sufficiently hydrated. This means the active ingredients that do make their way past that top layer of skin get stuck before they reach their destination. This is why an essence is core to any skincare ritual. Our newest discovery, The Essence , is the modern evolution of this Asian beauty skincare secret: a pure, powerful formula of 98.7% anti-aging Japanese superfoods. Uji Green Tea, Akita Rice and Okinawa Mozuku Algae are fermented, yielding amino acids, the building blocks of baby-soft skin, and lactic acid, which gently resurfaces skin. The water-light formula instantly doubles the hydration of skin above and beyond using a moisturizer alone, flooding skin with hydration to deliver treatments more deeply and amplifying the performance of all skincare that follows. This simple, seven-second daily ritual provides the ultimate skin superfood diet to reveal soft, youthful skin. We’re honored to bring you The Essence, inspired by geisha and remastered by scientists for you. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Always,"],"Title":["97% of Women in Japan Use This"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"d6c2-4ec4-9651","_cached_page_id":"d57d5e2afcf622cab0a1f607bc04a7d058840d2c"}

In it, the author offers practical steps to mindfully purge, clean and organize your treasures. I appreciated the straightforward advice of the KonMari Method, but particularly loved the philosophies behind it. The Japanese minimalism and serenity that informs her method also inspires our team at Tatcha every day. Less is more —Like Ms. Kondo, the geisha have long believed that less is more. Even with their elaborate performance makeup, a geisha’s skincare routine is no more than three steps: melt away her makeup, polish, and nourish skin. Their ingredients follow the same philosophy—a streamlined formula of active ingredients, minimally manipulated to their most efficacious form. Whether it’s oil from a camellia flower, steamed wild rose or brewed green tea, each ingredient and its benefits serves a purpose. Timeless rituals —In the same way that a decluttered, serene space is deeply rooted in Zen Buddhism, our collection draws on the wisdom of the past. Japanese skincare has been refined and passed down through generations, but many of the ingredients and rituals have proven themselves time and time again. The benefits of beloved ingredients like Green Tea, Rice and Algae have been confirmed by modern skincare scientists, reminding us that we can only illuminate what the geisha learned long ago. Listen to your body —A particularly beautiful piece of advice from Ms. Kondo’s book tells us to hold an item and ask ourselves if it sparks joy. Instead of attempting to use logic to justify the item (it was on sale, I might use it next year), we instead must listen to our body and how it responds. Similarly, the Japanese approach to skincare asks us to be deeply in touch with our bodies. Because skin is your body’s largest organ, it is reflective of your health as a whole. In Japan, instead of reaching for a cover-up for a pimple or a heavy cream for dry skin, they consider their stress level, diet and quality of sleep. This holistic view of skin means that their rituals are created to work with the skin and not against it, keeping it purified, polished and nourished to help address other issues in the long term. Our newest discovery, The Essence , is a modern evolution of the Japanese skincare philosophy. The formula is powerful but pure, comprised of 98.7% anti-aging superfoods: Green Tea, Rice and Algae. These are fermented into a superfluid to increase cell turnover and resurface skin for a smooth luster. The timeless ingredients are drawn from the wisdom of the past and perfected by modern scientists. The water-light formula instantly doubles the hydration of skin above and beyond a moisturizer alone, to soften and plump lines and wrinkles. Skin channels are left flushed with lasting hydration, delivering treatments more deeply and making all skincare more effective. I continue to be inspired by these beautiful philosophies, whether in my home, my work or my skincare. I hope you enjoy this treasured addition to your skincare ritual.

From painting her nails every night in 5th grade to roaming backstage at Fashion Week, she is a force to be reckoned with in the beauty industry. A devoted TATCHA fan, Nonie curated a special set of her must-have items from our collection. We spoke with her about kodawari, her beauty tips, and what’s next for Nonie. There is a Japanese saying, kodawari, which refers to the pursuit of perfection in details. How do you feel this applies to your work? It's a wonderful concept, because kodawari reminds us that perfection is sometimes quietly present, and not always instantly recognizable. If you approach your art and business with an awareness of the minutia, overall perfection is imminent. Imagine a red manicure that looks pretty from a distance, and when you get close, is actually made up of hundreds of tiny red pinstripes, painstakingly hand-painted. Kodawari! Between your world travels and your backstage work, life is busy! Do you have any on-the-go beauty tips that can take you from runway to the runway? My hair HATES to be washed every day – it goes all fluffy and frizzy. I like to take a tip from the models and brush baby powder through my hair instead of washing. It makes it just the right amount \"dirty\", and makes it look so thick! Also, for the perfect sexy, slept-in eye, I apply jet black eyeliner to the inside rim of my eyes and across my lids at take-off. By the time I get where I'm going, my smoky eye is just right. How does your daily life inspire the work that you do? Fashion and color are present everywhere, so even a trip to the corner store can be inspiring. I am prolific iPhone snapper, and archive the things I see for future reference. It could be a hairstyle, cool shoes, or just an amazing color I spot in some old graffiti. I try to imagine what I would want to look like \"in a perfect world\", and then conceive products or branding that speaks to that woman. What must-have beauty items do you have in your bag when backstage? TATCHA Original Aburatorigami Beauty Papers are a no-brainer! I carry L'Oreal B.B cream and after blotting apply a thin layer instead of powder for great skin. I never leave home without a black eyeliner (Stila), and MAC false lashes mascara. What's in store for Nonie for 2013? I am doing some exciting brand and design consulting in fashion and accessories that is really stretching my imagination and boundaries. Having grown a global brand off my friend's kitchen table gave me the insight to help other companies get to grips with their own branding and product assortment. Being able to play in arenas outside of nails has been hugely rewarding and I'd expect to start another company somewhere in the fashion/beauty realm in the near future…"],"Title":["Inspirations: Interview with Nonie Creme"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"d6c2-4ec4-9651","_cached_page_id":"3e413fe761093fadf66b92aab44261183bb80763"}

Amidst my travels, however, it occurs to me that I have never shared the story of how TATCHA began with you. It was around this time five years ago that I made the trip to Japan that changed my life. Every time the winter chill starts to subside and the flowers burst into life, I remember where we came from. It was a dark and stormy night…only joking, although it was a stormy time in my life. I traveled to Asia, ostensibly searching for exquisite blotting papers that I had encountered but really hunting for a sense of direction. When I found the papers – and surprisingly, my direction – it was not from the source I had expected. Many of you have seen our beauty papers and know the story behind them: gold artisans created the papers out of abaca leaf to protect the precious metal as they hammered it into whisper-thin leafing. I was struck not only by the beauty and efficacy of the papers, but also by the exquisite history behind them. They represented, to me, a deep connection between modern beauty and centuries of tradition, carefully preserved and passed down. I asked the price on the spot, determined to bring these treasures to the west and share them. I went back to the hotel that night and visited the garden. Hopefully you will forgive the cliché, but as I held the papers in my hand I could see my path; I knew, with calm certainty, what was going to happen. Of course, it could not be easy. The cost of purchasing the blotting papers and bringing them back to the United States was a jolt. Perhaps I knew that something larger was happening, or perhaps the stress of my Wall Street career was finally catching up to me. Either way, I simply could not let the papers fade into history. I sold everything I owned of value, beginning with my engagement ring. Furniture and my car followed shortly after, with pieces of my old life disappearing until my new life could begin. When the crates finally arrived, I held the papers in my hands and felt as though I were welcoming home ten thousand wayward children. I couldn’t wait to share them with the world. The papers’ use originated with geisha, the masters of stage performance. It seemed logical that makeup artists, their complements, would understand it best. I sent off packages to amazing artists like Daniel Martin and Matthew VanLeeuwen, hoping they would take a chance on the unknown. They recognized the beauty of the papers and handed them out to their clients, who gifted them to friends…and TATCHA was born. As I look back on all that has happened since, I am overwhelmed with gratitude and awe. We have grown so much in so little time, thanks in particular to our wonderful makeup artist friends. I look forward to seeing where this journey takes us next. - Vicky"],"Title":["Seeking the Past: A Journey, A Discovery, A Beginning"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"d6c2-4ec4-9651","_cached_page_id":"c4d598420dfb82b4588f58698be9950f8a860d0b"}

As I embark upon each journey East, I look forward with eager anticipation to new discoveries ahead, but am also reminded of voyages past. At the moment, my friend Marikiku is on my mind. Marikiku, who was a Geiko-san (Geisha) for many years in Gion, is one of my most valuable Geisha teachers. I met her shortly after introducing TATCHA's Aburatorigami Blotting Papers. When I showed her these golf-flecked leaflets, she remarked that she hadn't seen the original gold leaf blotting papers since she was a young trainee Geisha and asked me if I knew what the gold was for. “Of course,” I said, “It’s the by product of the gold leaf making process.” Marikiku conveyed a knowing smile, as if buoyed by the wisdom of her years. She then told me how the Geisha used to scratch the gold off of the papers and gently crush it into their lips to impart a subtle, sensuous glimmer. In that moment, our Camellia Nourishing Lip Balm was born. With it’s launch, we pay homage to Marikiku and the Geisha before her. And I am reminded that it is who as much as what one discovers while travelling that makes the journey worthwhile.
