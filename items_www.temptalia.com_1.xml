My puppy, Mellan, was scheduled to be neutered yesterday, but the Humane Society said he had a heart murmur graded 5 out of 6. I couldn‚Äôt take the risk of him dying on the table for the sake of nixing his parts. But of course, lots and lots of tears were spilled at the realization of just how mortal he is (and how much I love him). We were aware he had a slight murmur (grade 1-2) since he was at least 12 weeks old, but it was minor and presumed to be a puppy murmur (which tend to disappear by six months). We saw our vet yesterday, and he graded the murmur 3-4. Today, Mellan is at our vet all day, so he can get his chest x-rayed and have the doctor listen to his heart throughout the day. We are hoping for good news! *crosses fingers* So since I‚Äôm liable to cry off any makeup I wear today, here is a look back at my favorite green looks I‚Äôve done! Just click the photo to see the full look and its details! üôÇ I LOVE emerald greens, because they‚Äôre so intense and vibrant, but they‚Äôre not not neon or chartreuse greens. I have a thing for smoky eyes, especially when there‚Äôs some gold glittering in the darker colors. As much as mineralize eyeshadows *don‚Äôt* do it for me, I actually enjoyed the way last year‚Äôs Flashtronic shadows came out in this look! I think it‚Äôs the softness of the greens, though the overall look is a bit frosty, I suppose. This is kind of gold-green-blue, but still, I see predominantly green üòâ I love the way the blue liner popped, but I think the color of the gold blended well with the green. I just LOVE this muted shade of gold-green and everything. I am so tempted to try this again! This is not my own creation, but it is a recreation based off of the Barbie Loves MAC promo photos! I was so amazed at how this look turned out, because I was totally in love with it (still am!).</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-06-24 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>f6901a613da452b4777f1d3fb65679f8abfdeda3</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Color Abstraction Collection for Fall 1996</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/category/latest-collections/page/472/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Color Abstraction Collection for Fall 1996 By MAC Cosmetics Jul 03, 1996 July 03, 1996 MAC Color Abstraction Collection for Fall 1996 Eyeshadow Gesso True white (Matte) (Permanent) Contrast Navy blue with purple duo (Satin) (Permanent) Sketch Dark burgundy (Velvet) (Permanent) Juxt Pale green with gold frost (Frost) (Permanent) Fade Pale blue with silver frost (Frost) (Discontinued) Lipstick Shh Sheer clear red (Sheer) (Discontinued) Grid Dark purple (Frost) (Discontinued) Siss Golden beige (Satin) (Permanent) Blade Pewter (Frost) (Discontinued) Blush Style Bright golden coral (Permanent) Nail Polish Siss Sheer clear red (Discontinued) Grid Dark purple (Discontinued) Blade Pewter (Discontinued) Source</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>1996-07-03 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>2be5c87cdbc6f785fb2e08c6f6172074f6b0d8f1</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Terms of Use</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/terms-of-use/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Terms of Use Temptalia LLC ‚Äì Terms of Use February 7, 2016 This Terms of Use and Privacy Policy govern all websites, user features, mobile applications, and other services (past, current, or future) regardless of the methodology of distribution (collectively, the ‚ÄúService‚Äù or ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù) provided by Temptalia LLC (‚ÄúTemptalia,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù).

This cream is meant to be used both morning and night, and it does a whole slew of things. It promotes healing, increases cell regeneration, minimizes pores, detoxifies, hydrates, diminishes lines and wrinkles, and desensitizes sensitive skin. I was using increased amounts of acne medications, and predictably, they made my skin more sensitive. There were few creams that I could use without feeling like my face was on fire. Vita-A-Kombi 1 was one of them, and even better, it can be used both morning and night. It is a fairly thick cream, and it does take some time (5 to 10 minutes) to sink into your skin. It is best applied with a light layer all over the face, but without rubbing it too much into the skin; instead, just let it absorb naturally. My skin looked refreshed, and it felt so soft. My only complaint was that every time I used this, my boyfriend told me I smelled like old lady. So I ended up wearing this mostly at night, rather than day, because I didn‚Äôt want people thinking I smelled like ‚Äúold lady.‚Äù Otherwise, the results were right in line with what I expected, and my skin was happy to use it for a few weeks!

Whenever I try to do a nude lip, it always ends up a little too white, like a zombie or something. I‚Äôm looking for a pretty nude lip that will pair well with smokey eyes, but nothing too ghost-like. A : With nude lips, sometimes the easiest way is to take any nude lipstick but use a lipglass with a bit more pink or peach to pump up the color to the right shade for you. Brew is a great nude to start off with! Q : Can you tell me how to do that beauty queen/pornstar (lol) eye-makeup where they have a dark color in the crease and their eyes look really defined but still natural? It always looks so pretty and natural on them, but whenever I try to do it, I end up with just a smokey eye. It may be because I don‚Äôt have a deep crease. I‚Äôm not sure. A : It might be that they have a deeper crease than you, or they may even fake the depth of their crease by also darkening right above it. Try using a very small brush to create an ultra-defined crease like the 219 and go very slowly. It probably ends up looking more like a smoky eye because it ends up getting too blended. You really won‚Äôt want to do much blending if you want it very defined! Q : Can you recommend a MAC eyeshadow in their permanent line similar in color to coral and one similar in color to Jardin Aires? A : Oh, wow, I know Goldbit is a great dupe, but that was limited edition as well. A permanent color that might be similar is harder to find, but I would suggest checking out these permanent alternatives: Honesty, Mythology, or Paradisco. Q : My question is about getting your make-up done at counters in stores. I‚Äôve seen a few things about this in other blogs, but I was wondering what your opinion is on this. If you go to a make-up counter and get your make-up done, what is the appropriate etiquette for making a purchase afterwards? What if, after getting a look you like, you just don‚Äôt really want to buy anything that day? It is okto just say ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù and be on your way? Or do you have to buy atleast one thing? A : It depends on where you go. At the counters, I believe it is free to have your makeup done, but it might have changed. MAC freestanding stores generally have a policy of $40 sitting fee which can be redeemed in product most often. If you just happen to walk into the store and they end up showing you how to do your makeup, you are not obligated to buy anything. Q : Everytime I apply the eyeshadow, some of it falls on my face. Rubbing or swiping it off only leaves a trail. I dust my brush before applying to no avail. What do you do? A : You can try investing in a fan shaped brush like the 205 and use that to dust off powder/shadow from your face without streaking it. I would say that perhaps your base you‚Äôre using isn‚Äôt the best choice, because generally, a good base will end up taking most of the shadow you apply with minimal fall out, especially since you mentioned you already tap your brush after picking up the color to get rid of excess. Q : Foxy Lady kohl liner looked lovely on my hand but makes my eyes look bloodshot. I used it on my waterline and lash line. How else can I use it? A : You could try to soften or darken it to other shades using shadow. The shadow might even soften the edge of the liner making it less defined, which might make your eyes pop rather than look bloodshot. Another suggestion is to try wearing it on your upper lash line instead, or perhaps only on the corners of your lower lash line. Q : If I am going to purchase 2 MAC eyeshadows, 2 MAC blush, 2 MAC lipsticks and 2 MAC lipglass in shades of pink. What would you recommend? A : For pink eyeshadows, I would recommend Expensive Pink and Passionate, because one is lighter and the other is very dark, hot pink. If you don‚Äôt want a hot pink, you could try out Da Bling, which is a great medium pink. For blushes, I recommend Dollymix to everyone, because it is a great dramatic blush. I also enjoy Well Dressed or Dame for cooler pink blushes. Sweetie is a sheer medium pink, and Girl About Town is a great hot pink lip color. As far as lipglass goes, I would recommend Pink Poodle (hotter pink) and Cultured (a tinge on the purple side, but sheerer). Q : Is Bare Study a good base for most colors? I was also wondering if you can do a plum combo, I just brought one of the new shadow that have the purple and gold combo and I would like to see how you would use that one. I saw the one with by Jupiter and Ether. A : Bare Study would make a good base for most colors. Painterly is another paint pot that would also do a great job of that as well. I will try and post up a plum combo, which won‚Äôt be hard with the new Smoke Signal pigment, soon! Q : First, I know you have to have a MAC Pro account to purchase products off MACPro.com. Do you also need to have one to buy things from a MAC Pro store or can anyone just walk in and purchase something like a regular MAC store? Secondly, where can I find the glycerin you use to make a mixing medium? And what do you store your medium in? Lastly, do you let your wet pigment base dry before continuing to apply eye shadows or do you just start applying eyeshadows while the pigment is still wet? A : No, you don‚Äôt need a PRO card to shop at the actual store. You can also call up any PRO store and place a phone order without a PRO card. I don‚Äôt have a PRO card so I know how frustrating it is not to be able to order online or anything. You can find glycerin at a local drug store, probably in the band aid aisle, and make sure to get the liquid kind! I store my mixing medium in a little traveling jar. I use very little mixing medium when I apply, so it doesn‚Äôt get too wet, and it dries before I‚Äôm even ready to apply the eye shadow. In general, you should let it dry a bit before applying anything else, though. Q : Here is my problem, I have pretty oily skin, which is good (cause I won‚Äôt have too many wrinkles when I‚Äôm older, lol) but bad because my lemon-aid or any creme eyshadow clumps up in the crease of my eyelid. What can I do to stop that? A : Use a good base, and it should stop all of that creasing right away! One people swear by is Urban Decay‚Äôs Primer Potion, which you can pick up at Sephora. There is also MAC‚Äôs Prep + Prime Eye, which is the same idea. MAC also makes several different types of bases you can try, like paints, paint pots, and shadesticks, too.

Cremesheen is a finish of lipstick that MAC introduced to us last year, and the finish might be described as fairly pigmented color with subtle sheen and low frost. They don‚Äôt have shimmer as far as I could tell either. The new shades of Cremesheen lipsticks add a nice variety of color the permanent lipstick range, and I definitely found myself liking the colors a lot more than some of the limited edition lipsticks from the past few collections. As far as the new Cremesheen glasses go, I just can‚Äôt get on that train. Every single one of them is sheer in color, with some varying in pigmentation (the real test will be lip swatches, which I will do, but probably not until tonight, FYI). The finish and texture of the new glosses is almost buttery and quite creamy, so they do feel nice on the lips. For the price and quantity you get, I find it difficult to even recommend them, because the price alone just grates on my nerves. I‚Äôll put a little price analysis behind the cut, so you can read that if you desire üôÇ Temptalia‚Äôs Recommendations Must-Haves : Crosswires, Lavender Whip, Shy Girl Nice-To-Haves : Creme Cup, Hang Up, Lickable Skip : Fashion Scoop, Looks Like Sin See individual, in-depth product reviews as well as some cost analysis‚Ä¶ Cremesheen Glass at $18.00 A regular MAC lipglass costs $14 and you get 0.17 oz. for your money. Cremesheen glass will run you $18 and you get 0.09 oz. for your money. It‚Äôs really hard for me to understand why it costs $4 more and yet you get nearly half as much. The packaging is different, but let me tell you, I‚Äôm happy with the packaging for lipglasses if it‚Äôs going to save me $4! If you found yourself running out of your Dazzleglasses quickly, I would expect these to go the same way. I didn‚Äôt really grasp why Dazzleglasses were priced so much higher than lipglasses when they were originally launched either, so please let me know if there‚Äôs some magic ingredient that hikes up the product cost (and yet not worth mentioning in advertising). Cremesheen Lipsticks Creme Cup is a medium-toned neutral pink. It‚Äôs pretty, and it‚Äôs brighter and pinker than a lipstick like Angel. It‚Äôs not quite as opaque as most other Cremesheens, but it has good color pay off compared to lusres and glazes. Creme In Your Coffee is a deeper pink-mauve with brown tones to it. It‚Äôs a great way to try out a lipstick that‚Äôs more brown-based without going for something more obviously brown. Lavender Whip is a pastel purple shade with a little bit of pink to it, but it‚Äôs pretty lilac-y to me. It has good color and pay off; and you bet, it does resemble Fashion Mews from Hello Kitty, but it‚Äôs not as light/pale nor as frosty. Lickable is a bright hot pink with subtle sheen, not too much fuchsia in it either. It reminded me a bit of Girl About Town a little. Hang Up is a subtle cranberry shade. It‚Äôs reddish without being a true red; it has enough berry tones to keep it dark. Shy Girl is a stunning peach-nude color. I imagine it will be quite flattering on many different skin tones. I did find that this was the sheerest of the eight new (but permanent) Cremesheen lipsticks. Spice Is Nice is a warm tan-brown shade, perhaps with a little rosiness to it. It‚Äôs not a shade I‚Äôd rock myself, but I know it would make a nice everyday shade for others. Crosswires is a bold coral-red shade. It‚Äôs not an orange-based coral, for those who prefer that family of lipsticks. This is one of my favorite colors from the launch, even though it is a repromote. Cremesheen Glass Boy Bait is a mid-tone neutral pink (with almost a touch of peach in it). Creme Anglaise is a berry-pink color. Ever So Rich is a lilac-lavender shade, very sheer (so you better buy Lavender Whip if you want to emulate the promo photo!). Fashion Scoop is a light, milky pink. It‚Äôs cooler, and it‚Äôs also much lighter than Boy Bait. Looks Like Sin is a brownish-reddish color, but it‚Äôs obviously not a very red in color. This is the only one that bled into my skin (as you can see in the swatches). Despite being dark, the pigmentation is lacking when applied to my lips. Melt In Your Mouth is a bright, springy shade of pink. It‚Äôs not hot pink, but it‚Äôs brighter than the other pink glosses in the launch, but it‚Äôs pinker than Creme Anglaise. Partial to Pink is a warmer medium pink‚Äìmore pop to it than Boy Bait‚Äìand it did seem a little more pigmented than the other choices from the swatch alone. Petite Induglence is a fuchsia-pink, leaning very fuchsia and almost cool. It might pop in the swatch, but towards the edges, it sheered out and wasn‚Äôt giving me a ton of color.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2009-02-05 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>82487803b601506956e2e2fa27d7284413992910</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Survey Says‚Ä¶ February 4th, 2009</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/survey-says-february-4th-2009/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Survey Says‚Ä¶ February 4th, 2009 Features Feb 04, 2009 February 04, 2009 Instructions : Fill in the survey below with your answers, and then share it with us in the comments section! üôÇ Lip liner or no : [answer] Favorite Beauty Treat : [answer] How often do you wear makeup? : [answer]</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2009-02-04 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>077fee013de22845ac772ef44d4e8cc2927ebc3a</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Hello Kitty Too Dolly Eyeshadow Palette</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tag/mac-too-dolly-eyeshadow-palette/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Hello Kitty Too Dolly Eyeshadow Palette Reviews Feb 04, 2009 February 04, 2009 Too Dolly Palette swatches and product photos for you ! üôÇ Now, to focus on and study for Managerial Accounting and research and figure out my topic for my 30-page law paper!

If you notice, there‚Äôs a small teardrop of ‚ÄúAnti-Aging Serum‚Äù that runs through the middle of the lipstick. These are designed to help improve the look of lips, including minimizing fine lines. The way the product does this is mostly by acting as a lip plumping lipstick thereby minimizing any lines. This post features four shades: Pucker Up Pink (#102) is a neutral-cool raspberry pink with frosty shine that goes on fairly opaque. Peach Parfait (#401) is an orange-y coral with a frosty shine that is semi-sheer when it‚Äôs actually applied. (It looks nowhere this bright on my lips‚Äìmore like a peachy nude.) Compelling Coral (#402) is a coral-pink with a frosty finish and goes mostly opaque. Spicy Pink (#704) is a dark raspberry-pink with a soft sheen and a bit of frost in its finish. It goes on semi-opaque. I haven‚Äôt tried the original Color Riche formula (at least not that I can recall), but this formula is soft and lightly creamy with decent color pay off. I find the average wear time is just about two hours (assuming no eating/drinking) before it‚Äôs faded away enough that it needs to be reapplied. In terms of colors, I liked Pucker Up Pink and Compelling Coral the most‚ÄìI felt these shades flattered and delivered in terms of color. Peach Parfait was a bit misleading, going on much sheerer and paler than it appeared, and Spicy Pink wasn‚Äôt as dark as it looked in the tube as it was on lips. I have two gripes: the packaging feels incredibly cheap. It has a metal look, but it‚Äôs either plastic or a very cheap metal‚Äìit‚Äôs extremely light and just feels cheap. The outside casing still holds fingerprints (always annoying). The scent of these lipsticks smells of stale perfume and a bit of the trademark scent of lipstick. It‚Äôs just not pleasing, and I‚Äôd love it more if L‚ÄôOreal would switch to something less cloying (like vanilla or whatever). Also, if you dislike lip plumping products, you should opt for the regular Color Riche line, as these do have a slight tingle. The tingle is about a three on a ten point scale (with DuWop Lip Venom being a ten for me). These are best purchased when your local drugstore or mass retailer has these on sale for buy one, get one. I find $9.99 a bit steep otherwise. Product : 7/10 Value : 7/10 Ease of Use : 8/10 Packaging : 5/10 Recommendation : If you‚Äôre on a budget and are looking for non-drying lipsticks that give you decent color, L‚ÄôOreal‚Äôs new Color Riche Anti-Aging Serum Lipsticks are a good choice!

Consider the treatments for two at the Ritz-Carlton Spa, Kapalua , which only opened this past June. It‚Äôs a 17,500 square foot spa with fifteen treatments, private outdoor shower gardens, iPod docking stations (wow!), robe warmers (I‚Äôd like one of those!), grottos, steam rooms, saunas‚Ä¶ The works! According to a press release, Kapalua is ‚Äúbased on the healing waters of Waihua, which the ancient Hawaiians believed was the most pure form of water which was captured by the leaves of the taro plant.‚Äù Staying true to Hawaiian roots, they also offer Hawaiian based spa treatments, like a Lomilomi massage. They also use a host of natural ingredients like pineapple, papaya, coconut, and pumpkin in their products. The lines they use are often Murad, Naturopathica, Eminence, and Mama Mio for the expecting. Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua is located on the island of Maui in Hawaii. I‚Äôm pretty sure I don‚Äôt need to explain why Hawaii makes an amazing place to jet off to de-stress and love your honey. I‚Äôve never been to the island of Maui (my adventures have only taken me to Oahu, The Big Island, and Kauai), but I know it‚Äôs one of my parents‚Äô favorite islands to go for their anniversary. I‚Äôve actually used several of the products they offer (especially Eminence, which makes amazing facial treatments and masques that you can purchase and use at-home), but I must say they do a brilliant job of incorporating the Hawaiian feel into many of the products used during your stay or available to take home with you. There is something about the scents of tropical fruit and the ocean breeze that get me! If I could convince my boyfriend we could afford such a luxe vacation, I‚Äôd definitely want to check out Kapalua. If only, sigh! But hopefully some of you are more persuasive than I with your significant others üòâ</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2009-01-09 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>0f3870e1536d6107f2d78eebf6d2379ac735675b</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>LUSH Launches Happy Feet for Summer 2012</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/lush-launches-happy-feet-for-summer-2012/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>LUSH Launches Happy Feet for Summer 2012 Year: 2012 Launches Jun 09, 2012 June 09, 2012 LUSH Launches Happy Feet for Summer 2012 With summertime right around the corner it‚Äôs time to start thinking strappy sandals and flirty flip-flops.

Rub Rub Rub‚Äôs scent can be compared to Lush‚Äôs Sakura bath bomb (which is a fresh, spring-blossom-day kind of scent). RRR is not just a shower gel, but more of shower gel meets shower scrub. It‚Äôs not a full-on shower scrub (it‚Äôs just not gritty enough), but the sea salt in it helps make this gel give you softer, smoother skin. I actually like that it‚Äôs got the lather of a shower gel, but some of the grit of a scrub, because I can still use my bath poof to lather up and get some extra exfoliation in. Yummy Yummy Yummy is comprised mostly of strawberries, honey, and almond oil. I definitely can sense the strawberries in the product, but I wasn‚Äôt as impressed with the actual product. It is runnier than Lush‚Äôs other shower gels (and I‚Äôve tried several!), and it doesn‚Äôt lather up as nicely as their other ones, either. I have seen some murmurings about the product separating, but I‚Äôve had mine for over a month with no separation whatsoever. So as a shower gel, you‚Äôre better off with one like Flying Fox, but I found a better use for it‚Äìmy hair. If you want a touch of strawberry smoothie scent in your hair, just shampoo your hair a little with this instead!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-11-12 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>1e16ddac95a21c1f9d0fc68a2d31348cd25f9979</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Guerlain Terracotta Collection for March 2009 (Official)</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/guerlain-terracotta-collection-for-march-2009-official/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Guerlain Terracotta Collection for March 2009 (Official) Year: 2009 Launches Mar 03, 2009 March 03, 2009 Guerlain Terracotta Collection | March 2009 Terracotta Mineral Flawless Bronzing Powder $65.00 Inspired by the colours in the warm glow of the earth, this groundbreaking bronzing powder harnesses the unifying power of minerals to offer an incredibly natural-looking tan and a flawless finish.

Introducing‚Ä¶ Temptalia‚Äôs Halloween Mask Challenge! Show off your talent by creating a face mask that you might see as part of a Halloween contest ‚Äî this means the content of your mask is quite open-ended, as there are an endless number of costumes one might wear for the spooky night. The mask must be made using makeup (props are welcome), and it must appear on a person, whether it‚Äôs you or a model. Winner receives $30 in MAC products and $30 in beauty products. There will be one grand prize winner, but there will also be a smaller prize that goes to the person who wins the ‚Äúreaders‚Äô choice‚Äù award! Contest ends October 31st, 2007. Keep reading to view the details, contest rules, and see some examples of past MAC Cosmetics Halloween face charts for inspiration. Rules: 1) Only one entry per person will be judged and entered. You may submit multiple ones, but only one will be entered into the contest; just let Temptalia know which you want judged (for example, you submit one October 4th, but then think you do a better one October 20th, you can have the second submission as your entry!). 2) Each entry must be accompanied by at least one close-up shot and one full-face shot to be considered of the mask on a person. It is a mask, so a full face is absolutely necessary to truly show it off! Dimensions of the photos bust me a minimum of 390 pixels wide. More photos are most definitely encouraged, but not required. 3) Entries must be accompanied by a list of products used (if you end up forgetting a few, that‚Äôs OK, but knowing the main products used is essential!). 3) Contest entries will be posted on Temptalia throughout the month, but judging will not occur until November 1st, 2007. 4) Prizes and rules are subject to change at any time without any notice (gotta cover my rear, right? Yay, legal mumbo jumbo!). 5) Submit your entry to [email protected] by October 31st, 2007. Prizes: All entries will be judged by a panel of beauty bloggers to determine a grand prize winner ($60 value of beauty products, with $30 guaranteed to be MAC). Readers will be able to vote for their favorite to select one entry to receive the readers‚Äô award and subsequent prize ($30 value of beauty products). Inspiration: These photos are face charts done by MAC artists in the past, and these detail what a face mask can be.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-09-30 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>510941cba0deceb86d601abc50431fac5bf57882</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Napoleon Perdis ‚Äì Chandelier Shine, Gloss Patrol, Blush Patrol, Madame Curl, Eyeshadow Product Reviews</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/napoleon-perdis-chandelier-shine-gloss-patrol-blush-patrol-madame-curl-eyeshadow-product-reviews/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Napoleon Perdis ‚Äì Chandelier Shine, Gloss Patrol, Blush Patrol, Madame Curl, Eyeshadow Product Reviews Sample Reviews Sep 27, 2007 September 27, 2007 I just tried several Napoleon Perdis products, and my first impression is definitely a favorable one. I loved the packaging; all of the boxes had little tabs to make it super easy to open them (hey, those of us who wear nail polish compulsively love things that are gentle on the tips!). All of the product packaging is ultra sleek and classy looking, and I always appreciate a line that puts creativity in their styling. Madame Curl Curl mascara : I have crazy lashes, because they go multiple directions and have various lengths. I find this mascara to be great as far as giving me decent length, good curl, and minimal clumping. It‚Äôs not my holy grail, because I want incredibly dramatic lashes, which means length, thickness, volume, curl, everything! I‚Äôm still looking for my dream mascara. I like that this line offers multiple mascaras with different purposes, because this allows consumers to pick and choose what they need in mascara. Do-it-all mascaras do not always work the way they should, anyway! Eyeshadow in Crystal Cafe: Talk about one pigmented shadow! It‚Äôs predominantly in the pink family, but I have to say that there is a touch of red in it, so it‚Äôs a bold, dark pink. This is one of those colors that scares beauty blogger Karen, and I imagine quite a few of my readers! Pink is a color that often turns eyes into looking tired or as if you‚Äôve been crying for a few hours (trust me, my first pink look had my mom asking, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?!). When paired with say golds and oranges, you‚Äôll find you can achieve the sunset eye, while still using pink, and it‚Äôs not nearly so terrifying anymore! Blush Patrol : I remember when Napoleon Perdis debuted their line on Sephora there was an immediate buzz about this product, because it resembles Petticoat mineralize skinfinish by MAC Cosmetics, which is [nowadays] an extremely coveted hard-to-find item. I find that the Blush Patrol (one color, only) looks just gorgeous in its compact, all dome-shaped, with pink, raspberry, and shimmer swirls. The effect in application? Subtle raspberry-pink shimmer that works well to highlight cheekbones. It is well-suited for summer and lazy makeup days because a few taps of this on your cheeks and you have a slight pinkish glow on your cheeks. It‚Äôs not highly colored, so I would personally use it on top of a deeper blush for a more dramatic look. Gloss Patrol in Dallas: The gloss tube actually felt kind of heavy, not overly so by any means, but heftier than I‚Äôm used to. This particular shade is a very sheer iridescent pink gloss, and it would look lovely over deep lipsticks to give them a healthy coat of shine and shimmer. Chandelier Shine in Empress (pink) &amp; Voodoo (purple): Napoleon Perdis recently launched Chandelier Shine, which is a concept that involves matching lipgloss and nail polish. What do I think of this idea? Fantastic! I love matching makeup to clothes, and while I don‚Äôt have the time to change my polish color everyday, it‚Äôs nice to know that there‚Äôs a company who recognizes our inner desires to be matchy-matchy. I look at this as a great way to match on a particular occasion. The first one I tried was a deep purple-red, nearly black, color. The second one is a deep magenta pink, which is so up my alley. I found both polishes to have an amazing consistency, and they applied like a dream. I didn‚Äôt even have to apply two coats (though I did because I always do, and that‚Äôs just that), even with the ultra dark polish. I love the matching magenta pink gloss, because it makes a great on-the-go gloss for a quick ten-minute face as it tints the lips a subtle pink with glossy sheen. The purple gloss is actually reminiscent of Atmospheric by MAC; it‚Äôs very wearable, not so bold, just a slight shimmery purple.

Bobbi Brown is a brand that does emphasize and focus on more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù beauty, so you‚Äôll find plenty of basic shades of beiges, browns, and the like within the range. You won‚Äôt find an extensive range of bright and neon hues, but you will find some. A lot of the brighter colors get launched seasonally in limited edition collections, so if you like a formula, you might see a vibrant neon pink during the spring or summer. Eyes When it comes to gel eyeliners, Bobbi‚Äôs Gel Eyeliner ($24.00) is a cult favorite, and for good reason‚Äìit comes in a variety of shades, applies easily and fluidly, and lasts all day long. You have the classic black, Black Ink, along with fun colors like Ivy Shimmer Ink (deep emerald green) and Violet Ink (violet purple). Her Metallic Eyeshadows ($21.00) are really plush; soft, smooth, and lots of color payoff with a frosted, metallic fiinsh. Shades like Forest, Burnt Sugar , and Cognac are lovely on warmer skin tones, while Mint, Midnight , and Velvet Plum are flattering on cooler complexions. For neutral eyeshadows with matte finishes, her regular Eyeshadow ($21.00) line is worth considering‚Äìpay attention to Bone, Caviar, Espresso, Hot Stone, Wheat, and Taupe . From time to time, Bobbi Brown also releases eyeshadow and face palettes‚Äìsome are amazing, others are so-so‚Äìbut they‚Äôre usually worth at least a glance or two if you‚Äôre near a counter. My favorite Bobbi Brown mascara is Everything Mascara ($24.00), which results in really great everyday, natural-looking lashes. Cheeks If you love high shimmer, nearly metallic-finishes in your blushes and highlighters, you‚Äôll find Shimmer Bricks ($39.00) right up your alley. Shades like Nectar can be used as blushers on light to dark skin tones as well as providing highlight. Each compact has five strips of color, which can be used individually or altogether. If you‚Äôre into cream blushes, you might like Pot Rouge for Lips &amp; Cheeks ($24.00), which is a multi-tasking color product that gives both cheeks and lips a soft tint of color. It comes in an assortment of shades (ten at the writing of this post). Calypso Coral is great for a pop of coral during the summer, while Chocolate Cherry is excellent for a bolder, darker cheek color. Raspberry flatters lots of skin tones, even deeper ones, as it has just the right level of intensity. Lips Rich Lip Color SPF 12 ($23.00) is pigmented, lightweight, and moisturizing, and it‚Äôs probably my favorite lipstick formula by the brand, though the regular Lip Color ($23.00) is rather good and her Treatment Lip Shine SPF 15 ($23.00) is great for a glossier (but still a lipstick) option. High Shimmer Lipgloss ($23.00) may be my most favorite Bobbi Brown product, period, though don‚Äôt hold me to it, because it‚Äôs so hard to choose! They‚Äôre rich in sparkle and shimmer and look utterly dazzling on the lips (especially in the sunlight). Some shades are sheer with lots of sparkle, others are more pigmented with plenty of shimmer. My favorite shades are Canary, Electric Violet, Midnight Violet, Naked Plum, Pink Sequin, and Plum Gold . Base If you suffer from really dry skin and find most foundations emphasize dryness, EXTRA Tinted Moisturizing Balm is fantastic‚Äìit gives coverage and lots and lots of ongoing, all-day moisture. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for oilier skin types, because it would be too heavy. I haven‚Äôt tried her range of foundations very much‚Äìnot enough to make recommendations‚Äìbut check reader comments for possible options. Skincare I have normal-to-dry skin, so I do review and speak from that perspective for the most part, but of course, sometimes a product that isn‚Äôt hydrating enough for me but otherwise has a good texture may be a good fit for someone with oilier skin. I have tried and quite liked Hydrating Face Cream (thick but never heavy, nicely hydrating), Hydrating Gel Cream (quick-absorbing, lightweight, moisturizing), EXTRA Repair Moisturizing Balm SPF 25 (creamy, hydrating, slightly heavy), and Hydrating Rich Cream Cleanser (creamy, removes makeup and dirt well, never drying). Tools Every Bobbi Brown brush I‚Äôve used, I‚Äôve been happy with, but I haven‚Äôt used the full range. I love the soft, dense feel of her Blush Brush ($50.00) and full, dense feel of her Bronzer Brush ($50.00), which really seems like a buffer brush with a longer handle. What are your recommendations for someone looking to try Bobbi Brown products?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2012-06-09 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>481fe00b5fb785755f49d48930653b37469bba15</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>LUSH For Your Man: Shave the Planet!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tag/lush-shave-the-planet/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>LUSH For Your Man: Shave the Planet!

I tried this at least two months ago, but I wanted to hold off on making a review until was actually available to purchase. What good is a product recommendation if you can‚Äôt buy it?! I was only able to get my hands on itsy-bitsy samples (enough for about three uses, which is about a week‚Äôs worth), but I was sooo in love with the results! I washed with their Fortifying Shampoo ($27.95), then followed up with their Replenishing Conditioner ($29.95). Both products are sulfate-free, which is always a nice thing, but the scent is lovely. (I wish I could tell you more about the scent, but my memory fails me other than remembering it was pleasing.) See, the reason why I really loved this set of products was it actually allowed me to wash less often. Usually, I wash my hair every other day (day one, wash; day two, none; day three wash, etc.). By the end of day two, my roots are oily enough to be noticed. I found this product extended the life of my wash to day three (pretty much unheard of in my routine!).

I‚Äôve used a few Napoleon Perdis products in the past (China Doll foundation being one of them‚Äìwhich was fab, though pricey), and I haven‚Äôt been disappointed. I was interested to see how NP Set would meet my expectations. This post is only about the lipsticks (not the primer pictured above). The lipsticks in Rio and Boston Cream Ginger ($15.00) were the ones that I ended up giving a try. Rio is described as a brick red, but it‚Äôs too subdued to be a real brick red. I‚Äôd say it is a pinked brick red if anything. It‚Äôs a nice color, though, nonetheless; it‚Äôs perfect for fall and winter. It‚Äôs not pastel or pink or springy in the least bit, but it‚Äôs also not overly vampy or dark. It should work with most skin tones. The lipstick formula itself is matte in finish, but it is not at all drying‚Äìvery moisturizing for a matte. In the lip swatch, you‚Äôll notice despite being advertised as a matte, there is still some noticeable sheen. Boston Cream Ginger is an incredibly creamy coral-melon color. It‚Äôs definitely one of those colors I‚Äôm drawn to, because corals are my favorites! The creaminess factor is a huge plus, because a lipstick should be moisturizing and hydrating. It should never dry your lips out! Since I can‚Äôt reapply balm throughout the day when I have lipstick on, I only bother wearing lipsticks that keep my lips soft and pouty. This one also has a lot of glossiness in its finish, which makes it incredibly wearable without adding any gloss whatsoever‚Äìsomething I rarely feel comfortable doing! I‚Äôm very impressed by these lipsticks, and I wouldn‚Äôt mind checking out the other shades the next time I‚Äôm at Target (but I avoid going at all costs‚ÄìI always end up with a cart filled with 99% of things I didn‚Äôt intend to buy!).

Falling in love with Pin-Up was a complete accident! In an effort to get through all of the lipglosses I own, I‚Äôm trying to wear them alone, even if I‚Äôm not doing full makeup. I plucked a glossimer at random, and I was just totally wowed when I saw my reflection in my car mirror. My pout looked gorg! I‚Äôve been wearing it a lot to class lately, but I think I‚Äôm gonna have to hide it for a bit so I can wear it come summer.

It‚Äôs from this year‚Äôs Terracotta Collection . Mirage is a smoldering, smoked out gray-toned brown. It‚Äôs a nice, smoky shade, but since it‚Äôs not black but brown, it can be worn in the day time without overdoing it. Guerlain‚Äôs Loose Khols do take some practice, because they are a bit different from your average eyeliner. I find these work the best as a waterline product‚Äìit really holds on tight for the ride. I get about six to eight hours of waterline wear with these. The included applicator is like a stick, and again, practice makes perfect. At first, you‚Äôll be like, ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but just keep at it. These can also be used as an eyeshadow, but since you don‚Äôt get much product in it (plenty for an eyeliner, but not a lot to use as an eyeshadow). I do want to point out that this is an eyeliner first, and many pencil eyeliners give youa bout 0.04 oz. in product‚Äìso don‚Äôt let the size totally scare you. A little goes a long way, and I love how long-wearing the product is. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 29/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 3/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : Though it takes some trial and error to get the application down, I find the long-wearing power to be well worth a little experimentation! The matte dark brown is great for everyday or evening, which is nice!

If you saw my collection photos from January, you would have seen my dream vanity ‚Äì separate from the sinks, huge mirror, etc. Unfortunately, I had to move to a new area, and I lost that great spot. I was constrained to two feet of counterspace, bad lighting, and one measly drawer (plus closet space, but who wants that?). Now, I have four shelves/cubby holes (there are two more on the bottom, but reserved for other junk) dedicated to housing my makeup habit! So I introduce you, Temptalia‚Äôs $30 storage solution‚Ä¶ Here is the left half of the top of the newly-created vanity. I bought these square cubes at Target awhile ago for $1 each (bargain huntress‚Ä¶ yes, I think so) ‚Äì they are perfect for holding my lipglasses and lipsticks. I keep these out because I never know what I‚Äôm going to reach for. I also have a small mirror that is double-sided (magnifies on one side) for upclose/detail work. You can see the edge of the center mirror in this photo, which I found for $10 at Ross, and it‚Äôs a good size for makeup if you aren‚Äôt able to put up a wall mirror. The right side of the top of the vanity holds my brushes, mascaras, and liners in one container. I have all my MAC palettes (blushes and eyeshadows) on the right for easy access. The two left shelves: the top one houses my beauty powders, pigments, and a few items like foundation that I reach for often; the second one holds less used items like my various mascaras, drugstore liners, and an extra, empty silverware drawer for filling up later! Each silver storage solution is actually a silverware drawer ‚Äì you can find these at so many places; I picked mine up at Ross for $4 each. The two right shelves: the top one holds more pigments, eyeshadow quads, blushes, and eyeshadows in pot-form; the second one holds various beauty products that are not MAC or items I rarely use, plus a LUSH massage bar in a baggy (ha).

Whether you‚Äôre traveling for a few days or a few weeks, by plane or car or foot, you‚Äôre going to want to bring a few items of beauty necessity along with you, right? Now, when you go by plane, it is important to observe the 3 oz or less rule for all liquids, and all liquids must fit within a quart-size clear, plastic bag. Otherwise, it‚Äôs about how much you want to carry.I remember the first time I traveled for a week after becoming a beauty junkie, and I also remebering lugging far too much through the airport (a whole carryon‚Äôs worth ‚Äì this was pre-liquid restrictions). It is important consider what kind of makeup and how much of it you really need when traveling, but I also love travel-size sets for when you want to bring everything, but those big bottles just don‚Äôt do it for you.Here are some of my favorites (though all those holiday gift sets are also perfect for travel, most often, but hey, if you haven‚Äôt gotten your holiday loot yet, try these!): Philosophy ‚ÄúAll-Stars‚Äù Travel Set is a perfect way to keep all your skincare organized and in mini-size. You‚Äôll find Hope in a Jar, Hope in a Tube, Shear Splendor Shampoo, Shear Splendor Conditioner, and Kiss Me Red. Not a bad way to go for $35.00. Available at Nordstrom.com . Bobbi Brown Organizer is great for organizing what you do end up taking with you on your journey. I love that it has a brush holder as well as zipped up pouches. So all-in-one! $55.00. Available at Nordstrom.com . Bobbi brown Empties are amazing for taking travel-size portions of your full-size products. Reduce your traveling weight by filling these empties up with your favorite products! You should also be able to find empties at a local drugstore for about the same price. $10, available at Nordstrom.com . Lippmann ‚ÄòThree Times a Lady‚Äô Nail Color Set is great because it has a good trio of colors that are occasion-friendly and easy to carry in their miniature size. $21, available at Nordstrom.com .

You can find a review of Flamepoint, Buttercupcake, Love+, and Poison Plum here . The other five shades you can find in this review! The majority of the eyeshadows are vegan, but check the website, as they mark which are vegan (e.g. Love+ is not). Bulletproof is a deep dark black with a matte finish. It applies smoothly and isn‚Äôt chalky or powdery. Tako is a matte white. This one I felt had a little bit of a powdery look to it, though it was surprisingly good for a white eyeshadow. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever found a white that didn‚Äôt look a bit off on my skin tone, to be honest. It doesn‚Äôt feel powdery‚Äìjust looks a little like it on my skin tone. Dollipop is a bright hot pink with a matte finish. This is one of those showstopping pinks, truly. I am not sure if I‚Äôve ever seen anything quite this bright before. This is a retina-burning shade! Super pigmented and applies beautifully. Midori is an intense medium-dark green with a subtle shimmer. I actually can‚Äôt think of a shade that‚Äôs similar to this‚Äìat least not one that I own. Very pretty ‚Äì wearable without being so intense or primary. Afterparty is a rich medium blue with a shimmer pearl. This is the only shade that really made me go, ‚ÄúOh! This looks like‚Ä¶‚Äù (it reminded me of MAC‚Äôs Freshwater, but a little lighter blue). This one has a very distinct pearly sheen to it. All of the nine eyeshadows applied smoothly and felt soft to the touch. They were intensely pigmented, and you didn‚Äôt need much to get to that high level of pigmentation. For those who aren‚Äôt so much into color, Sugarpill doesn‚Äôt quite have you covered‚Äìyet. I‚Äôm interested to see if Sugarpill will put together a wider range of finishes, color varieties, and the like in the future. The packaging works for me. It‚Äôs understated and functional, but it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap (which is something I worry about with newer brands). It‚Äôs a circular, flat, semi-domed shaped plastic. It has a matte black plastic on the bottom half with a clear plastic flip-top lid. The lid has the Sugarpill logo printed (not a sticker!) on the lid as well.

Glossimers are thin in texture, smooth in shimmer, and non-sticky in feel. On my lips, the golden tones of this gloss really pop, but I really love wearing this for an extra kick over any lipstick. I used to not *get* the hype over glossimers, for two reasons: 1) why would anyone pay $27 for a gloss? (OK, totally over that, as I always say, once you pay $50 for a gloss‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no going back!) and 2) it just looks like a gloss! Now, it does and doesn‚Äôt look like any ol‚Äô gloss. It‚Äôs a very, very good gloss, but to really fall in love, you have to see it glittering and shimmering like the ocean in the sunlight. That‚Äôs really where I had my ‚ÄúI get it!‚Äù moment with these. I don‚Äôt care if a gloss is sticky or not, so that wasn‚Äôt a selling point for me, but I know it is for others. Most of glossimers do run sheer, and this one is no exception, but that is one of the reasons I love it over other products. It enhances without detracting from the base color (usually a lipstick in my case). I wore it most recently in a Valentine‚Äôs Day Look . Is this the right nude for you? Would you wear it?

These loose eyeshadows are ultra finely milled with rich color pay off that apply smoothly. Many of these eyeshadows are also vegan (check their website which marks which shades are vegan), for those curious! I‚Äôd recommend using these with a stickier base (e.g. something like mixing medium) for brighter and more long-lasting eyeshadow. Myself, I‚Äôd use these as bases, much like I‚Äôd use MAC Pigments. Asylum is a rich burnished red with a shimmery sheen. I found it looked redder when used wet (and obviously, more intense). Decora is a medium baby girl pink with silvery sheen and gold glitter flecks. Goldilux is a metallic bronzed gold. This is a truly gorgeous color‚Äìeasily my favorite of the eleven shades currently available. Junebug is a dark forest green with black flecks and a frosty sheen. The darkened base really comes through when used wet. Absinthe is a brightened yellow-green with a golden yellow sheen. It‚Äôs not chartreuse, but it‚Äôs not quite green either. This one applied beautifully wet or dry. Magpie is a medium-dark navy blue with silvery sheen and shimmer. I found this one definitely looked much better when used wet. Starling is a slightly darkened sky blue with a radiant silver sheen. This one could be used wet or dry, but I liked it better when wet. Royal Sugar is a vibrant shade of royal blue with silver and sky blue flecks of sparkle. This is not only an intense shade, but it‚Äôs a very unique color as well. Hysteric is a medium purple with a red base and an almost multi-colored shimmer. Lumi is an iridescent teal-reflecting white shimmer. This is a very fun shade to work with, and it‚Äôs one of those colors that can be layered over dark bases to give it a more unique look. (This one reminded me of MAC Transparent Teal Glitter in a non-glitter form.) Tiara is a metallic silver with a bright silver sheen. I found this looked lovely wet or dry, but the metallic sheen is brought out when this is used wet. These are held cynlider-style plastic containers with slightly glossy black screw-on lids with the Sugarpill logo printed (it‚Äôs not a sticker!) on top. The containers are cute and functional (reminded me of stumpier, smaller versions of MAC Pigments). There‚Äôs no insert or lid once you open, so take care when opening. I really liked the texture of these, because they were so soft and smooth, you didn‚Äôt need much to get intense color. My favorite shades were Goldilux, Absinthe, and Royal Sugar.

I‚Äôve known of Shrinkle forever , mostly through friends who‚Äôve bought from her via eBay, so when I saw that she was working on a cosmetics line, I was definitely intrigued. It was perfect timing when she reached out to me, because I was thinking of grabbing a few to try. Today, I‚Äôll go through the majority of the Sugarpill line, but first, I wanted to start off with the Burning Heart Palette ($34.00), which contains four large-sized eyeshadows (0.14 oz. each). The eyeshadows included in the palettes are the same size and shadows you can purchase individually. She has three variations available with a total of nine unique shades altogether. Burning Heart includes Flamepoint, Buttercupcake, Love+, and Poison Plum. Flamepoint is is a vibrant matte orange with fierce pigmentation. Buttercupcake is a bright matte yellow. I found the pigmentation on this to be great, but it did feel a little on the powdery side. Love+ is an intense shade of true red with a semi-matte finish. When swatched, I found it really looked more matte, but there is some shimmer/sheen when you look at it in the pan. Awesome pigmentation‚Äìvery much true-to-color. Poison Plum is a rich violet with a semi-matte finish. Again, like Love+, it has shimmer in the pan, but it‚Äôs very subtle when used. All four eyeshadows are rich, vibrant shades with good pigmentation and a soft, smooth texture. These aren‚Äôt powdery or chalky‚Äìthey are very blendable in practice. The eyeshadow pans themselves look to be about the size of Make Up For Ever eyeshadows, for reference. Since the palette is magnetized, these actually can be popped out if you want to rearrange them for travel, too. The packaging is edgy and fun‚Äìit‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôd expect from what I know about Amy and her style. What I like is that for a brand that‚Äôs debuting, she‚Äôs done it right. The packaging is not only true to her style, but it‚Äôs quality. It‚Äôs printed, designed for the line, and looks good. On the back of the packaging, all of the ingredients are listed for your reference. I would love to see the names of the eyeshadows added to the back of the palette/packaging, though. The quad itself is a heavy-duty cardboard (whether you dig cardboard or not for packaging is another story) ‚Äî I myself, prefer plastic/metal packaging because they hold up better ‚Äî but I haven‚Äôt had many issues with cardboard packaging either. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs not cheap, flimsy cardboard. I think with normal use, you‚Äôre not going to have any issues with the cardboard breaking down much, but you might get a couple of scratches. It‚Äôs magnetic, so it‚Äôll stay closed, and inside, there‚Äôs a large mirror. Do not expect Sugarpill to be an ultra affordable line‚Äìbecause the packaging doesn‚Äôt reflect cost-cutting and the products themselves are made with quality. I think it‚Äôs unfair for a brand (any brand, for that matter) to set low prices just to gain buyers. I think it‚Äôs important to set a price that makes sense for your brand, where you want to position yourself, and what kind of audience you want to appeal to. I think $34 for four shades of intensely pigmented eyeshadow (and they‚Äôre pretty large-sized pans, to boot) is a good deal. I‚Äôd also like to give major kudos to Sugarpill for putting up some of the most accurate brand-provided swatches I‚Äôve seen.

In the distance, hints of citrus and freesia pique the senses. Laughter and music can be heard coming from the harbor dotted with multi-color wooden boats. You take it all in realizing this is a day you‚Äôll want to relive forever. This is the inspiration for Pure White Linen Light Breeze. ‚ÄúWhite Linen has always epitomized casual elegance and the relaxation and happiness we feel in the spring and summer,‚Äù says Karyn Khoury, senior vice president of Fragrance Development World Wide, Est√©e Lauder Companies. ‚ÄúPure White Linen Light Breeze takes this mood one step further by having even more of a focus on the environment ‚Äî of the calming Mediterranean seascape. It is a sunnier, more transparent and even more tranquil scent.‚Äù The Fragrance While Pure White Linen Light Breeze incorporates core elements such as rich rose enhanced by white florals and smooth woods from classic White Linen and Pure White Linen, it was also created with dazzling citrus notes, airier florals, and a sheerer more subtly sexy finish for a scent that is as warm, mesmerizing and sensual as those treasured summer afternoons. An effervescent Darjeeling Tea Note is bathed with the refreshing iridescence of citrus including luscious Italian Bergamot, sparkling White Grapefruit and energetic freshly grated Orange Zest. Watery Kumquat conveys a contemporary carefree playfulness. A gentle unfolding of colorful Osthmanthus, vivacious Yellow Freesia and sensuous Neroli Petals intertwine with graceful Linden Flowers and rich Centifolia Rose to create a fresh intensely feminine allure. Precious Cedar Wood, rich Teak Wood, and a Soft Skin Accord embellished with a drop of ambrosial Acacia Honey impart a lasting subtle sensuality and that is effortlessly elegant.

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm busier, or maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm lazier (I‚Äôm going with the latter), but nonetheless, I tend to go for a minimal face. There are even a few days (when my skin is being nice) where I will even go sans makeup altogether! What exactly does the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Really Wearing Makeup‚Äù look entail? I have discovered that with the right mix of products you can get that totally natural look and look good in it. I used Studio Fix Fluid in NC30 applied in dabs using the 194 brush, then buffed in with the 182 brush. Sculpt sculpting powder to contour cheeks using the 168 brush. Select Sheer Loose Powder in NC25 applied using the 187 brush (stippling brush). Dior Skin Shimmer in Amber Diamond with the 150 brush on apples and high planes of cheeks. Espresso and Carbon eyeshadows to fill in brows with a 266 brush. I finished by wearing 3N lipstick with 2N lipglass on lips. What do you need? Since we are not all the same shade of skintone, nor do we all own the same products, let me give you some more generic ideas as to what you need for that super natural look.

It‚Äôs a soft, sheer shade, but it still gives lips enough color to pop. You can wear it alone or paired with heavier eye makeup, but it looks natural enough to be worn with little makeup as well.

It‚Äôs a bit muted, which makes it an excellent color for smoky eyes, but it‚Äôs also nice for subduing bolder colors. It has a slight iridescence to it, but it isn‚Äôt overly frosty. I thought the pigmentatoin was good as well. #160 is a matte eggplant shade of purple. I really love using this with pinks and purples in the crease. It also works really well all over the lid and then a matte black in the crease for an ultra smoky eye. #160 is smooth and has plenty of color for you to enjoy. #142 is a shimmery medium purple with a silver sheen/shimmer to it. This isn‚Äôt quite as lovely as I was hoping, as it could pump out more color right away, but it layers decently so you can still get a more intense color if that‚Äôs what you want (like me). #92 is one of the brand‚Äôs more famous eyeshadows. It‚Äôs a matte, bold shade of violet-purple. It‚Äôs incredibly bright, and it goes on smoothly and packs a lot of color from the get go. I haven‚Äôt used this yet in a look, but I‚Äôm definitely eager to! #89 is a soft, pearly fuchsia-purple shade with slight violet sheen. It reminds me of a lighter, less frosty version of MAC‚Äôs Stars ‚Äòn Rockets. Which of these are your favorites? Check out more photos !

The kit includes: mineral fusion‚Äôs signature Pressed Base in two different shades; the Luster Bronzer Duo, a duo bronzer with a sheen glow as well as a matte finish; Kabuki Brush ; and the Hydration Mist, a blend of antioxidant and anti-aging nutrients in an instantly hydrating mist. Luster Bronzer Duo I really loved the Luster Bronzer duo ‚Äì it‚Äôs a combination of a dark bronze color (be light handed with it, it goes on with punch otherwise!) and a lighter warm golden powder. I found the lighter color made an excellent sunkissed cheek, which I love for quick mornings or days with little makeup. I thought the packaging for all the products was tantalizing, as everything came in sleek, thin compacts. I loved that the products were light, because I could easily toss one in my purse and go. And knowing Temptalia readers and how much some of them carry in their purses, lightweight is essential! I liked the finish of the products (matte), but I found the coverage to be too light for my personal taste. I think I‚Äôm more of a liquid girl when it comes to foundation, I suppose, and a pressed powder just isn‚Äôt enough for me. I know a reader mentioned the harshness of the kabuki brush, but I didn‚Äôt find it too harsh. The Hydration Mist is refreshing, but I think I‚Äôd probably end up using this more as the winter comes and my skin dries out a bit more. I wouldn‚Äôt imagine a mini kabuki at this price (plus all those other items) to compare to a more high-end kabuki brush. It is mini, so it gives you a bit more control and precision. All in all, for $20, this is really a bargain, and I think it is an excellent way to check out Mineral Fusion as a brand, as well as mineral makeup on the whole.

To view the entire series to date, be sure to visit the beauty basics , or you can view posts within the series about MAC Face Brushes . Focus On: MAC 190 Foundation Brush MAC 190 Foundation Brush ($32.00) is a flat, paddle-shaped brush with very rounded edges and almost comes to a soft, rounded point. It‚Äôs fairly small, and it is thin. It‚Äôs a firm, densely-packed brush with fibres that make it easy to use with liquid and cream products, particularly foundations. I like it more for initially applying liquid/cream products onto the face rather than as a tool to blend or actually give me full coverage. I find fluffy brushes like the 109 are much more to my taste for application of foundations, but they can get a bit gummed up if you simply get the foundation on it from the get-go. Often using the 190 to dab on the product to my face, and then using the 109 to blend it out, works best for me. While a quality brush, I rarely reach for it, so I wouldn‚Äôt consider it a must-have. How do you like to use this brush ?

For fall, Urban Decay launched Ink For Eyes ($22.00 each), which is a brand new cream eyeliner available in six shades just dead-on perfect for the upcoming fall season. Urban Decay tells us their secret ingredient is Nylon 12, which is an ingredient that limits drag for a smoother, more precise application while it softens and absorbs excess oil. I put on Zero yesterday, and it didn ‚Äò t smudge or fade on me, so I‚Äôm pretty happy with the wear on these so far. The packaging is sleek and edgy, with a peacock drawing on the cover of the gunmetal-gray box. Flip it open, and you‚Äôll find a sleek, narrow mirror, a double-ended brush (smudge tip and angled brush), plus the star ‚Äì a strip of the actual ink. Binge is a rich, dark navy blue. It‚Äôs blue without being bright, and it‚Äôs dark without losing all of the blue. It‚Äôs definitely more navy blue than black-blue, too. You can also go less heavy to get a little more blue to stand out or go heavier and get a deeper color. Empire is a deep violet-purple with a little bit of sheen/glimmer. It‚Äôs pigmented, smooth, and really creamy when applied with a brush. Demolition is a deep, dark brown. It‚Äôs not too warm‚Äìalmost seems cool-toned to me‚Äìand intense. Very creamy and chocolately. Zero is an intense, rich black. There‚Äôs really not much else to describe it as ‚Äî it‚Äôs really quite black! I am *all* over liners and mascaras that are this rich in black. Loaded is a medium-deep forest green with tiny greenish-silver shimmer. It has good color pay off, and I love that it‚Äôs noticeably green, but it isn‚Äôt bright or OTT at all. Pyrotechnics is a sheer, glittery base. It has multi-colored glitter and goes on mostly clear. Layer it over one of the others or underneath one of the others to add more glitz!

It had semi-opaque color coverage, which I think was owed a lot to the very slippery, creamy consistency, and if it had been slightly drier, it would have been more pigmented applied. It also applied unevenly as a result. Once on, it wore well for six and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating. NYX Envy (P, $6.00) is bluer. Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics Technopagan (P, $18.00) is darker, bluer. See comparison swatches / view dupes . NYX Power Wicked Lippie ($6.00 for 0.15 oz.) is a muted, rosy mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It wasn‚Äôt as creamy as the other two shades, but in a good way, as it still glided on without dragging, but the color distributed better and more evenly. It could have been a little more opaque, given the formula‚Äôs claims. The color wore well for five hours on me. Revlon Icy Violet (LE, $7.99) is lighter. NARS Falbala (P, $26.00) is sheerer, less metallic. MAC Venus (LE, $16.00) is lighter, pinker. Guerlain Bloom of Rose (P, $35.00) is lighter. See comparison swatches / view dupes . NYX Cold Hearted Wicked Lippie ($6.00 for 0.15 oz.) is a silver-shimmered, medium black with a glossy sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied with some unevenness. It tended to pull into lip lines after three to four hours of wear, though it lasted closer to six in all. Though it has a very different finish, Kat Von D Slayer (P, $21.00) with its sheerer, uneven application looked somewhat similar on (but it‚Äôs matte and has no shimmer, just to be clear!).

It almost seemed like sparkle, because the particles seemed even finer than most micro-glitters. Tom Ford Beauty Silver Smoke (LE, $32.00) has a similar base color, but it isn‚Äôt glittery‚Äìit‚Äôs more metallic, so it‚Äôs not what I would consider a worthy dupe. See comparison swatches / view dupes . If you know of potential dupes, please share in the comments‚Äô section! This was a total impulse buy, but the promotional image really made me curious about it! I‚Äôve had good luck with Formula X, so I kept my fingers crossed. It‚Äôs an interesting shade, and I think the multi-colored micro-glitter makes it different than other potential dupes (that I know of, of course!). I also felt like it was a festive, holiday-esque shade that wasn‚Äôt your typical interpretation (metallic golds, reds, etc.) of the season. I wish it was more pigmented, though, as it is only semi-opaque and not the ‚Äúfull coverage‚Äù described. It‚Äôs the type of formula that can be layered with up to three coats comfortably or two thicker ones. It dries down faster than the average polish to a shiny, metallic finish‚Äìnot really glossy, just reflective. The wear time was consistent, and it lasted well with only very minor tip wear for seven days (no base/top coat). 46 15 Alchemy 46 15 Alchemy A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora Brazil 9 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

You may recognize the eyeshadows from Too Faced‚Äôs The Chocolate Bar . Both bronzers have routinely been featured in other palettes and are available individually as well. The lipgloss is a new formula called ‚ÄúLa Creme Lip Gloss‚Äù that will officially debut next spring. The palette has a strong, chocolaty scent, so if you don‚Äôt dig sweet chocolate smells, you may want to look at other Too Faced offerings this holiday. I think they could have chosen a more versatile set of shades, as I found the three odd to combine; the matte didn‚Äôt play as well with the shimmery shades, and when I tried to layer, it tended to look a little powdery/chalky. I think perhaps a more satiny finish for the lightest shade would have helped for combining the three, and if the darkest shade was darker, you could get more versatility out of these three. I just don‚Äôt love the way this is done, though the quality is good with the exception of the lip gloss, which was a total miss for me. White Chocolate is a pale, light beige with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had a soft, silky consistency that had good color payoff without being powdery. However, when it layers or blends with the more shimmery shades like Creme Brulee and Haute Chocolate, it seems to make them appear a little chalky at times. I think the thinner texture (in comparison to the other two shades) also makes it less easily blended with them. It wore well for eight hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Creme Brulee is a brightened, medium-dark gold with a frosted, metallic finish. It is a little drier and thinner compared to the version in the Chocolate Bar, though the pigmentation was still good. It wore well for eight hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Haute Chocolate is a meidum-dark, bronzy brown with a frosted sheen and warm, reddish undertones. It had good color payoff, and the texture was soft and blendable, though it wasn‚Äôt as buttery or as dense as the version in the Chocolate Bar. It wore well for eight hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Chocolate Soleil (Bronzer) is a medium-dark, tan brown with warm, yellow-ish undertones and a satin-matte finish. It‚Äôs a permanent product in Too Faced‚Äôs range, and it‚Äôs in nearly every holiday palette from them this year (and was often included in their various palette/sets released in the past). The texture is soft, silky, lightly powdery, but blendable and fairly pigmented. It lasts about eight hours on me. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Snow Bunny (Bronzer) is a warm, light-medium gold with orange tones and a frosted sheen. It had a slightly thinner texture, but it was still smooth and blendable on the skin. The more frosted sheen did emphasize pores somewhat, so that may be a deal-breaker. I like it better dusted lightly over Chocolate Soleil as a highlighter, as that lighter application helps to minimize how much gets emphasized on the skin. It wears seven and a half hours on me. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Naked Dolly (La Creme Lip Gloss) is a pink-peach with a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but it settled into lip lines and applied unevenly. The texture was somewhat thick, and it was tacky on the lips. The gloss lasted two hours, and it was neither drying nor hydrating.

Site News Feb 06, 2009 February 06, 2009 Some of you have been readers of Temptalia since its early, not-so-industrious beginnings, while others have only stopped by yesterday. I would really love to get to know those who have supported Temptalia and continue to support this endeavor! I can‚Äôt say enough, but thank you for reading, commenting, and supporting both me, as I grow and learn and discover myself, as well as the blog as a beauty resource. What name do you go by? Christine. I‚Äôve never been one for any of the nicknames that come from Christine (Chrissy, Christy, Chris, etc.), so I‚Äôve always stuck with Christine. You can call me Temptalia, too, since it‚Äôs been my internet monniker for the past six years or so. Who are the most important people in your life? My family and my boyfriend are the people who are vital to me enjoying and loving life. Everyone has supported me for my educational and business endeavors so much, and the support system is just incredible. What are some ways you enjoy spending your free time? Free time, what‚Äôs that? Just kidding üòâ These days, I like spending my down time with Mellan or watching trash reality TV. I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô Tool Academy on VH1 for its utter hilarity, at the moment. With I Love Money 2 just beginning, I‚Äôll probably watch that. I‚Äôm terrible about watching when they‚Äôre on, though, so I often miss episodes. Stupid TiVo not working with Dish Network üôÅ Reveal three quirky facts about yourself! I used to ‚Äúrun‚Äù online magazines back when AOL was a huge internet provider; I believe I did it from age 13 to 17. At some point, I think I had over ten different ones running (oddly enough, one was a ‚Äúgirly‚Äù ‚Äòzine with some beauty in it!). I don‚Äôt love the taste of coffee, but I love Starbucks! And final fact: I‚Äôm pretty good at Guitar Hero üòâ Where do you want to be in five years? I‚Äôd love to have been able to really grow Temptalia into a successful business doing more than just blogging. I really hope I‚Äôve finished up school by then‚Äìshould be done in 2011‚Äìand done for good! It would be fantastic to have my very own beauty/makeup room with insanely cute and practical storage systems for all my products üôÇ What book, song, and movie could you read, listen, and watch over and over again? Book: Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Song: Alice In Chains‚Äô ‚ÄúNutshell.‚Äù Movie: Ratatouille (which I have probably watched/listened to over thirty times!). What do you feel makes you beautiful? I have a good heart. Even if my aim isn‚Äôt always on target, my intentions are good! I‚Äôm not about being petty, mean, or rude to others‚Äìit‚Äôs just not in my nature! Now, I want to get to know YOU! 1. What name do you go by? 2. Who are the most important people in your life? 3. What are some ways you enjoy spending your free time? 4. Reveal three quirky facts about yourself! 5. Where do you want to be in five years? 6.

It will also be available at: Nordstrom , Macy‚Äôs , Bloomingdale‚Äôs , Dillard‚Äôs (no exact date or time given for online releases at other retailers). The MAC x Kelly Osbourne Collection has a few products for eyes, lips, and cheeks, so everything is covered within the collection. It was a so-so collection with a mix of decent to good products but some products are more dupable than others. Though I really liked the way Kelly Yum-Yum feels on the lips, it is also a color that has been done quite often. Cheeky Bugger will be nice for fairer complexions.

Urban Decay Rush (P, $19.00) is more muted. Urban Decay Manic (P, $19.00) is a touch lighter, warmer. MAC In Anticipation (P, $19.50) is pinker. MAC Pink Treat (P, $15.00) is slightly darker. See comparison swatches / view dupes . It had really good color payoff in a single pass, and it applied evenly to the lips‚Äìa lot of lip pencils do not look as even on their own as Cranberry does. It has a totally matte finish, so it gives lips a slightly drier look, but the pencil itself didn‚Äôt feel too clingy or drying. It‚Äôs not a particularly comfortable formula to wear by itself, but it is helps prolong the wear when worn underneath a shorter-wearing lipstick that is more hydrating. On its own, it wears six hours and is somewhat drying. I believe this shade was once permanent but then discontinued, and now it is set to be re-released with MAC x Sharon Osbourne . 60 15 Cranberry 60 15 Cranberry A Discontinued N/A Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 96% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

MAC Snob is shinier. MAC Silly is lighter and shinier. Rescue Beauty Lounge Pepto Pink is darker, shinier. Essie Off the Shoulder is darker, shinier. See comparison swatches here . I found the consistency of this shade to be a little on the thick side, and it was harder to apply smoothly and evenly. I felt like it was almost sticking to the nail and was rather streaky on the first coat. The second coat covered a lot of the streaking but not all. Because of the wax finish, I do recommend using a ridge-filling base coat to smooth out the surface. The wear I get with the wax finish formula gives me more tip wear after seven days than the cream/shimmer formula from Cult Nails. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with chipping, though. 77 59 Kiss My Rose Bush 77 59 Kiss My Rose Bush B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Cult Nails 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 7.5 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 86% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It has a silver glitter overlay, but the glitter disappears after the first use. On me (warm, medium skin tone), I get visibly pinker cheeks, but the effect is definitely subtle. The texture is soft, and it‚Äôs effortless to apply and blend out, partially owing to the softness in the color itself. It has an ultra soft sheen that looks more like a glow when applied, so there is no need to fear shimmery or glittery finishes here (and again, the glitter is only on the top layer). Lancome says: ‚ÄúThe new must have blush is an original twist of two incontrovertible items of the 70‚Äôs style: the bowtie and the butterfly designed by Alexis Mabille. In fashion, wearing a bowtie is the ultimate chic attitude, besides a way to express free-spirit and absolute lack of concern for what other people think. The butterfly is a multicultural symbol of free soul, feminity and beauty of nature.‚Äù Lancome recommends using the pink shade as a blush, beige shade as a sculptor, and lavender shade to unify the complexion. This is all well and good, and I appreciate the directions overall, but you‚Äôre going to need a pretty small (and precise) brush to use any of the three shades alone‚Äìespecially the lavender one. The design is femine and pretty, though of course, it looks less elegant once you‚Äôve used it a few times, but some of the features still linger (and as far as I know, and based on Lancome‚Äôs recommendation to use certain shades individually), there are three distinct shades that go all the way through. Also worth noting is that this is practically a brick of blush at 0.39 oz. (average blush is around 0.15 to 0.20 oz.). The included applicator worksin a pinch, but the bristles are rougher than I‚Äôd like, and they will kick up a lot of powder if you attempt to use it.

According to Urban Decay, these have a silky texture that has ‚Äú40% more glitter than our most sparkly shadows,‚Äù and that this formula ‚Äúdelivers a sheer wash of color, topped with ‚Ä¶ sparkle that glistens like wet now.‚Äù The glitter ingredient is called ‚Äúreflex‚Äù and these boast no fall out or chunky glitter. They can be used wet or dry, depending on what kind of color you want to achieve. Each Stardust eyeshadow retails for $20.00 for 0.12 oz. For reference, Deluxe Eyeshadows retail for $18.00 for 0.09 oz. and Deluxe Eyeshadows retail for $16.00 for 0.05 oz. Stardust Eyeshadows Space Cowboy is a champagne beige with golden sheen and sparkle. It goes on barely there when used dry, but it has a more opaque look when used wet. Bobby Dazzle is a shimmery white (just slightly tinged by gold) with white and silver sparkle. This shade is best used dry unless layering over a more intense color, because it is incredibly sheer dry, though more obvious when used wet. Griffith is a soft, yellow-toned green with paler green sheen and sparkle. You can get some green to show when you use this dry, but it‚Äôs better when used wet or over a base. Diamond Dog is a dirty brown with a little gray and silverish sparkle. This brown kind of felt like one of those ‚Äúugly‚Äù browns to me for some reason. Somewhat pigmented when used wet but still nicer when used wet. 54 is an icy purple with silver-white sparkle. It‚Äôs pretty pale and cool-toned and like the other shades, best used wet. Retrograde is a darkened purple with red undertones and silver sparkle. I expected richer color, but I couldn‚Äôt achieve the deepness I wanted even when used wet. It just looks so dark in the pot, but it‚Äôs not nearly so dark in real life. Atmosphere is a bright teal-blue with silver sparkle. Atmosphere is easily the best shade of the nine ‚Äî if you only wanted one, this is the one I‚Äôd recommend. It‚Äôs richly pigmented, even when used dry, and moreso when used wet. Moon Spoon is a gray taupe with cool silver sparkle. So so when used dry, smoother when used wet. Void is a gray-black with silver sparkle. It reminded me of Oil Slick, just with more glitter. I found this one didn‚Äôt seem to look much different when used wet‚Äìabout the same as when swatched dry. The packaging is a matte, slightly squish plastic (think NARS) shaped into a square. You squeeze the sides and it releases the plastic flip-top back. I‚Äôm not drooling over the packaging, but it‚Äôs functional. It‚Äôs particularly streamlined and ‚Äúclean‚Äù for Urban Decay, actually. The glitter in the Stardust eyeshadows is definitely not the typical chunky glitter a la Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, but I did encounter a decent amount of fall out when I used Atmosphere in this look earlier this week . It wasn‚Äôt the worst fall out I‚Äôve encountered, but I did get enough to be able to say that these definitely are prone to fall out for me. I used it over Urban Decay‚Äôs Primer Potion and wet, for reference, and still had the fall out. I‚Äôd say the fall out is a little less than their typical glitter eyeshadows, certainly much less so than Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, as well. If you don‚Äôt mind a little clena-up, then these might be fun to play around with. These are probably better over dark bases or else layered on top of more pigmented or vibrant shades of eyeshadow. I could definitely see these working well over a black base for a very smoky, glittering eye. Even though layering seems to the best way to use these, they weren‚Äôt quite as blendable as Urban Decay‚Äôs powder eyeshadows. When used wet, they have a bit of a tendency to ‚Äústick‚Äù in places, so you may find yourself using a similar-colored powder eyeshadow to help blend out the Stardust eyeshadow. Bottom Line: I have never been a fan of eyeshadows that produce a lot of fall out. I don‚Äôt want to have to spend extra time cleaning up after application; I don‚Äôt mind a little bit‚Äìthe kind that can be covered up with foundation, just not a lot. These have enough fall out that I don‚Äôt love them, and I think the colors themselves aren‚Äôt as vibrant as I‚Äôd like to see from Urban Decay, so they‚Äôre not to my taste. Atmosphere was the only one that really popped to me. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre okay ‚Äì Urban Decay states they‚Äôre sheer, but they also say ‚Äúno fall out‚Äù which I found not to be the case in my experience. I found myself preferring Stila‚Äôs Jewel Eyeshadow Palette for my dose of glitter, because I found the color went on a bit more pigmented when used dry, but I also didn‚Äôt encounter very much fall out when I used them either. Of course, the shades aren‚Äôt similar, so you may go one way or the other based on what kind of color you want. I will say that if you use a sponge-tip applicator or your finger to press on the glitter, there is a lot less fall out, though. Additionally, for a glittery-based eyeshadow, the fall out was much less than I‚Äôve experienced in the past, on the whole. Have you tried these yet? What has your experience been like?

Finish by applying Blacktrack fluidline to the upper lash line with the 208, and then sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Sculpt sculpting powder to the hollows of the cheeks to lightly contour and blend onto cheeks with the 168. To highlight, apply Shell pearl onto the cheekbones with the 165.

Though it‚Äôs a bit of an investment, for those who adore the 24/7 formula, it‚Äôs such a steal. Korres High Drama Antioxidant Color Collection ($39.50 but a $117 value) is practically a look-in-a-box kind of package‚Äìand I‚Äôve always been impressed by Korres‚Äô textures. Korres, in general, often puts together excellent value sets, from skincare to makeup to lip butters. Urban Decay Naked Palette ($48.00 but a $230 value) includes twelve full-sized neutral eyeshadows that are beautiful on a variety of skin tones, work seamlessly together, and have excellent texture and pigmentation. If you can track yours down, it is worth the effort‚Äìassuming you dig yourself some neutrals, of course. Philosophy The Joy of Great Skin ($85.00 but a $156 value) will bring you some of Philosophy‚Äôs most popular products in a value set that will kick-off any new year, new skin resolutions you haven‚Äôt started. Clarisonic Mia ($149) is, for all intents and purposes, the same device as the original Clarisonic (which goes for $195). I think the Mia gives people a chance to purchase at a slightly more palatable price tag, but it really doesn‚Äôt feel or seem any different than the full-sized version! (I know the ‚Äúbig‚Äù difference is that the Mia only has one speed.) The all-new 2011 Jetta comes nicely equipped at a surprising new price. Which means, German engineering, more rear legroom, enough trunk space for just about anything and, above all, more looks from everybody on the road. It‚Äôs great. For the price of good.

Light and nature are two major themes that have infused Giorgio Armani‚Äôs aesthetic and vision of makeup since its creation. The Armani makeup collection for spring 2011 plays with transparency to ignite a woman‚Äôs face. Bright colours that allow infinite layering and blending create a new landscape of tones. There is a new smoky look for the eyes produced with radiant colours. From soft to dramatic, the look seen at the Armani spring/summer 2011 fashion show was a fresh interpretation of ‚ÄúLa Femme Bleue‚Äù. This season the must-have look utilises a perfect harmony of diaphanous forest green and purple iris on eyes, contrasted with frozen pink light on skin and lips. The inspiration: fresh morning dew on a wild bunch of flowers. Makeup artist Linda Cantello, who worked on the Armani spring/summer 2011 fashion show, says: ‚ÄúImagine the richest purple and the deepest green both enlivened by a frozen silver. A soft black completes the palette, to be worn alone as liner or to add depth to smoky eyes. Freshened by the softest baby lips, a beautiful frosty blush completes this new way of facing spring in the depths of winter.‚Äù Transluminence Eye Palette ($58.00) Blend and layer the four full, rich, colour-intense translucent tones. Apply rich purple iris with an eye brush to the eyelid and add dewy forest green. These will fuse together into a vibrant blue turquoise. Render the effect even more luminous with a layer of frozen silver. Open up the eye with a touch of silver on the inside corner. Outline the under eye or the eyelid with soft black eye colour, applied wet or dry. Transluminence Face Palette ($49.00) Sculpt the face with frost bitten Sheer Translucent Blush presented in the spring signature face palette.

It also wears three to four hours on me, and I never find my lips parched after wear. For spring, Chanel launched two shades: Nakkar is a reddened watermelon pink with subtle gold micro-shimmer. It provides some color on my lips, but it‚Äôs still on the sheer side. Nakkar is like a red version of Pink Teaser (from fall ‚Äô10). Aragonite is a sheer, nearly colorless base with silver, pink, and teal micro-shimmer. Aragonite is fairly similar to Galactic, the primary difference being Aragonite has more pink shimmer, while Galactic has less and therefore appears cooler in tone.

(I‚Äôm not sure about the permanence of this product‚Äìstill waiting for confirmation.) It is aptly named, as it consists of five shades that are variations on white/black/gray. There is a blue-tinged white with a frosted finish; medium-dark bluish-gray with a satin finish; pewter gray with a metallic-frost sheen; bright snow white with a high metallic-frost finish; and a dark, matte black with silver micro-sparkle. For the traditional, more monochromatic smoky eye, this is a perfect palette to create those kinds of looks. I like the gradual intensity of gray from white to black, which allows for a lot of different variations in how light or dark you want to go. This quint has very smooth, buttery eyeshadows that are nicely pigmented, not powdery, and effortlessly blendable. I did not feel like there were any problem children in this palette, which is really nice to see, because often there is at least one imperfect shade in any palette.

Depending on what I wear it with, I‚Äôve found it can look more blue-pink or yellow-pink. It looks semi-opaque when applied to my lips, but it does noticeably pink and pale ‚Äôem up with a very creamy look. It almost looks like a milky pink on me, but not quite so pale. I wore Jing-a-Ling with MAC Nymphette in this sunset-eye look . Benefit‚Äôs Silky Finish Lipsticks tend to have a little more slip, so I find they last about three or four hours, but the silkiness of the finish does make it a more moisturizing lipstick. Is this the perfect pink for you? Would you wear it? The Spring Season is a series of posts featuring my favorite soft beige, coral, and pink lipsticks and lipglosses ‚Äî all perfect for the first blossom of spring ‚Äî that runs through March 2010.

This is the third palette from Bobbi Brown‚Äôs Color Strips Collection , which also featured Bonfire and Orchid . Ivory is a cool-toned white beige with a matte finish. Lightning (Sparkle) is a shimmering softened gray with silver shimmer. Aquamarine (Metallic) is a muted sky blue with a frosty sheen and shimmer. Grey Sky is a medium gray with almost a brownish-taupe cast with a matte finish Storm is a deepened blue-black with a matte finish. The Aquamarine Palette is more on the cool-toned side, so it‚Äôs definitely more suitable for those with cooler undertones. However, it‚Äôs not unwearable for those with warmer skin tones, but you‚Äôll want to mix and match with some slightly warmer hues just to bring everything together. What I really like about this palette, though, is that the shades work really well together, like in the Bonfire Palette . For a review of the Pot Rouges, head on over to my Orchid Palette review, which includes the same shades of Pot Rouges.

Chanel Energizing Multi-Protection Cream SPF 15 ($75.00 for 0.1.7 oz.) is a quick-absorbing moisturizer with a cream consistency but the feeling and behavior of a lotion. It is designed to be used daily to ‚Äúkeep early signs of age and fatigue at bay.‚Äù I wanted to try this particular moisturizer, because I really enjoyed Chanel‚Äôs Ultra Correction Lift Day Cream SPF 15 ($150.00 for 1.7 oz.). Chanel has several different product families available in skincare, and Beaute Initiale seems to be their ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù range. It also seemed like it would be a good fit for my skin and aging concerns (more about preventation than reversal at this time). Hydramax + Active seems like another alternative for getting your foot in Chanel‚Äôs skincare. My Skin : I‚Äôm 24 years-old with some fine lines around my eyes, slight but noticeable lip lines when I smile. My skin type is normal-to-dry in the fall/winter and mostly normal in the spring/summer. I am acne-prone and suffer from minor breakouts that seem to be more hormone or stress related than anything else. There were so many things I loved about this cream, but it just doesn‚Äôt work with my skin type (normal-to-dry). I need more moisture, and I found my skin felt parched after a couple of hours after using this. I think those with oily skin ( but I would still recommend the Fluid for very oily skin types ) could definitely consider this as an option for a daytime moisturizer. The cream dries down very quickly, within a few minutes, which is something I always keep an eye on when it comes to creams. Nobody wants to wait thirty minutes for their moisturizer to absorb! It also spreads very evenly and well without leaving any streaks of white‚Äìit feels and looks like a cream, but the way it evens out so quickly makes it seem more like a gel. It dries down to a semi-matte, smooth finish. It is scented, but I found it pleasant‚Äìa fresh floral that didn‚Äôt feel heavy. I loved using it and wearing it for two to three hours, but for my skin, I need something heavier. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why this isn‚Äôt sufficient, because I don‚Äôt have particularly dry skin, and there is a Fluid version (which I imagine is lighter and designed for oilier skin types). It is listed as a cream, so it should be heavier and more suitable for drier skin types, but it does not seem to be hydrating enough for my normal-to-dry skin, let alone dry skin. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 25/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 RECOMMENDATION: I recommend trying a sample of this for normal-to-oily and oily skin types. If you are oily or very oily, you may consider using the Fluid version, which comes in a pump and may be lighter (but I haven‚Äôt tried it myself). AVAILABILITY: Nordtsrom See more photos!

The finish was creamy, not quite milky, but as such, there was some settling into lip lines. It is a thicker gloss, too, so be careful when applying it to ensure an even finish (also avoiding smooshing your lips together too much, as it will push around the gloss and making it look uneven). my thoughts on the formula: MAC Lipglasses are vanlla-scented, and they are typically thick and sticky.

Chanel Energizing Multi-Protection Cream SPF 15 ($75.00 for 0.1.7 oz.) is a quick-absorbing moisturizer with a cream consistency but the feeling and behavior of a lotion. It is designed to be used daily to ‚Äúkeep early signs of age and fatigue at bay.‚Äù I wanted to try this particular moisturizer, because I really enjoyed Chanel‚Äôs Ultra Correction Lift Day Cream SPF 15 ($150.00 for 1.7 oz.). Chanel has several different product families available in skincare, and Beaute Initiale seems to be their ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù range. It also seemed like it would be a good fit for my skin and aging concerns (more about preventation than reversal at this time). Hydramax + Active seems like another alternative for getting your foot in Chanel‚Äôs skincare. My Skin : I‚Äôm 24 years-old with some fine lines around my eyes, slight but noticeable lip lines when I smile. My skin type is normal-to-dry in the fall/winter and mostly normal in the spring/summer. I am acne-prone and suffer from minor breakouts that seem to be more hormone or stress related than anything else. There were so many things I loved about this cream, but it just doesn‚Äôt work with my skin type (normal-to-dry). I need more moisture, and I found my skin felt parched after a couple of hours after using this. I think those with oily skin ( but I would still recommend the Fluid for very oily skin types ) could definitely consider this as an option for a daytime moisturizer. The cream dries down very quickly, within a few minutes, which is something I always keep an eye on when it comes to creams. Nobody wants to wait thirty minutes for their moisturizer to absorb! It also spreads very evenly and well without leaving any streaks of white‚Äìit feels and looks like a cream, but the way it evens out so quickly makes it seem more like a gel. It dries down to a semi-matte, smooth finish. It is scented, but I found it pleasant‚Äìa fresh floral that didn‚Äôt feel heavy. I loved using it and wearing it for two to three hours, but for my skin, I need something heavier. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why this isn‚Äôt sufficient, because I don‚Äôt have particularly dry skin, and there is a Fluid version (which I imagine is lighter and designed for oilier skin types). It is listed as a cream, so it should be heavier and more suitable for drier skin types, but it does not seem to be hydrating enough for my normal-to-dry skin, let alone dry skin.

The amplified finish gives is a creamier consistency, more color pigmentation, and a semi-matte finish. I did find this shade a little on the drier side, so I would recommend prepping lips accordingly (keep the moisturized, exfoliate prior). my thoughts on the formula: MAC Lipsticks are vanilla-scented but taste-free. I typically get four hours of wear, but some of the lighter lustre and glaze finishes tend to disappear by hour three. Amplified cremes and amplified finishes, however, tend to go beyond four, but with lighter shades like Viva Glam Gaga 2, I expect around four.

This is a gorgeous hue that works well on cool, pale toned skin to warmer, deeper skin. The subtle glimmer of the shimmer and shine give lips a fuller, rounder look while de-emphasizing lip lines. The color itself is nearly opaque, which is a bit surprising given the Brilliant line, but with a color like this, it works. If it were sheerer, it may have looked blotchy. The Rouge G Brilliant formula is like a lipstick and lip gloss hybrid in the way it looks and feels; it holds on and wears like a lipstick (three to five hours) but has the shininess of a lip gloss. It‚Äôs also moisturizing and doesn‚Äôt emphasize lip lines. Like the Rouge G lineup, though, these have a rosy-fruity scent to them.

It also sets and mattifies the skin, which makes it one multi-tasking powder. Upon trying it, I was a bit bothered by the lightness of the compact‚Äìit feels like plastic, and from Guerlain, it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôd expect. It sounds like plastic when I knock on it, which could account for the lack of weight. On the flip side, because it is not metal or metal-esque, it still has that gunmetal look without the accompanying fingerprints. I‚Äôm torn: I love the heft of a good luxe compact, but I love that this stays fingerprint-free. The Meteorites Illuminating Pressed Powders actually come in rather different packaging, which also felt plastic, so perhaps I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised. The ones prior are shimmering and less flesh-toned as they are enhancing (think highlighters). Those go for $65 a pop but come with 0.35 oz. of product. I tend to get a touch oily around the t-zone after six to eight hours of wearing full makeup, but I was pleased to see that a sheer layer of Rose Teint did wonders and kept me shine-free for twelve hours. It also illuminates in a very soft, refined way; it‚Äôs there but so slight that it really does seem like your skin is naturally radiant and aglow. It has a beautifully silky texture that‚Äôs so finely milled that it looks more like a pearly finish than anything else. The sample I received was in Teint Rose, which is actually the lightest shade and ever-so-slightly pink-tinged (but really, it‚Äôs so slight, I could hardly tell), while Teint Beige and Teint Dore are darker, though from what I‚Äôve seen, not by much. On me, it seemed virtually colorless and worked well even though it looks rather pale and light. (I think I may pick up Teint Beige, though, to see what that does for me, as I like this one quite a bit.)

There are six included in this post: Clinic (deep peacock green with fine green sparkle), Narc (mossy green sheen), Clash (bright electric blue with fine silver sparkle), Delinquent (deep jewel purple with fine purple sparkle), Morphine (iridescent lilac), and Barracuda (black with fine silver sparkle). Clinic is a rich, jewel-tone teal with green-teal sheen and light silver sparkle. It is similar to Covet 24/7 Liner , but Clinic seems more green-based. Narc is a darkened grassy green tinged with olive dusted with gold sparkle. It compares best with Mildew 24/7 Liner , but it is noticeably greener and warmer. Clash is a brilliant bright blue with silver sparkle. It is extremely similar to Electric 24/7 Liner ‚Äìif I look closely, it seems like Clash is slightly brighter. Delinquent is deep purple violet with lilac sparkle. It‚Äôs such a stunning jewel-tone shade. It is completely different from Lust 24/7 Liner , and it doesn‚Äôt compare to Ransom 24/7 Liner either. Morphine is an iridescent cool-toned bluish-lilac with some fuchsia in its base. I thought it might compare to Asphyxia 24/7 Liner , but it‚Äôs much, much lighter, more iridescent, and really does not have much in common with Asphyxia . Barracuda is a darkened black with silver sparkle. I couldn‚Äôt distinguish it from Oil Slick 24/7 Liner , and it is slightly darker than Uzi 24/7 Liner . Of this set, Delinquent and Morphine are the most unique, while the other four have similar shades in the 24/7 Liner line. This is predicated on you already owning the liner counterparts and not feeling the need to spring for jumbo-sized versions to use as an eyeshadow base. The 24/7 Liners are still much easier to use as eyeliners, because they are smaller and therefore more precise and suited for the lash line. However, you do get significantly more bang for your buck with the 24/7 Shadows, so if you don‚Äôt own one of the 24/7 Liners that compares but always wanted to, perhaps the 24/7 Shadow version will serve you well. These really do feel like jumbo-sized 24/7 Liners‚Äìthey are smooth, creamy, and glide across the lid with ease. I will say that these seem more pigmented than the 24/7 Liners. You really get true color with one stroke, and even lighter shades go on opaque. I wore Clinic (to-be-reviewed) on one eye and Midnight Cowboy on the other eye for twelve hours yesterday, and I didn‚Äôt experience any creasing. I wore them both all over the lid and above the crease, applied with the pencil itself, and straight on the lid (no primer). I later wore just Rehab all over the lid and above the crease, blended out with fingertips, with Rehab over Urban Decay‚Äôs Primer Potion on one lid and by itself on the other. This test was more about blendability and how it would work over a base. It dries down quickly; it‚Äôs smudgeable and blendable for 15-20 seconds, but you‚Äôll want to work pretty fast if you‚Äôre blending two or more of the Shadow Pencils together. Lighter shades like Sin, Lit, and Midnight Cowboy are beautiful all-over lid shades‚Äìfor those mornings where all you have are two minutes to spare. They are shorter than 24/7 Liners (just over 5.5‚Ä≥), but they are definitely fatter‚Äìthey also contain over twice the product (.10 oz. vs. 0.04 oz.) and only cost $3 more ($20 vs. $17). In terms of high-end products, they compare to NARS Shadow Pencils in look (doesn‚Äôt migrate), but they perform well, like MAC Shade Sticks (creamier, though). I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised at how the price/quantity worked out here. All in all, I‚Äôm liking these so far, and they make excellent colored eyeshadow bases that can also double as eyeliner. So far, I‚Äôve found they adhere well to the lid without creasing or fading. P.S. ‚Äî I have to see what NYX pencils I have, but I will try to do some comparisons later this weekend (school all day).

Whether you use these as eyeliner or as an eyeshadow, they work as well, if not better, than the 24/7 Liners‚Äìsince they‚Äôre more pigmented.

I‚Äôve found that the shimmery shades can be used wet or dry, while the satin and matte shades are better used dry. The all-over base is a pink champagne with a frosted sheen of a finish. The lid shade is a metallic finished copper with strong orange undertones. The crease shade is a medium, warmed up brown with soft red-orange undertones and pale copper shimmer-sheen. The highlighter shade is a pale yellow gold that‚Äôs almost cool-toned; I found this shade had some fall out and worked best applied wet. The liner shade is a rich, dark chocolate brown with subtle red undertones and burgundy-bronze shimmer‚Äìbest liner shade yet, because it works beautifully wet or dry. my thoughts on the formula: The texture of Lancome‚Äôs eyeshadows are very smooth‚Äìsoft, silky‚Äìand all of these shades were excellent in terms of pigmentation. I only had minor fall out concerns with the highlighter shade, so I would recommend using it with a damp brush. I‚Äôm disappointed in the quantity provided in the palette, though. Lancome‚Äôs Color Design Quads come in at 0.16 oz. and their Color Design Eyeshadow singles at 0.0458 oz., which works out to be $263/oz. and $371/oz. respectively. This palette is $340/oz., which makes it more expensive ($48 vs. $42) with less product (0.141 oz. vs. 0.16 oz) than the Color Design Quads.

Very different. Follow Your Fancy is redder than Off the Page , while Sugarpill Asylum is darker and more orange. Madly Personal is a little darker and less frosted than Fuchsia , while Bright Fuchsia and Bold &amp; Brash are both much brighter, deeper, and darker‚Äìthe latter has a stronger iridescent fuchsia sheen. New Fixation is redder. Neon Orange is slightly darker than Morange but the difference is very, very subtle. Something New is a glossier version of NARS Schiap , while Smashbox Flirty is a lil‚Äô sheerer and Girl About Town is a bit darker. Trimming Talk is frostier and lighter, but Most Popular is totally different. Style Curve is similar to Show Orchid , which is brighter and more fuchsia, while Violetta is purpler and darker. Go For It is too purple, and Purple Rite is more plum than fuchsia. Love Forever is also similar but more fuchsia than purple. Play It Proper is a very pale, powdery pink, and it‚Äôs really not much like Benefit Dandelion , Shell Pearl , Porcelain Pink , or Oh So Fair . Pearl Blossom is the closest, but the texture is so different; plus it has a sheen, rather than a powdery finish. Too Chic is closest to NARS Albatross , which is a little yellower, while Chez Chez Lame is more beige. Benefit Dandelion is too peachy while Pearl Sunshine is significantly darker. Madly Magenta is significantly more purple than both Show Orchid and Love Forever . Movie Star Red is more pigmented but similar in color as Gesina , while Russian Red has less pink in its base. Tickle Me Pink is closest to Viva Glam Gaga (slightly lighter and cooler) or Snob (cooler), but it is similar to Overtime , which is a yellower pink (almost looks peachy in comparison). Unlimited looks nothing like it. Virgin Isle is a touch lighter than Vegas Volt , while Jazzed and Ever Hip are significantly lighter. See swatches!

Three of the four are lustres, but Empowered is a satin finish lipstick and has a spectacular amount of pigmentation, creaminess, and overall feel. It‚Äôs not my kind of color, though, which makes me wish it was! Equality is definitely not going to be an easy shade for us to pull off; probably gotta layer it with another lipstick and/or gloss. Myself is really weird, because it is myself on me. Which isn‚Äôt bad, but hey, I wear lipstick so I can‚Äôt *change* the lip color. Lipstick ($14.00 U.S. / $16.50 CDN) Equality is a semi-opaque fleshy-beige. It reminded me a bit of maybe Fleshpot lipstick (PRO) or concealer. This is really ‚Äúconcealer lips‚Äù on me, because it is so, so pale. This is not a shade that I‚Äôd consider suitable‚Äìat least alone‚Äìon my medium skin tone. It‚Äôs just going to wash me out. It is, however, an interesting way to neutralize the natural pigmentation in one‚Äôs lips. It has a lustre finish,which accounts for its slightly uneven application and glossy sheen. Myself is MLB‚Ä¶ not quite better. No, but seriously, I put this on my lips, and I was like, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd it go?‚Äù I slathered this sucker on, but it just looked like my lips‚Ä¶ but again, not really *better*. I think this might be particularly lovely on those with more naturally reddened lips, because it might cool ‚Äôem down to a lighter pink. This was the sheerest lipstick of the four. It‚Äôs kind of a soft, cool-toned dirty pink. It is also a lustre finish lipstick. Empowered is a creamy, ultra pigmented brown with kind of a lightened peach feel ‚Äî it‚Äôs just not dark brown or even chocolate brown, but it‚Äôs definitely brown. On me? Don‚Äôt love it. I‚Äôm not a brown lipstick kind of gal, but I do think deeper skin tones will appreciate this one. It has a full coverage look, a lovely satin finish, and feels lovely on. Best formula/texture out of the four ‚Äî just wish I liked the color on me! 5N is a semi-sheer, plummy brown. It‚Äôs beautiful on lips, but it can go darker or lighter depending on your lips‚Äô pigmentation ‚Äî on me, it‚Äôs not ultra dark, but it darkens my lips enough that I‚Äôm satisfied with the color. It has a glossy finish, as it is also a lustre finish lipstick. This is a repromote from the N Collection from 2008 (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong on the year‚Ä¶). See photos, swatches, and lip swatches!

There‚Äôs an interesting mix of shades here ‚Äî you have the ultra bright, two more neutral/everyday, one vampy, and one that doesn‚Äôt quite fit. The five shades include: Courting Lilac (sheer lilac mauve with soft gold pearl), Cut-a-Caper (mid-tone peachy pink), Deepest Wish (deep creamy red-brown), The Faerie Glen (pale neutral pink), and Full Fuchsia (bright blue fuchsia). All are limited edition except for Full Fuchsia , which is permanent at PRO stores. Courting Lilac is a semi-opaque, pink-tinged purple with gold shimmer and sheen. It has a glaze finish. It‚Äôs not the same, but it has a similar effect as Victorian (from Spring Colour Forecast), but Victorian is a bubblegum pink in comparison. It‚Äôs closer in color to Bubblegum (also from Spring Colour Forecast), but the golden sheen is more apparent in Courting Lilac, and it‚Äôs not quite as blue-based. It‚Äôs also reminiscent of Urban Decay‚Äôs Naked but a little more lilac. Cut-a-Caper is a semi-opaque, soft coral-pink with a glossy shine. It has a lustre finish. At first, I thought it might have been similar to Ever Hip , but it‚Äôs peachier. It‚Äôs actually quite similar to Smashbox‚Äôs Splendid . I‚Äôm actually reminded of Strange Potion, which was a lipglass. I gotta say that it doesn‚Äôt look very much like it does in the tube when swatched or worn. Deepest Wish is a deepened red-burgundy with a glossy shine. It has an amplified finish, but it‚Äôs the weakest amplified I‚Äôve tried‚Äìit‚Äôs a lot glossier and sheerer than other amplified finished lipsticks I‚Äôve tried in the past. It‚Äôs a muted version of Media , less opaque version of Kittenish . The Faerie Glen is a semi-sheer neutral beige-peach with soft sheen. It has a lustre finish. It‚Äôs a lighter version of MAC Cherish . Full Fuchsia is a neon fuchsia with blue undertones. It has an amplified finish, and it applies nearly opaque. It is brighter and pinker than Girl About Town. I think Courting Lilac will be the big seller within the lipsticks launched, because it‚Äôs a little different than past similar releases and not fully found within the permanent range. Both Cut-a-Caper and The Faerie Glen are wearable neutrals that should flatter both cool and warm skin tones. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 26/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 RECOMMENDATION: The lustre finishes here actually have decent pigmentation, which is always nice to find. They‚Äôre still glossy in the overall appearance, though. Deepest Wish feels too dupeable to be a must-have.

MAC Blackground has a warmer base and smaller shimmer. Urban Decay Oil Slick is also a bit warmer (and a powder product). Buxom Black Lab is similar but has multi-colored sparkle. It had so-so color payoff; it is more easily applied as a sheer wash of color (so then it turns into a dark gray), and if you attempt to build up the color, it doesn‚Äôt work out so well. It tended to bunch up and layer in odd ways so that it didn‚Äôt give you a smooth, even result. The texture was smoother than Steel , but it had a very dry, almost flaky texture once it dried down. The color came off in chunks throughout the day. I tested it twice just to be sure, but it was the same: splotchy color, fall out, and then light creasing after eight hours. 1 4 Sinister 1 4 Sinister F Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Macy's Harrods Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) LookFantastic Bloomingdale's FeelUnique bluemercury Estee Lauder Dillard's 5 Product 6 Pigmentation 7 Texture 5 Longevity 2.5 Application 57% Total See more photos &amp; swatches!

NARS Gaiety is cooler-toned, bluer-based. NARS Angelika is darker, sparkly. MAC Pink Tea is more shimmery. MAC Peony Petal is cooler-toned. Tarte Dollface is a touch lighter. Bobbi Brown Nude Pink is more muted, slightly lighter. Normally, I like Bobbi Brown‚Äôs blush range for a formula that‚Äôs mostly matte, pigmented, and blendable, but Pastel Pink was so dry and stiff. This was another shade from the collection that I had to scrape off layers of color just to get a ‚Äúheavy‚Äù swatch of color. I really had to swirl and pack on the color to get enough payoff to show up on my skin tone for photographs and testing. If you have any scratchy brushes, I‚Äôd recommend using it with this, because it will help dig into the product to yield more payoff. While I can appreciate that fairer skin tones often prefer a blush that‚Äôs not so intense so they can use it with ease, the texture makes this one hard to use even if all you want is soft color. It‚Äôs not very blendable and really needs to be buffed and worked into the skin as it has a tendency to stick and look splotchy. It lasted for seven hours well, and after eight hours, there was noticeable fading. 10 9 Pastel Pink 10 9 Pastel Pink F Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Net-A-Porter Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's QVC Bobbi Brown (UK) Cosbar bluemercury Bobbi Brown 4 Product 5.5 Pigmentation 4 Texture 7.5 Longevity 2.5 Application 52% Total Read Full Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2013-03-24 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>5988d90b641025df28ec0332a3fcf4fa054612d4</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Free for Haul Friday, Volume #068</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/free-for-haul-friday-volume-068/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Free for Haul Friday, Volume #068 Features Feb 18, 2011 February 18, 2011 Welcome to Free For Haul Fridays!

If you don‚Äôt like frosty lips, though, you may not find yourself swooning over these, because three of the four do have that frosty, glimmering look. Like the lipsticks, whether these are for you is really a matter of personal taste; none of them are bad in formula, texture, or feel, but the colors may not appeal to everyone. Lipglass ($14.00 U.S. / $16.50 CDN) Glamour For All is a creamy, slightly milky medium pink. It‚Äôs harder to find a creamy medium pink, because often, creamy/milky pinks tend to be pale and lightened up a bit ‚Äî this one isn‚Äôt. On lips, it‚Äôs very creamy, so it does have a tendency to settle into lip lines. Liqueur is a reddish-brown with multicolored shimmer. It‚Äôs a pretty rich shade on lips, and it doesn‚Äôt sheer out too much on lips. Naked Frost is a neutral gilded bronze with multicolored shimmer. It has a very frosty and shimmery look on lips. It looks almost like a gilded beige on lips, rather than as deep or as bronzy as it does in the swatch. Spirit &amp; Soul is a slightly cool, kind of neutral tan-brown with multicolored shimmer. It has the same frosty, shimmery finish as both Naked Frost and Liqueur. The gold shimmer really pops when applied to lips. See photos, swatches, and lip swatches!

I think some might find these work for contouring, others for blushing/bronzing. I liked Personal Style the most, because I could see it being just a hint of definition on cheeks when eyes/lips are bold. Beauty Powder Blushes ($18.50 U.S. / $22.00 CDN) All‚Äôs Good is a dirty brown with just a smidgen of pink in it. It has very, very little shimmer ‚Äî like barely there shimmer. I think this might be nicer on deeper skin tones, but I keep thinking it‚Äôs just going to look dirty on me. The texture is very smooth, and the color itself is pigmented. Personal Style is a neutral-to-cool fleshy beige with no real shimmer (the powder looks like it has some, but I couldn‚Äôt detect any in the swatch). This looked like something you might even be able to contour with if you have lighter skin. See photos &amp; swatches!

Taupe Craze is a cool-toned neutral palette; not all shades have strong, cool undertones, but overall, the palette leans cool. I liked how the palette was a mix of finishes‚Äìsatin, shimmery, and almost matte. Initially, the two shimmery shades were concerning, because they looked almost glittery, but it seems like it‚Äôs more of the top layer than anything else‚Äìboth shades are more shimmer than glitter. The all-over color is a pale peach-beige with a satin-matte finish and excellent color pay off and a smooth texture. The lid shade is a neutral-cool medium brown with a soft taupe shimmer. The crease shade is a medium-dark taupe brown with a soft satin sheen. The highlighter shade is a smoky taupe with a bright metallic sheen and shimmer in its finish; when used wet, the metallic sheen is emphasized. I have no idea why Lancome would recommend this shade as a highlighter. Finally, the liner shade is a deep cool-toned taupe brown with silver flecks of shimmer; it is best used wet, if you want really smooth, richly colored line. The liner seemed the least pigmented‚Äìit‚Äôs a touch lighter swatched than what it is in the pan, but when used wet, it is a touch darker. Both the shimmery shades (lid and highlighter) along with the liner shade worked whether wet/dry (with the liner shade being better wet). I did try the all-over base and crease shade wet, just to see if I could, and they worked better dry. There did seem to be a slight hardening and darkening over the crease shade from using it wet, though. I couldn‚Äôt find out whether these were to be used wet/dry on Lancome‚Äôs website, but from my experience, it did not negatively impact any of the shades, with the exception of the crease shade. my thoughts on the formula: With the exception of the liner shade, the other four shades had very soft, smooth textures with nice color pay off. I really loved the all-over base shade‚Äìit had such a silky soft texture with beautiful pigmentation. It worked well as a lid shade and highlighter shade (which is good, because the ‚Äúhighlighter‚Äù shade is quite dark for a highlighter). I‚Äôm disappointing in the quantity provided in the palette, though. Lancome‚Äôs Color Design Quads come in at 0.16 oz. and their Color Design Eyeshadow singles at 0.0458 oz., which works out to be $263/oz. and $371/oz. respectively. This palette is $340/oz., which makes it more expensive ($48 vs. $42) with less product (0.141 oz. vs. 0.16 oz) than the Color Design Quads. I also know this palette invites a comparison to Urban Decay Naked Palette , but this one is cooler-toned, while Naked is warmer. If I had to pick the most similar shades, I would say Virgin (but Lancome‚Äôs all-over-base is much more pigmented and smooth, less shimmer), Toasted (Lancome‚Äôs lid shade is cooler), Buck (Lancome‚Äôs crease shade is cooler-toned, more taupe), while the highlighter and liner shades have no real similarities to shades from the Naked palette.

I wish they boosted up the quantity just a bit, perhaps to 0.18 to 0.20 oz. It‚Äôs a shame how the below average value of this palette brings down the overall grade. where to buy: Sephora Lancome Taupe Craze Color Design Palette Lancome Taupe Craze Color Design Palette Lancome Taupe Craze Color Design Palette Lancome Taupe Craze Color Design Palette All-over base, lid, crease, highlighter, liner (dry/wet) All-over base, lid, crease Highlighter, liner (dry/wet)</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-02-14 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>f9aedd73cd7964b6fa9cec9688d421c8ba3fae39</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Philosophy Candy Cane Shower Gel Review, Photos</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/philosophy-candy-cane-shower-gel-review-photos/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Philosophy Candy Cane Shower Gel Review, Photos Reviews Dec 29, 2010 December 29, 2010 Philosophy Candy Cane Quick Review: Philosophy Candy Cane Philosophy Candy Cane Shower Gel ($16.00 for 16 oz.) is a crisp, clean peppermint. It‚Äôs bright and crisp‚ÄìI think those are the best words to describe the scent. Philosophy Shower Gels are one of my personal favorites for body washes, because they come in an assortment of scents, with new ones each season. They lather up well and leave skin feeling clean without any tightness or dryness. I wouldn‚Äôt call these a moisturizing body wash nor do their scents linger. If you prefer your body wash to leave behind a long-lasting scent, these won‚Äôt be for you, but if you like to enjoy the scent while you shower but don‚Äôt want it to linger beyond, then these are perfect. (I belong to the latter category!) I don‚Äôt find them to lather quite as well in the hair, and they work in a pinch to clean hair, but I prefer many other shampoos over this one. It does, however, work well as a bubble bath, too‚Äìa little goes a long way. Welcome to Swatch-all-idays !

All three have a satiny, slightly glossy finish, and they feel very moisturizing on the lips. They smell sweetly scented ‚Äî I think I detected a bit of caramel-ness to it, too. Ever since Urban Decay launched their lipstick line, I‚Äôve always been a huge admirer of the creative packaging. I still love it, but it has to be some of the more impractical packaging I‚Äôve come across, just because the label is on the ‚Äútop‚Äù but the daggers are out of the bottom (which don‚Äôt stand very nicely). But I really do love it anyway. It‚Äôs just so beautiful to look at. Both Oil Slick and Confession should be worn with a lip liner (clear or otherwise), or you could wear this with Urban Decay‚Äôs new Lip Primer Potion ($20.00). I haven‚Äôt yet tried it, but I‚Äôm planning to see how the two work together later on (and will definitely post some comparisons for you all, too). These two shades tend to settle into natural lip lines and may bleed, too, without the proper base! Oil Slick is a sheer, glossy black with small, silver sparkles. It‚Äôs extremely wearable‚Äìnot necessarily on its own‚Äìwhen you layer it with other shades. Try topping it with a really rich red or pink! Naked is creamy, pinky shade with a little bit of beige to tone it down and gold shimmer to warm it up. Love it. LOVE. Confession is a sheer, glossy burgundy-wine shade. It goes on much brighter/lighter than it looks in the tube‚Äìso don‚Äôt be afraid of the near blackberry color it appears to be. (Actually, the transformation reminded me a bit of how Clinique‚Äôs Black Honey is!) Naked is my new obsession, though. It‚Äôs absolutely stunning on lips. It‚Äôs totally my-lips-but-better (MLBB) and yet way more complex and interesting than just MLBB. It‚Äôs this glossy pinky color with gold shimmer/sparkle. I feel like I‚Äôm wearing a lip color that brightens my whole face without anyone really having a clue I‚Äôm wearing any. This shade really grabbed me from the get-go, even if it‚Äôs not necessarily a unique or eye-catching (hey, it‚Äôs no hot pink!). Anyone else check these out yet?

I suppose my feelings are much like they were with Warm &amp; Cozy from last week ‚Äî I‚Äôd loved to have seen new and different neutrals. I also wish Showstopper would go into retirement for at least a few years! Of the four, my favorite was All Races, and I do think that one is the most worth picking up, because it‚Äôs not a shade I‚Äôve seen by MAC at all (no immediate dupes came to mind). Eyeshadows ($14.50 U.S. / $16.50 CDN) All Races is a cool-toned lilac with a little gray edge. It has a matte finish, and it is a creamy, silky matte‚Äìno chalky texture here. I can‚Äôt remember seeing a shade like this by MAC. Maybe once or twice, but nothing I can remember at the moment! Banshee is a dirty pink with a little brown to it ‚Äî it has a silver glitter that makes it a little chunky. It has a lustre finish, which definitely accounts for the glittery feel. I imagine you may have some issues with fall out with this shade. Cross-Cultural is a medium-dark chocolate brown with a matte finish. This is definitely a shade you could use to contour your eye space with; it has a nearly neutral finish, not being too cool nor warm. I‚Äôd say this is similar to maybe Era/Texture or a lighter version of Espresso. Showstopper is an ultra dark charcoal brown with a cool feel to it. This is a shade that‚Äôs not permanent yet it comes out often enough that it never feels like you need to stock up. This also has a matte finish to it. This is similar to Mystery/Brun.

All information straight from MAC HQ. Q&amp;A with Mickey Contractor Mickey, how long have you been working with M¬∑A¬∑C? It‚Äüs been 32 years since I started working as a makeup artist and this is my 6th year with M¬∑A¬∑C. I‚Äôve collaborated with the brand since they launched in India. M¬∑A¬∑C wanted to work alongside a makeup artist with credibility, experience, the ability to inspire who was also an authority of goodwill in the industry. So when they came to me and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like you to collaborate with us, we‚Äôre opening a store in Bombay‚Äù: I thought, ‚ÄúThis is a Godsend for me‚Äù. Working with M¬∑A¬∑C was an opportunity to really convey my vision. They have such incredible authority and influence in the industry and becoming a part of that was incredibly exciting to me. Had you already been using M¬∑A¬∑C products? Yes, I‚Äüd been using M¬∑A¬∑C for years. I first discovered M¬∑A¬∑C when I was in Canada about 15 years ago where I bought Twig, Malt and Marrakech lipsticks. Those kinds of shades just weren‚Äôt available in India. In fact, so little makeup was available in India back then! I‚Äôve been a huge fan ever since. What‚Äôs your beauty philosophy? For me, beauty is about a natural-looking woman who wears makeup, but wears it so cleverly that it doesn‚Äüt actually show. She‚Äüs also somebody who carries herself with a lot of confidence, not just someone who‚Äüs pretty, but who also has a lot of character. For me‚Ä¶that defines beauty. See lots more Q&amp;A with Mickey, as well as product development! Who have been your creative influences throughout your makeup artistry career? I began my makeup career thanks to Indian Bollywood star and Sixties Item girl, Helen. I also used to look at Linda Evangelista‚Äôs pictures in the Seventies and Eighties and be utterly inspired by her beauty. Linda, Christy Turlington, Paulina Poritzcova- they were the models who really inspired us because all we really got to see were advertising campaigns in the very few foreign magazines that were available to us. You‚Äôre known as the Master of Modern Bollywood. How has Bollywood changed since you started working in it? In terms of makeup, by the Nineties I had managed to influence Bollywood a lot. My whole idea was to try and minimize the old Bollywood way of makeup as much as possible ‚Äì we used to be into panstick and pancake makeup, which looked really thick. I wanted it to look more modern, more real, more today, closer to what Hollywood does‚Ä¶because it makes it more believable. That was my contribution to this culture. I was doing a lot of movies at this time, so when people saw the makeup they realized what I was talking about and they all started to copy it. A lot of actresses would send their own personal makeup artists to see what I was doing and make them watch me. Most of the A-grade actresses were taking a lot of tips from me, asking what colour foundation they should be using, what kind of look they should go with, etc. You‚Äôve said that the ‚Äòno makeup‚Äô look requires more effort than a full-on makeup look‚Ä¶ how come? The ‚Äúno makeup‚Äù look in India is about using everything you need to use but making it look like nothing! That‚Äôs the reason it‚Äôs so much more difficult, because your blending has to be perfect, the contouring need to be perfect, you‚Äüve got to be able make an exact match to the colour of the skin tone‚Ä¶it‚Äüs very, very difficult. But the products and tools in this collection all work together to make achieving this look so much easier. What have been your biggest creative challenges? It‚Äüs taken me almost 20 years to take the Bollywood makeup ‚Äúdown‚Äù to what it is today. I‚Äôve been saying ‚Äúcut down on the makeup, cut down on the makeup‚Äù for many many years. Yet there are not a lot of women who are willing to change their makeup very quickly because it‚Äôs something they‚Äôve been doing the same way for years. Since M¬∑A¬∑C brought me into the picture it was much easier, though, because I had many more products to play with, and of course M¬∑A¬∑C is an authority in the industry. As a Director of Artistry for M¬∑A¬∑C, people took me even more seriously. You‚Äôve already worked with M¬∑A¬∑C on product development in the past haven‚Äôt you? Yes, three years ago I created a few foundation shades for the Middle East and India, because so many people wanted to use M¬∑A¬∑C foundations yet felt that they couldn‚Äôt find the exact shade and tone they needed. They didn‚Äôt have enough yellow undertones in them, which caused them to appear grey on Indian skins. The foundations did so well that M¬∑A¬∑C realized that it was the right time to do a whole collection and expand on this. What was your inspiration for this collection? My USP is skin. I am one of those makeup artists who focuses a lot more on the complexion and contouring rather than just colour, so I wanted to split the collection into two parts: ‚ÄúFace‚Äù for creating the perfect skin and ‚ÄúColour‚Äù to add definition. The inspiration for this collection really came from what I felt Indian women needed. Pigmentation and discoloration problems around the mouth and under the eyes is something that most people in India have a problem with, so creating the concealers was really important to me. They really work to address these issues on any olive-based complexions and outside of India they‚Äôll also work beautifully on Hispanic, Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern skins, which can also have similar issues with pigmentation. Because creating beautiful skin is always my priority as a makeup artist, I wanted to focus on that, as well as developing the best colours to accentuate it with. Tell me a bit about the Face range‚Ä¶ I do a lot of in-store appearances, whether that means promoting Viva Glam on World Aids Day or doing one-on-one appointments with the customers. When I meet these women and identify their needs, what it comes down to is that they all want the perfect shade of concealer. So, I created four new shades of Select Moisturecover Concealer that really are perfect for Indian women‚Äôs skin tones and anyone with an olive-based complexion. Select Moisturecover is by far my favorite concealer formula in the range. It‚Äôs texture works on all skins, even on more mature skins and really doesn‚Äôt cake up under the eyes. The double-ended colour corrective concealer looks amazing. How did you come up with this idea? This product is ideal for taking a concealer or foundation you already have to almost the exact shade for your skin. If it‚Äüs too dark you mix some of the yellow in to make it lighter. For whiter skins the yellow also works beautifully to counteract the slight greyness or blueness that Western skin tones have. If it‚Äüs too light you just add a couple of dots of the coral to it to make it darker, and the orangey tones neutralize the dark brown or red undertones that Indian skin often has. You can dab them on as colour correctors and then wear your usual concealer over it. How about the Colour range? How does this reflect your signature style? I love using browns and earthy tones on the eyes, so I have designed an eyeshadow quad of my perfect neutral colours. I took existing shades of Folie brown and Carbon black, to which I‚Äôve added two new shades, Viva (which means ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù ‚Äì it was great to give the products Indian names), a new golden-y coppery brown, and Jaan (which means ‚Äúmy life‚Äù). The name of the quad ‚Äì Athma ‚Äì means ‚Äúsoul‚Äù because the colours in it really reflect the look that I am known for. I‚Äôd say it pretty much defines the makeup that I do in terms of colour. The lip products are gorgeous and so wearable‚Ä¶ I always prefer to give attention to one feature, and my signature look is really a smoky eye with a mouth that‚Äôs really simple and neutral. You can use the lipstick with the gloss, or just one or the other to play around with getting the texture you want, but still have beautiful natural colour. Of the lipsticks, Yash (which means ‚Äúfame‚Äù) is an almost nude-beige-brown and Mehr (which means ‚Äúgrace‚Äù, also my wife‚Äôs name) is a pink-nude. Any brown tones read as nude on Indian skin, which on white skin will actually read as a stronger colour, but these shades look beautiful on both skin tones. The four single eye shadows are gorgeously strong shades. In particular, the bright pink is really striking. What led you to this vibrant colour? Yes, they are. For example, in India a bright pink is known as Rani pink ‚Äì Maharani‚Äôs in Rajasthan used to use a lot of strong bright pinks in their outfits, so I created the strong fuchsia eye shadow, Rani, to reflect this. It looks a lot hotter in the palette than it does on your skin ‚Äì you can wear it as a light wash if you‚Äôre delicate when applying it. The two Fluidlines are very vibrant and unusual too? What inspired these? The Fluidlines came about because on the last few films I‚Äôve worked on I‚Äôve been using a lot more colour. I reached a point where I thought that just gold and black would be boring so let‚Äôs use a little bit of colour! To create shades like this bright turquoise and green I previously had to use an eye pencil and then put a powder shadow over it. Since everyone was coming to me asking how to recreate them, I thought ‚Äúwhy not make it so they can have it in one pot and just paint it on?‚Äù So, from neutrals in the quad to the brighter single colours, there‚Äôs something for everyone, then? Yes, between the quad and the singles you get the full spectrum of choice ‚Äì a little bit of colour and some neutrals, some matte and some frost. Of course there are so many wonderful colours in the existing line up, but I created what I felt were some of the M¬∑A¬∑C colours that were missing in my kit. What was important to you in terms of texture? I like shadows with a little more pigment in them so that they have a very smooth application with great longevity and strength of colour. The single eye shadows have more of a pearl undertone to them ‚Äì Indian women do love to wear shine and frost. I really love the formulas that we‚Äôve got to now. There was a lot of back and forth with the labs to get them exactly right, but they‚Äôre really amazing now! How do you cope with the challenge of working in the excessive heat in India? It must be hard on you‚Ä¶and the makeup! It‚Äüs a huge challenge to work in the heat. For years the majority of film studios in India weren‚Äôt air-conditioned, and even some today. If you were working outdoors, it was sometimes a nightmare as you could be working in conditions that would dry the skin and also melt the makeup. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so happy with the textures we created in this collection as they really do stand up to the heat with great staying-power and don‚Äôt look heavy on the skin. Is having the opportunity to create your own line of products your dream? Of course I think it should be every makeup artists dream to create their own line of products. Will these products work on everyone, not only Indian skin tones? Absolutely. These colours will work on almost everyone, not just Indian women, but particularly Hispanic, darker Mediterranean and Middle Eastern skin tones, too. Of course you can play with the shades and use them differently whether you‚Äüre a makeup artist or a customer, but everyone will love them I‚Äôm sure! What are your star products in the collection? The Select Moisturecover double-ended corrector is my star product. In terms of the colour, the Athma eye shadow quad is something I‚Äôll use all the time, and I also really love the Lipglasses. I‚Äôve finished almost all the final product testers that I have ‚Äì especially the lipsticks and Lipglasses, which I‚Äüm using on a daily basis. I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the products that M¬∑A¬∑C has created for me. They‚Äôre all perfect. INDIAN MAKEUP‚ÄôS IMPECCABLE NEW MAKEOVER‚Ä¶ Living up to its credo of ‚ÄúAll Ages, All Races, All Sexes‚Äù: M¬∑A¬∑C introduces the ‚ÄúMickey Contractor‚Äù collection. A stunning array of foundations and concealers in shades perfectly calibrated for Indian and Middle Eastern skin tones, and a host of colour products specifically designed to create looks ranging from super natural to vibrantly flattering on such olive and golden complexions. An award-winning Indian makeup artist, Mickey Contractor has spent the last twenty years bringing Bollywood beauty toward modern aesthetic ideas. ‚ÄúMy whole idea was to try and minimize the old Bollywood style of makeup as much as possible ‚Äì it used to be all about thick panstick and pancake,‚Äù explains Mickey. ‚ÄúI wanted it to look more modern, more real, and more today. Closer to what Hollywood does‚Ä¶it makes it more believable,‚Äù he enthuses. A pretty almighty task, considering that this pioneering attitude was unheard of in India at the time (back in the 80s), where neither current products nor modern inspirations were easily available. The lusciously nude lip that Mickey was championing (thanks to his discovering M¬∑A¬∑C Lipsticks in Twig and Malt on a trip to Canada) hadn‚Äôt been an option in India before. And the glossy ad campaigns that fueled his vision ‚Äì Linda Evangelista and her supermodel friends, representing a whole new type of more natural glamazon ‚Äì were yet to impress upon beauty trends in the Indian subcontinent‚Ä¶ Little wonder, then, that it took Mickey almost two decades to get Indian women‚Äüs makeup pared down to what it is today. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd been saying ‚Äúcut down on the makeup, cut down on the makeup‚Äù for God knows how many years, but there are not many women who are willing to change their makeup overnight,‚Äù he reflects. Still, the way he made Bollywood beauty icons such as Kajol, Rani Mukherjee, Aishwarya Rai, Tabu, Preity Zinta and Sushmita Sen look, spoke for itself. Soon A-list actresses by the dozen were sending their personal makeup artists to Mickey to pick up his tricks, and grilling Mickey for tips as he worked with them on set, ‚Äúasking what colour of foundation they should be using, what type of look they should go with,‚Äù explains Mickey. An Indian beauty revolution had begun‚Ä¶ Suffice it to say, Mickey is one of the industry‚Äôs true visionaries. He has transformed the makeup of Indian film stars and celebrities, becoming the barometer of beauty trends in India, on and off the catwalk. Little wonder, then, that he became M¬∑A¬∑C‚Äôs Director of Artistry, India, six years ago. For a brand who always has their eye on supporting artistry and consistently work alongside the industry‚Äüs mavericks and movers, M¬∑A¬∑C and Mickey are a perfect match: both are industry insiders, authorities, influencers and loved by celebrities. So as M¬∑A¬∑C launched into the Indian market they naturally wanted to work alongside the best in the Indian makeup business‚Ä¶and who more knowledgeable, influential and talented than Mickey? For Mickey, of course, ‚Äúit made my mission to make Indian makeup more natural so much easier,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI had so many more products to play with, and of course, as the Director of Makeup Artistry for M¬∑A¬∑C they took me even more seriously.‚Äù Back to the makeup collection, it‚Äôs the first time that M¬∑A¬∑C has created a tribute collection to a makeup artist. ‚ÄúMickey is the first makeup artist that we‚Äôre collaborating with on a collection because we really have such respect for him as being the master of this market,‚Äù says Nicole Masson and Nick Gavrelis, M¬∑A¬∑C‚Äôs Vice Presidents of Global Product Development. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs touched so many women, men and makeup artists not just throughout the Middle East but globally, too,‚Äù adds Nick. ‚ÄúThis collection pays credit to one of Bollywood‚Äôs greats. Mickey‚Äüs talent and accomplishments need to be celebrated, and, most importantly, his philosophy and approach to skin, beauty and makeup application are such that they need to be shared with the world.‚Äù And what better way than with a signature makeup collection that truly reflects Mickey‚Äôs signature beauty aesthetic? ‚ÄúFor me, beauty is about a natural-looking woman who wears makeup, but wears it so cleverly that it doesn‚Äôt actually show,‚Äù explains Mickey. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs also somebody who carries herself with a lot of confidence. She‚Äôs not just someone who‚Äôs pretty; she also has a lot of character.‚Äù All of which goes to explain why M¬∑A¬∑C and Mickey Contractor is a collection of two parts: ‚ÄúFace‚Äù (to create that perfectly light-handed, luminous complexion) and ‚ÄúColour‚Äù for the jolt of confidence and uniqueness he‚Äüs talking about. ‚ÄúMy USP is skin,‚Äù states Mickey. ‚ÄúI am one of those makeup artists who focus much more on the complexion and contouring rather than just colour.‚Äù Indeed, it wasn‚Äôt long into Mickey‚Äüs career at M¬∑A¬∑C that he first teamed up with the Product Development team three years ago, creating four foundation shades for the Middle East and India. ‚ÄúSo many people wanted to use M¬∑A¬∑C foundations who felt that they couldn‚Äüt find the exact shade and tone they needed,‚Äù says Mickey. ‚ÄúFor foundations to work on Indian skin they need to have enough yellow undertones so as not to appear grey and dull.‚Äù Which leads us into the Face part of Mickey‚Äôs collection, simply inspired by what Mickey felt ‚ÄúIndian women really needed.‚Äù ‚ÄúSeeing that pigmentation and discolouration problems around the mouth and under the eyes are something that almost every other person in India has a problem with, creating the Face category was really important to me,‚Äù he explains. Especially the unique Double-Ended Colour Corrector, featuring a banana yellow and an off-coral that take the guesswork out of customizing your existing concealer or foundation to the perfect shade. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs too dark, you mix the yellow in to make it lighter, which also works beautifully to counteract the slight greyness of blueness that Western skin tones have. If it‚Äüs too light you just add a couple of dots of the coral to it to make it darker, while the orangey tones neutralize the dark brown or red undertones that Indian skin often has,‚Äù directs Mickey. Flawlessly glowing skin in place, the star product of the Colour collection, has to be an eye shadow quad that perfects Mickey‚Äôs classicly soft smoky eye. ‚ÄúI love using browns and earthy tones, so I‚Äüve called this quad Athma, which means ‚Äúsoul‚Äù, since it‚Äôs the look I‚Äôm most known for‚Äù he explains. Paired with one of the opaque nude pink lipsticks (Yash and Mehr) or Lipglasses (Flesh and Lust) and you‚Äüve got what Mickey describes as ‚Äúthe ‚Äòno makeup‚Äô look in India‚Ä¶which is about using everything you need to use but making it look like nothing!‚Äù he laughs. He makes it sound easy, and maybe it now is, but that‚Äüs only thanks to Mickey being an absolute perfectionist when it came to getting the shades and formulations for these products absolutely correct. ‚ÄúMickey is a pro, he‚Äôs using the products and he knows the precise details of them, so it wasn‚Äôt so much a challenge as a great opportunity to get the colours exactly right,‚Äù recalls Nicole. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking undertones, overtones, level of pearl, level of coverage‚Ä¶not just to get the shade close to what he wanted but absolutely exactly what he wanted.‚Äù High pigment levels and super smooth application topped Mickey‚Äüs wish list, and his specificity certainly paid off. The formulas, finish and lasting power of this collection are second to none. Two electrifying turquoise and green Fluidlines are anything but low key. Worn like a striking yet simple accessory on the eye, they were a case of Mickey creating one of those products his kit was missing. ‚ÄúTo create shades like these, I was having to use an eye pencil and then put a powder shadow over it. Since everyone was coming to me asking how to recreate them I thought ‚Äúwhy not make it so they can have it in one pot and just paint it on?!‚Äù Well, exactly. There are also single eye shadows that pick up on Indian women‚Äüs love of frost, in four deeply pigmented shades wonderfully reminiscent of Indian silks. Take Rani, a bright fuchsia with a soft pink pearl, inspired by intense pink favoured by Maharani‚Äüs in Rajasthan. ‚ÄúIt looks a lot hotter in the palette than it does on your skin ‚Äì you can wear it as a light wash if you‚Äüre delicate when applying it with your fingers‚Äù suggests Mickey. So, there you have it: M¬∑A¬∑C and Mickey Contractor. A little bit of the brights of Bollywood, a lot of the natural glamour of Hollywood, and definitely something that will fit in every woman‚Äüs makeup bag today. All Ages, All Races, All Sexes, indeed. Mickey Contractor: Director of Makeup Artistry ‚Äì India He‚Äôs a makeup artist who turns heads when he walks down a Bombay street, a talent who literally changed the face of Bollywood and he‚Äôs M¬∑A¬∑C Director of Artistry, India. He‚Äôs Mickey Contractor whose career started in an extraordinary way ‚Äì by meeting a muse. As a young lad what came first were the movies. Watching films from age 10, he became transfixed by an actress whose onscreen persona was both cabaret dancer and vamp. At age 10 he may not have known the culture behind the looks, but he knew what fascination felt like. With eyes that flashed, hair that piled high above her head, feathers that rose cockade-like above her head, she was ‚Äúawe-inspiring.‚Äù Her name was Helen Richardson Khan, Bollywood‚Äôs legendary ‚ÄúHelen.‚Äù Unlike traditional Bollywood queens, she was trendy. Of exotic mixed heritage, she found her inspiration in English glossies, and took to mimicking the trends of the ‚Äô60s and ‚Äô70s. The sexy eye liner flicks, the loose bouffant, the sense of sex and liberation. Young Mickey was drawn in. Something about the hairdo and the feather must have stuck, for upon leaving school Mickey went to work in a hairdressing salon. Amid the perms and updos of Bombay‚Äôs stylish, there was one customer in particular who he was thrilled to work on, Helen. One day, shampooing her hair, she asked him what he wanted to do with his life and suggested that he learn makeup. Giving him some insider advice, she told him to go and assist a Bollywood makeup artist. Mickey was hardly going to ignore his beloved muse. With no formal schools in makeup art in Bombay, apprenticing was the way to go. Unlike Western culture, makeup artistry in India was at that time a family profession and techniques were passed down father to son like family secrets. Because of this laissez-faire, no trends were created. Mickey, on the other hand, had no family connections and was an outsider. Finding a makeup artist willing to take him on, he was taught the basics in foundation. Assisting for eight months, he began to create his own tricks; after all, he had no family secrets to be the keeper of, he was free to ad lib ‚Äì and he did. His techniques became savvy and he started to develop a reputation. Stepping out, he initially worked the provincial film studios, working on C-list movies ‚Äì learning but financially barely scraping by. His kit was a mishmash of local brands of makeup and a few brushes he had bought from an art store. He was also inadvertently networking. The faces he made up in the provinces were also cast in Bollywood. Eventually he was asked to be the makeup artist for a trio of actresses. This was getting closer to his mission, but he was learning something about Bollywood, too ‚Äì makeup artists weren‚Äôt esteemed. The combination of low pay and shabby treatment made Mickey react. A rebel with a cause, he quit and went to work in commercial advertising. There he earned more, and was allowed a different kind of creativity, one that was more receptive to trends. Finally, he had the freedom to create and develop his look. Dipping into six-month-old fashion magazines, he would look, see and reinterpret in his own style. As his reputation grew, Bollywood‚Äôs interest in him returned. Wooed by director Rahul Rawail, Mickey dug his heels in and made unheard of contractual demands. Despite himself, he got the job. But there was no shrinking back to the status quo. When the director screamed, he screamed back. He began to get a reputation. But if his screaming was loud, his work spoke louder. Juggling Bollywood and commercial work, he attained an unheard of celebrity status in Bollywood and around Bombay: he became a makeup superstar. Movies meant location work and one year he found himself in Canada shooting a Bollywood film in the Rockies. On the way home he popped into a makeup store in a shopping mall in Vancouver ‚Äì M¬∑A¬∑C! Struck by the colours, he picked up something he never thought he could find; perfect nude lipsticks ‚Äì M¬∑A¬∑C favourites Malt, Twig, and to this spontaneously added a deep burgundy Diva. Back home he experimented and got hooked. This was just the start. As his reputation grew and his fees increased, he built his M¬∑A¬∑C collection. With no source in India, he would pick it up here and there. In London he would buy a Cork Lip Pencil‚Ä¶Then next port of call he would dip into the browns, rusts, and coppers he would find in the eye shadow collection. He built his collection on one inspiration: the colour spectrum of the Indian complexion. As his status rose, he began to influence a whole new generation of Bollywood makeup artists ‚Äì and his fame outside the country was growing, too. Scouted by M¬∑A¬∑C for their first store in Bombay, Mickey had no hesitation. He still does Bollywood and commercial work, but his work with M¬∑A¬∑C is a passion. Between M¬∑A¬∑C Master Classes round the world, in-store appearances, new store openings (after Bombay, there was Bangalore), Bollywood and its Award Ceremonies, and Delhi Fashion Week, he has little time for much else. His inspiration comes from the West‚Ä¶from the backstages of London, Paris, Milan, New York, and from the glossies, and where he needs to, he tempers them for the Indian taste and skin. As he says, ‚ÄúIn India ‚Äì unlike Paris ‚Äì you don‚Äôt do looks that are so nude you look like you just got out of bed.‚Äù He may not realize it, but when he takes a trend, and modifies it, ever so slightly for the Indian market, he‚Äôs echoing his muse, Helen who in the ‚Äô70s looked at a photo in Vogue and copied it in her own way‚Ä¶And as for those art brushes, with which he learned the art of the liner, yes, he still has them ‚Äì but only as keepsakes. Q&amp;A with Nick Gavrelis and Nicole Masson, MAC Vice Presidents of Global Product Development Firstly please can you tell me about your role at M¬∑A¬∑C and how you work on collaborations? Nicole : Nick and I are counterparts within the two different areas of M¬∑A¬∑C. Nick is the Vice President of Global Product Development for face, skincare and Pro products, and I‚Äôm the Vice President of Global Product Development of all M¬∑A¬∑C ‚Äôs colour products. Do you collaborate directly with the makeup artist, or does the process have to go through multiple people? Nick : The risk of it going through too many people is a dilution of integrity. It‚Äôs critical for us to have one-on-one face time with our collaborators and this is something we did constantly with Mickey in order to review submissions, in both the Colour and Face categories. Then we could decide how urgent is it that we tweak a colour and discuss if it is working, or do we need to go back and involve the chemist for a reform or rework? It can be a long process and Mickey did this very patiently with us! M¬∑A¬∑C constantly strives to stay ahead of the game in terms of keeping collaborations fresh. Why did you choose Mickey to be the first makeup artist for a tribute collection? Nicole : The reason we chose Mickey to be the first makeup artist that we‚Äôre collaborating with on a collection, is that we really have such respect for him as being the master of this market. Nick : He‚Äôs touched so many women and men and makeup artists, not just throughout the Middle East but globally, too. He‚Äôs inspired and mentored so many of our M¬∑A¬∑C Artists that we felt like we needed to pay credit to one of Bollywood‚Äôs greats who is such a true and generous friend to our brand. He‚Äôs family and his talent and accomplishments need to be celebrated. And, most importantly, his philosophy and approach to skin, beauty and makeup application are such that they need to be shared with the world. How was working with a makeup artist on a collection different than working with a fashion designer? Nicole : We do work with makeup artists when we work with designers also, but this is the first time that a makeup artist has put his name to a M¬∑A¬∑C tribute collection. When you‚Äôre working with a designer, they have overall conceptual ideas ‚Äì they like the feel of something, they imagine how it makes them feel when they use the product and how it relates back to the artisan quality of their own clothing. However, Mickey is a makeup pro, he‚Äôs using the product and he knows every detail of it, so it wasn‚Äôt so much a challenge as a great opportunity to get the colours exactly right. We‚Äôre talking undertones, overtones, level of pearl, level of coverage‚Ä¶not just to get the shade close to what he wanted but absolutely exactly what he wanted. How does it perform on all different skintones, does it perform exactly the way he wants it to and so on‚Ä¶ So it‚Äôs much more collaborative in the sense that the precise shades and textures of makeup were determined with Mickey? Nicole : Mickey speaks our language in terms of cosmetics. Designers say ‚Äòtake this pink I imagined in my dream and make it!‚Äô Whereas Mickey would say ‚ÄòI need this pink to do x, y and z. I need it to have a slightly rosier undertone on this type of skin tone, or a yellow tone‚Äô, or ‚ÄòI need it to be true and clean‚Äô or to ‚Äòflash‚Äô in a certain way. He was very precise, which made it easier to work with him. You can do the best work when you get the best instruction and Mickey was always 100% clear with us. It‚Äôs interesting that the collection is split into two parts, Face and Colour. Why is this? Nick : The DNA of Mickey‚Äôs work begins with skin. He works in very thin, very carefully applied layers to create a completely flawless skin that will stand up to the harsh environment and the hours that many of these Indian actors and actresses have to deal with. The trickle down benefit for real women is that the products in this collection perform incredibly. They look beautiful and are appropriate not just for Indian and Middle Eastern skin tones, but for anyone that may not have found the shade in the existing M¬∑A¬∑C line up that they want. These shades are special, and have application for absolutely anyone. I understand that the new double-ended colour corrector is a product ‚Äòfirst‚Äô and an important and exciting development in this collection. How do they work? Nick : Yes, the double-ended concealer is a new concept of colour corrector, containing both a pale yellow and burnt coral corrector. It‚Äôs the fundamental product that Mickey uses on just about every woman he works with. He‚Äôll use it as a colour corrector before he conceals, or will mix it into concealer or foundation to tone and create an exact, beautiful, natural, vibrant colour. In some cases he‚Äôll even mix it over foundation or concealer. These correctors have a slightly deeper pigment load than our regular Select Moisture Cover Concealer formulation. It will allow you to blend it into an existing concealer or foundation shade to tone it, so that it becomes even more perfectly suited for your skin or the lighting conditions that you‚Äôre entering into. We believe that this double-ended concealer will be the star product of the Face portion of the collection. And yes, we are definitely exploring the notion of these double-ended correctors for all shades of skin! There are also some new shades of Studio Moisture Cover Concealer in the collection ‚Äì how are these special? Nick : The four concealer shades, as well as the correctors, are designed to brighten and flatter the skin ‚Äì as if you‚Äôve had an extra night of sleep! They are specifically designed for those Mediterranean, Indian and Middle Eastern skins that tend to have a little bit of grey in them because it‚Äôs golden and olive undertones can easily look ashy and dull. So, the warmth of these shades is designed to be extremely uplifting. For example, when you look at the existing global line up, there‚Äôs a big shade gap between NC20 and NC30 concealers. Mickey has created the perfect shade that‚Äôs a step above NC20 but has a beautiful golden, slightly peachy nuance that happens to take the grey out and brighten under the eye. Did you feel that M¬∑A¬∑C needed more products to specifically cater to the Indian and Middle Eastern market? Nick : We worked with Mickey a few years ago on our foundation and concealer extensions. Since then a new need has come out for more textures and shades ‚Äì Select Moisturecover gives a thinner concealer feel that deals with the dehydration factor of very dry, arid climates or very drying, humid climates. Mickey was incredible at helping us with this because he is so knowledgeable about proper shade nuances and proper texture choices in foundation and concealer. Did you have to create new formulas for this collection to fulfill how Mickey wanted the products to feel, look and perform? Nick : As far as altering the formula of the Face products, we didn‚Äôt. We‚Äôre repromoting 3 shade extensions of Studio Fix fluid that were created specifically for this market. Then there‚Äôs the Prep and Prime Transparent Finishing Powder, which is a staple for Mickey. He uses this product not only to set foundation as he works in these very thin layers to create a beautifully textured skin, but also to strategically control oil. We worked with 3 existing brushes ‚Äì Mickey is so passionate about artistry tools and these are his selects from the existing portfolio. Nicole : Luckily for us, Mickey was already extremely satisfied with the texture and performance of M¬∑A¬∑C ‚Äôs colour products and he specifically requested certain textures that we already had to be part of this collection. So, for the lipsticks he wanted a fuller coverage, such as the matte Amplified Lipsticks, and for the Lipglass he wanted a creamy fuller coverage rather than a sheer or sparkly formulation. So again, in terms of textures we were able to work within our existing formulas. So, have you had shades like these in the Colour collection offered before at M¬∑A¬∑C? Nicole : We have had shades like these appear before within our colour collection, but never before have we put it together into one complete collection that people with these skin tones can use every single product. We wanted to focus on exclusive shades that were hand selected by Mickey. That‚Äôs why we haven‚Äôt included basics, like brow pencils and mascaras, since they‚Äôre available in the existing line up. What do you love most about the collection? Nicole : What I love about the collection is that half of the colour products are very neutral ‚Äì the lipsticks, the Lipglass, the Blushcreme, the eye quad, are all neutrals. But they‚Äôre slightly darker than what you might consider ‚Äòneutral‚Äô shades in a Western makeup kit. It‚Äôs a base look that any woman of colour could wear. It‚Äôs for everyone from a sun-kissed complexion to the darkest skin tone, no matter where they‚Äôre from or what their undertones are. Then you have the single shadows, all of which are deep, intense, vibrant, jewel-tone shades that are meant to be layered on. The purple and the red are more contrasting, while the saffron and the forest green blend beautifully into the skin. I also love that you could do anything you want with this collection, whether it is a nude eye with a bold lip or a smoky eye with a subtle lip!

Sample Reviews Mar 02, 2010 March 02, 2010 MAC Give Me Liberty of London: The Sneak Peek Begins! With unveiling parties happening across the country tonight, I thought I‚Äôd share a little sneak peek of the MAC Liberty of London Collection that will release, officially, in-stores on March 11th. Today, I‚Äôll share with you photos, swatches, and reviews of the products I‚Äôve been able to try so far. Please keep in mind that I am missing a few pieces ( Give Me Liberty of London Eyeshadow; Peachstock Lipstick; and Frankly Fresh &amp; A Different Groove Lipglasses ) and will have photos, swatches, and reviews of those items on the in-store launch date. First, before we get to the good stuff, I thought I‚Äôd share some fun facts and insights on how the collection came to be. The MAC Give Me Liberty of London design is based on William Morris‚Äô Strawberry Thief print, which dates back to 1883. Because MAC wanted exclusivity, Liberty reworked the original print while MAC collaborated on colours and design to modernize it. On the packaging, James Gager, Senior Vice President and Creative Director for MAC Cosmetics, says, ‚Äú I‚Äôm particularly proud of the packaging‚Ä¶ White [packaging] speaks to a reawakening of everyone‚Äôs sensibilities for spring. [It] has a remarkably fresh, springy look to it. Even if you don‚Äôt know what Liberty is, you want to own these pieces because they are so unique and special. It‚Äôs evident that something original has taken place here in terms of the collaboration. ‚Äù On the promotional imagery , Gager says, ‚Äú The inspiration was all Liberty and all London. ‚Äù Miles Aldridge, photographer, shot the visuals in London, with Charlotte Tilbury, makeup artist, created the look. (Both Aldridge and Tilbury are English!) Gager goes on to say, ‚Äú The idea was to capture the spirit of the famous Brit wit, bohemian chic girl. Katy England, another famous Brit, styled the shoot. She also designed the outfit worn by the model, using many Liberty prints and turning them into an over-the-top ruffled dress. With the MAC Give Me Liberty of London collection, we aspired to capture the spirit of this dreadfully chic, cool English girl, sitting on a chair, decked out in all the British regalia. She‚Äôs a Liberty freak and a MAC addict; she can‚Äôt get enough of either brand. ‚Äù Give Me Liberty of London launches March 11th, 2010 at all North American MAC locations, 1.800.588.0070, and www.maccosmetics.com ( expect online to put it up a day or two earlier, though! ). The collection will launch April 2010 for international MAC locations.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2010-03-02 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>982f0070fb489dd354b5bb1753e1b11bc4750222</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Hourglass Scarlet Aura Sheer Lip Stain</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tag/hourglass-aura-sheer-lip-stain/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Hourglass Scarlet Aura Sheer Lip Stain Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 17, 2011 March 17, 2011 Hourglass Scarlet Aura Lip Stain Lasting Lip Stain with Hourglass Hourglass Scarlet Aura Sheer Lip Stain ($26.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúsoft plum.‚Äù The new Aura Sheer Lip Stain is a water-based lip stain that‚Äôs designed to create a sheer wash of color with a semi-matte finish. Scarlet is the darkest of the three shades launched. Over my natural lip color, it‚Äôs a deep, plummy, berry. It‚Äôs semi-opaque and has just a touch of sheen but it is mostly matte. If you haven‚Äôt tried one before, lip stains require prep work‚Äìbecause they adhere to your lips, much of your natural lip is ‚Äúexposed.‚Äù There is no gloss or creamy lipstick to hide behind, so any imperfections from your natural lips may show through with a lip stain. Scarlet is dark enough where it is a more forgiving lip stain, but drier lips will find this accentuates dryness, cracking, and peeling. I always exfoliate and then pat clear balm on my lips approximately 30 minutes prior to applying a lip stain. I tend to do this after my morning shower, and then I apply the stain after breakfast. It‚Äôs loaded with color but not much else, so it isn‚Äôt going to provide long-lasting moisturization, which is why I like to prep with balm beforehand. It does take well to layering balm on top, though, so clear balm can be used to proivde moisture without disturbing the color. I love the concept of lip stains but find it difficult to wear them, because they often apply unevenly. Hourglass applies beautifully‚Äìthe color deposits well without settling into lip lines and has enough glide that it is easy to evenly distribute. It also lasts for hours and hours and does make it through drinking and eating. I get around eight hours of continuous wear‚Äìby ten, there is a little fading.

It‚Äôs described as ‚Äúa purplish dark brown.‚Äù I almost re-took the photos for this polish, because on my desk, it looked rather brownish when I peeked at it from the corner of my eye, but upon closer inspection, it does have this purpled murkiness. It looks like muddied eggplant purple in the bottle, but on nails, it‚Äôs much more sophisticated than that. The subtle red undertones seemed to pull out quite a bit for me, despite my warmer skin tone, but it gave it a brightened quality that added interest. It‚Äôs a smoky, blackened eggplant with a little red, little brown. my thoughts on the formula: These are richly pigmented lacquers that have nuances in both the color and finishes. Each color is well-thought out, and I‚Äôve yet to come across a poor performer in the brand‚Äôs color range. I used two coats for opaque coverage.

Years ago, after traveling to Japan, Fran√ßois brought back a small, porcelain pot with a red film of color‚Äì Kabuki makeup for the lips. Debuting this holiday season after years of development is the NARS Bento Box Set ‚Äì a limited edition set of two Kabuki cups that were hand-poured with a new exclusive-to-NARS lipstick formula in highly pigmented shades containing Vitamin E. Housed in a handmade bento box, the set also comes with a Kabuki lip brush, designed for precise application by dipping the brush into the cup and blending until desired coverage is achieved. Fusing two inspirations together, Fran√ßois chose Daphne Guinness to once again be the face of NARS with her evocative portrayal of classic theatrical Kabuki makeup. Only one thousand sets were created for sale in the United States and will retail for $125, and just over two thousand in total were created worldwide.

From her portion of the Makeup Art Cosmetics Collection MAC Makeup Art Cosmetics Collection comes two Reflects Glitters (Copper and Rust), two Glitters (Gold and Fuchsia), four pigments (Cocomotion, Brash &amp; Bold, Heritage Rouge, and Push the Edge), as well as Gloss Texture in Clear. Pigment ($19.50) Brash &amp; Bold is a velvety, deep fuchsia-red with subtle fuchsia-purple sheen. If Bright Fuchsia and Pink Pearl pigment had a baby, this would be it. Heritage Rouge is a dark, cranberry-burgundy frost. It‚Äôs incredibly pigmented and goes on smooth. It‚Äôs one of the best pigment textures to date. This was a previously released shade, so be sure to check your stash to make sure you don‚Äôt already have one. Push the Edge is a deep blue-based violet purple with soft shimmer/sheen. It reminded me a lot of Entremauve pigment but bluer, not quite as plum. The textures are even similar, as this one is a bit chalky (though not terribly so). Cocomotion is a rich shade of antique gold with a bit more brightness than your typical antique gold. It‚Äôs one of my favorite shades of pigments (again, check your stash before buying), because it‚Äôs extremely smooth, rich in pigmentation, and is a dream to work with. Product : 9/10 Value : 9/10 Ease of Use : 8/10 Packaging : 8/10 Recommendation : I think both Brash &amp; Bold and Push the Edge pigments represent two shades we don‚Äôt often see MAC putting out. While neither is necessarily absolutely, positively original, they‚Äôre both pleasant surprises. Cocomotion and Heritage Rouge are also exceptional shades, and it‚Äôs good to see them make a return, at least for a limited time.

I‚Äôve long wanted to change the criteria within the rating system, and the time has come to do so. Though these have always been part of the review‚Äìjust not so transparently‚ÄìI‚Äôve decided on a new set of parameters to provide you better insight on where points are going (or getting lost) and really providing an overall score that is representative of the product. I also felt that it was time to make our system more distinct and truly ours as rating systems have gained popularity over time. The biggest change is in the removal of the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù metric, which I had always based a product‚Äôs price/quantity ratio compared against the average price/quantity ratio of similar products from comparable brands. From using value in the rating system for the past couple of years, I‚Äôve found that value is simply too subjective. Some are looking for quantity, others are looking at low final cost‚Äìeven if you get a metric ton of blush. One person may find a $10 eyeshadow is cheap, while another finds $15 outlandish. I will, of course, continue to talk about value and in particular, speak on products that really fall below or above, but it will be in the written review and not a component of the total score. Introducing: The Glossover ‚Äî The Rating System - Recommended We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below. Thanks! Sephora Amazon Ulta Nordstrom PRODUCT looks at whether the product does what it is supposed to do. If it‚Äôs a curling mascara, did it curl? If it‚Äôs waterproof, was it? PIGMENTATION looks at whether the product is as pigmented as it is supposed to be. Products that are supposed to be sheer will not get 0/10 because they are not pigmented‚ÄìI am looking for the level of pigmentation to be in sync with the product‚Äôs description. TEXTURE looks at whether the product has a good consistency for the type (e.g. you wouldn‚Äôt want a gritty cream blush, right?) and how it contributes to a better product. LONGEVITY looks at how well and long a product wears. If a product is supposed to last all day, does it? APPLICATION looks at how easy the product is to apply‚Äìdo you have to experiment with ten different eyeshadow bases to get the eyeshadow to pop? Is it difficult to blend? PACKAGING looks at functionality, sturdiness, and overall appeal. This is less about whether it‚Äôs pretty (as ‚Äúpretty‚Äù to me may be ugly to you!) and more about if it pumps out an appropriate amount, if it will withstand being tossed in a purse, and so forth. There is a total of 50 points available, and once actual points are totaled, a final letter grade is assessed, which you will find on the lower right corner of The Glossover . Directly to the right of each component of the rating system will be my final thoughts‚Äìjust as before‚Äìbut displayed in a more eye-catching format. The ‚Äúwhere to buy‚Äù component will now be listed above The Glossover, which is typically the end of the written review. We do recognize that there are some product categories (notably, hair care and skin care) that do not fit within this rating system, and we are still determining whether certain categories really require a rating system (like fragrance or skin care) and/or need their own rating system. Over the next few weeks, I will be moving through past reviews to bring those rating systems moved over to the new system. I expect only slight variations in grades‚Äìparticular for products that were either very below or above value‚Äìbut otherwise, the overall grades are getting clarified and refined. Updated @ 11:49AM PST : We tweaked font sizes and colors and hope that it has satisfied at least some of your concerns.

Glitter ($19.50) Gold is a shimmery, chunky gold glitter. It‚Äôs not a yellow-based gold, which is nice, and this looks particularly nice in the hair. Fuchsia is a sparkling medium-dark purple chunky glitter. This is always fun to mix into hair spray or the like. I find the normal glitters too chunky to look as stunning on the lips as Reflects do. Reflects Copper is a shimmery, glittering confection of orange copper. It is not eye-safe, so while it‚Äôs gorgeous to look at, I know there‚Äôs not much for me to do with it. Some things you can do with glitter that‚Äôs not eye-safe: mix with nail polish, mix with body lotion, mix with hair spray, and mix with lipgloss. Reflects Rust is a rusty shade of orange-red. It‚Äôs just as glimmering as Reflects Copper, and the glitter is incredibly fine, but again, not eye-safe, which is just a bummer. How do I use glitters if not on the eyes? You can mix in glitter with all sorts of products. I like the Reflects the most for mix-ins, just because it is a finer grade glitter. It‚Äôs particularly nice on lips and mixed with lotion/moisturizer and used on legs and shoulders. For the regular glitters, I think they look nice when spritzed into the hair or mixed with nail polish. Product : 9/10 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 6/10 Packaging : 8/10 Recommendation : As much as I adore the way Reflects glitters look and feel, I find myself rarely using them. All of the glitters are beautiful shades, though they are also permanent at PRO stores, so you don‚Äôt have to hurry if you‚Äôre on a budget. I also distinctly remember glitters being priced less than pigments, so I‚Äôm not sure why that changed.

Lipglass has a sticky/tacky texture and can be sheer to opaque, depending on the shade. Lip swatches will be posted tomorrow! üôÇ Lipglass ($14.00) On Display is a stunning deep burgundy-wine with gold shimmer. This one is absolutely stunning both swatched and on the lips. I haven‚Äôt been this pulled by a lip color by MAC in what feels like way too long. I like this one so much I‚Äôm considering a back up‚Ä¶ Personal Taste is a purply-rosy pink with golden shimmer. It‚Äôs semi-sheer, providing just a smidgen of color on the lips, but mostly just brightening up the natural lip color and adding shimmer. New Spirit is a light orange-y coral with soft golden shimmer. I was reminded of a more orange version of Orangedescence lipglass (limited edition from quite awhilea go). I liked it, and I liked the way it gave my lips a brighter look and the shimmer was noticeable. Young Thing is a warmed up creamy beige with peachy-gold shimmer. It‚Äôs similar to C-Thru, but it has shimmer, and it‚Äôs not quite as cool/neutral toned. Product : 9/10 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 8/10 Packaging : 8/10 Recommendation : I‚Äôve always been a fan of MAC‚Äôs Lipglass, just because it‚Äôs available in so many fantastic shades, and the sticky-factor makes it long-wearing. I found On Display and New Spirit to be my new must-haves from the new glosses.

It is nearly opaque, but you can see my lip freckle peeking through just slightly. There‚Äôs a nice glossy shine while the lipstick itself is creamy and applies like a dream. All of Tom Ford‚Äôs lipsticks are vanilla-scented but taste-free, and I get about five or six hours of wear with darker shades like Moroccan Rouge .

In our continuing pursuit of building awareness and support for some of the world‚Äôs most vital environmental causes, Chantecaille is proud to shine a light on a fast-growing global issue: The increasing eradication of the world‚Äôs dolphins. Once plentiful in the cradle of civilization‚ÄîThe Mediterranean, and particularly in the waters surrounding Greece‚Äîcommon dolphins are becoming so scarce, they now reside on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. Highly intelligent and considered in many cultures to be a sacred link between humans and Gods, dolphins face countless threats across the globe. In antiquity, killing a dolphin was an act punishable in some countries by death. Extreme over-fishing, severe lack of marine-protected areas, habitat degradation, trawling, marine pollution, and illegal harvesting (notably profiled in the recent documentary, The Cove) continues to threaten the survival of this magical creature. Which is why Chantecaille‚Äôs latest inspiration for Spring 2010 culminates in Les Dauphins‚Äîa limited edition palette of color essentials devoted to the symbol and protection of this endangered animal. Les Dauphins‚ÄîThe Limited-Edition Quad Palette ($77.00) Les Dauphins‚Äôs Quad Palette reflects soft, simple warm grays, delicate beiges, and iridescent neutrals, a strong runway trend from the spring 2010 collections. The colors are encased in an elegant gunmetal quad palette (along with a smoky-rose satin pouch), and each pan is embossed with two dolphins, containing two shades to be blended together. The three eyes‚Äîin of-the-moment grays, beige, and soft pinks‚Äîbrighten and define the eye area with subtle pearl. The perfect pink ,cheek color offers a universally flattering flush of rosy warmth. China Rose and Bourbon Rose Lip Chic ($30.00) To compliment Les Dauphins Quad Palette, Chantecaille created two new Lip Chic shades: China Rose and Bourbon Rose. Aligning with the spring runway collections‚Äô passion for corals, and pinks, these two new additions beautifully complement the warm neutrals contained in the quad palette, adding a fresh pop of vibrant color to the lip along with the plumping, smoothing, and soft wearable shine that‚Äôs made the Lip Chic formulas so unique and popular. China Rose Lip Chic A bright and universally-wearable golden coral Bourbon Rose Lip Chic A joyful blush of clean, cool pink Giving Back to Protect the Dolphins To bring further support to the dolphin‚Äôs survival worldwide, Chantecaille will give 5% of Les Dauphins to Giovanni Bearzi, a Pew Fellow of Marine Conservation, who heads up Tethys‚ÄîA non-profit NGO for the study and the conservation of the marine environment in the Mediterranean. The Tethys Research Institute has been studying Mediterranean whales and dolphins for two decades and has become one of theforemost research organizations working in the basin. Tethys subscribes to the following philosophy: ‚ÄúTell me and I‚Äôll forget, show me and I may remember, involve me and I will understand.‚Äù ‚Äî Confucius To engage the public‚Äôs interest, understanding and support of marine conservation, they offer Field Courses on studying dolphins and whales in the Mediterranean, giving the layperson first hand experience with these animals. Chantecaille encourages everyone to learn more and help bring awareness to this cause at http://www.tethys.org/giovanni_bearzi.htm .

The majority of the color lasts four to five hours, but a fuchsia stain persists for a couple more after that. I like that it‚Äôs long-wearing without feeling drying. With Pure Pink, it is more of a blue-based pink, so it suits those with cooler complexions best, but if you have a warmer complexion, I still think it would work.

It goes on opaque, and it‚Äôs the most glistening/shimmering shade I‚Äôve tried so far. It does settle a bit into lip lines, but from a normal viewing distance, it‚Äôs really not noticeable. This is a shade that stains very well and wears for four to five hours with a lingering stain for an additional two or so. It‚Äôs vampy without being too blackened but not too much of a red shade either. I can definitely see this being a perfect shade for fall. Tom Ford‚Äôs Private Blend Lip Color collection are all vanilla scented and come in a white and gold square tube. It‚Äôs a very clean and elegant look, and the tube itself is weighty, so it feels more luxurious when you hold it in your hand. I like that the usage of the white paneling means no fingerprints, since that is a common problem when brands use more metallic/metal kind of packaging.

NARS Christina is redder and has a golden shimmer. Guerlain Rose Bengale is slightly brighter and has pale pink shimmer. MAC Red Dwarf is more berry, less pink. MAC Positively Dashing is slightly darker and pinker. MAC Deliciously Forbidden is brighter and pinker. Hourglass Nocturnal is very similar but a little redder. Dior Ruby is a touch darker. MAC Offshoot is browner. MAC Craving is very similar. Maybelline Bit of Berry is a little lighter and pinker. As you can see, there are numerous shades that are similar to this one; some shades are a little redder, others are a bit pinker, and a few are fairly close. Casablanca has good color coverage, as it applied opaque and hides my lip freckle quite well. It has a creamy, smooth consistency that enables it to glide on evenly and easily. Even though it has opaque color and a creamy feel, it doesn‚Äôt sit heavily on the lips. It‚Äôs comfortable to wear, and it wears well‚Äìa solid five hours‚Äìwhile lightly moisturizing the lips. Tom Ford‚Äôs lipstick range is vanilla-scented but doesn‚Äôt have any discernible taste. It comes in a square tube with gold metal accents and brown ‚Äúpaneling‚Äù on the exterior of the tube. I like that the outer tube doesn‚Äôt hold fingerprints, and there‚Äôs a satisfying click when you close the lipstick, so it stays together better if you toss it around in a bag. The brand‚Äôs logo is cut into the tip of the lipstick. 87 15 Casablanca 87 15 Casablanca A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Beautylish Neiman Marcus Saks Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Barneys Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Cosbar Tom Ford 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total Read Full Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2012-05-11 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>6cfad9760ad6d8bc530f22aaf01199b472b73b4d</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Spring Makeup: Barbie Pink &amp; Purple (Valentine‚Äôs Day Makeup‚Ä¶ Maybe!)</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/spring-makeup-barbie-pink-purple-valentines-day-makeup-maybe/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Spring Makeup: Barbie Pink &amp; Purple (Valentine‚Äôs Day Makeup‚Ä¶ Maybe!) Looks Jan 06, 2010 January 06, 2010 Valentine‚Äôs Day Makeup: It‚Äôs the New Pink Last night, I asked the late night Twitter crowd if I should do a colorful or natural look ‚Äî I was originally thinking about doing something soft and natural, but colorful was the voice of the majority, so I ran with it. I thought about it, and I decided I should do some pinks, and then I started feeling like something Barbie might wear, you know, if she was obsessed with makeup and wore color up to her brows‚Ä¶ üòâ Since it‚Äôs always fun try out different lips, I went with two extremes: hot fuchsia pink and cool-toned pink-purple. I think what you pair it with, lips-wise, is really something that‚Äôs about what you feel comfortable in and if it‚Äôs appropriate for the occasion. I‚Äôd totally wear the hot pink lips out at night ‚Äî don‚Äôt care if it doesn‚Äôt follow makeup rules! To tone it down, go for something in-between ‚Äî light enough so it doesn‚Äôt compete with the eyes, but not so light that it washes you out. My go-to for a look like this is Sweetie lipstick topped with Luminary lustreglass, but I wasn‚Äôt trying to be subtle with this look, so there ya go. Best part about makeup? It‚Äôs fun! Second best part? It washes off üôÇ I‚Äôm pretty sure I totally rocked this kind of look one Valentine‚Äôs Day, so let‚Äôs go with that. I‚Äôm almost positive I did the ultra bright, ultra fuchsia, and totally unforgiving hot pink lip on a Valentine‚Äôs Day, at least. You could totally put some awesome false lashes on for even more dramatic eye, too! You will need the following‚Ä¶ Eyes : MAC Soft Ochre Paint Pot (neutral beige base), (opalescent white-pink), MAC Pink Opal Pigment MAC Seedy Pearl Eyeshadow (pinky-white), MAC Stars ‚Äòn Rockets Eyeshadow (fuchsia-purple), MAC Fig. 1 Eyeshadow (eggplant), MAC Passionate Eyeshadow (medium-deep pink), MAC Penultimate Eyeliner (black), Urban Decay Lust 24/7 Liner (purple), Chanel Exceptionnel Mascara (black) Cheeks : Benefit Sugarbomb Powder (peachy-pink) / Illamasqua Kate Blush (cool-toned pink) Lips : MAC Show Orchid Lipstick (PRO) (fuchsia-purple), MAC Luminary Lustreglass (opalescent) / MAC Saint Germain Lipstick (cool-toned pink-purple), MAC Luminary Lustreglass (opalescent) Brushes : 266 (firm, angled brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 214 (smudge brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 129 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Saint Germain = Snob For eyes, start by applying Soft Ochre paint pot as your eyeshadow base all over the lid with the 249. Put one or two drops of water-based mixing medium (or water) on your 239, and then apply Pink Opal pigment on the lid, going just above the crease. Using the 239, apply Seedy Pearl eyeshadow on the lower lid. Next, apply Stars ‚Äòn Rockets eyeshadow on the outer third of the eyelid and lightly blend with crease. Darken the outer third of the lid with Passionate eyeshadow with the 239, gently brushing it into the lower crease. Next, define the crease by applying Fig. 1 eyeshadow with the 226. Lightly tap and brush Seedy Pearl eyeshadow directly above the crease to soften. To finish the eyeshadow look, sweep Seedy Pearl eyeshadow as a highlighter on the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Lust Liner on the lower lash line and Penultimate eyeliner on the upper lash line, and then sweeping lashes with Exceptionnel mascara. For cheeks, apply Benefit Sugarbomb to the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116 for a warmer cheek; try Illamasqua Kate for a cooler pink cheek. For lips, apply Show Orchid lipstick first, and then layer Luminary lustreglass for a bolder lip look. For a paler lip look, try Saint Germain lipstick as a base, and then top with Luminary lustreglass . Check out more photos !

In our continuing pursuit of building awareness and support for some of the world‚Äôs most vital environmental causes, Chantecaille is proud to shine a light on a fast-growing global issue: The increasing eradication of the world‚Äôs dolphins. Once plentiful in the cradle of civilization‚ÄîThe Mediterranean, and particularly in the waters surrounding Greece‚Äîcommon dolphins are becoming so scarce, they now reside on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. Highly intelligent and considered in many cultures to be a sacred link between humans and Gods, dolphins face countless threats across the globe. In antiquity, killing a dolphin was an act punishable in some countries by death. Extreme over-fishing, severe lack of marine-protected areas, habitat degradation, trawling, marine pollution, and illegal harvesting (notably profiled in the recent documentary, The Cove) continues to threaten the survival of this magical creature. Which is why Chantecaille‚Äôs latest inspiration for Spring 2010 culminates in Les Dauphins‚Äîa limited edition palette of color essentials devoted to the symbol and protection of this endangered animal. Les Dauphins‚ÄîThe Limited-Edition Quad Palette ($77.00) Les Dauphins‚Äôs Quad Palette reflects soft, simple warm grays, delicate beiges, and iridescent neutrals, a strong runway trend from the spring 2010 collections. The colors are encased in an elegant gunmetal quad palette (along with a smoky-rose satin pouch), and each pan is embossed with two dolphins, containing two shades to be blended together. The three eyes‚Äîin of-the-moment grays, beige, and soft pinks‚Äîbrighten and define the eye area with subtle pearl. The perfect pink ,cheek color offers a universally flattering flush of rosy warmth. China Rose and Bourbon Rose Lip Chic ($30.00) To compliment Les Dauphins Quad Palette, Chantecaille created two new Lip Chic shades: China Rose and Bourbon Rose. Aligning with the spring runway collections‚Äô passion for corals, and pinks, these two new additions beautifully complement the warm neutrals contained in the quad palette, adding a fresh pop of vibrant color to the lip along with the plumping, smoothing, and soft wearable shine that‚Äôs made the Lip Chic formulas so unique and popular. China Rose Lip Chic A bright and universally-wearable golden coral Bourbon Rose Lip Chic A joyful blush of clean, cool pink Giving Back to Protect the Dolphins To bring further support to the dolphin‚Äôs survival worldwide, Chantecaille will give 5% of Les Dauphins to Giovanni Bearzi, a Pew Fellow of Marine Conservation, who heads up Tethys‚ÄîA non-profit NGO for the study and the conservation of the marine environment in the Mediterranean. The Tethys Research Institute has been studying Mediterranean whales and dolphins for two decades and has become one of theforemost research organizations working in the basin. Tethys subscribes to the following philosophy: ‚ÄúTell me and I‚Äôll forget, show me and I may remember, involve me and I will understand.‚Äù ‚Äî Confucius To engage the public‚Äôs interest, understanding and support of marine conservation, they offer Field Courses on studying dolphins and whales in the Mediterranean, giving the layperson first hand experience with these animals. Chantecaille encourages everyone to learn more and help bring awareness to this cause at http://www.tethys.org/giovanni_bearzi.htm .

A portion of the proceeds will benefit the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is an agency of the World Health Organization. The collection will start to roll out at beauty supply stores and select salons in September. Encouragement is a pale, milky pink with silvery-white shimmer. Even with three coats, it wasn‚Äôt quite opaque, but it‚Äôs pretty close to it. Very pretty-in-pink. Enpowerment is a creamy slightly cooled blue-based pink. I used three coats to get an opaque look. It looked less cool-toned under brighter/direct sunlight, though! Endurance is a darkened fuchsia jelly base with fuchsia shimmer. I also used three coats here. I like when pretty products also give back! It makes buying them just a little good for the soul, too. I‚Äôm a believer in purchasing products you want, not solely so you can give to a cause‚Äìbecause if you want to give a cause, a donation from you to them is always the best way, since 100% will go towards the cause you‚Äôre looking to support. However, when there‚Äôs an item you‚Äôd normally buy AND it gives back in some capacity, it‚Äôs a nice bonus. China Glaze‚Äôs three shades are perfect to represent BCA month, and they‚Äôre lovely, feminine shades. My favorite shade was Endurance , just because it‚Äôs bold and beautiful and fun. I didn‚Äôt have any application issues with any of the three shades, though they all needed a full three coats. But I really fell in love with the names used for these polishes‚Äìuplifting and inspiring.

Stila Road to Radiance Palette ($10.00) sounds like a good deal, but in all honesty, I (personally!) would rather put $10 towards one stellar full-size product than a medicore palette. Stila misses in this palette by delivering four inferior eyeshadows‚Äìnot only in pigmentation but the entire formula is nothing like Stila‚Äôs individual (nor their Barbie palette) shadows. They are sheer and don‚Äôt build up particularly well. Stila shadows are incredibly soft‚Äìso soft, they can kick up some powder‚Äìand almost creamy, despite being pressed powder. These are nothing like that. Because Stila is a much higher quality brand than this palette portrays, I think it‚Äôs a poor palette overall‚Äìeven if the price tag is enticing. The only product I liked in the palette was Hibiscus Convertible Color. It was creamy, blended out nicely, and wore well. In terms of value, the four eyeshadows come to 0.15 oz. while the Convertible Color is 0.09 oz. (full-size is 0.15 oz.). Since I only liked Hibiscus, I‚Äôd much rather buy a full-size Convertible Color in its own packaging, particularly since it‚Äôll stay clean of any loose powder unlike in the palette.

Pro Longwear Bronzing Powder ($28.00 for 0.42 oz.) is a new (but limited edition) formula that features two shades: Nude on Board (bronzy, yellow tone) and Sun Dipped (dirty red tone). This new formula promises to yield ‚Äúsheer-low transparent coverage‚Äù with ‚Äúlong wear‚Äù and a ‚Äúnatural finish.‚Äù Nude on Board is a soft light-medium golden tan with subtle gold shimmer-sheen. On my skin tone (about NC30 at the moment), it adds subtle warmth and golden glow. This would be the shade most suitable for light to medium complexions. MAC Soft Sand is darker, redder. MAC GIve Me Sun! is a little more orange. Sun Dipped is a light-medium brownish tan with a subtle beige-gold sheen. This shade is a little more buildable than Nude on Board, but it‚Äôs still more appropriate for light to medium-dark than medium to dark. I think it could still add a subtle warmth to all complexions, though. MAC Soft Sand is redder. MAC Golden is a little lighter. Chanel Sable Beige is a little yellower, more golden. Side-by-side, Nude on Board seems lighter and warmer compared to Sun Dipped , which looks a bit dirty, brown, and gray. When swatched, however, the differences get minimized. Nude on Board is distinctly golden, yellow-toned in comparison, but Sun Dipped isn‚Äôt really darker, just a little less warm and it has more of a sheen than a shimmer. As I‚Äôm writing this review, I‚Äôm looking at them side-by-side on my forearm, and in my office lighting, it‚Äôs hard to tell them apart. The same is true when they‚Äôre applied to the cheeks! Moral of the story: you don‚Äôt really need both. I anticipate that cooler complexions may see more of a difference. The texture of the Pro Longwear Bronzing Powders is very, very soft and smooth‚Äìthese powders are incredibly finely-milled and feel like silk against the skin. They apply even better; they apply softly, evenly, and blend out effortlessly. It‚Äôs almost a creamy feel, because of how silky the powder is. When I tested out the wear, Nude on Board lasted for eight hours without fading or migrating. After ten hours, it was a little faded and patchy.

This holiday‚Äôs refillable compact is a black lacquered metal case that has a lot of heft‚Äìthe whole compact clocks in at just under 5 oz. The top of the compact is raised with Guerlain‚Äôs signature rosette, and the interior of the rosette is made up of gold mother-of-pearl. Wulong is a sheer veil of warm, golden ivory glow. It‚Äôs glow in a compact, really, but in a subtle, barely-there way. According to Guerlain, the powder ‚Äúcombines six shades to ensure a pure, flawless and luminous complexion regardless of skin tone.‚Äù It is subtler compared to Perles du Dragon . I used it dusted all over my face as a finishing powder, though I also used it to set my makeup when I tested it (so you would only see the effect of this product). Without the powder, my foundation only lasts around eight hours, and while it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs not pristine after eight hours. With the powder, my foundation lasted well into the tenth hour, and I didn‚Äôt get any afternoon or evening shininess on my t-zone. The effect of Wulong is lightly mattifying but mostly softening and diffusing; it makes my pores (almost) disappear and softens lines. It‚Äôs kind of like real-life Photoshop for your skin. What it does is similar to what regular Meteorites do, but the compact version is more travel friendly. I applied it with a large tapered brush like MAC‚Äôs 184. The texture is softer than silk, smoother than butter; it‚Äôs finely-milled to the point where it melts against the skin. It never looks powdery or cakey, and on my medium skin tone, it‚Äôs not at all ashy. I‚Äôm not certain that the actual shade of Wulong will be later available in a refill, but Mythic Voyage is at present and the refill is $55, to give you an idea of the cost of the product compared to the cost of the product and compact. I haven‚Äôt tried Mythic to my memory, so I don‚Äôt know how comparable it is. I would expect a similar effect overall, because the formula is so transparent and finely-milled. The back of Wulong says ‚ÄúRefillable with Mythic 01.‚Äù You might also consider Guerlain‚Äôs Illuminating &amp; Mattifying Pressed Powders , which are also part of the Meteorites family, though those are more matte than Wulong . There‚Äôs no planet where I would feel comfortable saying this is a must-have‚Äìnot at $170‚Äìbut it‚Äôs a lovely product that performs well by making my skin look 15-20% better than it is and extending the wear of my base. I‚Äôd be more apt to purchase a refill and skip the compact to save $115. The compact is gorgeous. It‚Äôs exactly what luxury beauty packaging should be. I‚Äôm just not that much of a packaging junkie, but I routinely use pressed Meteorites to finish my foundation. Wulong is one piece I‚Äôll treasure and enjoy for years. It‚Äôs very much a collector‚Äôs item, and I can see why some Guerlain collectors make sure they‚Äôre first in line for these compacts. 28 3 Wulong 28 3 Wulong A+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Cosbar Dillard's 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 100% Total Read Full Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2012-10-19 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>c8c8b0884d81f3a017291c24a89a820b0f726194</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Estee Lauder Sensuous Rose Pure Color Blush</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tag/estee-lauder-pure-color-blush/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Estee Lauder Sensuous Rose Pure Color Blush Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Sep 12, 2012 September 12, 2012 Estee lauder Sensuous Rose Pure Color Blush In Love with Sensuous Rose Estee lauder Sensuous Rose Pure Color Blush ($28.00 for 0.24 oz.) is a pale pink-beige with a soft, satin finish. It has subtle warm undertones, but it‚Äôs just barely warm. I almost wanted to describe it as coral, but I think the muted quality of the color makes it something else‚Äìthat‚Äôs where the beige tones come in. Tarina Tarantino Feather is pinker. MAC Ladyblush is a bit darker (and a cream product). Pure Color Blush is supposed to be ‚Äúfresh, radiant color [that] lasts all day, won‚Äôt streak or fade‚Äù with an ‚Äúultra-silky powder [that] sweeps on sheer for a natural glow‚Äù or ‚Äúbuilds for contoured and sculpted definition.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blush that you don‚Äôt have to worry about being too heavy-handed with, but if you need more color, it‚Äôs buildable. It‚Äôs also supposed to wear all day without streaking or fading. I‚Äôve only tried this shade from this formula, but it was a stunner and more than impressive! It‚Äôs extremely soft and silky-smooth‚Äìabsolutely finely-milled‚Äìand looks that way on the skin. The way it melts onto the skin gives such a great natural finish and sheen, so it never emphasizes pores or skin imperfections. Estee Lauder really nailed the pigmentation, too; it applies easily and evenly without going overboard, but it still shows up on my skin tone (I‚Äôm about medium in color) even with just one sweep of color. The color is buildable to more dramatic (true-to-pan) color without having to pile it on.

Chantecaille Les Petales de Rose is more shimmery with a warmer golden sheen. MAC Lightscapade is more shimmery. MAC Light Sunshine has a bit more of a sheen and powderiness to it. So, after discovering the majesty of Wulong over the holiday season, I knew I had to see whether the always-available Mythic was similar/comparable (because Wulong is limited edition, and while you can refill the compact, it would have to be with Mythic ). One of the reasons I wanted to find out about their similarities is because you can purchase the pan without the compact‚Äìthe pan will run you $55, whereas the whole kit ‚Äòn‚Äô caboodle with cost you $170. Initially, I thought, ‚ÄúThis is going to be different,‚Äù but as is the nature of the product, no, not really (and that‚Äôs not a bad thing). What I noticed more with Mythic is that it‚Äôll be a better mattifying product, because it has more of a matte, powdered base color with a very subtle sheen and a dusting of delicate micro-shimmer. Wulong reads slightly more as a barely-there sheen with less of a mattifying texture. In the pan, Mythic appears cooler-toned, but on, I don‚Äôt notice any coolness at all, because it is designed to be a transparent finishing powder over all else. For those who couldn‚Äôt bear the price of Wulong , if you have an existing compact or an empty palette to store it in, Mythic is something worth checking out instead. I measured, and the diameter of the pan appears to be 55mm. Guerlain‚Äôs Meteorites Voyage Powders are really a pressed version of their famous Meteorite with less emphasis on shimmer, more on radiance, brightening, and creating an illusion of better skin. That‚Äôs really what these powders do for me: give me the effect of Photoshop in real life. They‚Äôre a subtle something-rather that no one can point to and say, ‚ÄúOh, nice highlighter!‚Äô but instead say, ‚ÄúHey, are you doing something different with your skin today?‚Äù As a finishing powder, it‚Äôs the very last step in the routine, right after setting powder, but honestly, I regularly use this (and Wulong ) as both my setting and finishing powder‚ÄìI have normal-to-dry skin, so I imagine that‚Äôs part of why I can get away with it‚Äìbut I have noticed it still extends the wear of my base makeup by about an hour. This is the kind of product that either makes it into your everyday routine or you‚Äôll never understand how anyone on earth could shell out money for something they can‚Äôt (or barely) see. It‚Äôs okay to feel either way; what‚Äôs most important is that you enjoy your makeup. I‚Äôve used either this or Wulong since getting Wulong (and prior to that, I was using Guerlain‚Äôs Illuminating &amp; Mattifying Pressed Powder , which is also a worthwhile alternative), but I have been using this specifically for the past two weeks. For me, it is absolutely part of my everyday routine. If you asked me to choose, I would say Wulong ‚Äìbut that is because it is limited edition, because I like the look of the compact, and I‚Äôm just a little warm. 62 1 Mythic 62 1 Mythic A+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Cosbar Dillard's 10 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 100% Total Read Full Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2013-01-09 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>da8dc0c5e7f32800f245aff882d2d72c5542ff66</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Illamasqua Katie Blush Review, Photos, Swatches</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/illamasqua-katie-blush-review-photos-swatches/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Illamasqua Katie Blush Review, Photos, Swatches Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Feb 05, 2010 February 05, 2010 The First Blush of Spring: Illamasqua Katie Blush Illamasqua Katie Blush ($23.00) is an ultra pale pastel pink with a matte finish. It has good color pay off, but it is extremely light in color. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite as pigmented as several of the other shade variastions I‚Äôve tried in their powder blush line, though. Personally, I found it didn‚Äôt work on my skin tone; the paleness washed me out and made me look sickly. I think this is a shade very well suited for those with more porcelain complexions‚Äìcould see it looking very spring-y and natural (and not sickly!). Illamasqua‚Äôs blushes are nice for matte, pigmented color. The packaging isn‚Äôt my cup of tea (too bulky), but I like that the top is clear, so you can see the color without having to open the compact. Illamasqua brushes are a slightly cheaper investment ($23 to $25) than NARS blushes, though you get a little less (0.02 oz. to be precise). So far, all of the blushes I‚Äôve tried by Illamasqua have had matte finishes, so it‚Äôs easy to wear them and have them turn out natural-looking. You can always brush on a highlighter if you want a shimmery look‚Äìbut you don‚Äôt have to, which is nice. Everyone needs a few matte blushes in their life!

It really is a lovely color, and it applies evenly with good pigmentation. There‚Äôs also a built-in sharpener, and I love that you can twist the eyeliner up and down (sometimes it only goes up!). I‚Äôm continually surprised at how little product is included in twist-up eyeliners‚Äìit‚Äôs typically 0.02 oz. or so‚Äìwhile pencil eyeliners run around 0.04 oz. I‚Äôve only finished one eyeliner in my life (MAC Graphblack, which is also a twist-up eyeliner); and going off memory, I know that, despite daily usage, I didn‚Äôt run through it in a matter of days‚Äìprobably around two or three months. I am curious as to why they‚Äôre only designed to fit that much, though. I don‚Äôt feel like I use any less/more between twist-up/pencil liners! Anyway, this is to point out that you‚Äôre only getting 0.01 oz., which is below average, so if you‚Äôre looking for a daily eyeliner, you might want to prepare yourself for frequent repurchasing. The formula of this eyeliner is excellent, and if you‚Äôve had trouble with eyeliner staying in place, you may want to test drive Chanel sometime (they also have several other lovely shades). It is, indeed, waterproof. It wears all day without smudging, budging, or fading. It doesn‚Äôt stick well on my waterline (just an hour or two), but it stays put on my lower lash line. I wore it across my crease (rather than my upper lash line to avoid irritation), and it didn‚Äôt crease there either.

The pen is new and limited edition from Smashbox‚Äôs Heartbreaker Collection for the spring. It‚Äôs actually kind of funny, because it seems like pen liners are the new thing to do, as several brands have put one out for the spring. I remember the first one I ever used was MAC‚Äôs Penultimate , which I still use on occasion. I like pen liners because they are easier to use than traditional liquid liners. I think I do personally prefer gel eyeliners for the upper lash line over liquid liners, but I do prefer pen liners over traditional liquid liners. You have a lot more control, and it is nice that the tip is always rich in color‚Äìyou don‚Äôt have to worry about running out or product drying on you mid-lining. Smashbox‚Äôs Liquid Liner Pen comes in just one shade, Jet Black , which is a rich black. It‚Äôs pretty intense and does go on as a slightly shiny black. I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of black liquid liners seem to reflect more brown-black when swatched, but they really do appear quite black in real life‚Äìthe same thing happened here. I urge you to check it out where I wore it in this look (on the right eye‚Äìyour right, not mine‚Äìthe left eye was done with Stila‚Äôs Pen Liner !) If you like extremely tight/thin lines, I don‚Äôt think this is your best bet. It can give you a relatively thin line, but I had trouble getting and keeping it ultra thin. The tip is long enough to give you a nice, broad stroke, but it‚Äôs not so long that you lose control over the shape and direction of your line (nor does it kind of bend too much). This does have a very ‚Äúliquid‚Äù feel when you use it, so don‚Äôt go over the line too much ‚Äî once or twice should be plenty. This liquid liner does last a solid eight hours or longer on me (I avoid wearing my makeup for longer than eight hours a day!) and doesn‚Äôt fade, smudge, or migrate whatsoever while I‚Äôve worn it. It‚Äôs housed in a simple pen-shaped tube with a removeable cap that clicks back on. It‚Äôs very minimalist, but it‚Äôs slim and functional. The price tag seems a little higher than I‚Äôd have expected (Jet Set and Cream Eye Liner by Smashbox are both $22), but it‚Äôs not too out of the price range for Smashbox liners. The other downside is that this is a product that could become a staple in your routine, but it‚Äôs limited edition!

It flashes from a dirty, antique gold to grass green. As I mentioned earlier this week, Color Club Editorial is very comparable, as they both are similar to Chanel Peridot . Though not quite as similar, Ozotic #507 is worth mentioning‚Äìit just shifts more to blue than to green. It‚Äôs mostly opaque after two coats, but I would advise applying three, because the formula is a bit thinner and slightly sheerer than other China Glaze polishes. There are noticeable brush strokes in the finish and they apply straight overall, but they are there. This shade dried down a bit faster than other China Glaze polishes, and it did have a naturally shiny finish. I recommend waiting between coats, because it will drag if you apply a second or third coat too soon. I typically get a week of wear out of China Glaze‚Äôs formula but do not have any chipping, just minor tip wear. 9 4 Rare &amp; Radiant 9 4 Rare &amp; Radiant B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Drugstore.com Ulta Amazon Beauty Brands 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 88% Total Read Full Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2012-10-05 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>f43ad84824855b8c4d07067afff6fe6e68697390</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Dior Intimate Bronze (522) Ultra Gloss Review, Photos, Swatches (Nordstrom Exclusive)</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/dior-intimate-bronze-522-ultra-gloss-review-photos-swatches-nordstrom-exclusive/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Dior Intimate Bronze (522) Ultra Gloss Review, Photos, Swatches (Nordstrom Exclusive) Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Jul 25, 2010 July 25, 2010 Dior Intimate Bronze Ultra Gloss Nordstrom Beauty Exclusive: Dior Ultra Gloss Dior Intimate Bronze (522) Ultra Gloss ($26.50 for 0.21 fl. oz.) is a semi-sheer shade of bronzed nude with gold and copper micro-shimmer.

Rose Temptation is a softened rose-gold with subtle gold flecks and soft sheen. It also has slight red undertones, but they‚Äôre not too strong in this shade. I found this to be the softest shade out of the three new shades, but it is the second most wearable ( Pink Explosion being the most). When I wore it, I tried it very softly, because I ended up using it to complement a rather smoky eye, and I think it worked out well. It gave my cheeks a gentle color without being over-the-top‚Äìvery natural.

Before you‚Äôre going to go to bed! After I finished photographing Urban Decay‚Äôs Naked Palette , I really wanted to do something using Gunmetal, but I wanted it to be different than just a regular ol‚Äô smoky eye‚Ä¶ so I thought, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try Half-Baked and Gunmetal!‚Äù Then it started to give me this ‚Äúnight sky‚Äù feeling‚Ä¶ and then I thought, ‚Äú Maybe this would be really cool with silver eyeliner‚Ä¶ I think I will try‚Ä¶ just for fun! ‚Äù Oh man, I was paying for that fun, though. My upper lash line was itching and watering so bad! I just wanted to get photos taken as soon as possible that I didn‚Äôt even realize the damage all that watering had done (removed the inner corner!). So, I ask that you excuse the missing piece of the puzzle and the bloodshot eyes! üôÅ You will need the following‚Ä¶ Eyes : NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base (neutral eyeshadow base), Urban Decay Creep Eyeshadow (deep blue-black), Urban Decay Gunmetal Eyeshadow (blue-gray), Urban Decay Half-Baked Eyeshadow (copper), Urban Decay Virgin Eyeshadow (soft beige), Urban Decay Deviant 24/7 Liner (medium blue), MAC Silverstroke Fluidline (silver), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder (translucent) Cheeks : Chanel Rose Temptation Blush (reddish plum) Lips : Chanel Rose Dentelle Rouge Coco Lipstick (soft pink), Chanel Rose Dilemma Glossimer (pink) Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 116 (dense blush brush), 208 (thin, angled brush) For eyes, start by applying Smudgeproof as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Using the 239, apply Creep eyeshadow on the lowest third of the lid and pat across in a horizontal line (almost as if you were lining the upper lash line). Lightly blend Gunmetal eyeshadow above Creep eyeshadow to the crease with the 239. Next, apply Half Baked eyeshadow into the crease with the 226, lightly blending. Blend Virgin eyeshadow with the crease shade and highlight the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Deviant liner on the lower lash line, and then smudge Gunmetal eyeshadow on the outer third of the lower lash line with the 219. Apply Silverstroke fluidline on the upper lash line with the 208 brush. Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Rose Temptation blush on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Rose Dentelle lipstick first, and then layer Rose Dilemma glossimer for a complementing lip. Check out more photos!

Chanel describes it as a ‚Äúsheer, lightly shimmering shade of gold to bring a subtle new luminosity to the face.‚Äù It looks more shimmery in the pot than it does on‚Äìit‚Äôs not glittery or heavy. On my skin tone, I don‚Äôt find that it really adds much‚Äìit‚Äôs a touch of warmth, at best, accompanied by a glowy reflection. As a highlighting product, it‚Äôs good but not the best on the market. It‚Äôs a blush that would work well for layering over other shades to add golden shimmer. I liked that it delivered a sheen without an abundance of shimmer, and as far as golds go, it‚Äôs surprisingly demure. Joues Contrastes don‚Äôt wear superbly on my skin‚Äìthey last six to eight hours but rarely past that‚Äìbut they tend to easy to blend and look natural applied. I might have had some blending issues with Rouge , but Or was a cinch to apply to high planes of the face and cheeks. Chanel Shimmering Tweed is similar but a little more bronzed, and it has a chunkier glitter/shimmer in its finish. MAC Sun Rush is more of an orange-gold, but on, I think they‚Äôre very similar.

Chanel blushes have a cult following, with fans coveting each new shade the brand releases. I don‚Äôt think Pink Explosion disappoints‚Äìit is the most wearable of three new and limited edition shades releasing with the fall collection. For those who don‚Äôt follow Chanel or rarely stop by the counter, let me tell you a little about what makes these blushes so loved. They are finely-milled, silky smooth powders that apply beautifully on skin. This is not a blush that will look chalky or powdery‚Äìit lays down on skin like it belongs there; the shades, no matter their hue, always look natural on cheeks. Like any range, not all shades may work for all skin tones‚Äìsome are on the lighter side‚Äìbut Pink Explosion packs enough pigment to go bubblegum pink. It‚Äôs just as easy to create a soft, petal pink flush with just a tap of the brush. Pink Explosion has a soft white shimmer that is nearly undetectable once it‚Äôs applied. Instead, it gives off a lowkey, luminous glow. I‚Äôm hesitant to even call it a sheen, because it‚Äôs so subtle.

It‚Äôs very, very intense. You‚Äôll need a light hand with this particular blush, because it is easy to go overboard. When you use a light hand, though, it does tone down to more of a medium-dark pink‚Äìit doesn‚Äôt look red‚Äìwhich looks like a soft flush. For such a pigmented blush, though, I had hoped for more blendability, but I felt like I had to do quite a bit of buffing and blending to get it to look even on me. Buffing was absolutely essential here, because without it, my cheeks looked splotchy and feverish. The texture is soft and smooth, just like other Joues Contrastes, but I did not find it as blendable as the others. I normally find Chanel‚Äôs blushes extremely easy to blend out and apply, but the color seemed to ‚Äústick‚Äù once it was applied. Joues Contrastes tend to fade after six to eight hours on me, rather than lasting a full eight to ten. MAC Bite of an Apple is a little brighter, pinker. NARS Exhibit A is much more orange. It‚Äôs a brighter, more vibrant version of MAC Love Thing . It compares best with MAC Frankly, Scarlet but perhaps a little darker. Rouge will be excellent on deeper skin tones, because of its rich color payoff, and it will also be good for anyone who reaches for dramatic blushes overall. If you are looking for more of a wear-and-go color, and ultimately, think you‚Äôd end up using this very lightly, you‚Äôd be better off picking up a product that takes less time to apply correctly. 27 5 Rouge 27 5 Rouge B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Chanel Dillard's 8.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 8 Longevity 3.5 Application 88% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

How each of us enjoys our lives is different; many find common ground in socializing or being outdoors, though there are all kinds of ways to take time out from our busy lives and do something that we enjoy, whatever it may be. I often struggle to find the right balance between life, school, and ‚Äúwork‚Äù (the blog), mostly because I‚Äôd rather be blogging than most other things! Schedule free time into your life. Don‚Äôt let yourself make excuses for why you aren‚Äôt hanging out with your honey, putting off that family dinner, or just not doing your favorite activity. It‚Äôs easy to put it off if you haven‚Äôt actually penciled in a time for it. Put it on your schedule so it becomes part of your day, part of your to-do list, in a sense. It may seem counterintuitive‚Äìplanning your free time‚Äìbut it‚Äôll help you stick to your schedule. Take 5 minutes before your start your day to pump YOU up. Before you start your day, tell yourself five good things about YOU. Compliment YOU. Then tell yourself five things you‚Äôre going to do today, whether it‚Äôs put makeup on, give your kids a kiss‚Äìpick five and then do them. Not only will you boost your self-confidence and start your day off on a positive note, but then you‚Äôve created five mini-goals‚Äìand they‚Äôre as easy or difficult as you want them to be. Get away from your desk/work. When possible, get out of your office, school, etc. for lunch or fifteen minute breaks. If the weather is nice, take a stroll around the building or away from it. Re-read your favorite book. It‚Äôs important to spend time reading and enjoying things that aren‚Äôt required reading. If you‚Äôre not into books, try magazines, news articles, etc. instead. I always like to re-read my favorite books when I‚Äôm really busy with school reading, because I can just enjoy it‚ÄìI know my favorite parts, I know the ending. Take 5 minutes to de-stress before coming home. By coming home, I ultimately mean before you settle into your home, particularly if you live with others. Just take a few minutes to breathe and let go of any stress from the day. Your home is your sanctuary! Go on vacation! Even if you can only afford to take a couple of days off from school/work, take them. And you don‚Äôt have to go to a ritzy resort if it‚Äôs not in your budget, either! You can have a stay-cation, too. Just spend the time relaxing, enjoying life, and not thinking about school/work, even if it‚Äôs just for a day or two. Stop checking email in bed. This is something I‚Äôm terrible at not doing, but it can be so helpful. Sometimes you get action item emails before you go to bed, or you‚Äôll see something that makes you jump out of bed as soon as you wake up‚Ä¶ and before you know it, you‚Äôre not even doing what you‚Äôre supposed to be doing in bed‚Äìwinding down or waking up. Put pictures of things/people you love nearby your workspace. In your car, wallet, cubicle, office, computer, etc., keep a few photos of the people and things that are meaningful to you. Remember that you have a life outside of your school/work and those pictures will remind you every time you look at them. Do you feel like you have balance in your life? This post was inspired by the course I‚Äôve been taking this weekend called Spirit of the New Workplace . For my group presentation, we tackled work/life balance and how we could find ways to implement it in our own lives.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2010-08-28 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>f5d043e97935c5cf0c7a82da191240371ff060e2</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Colourizations: Double Feature Eyeshadow Duos Swatches, Photos, Reviews, Dupes (Part 1)</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-colourizations-double-feature-eyeshadow-duos-swatches-photos-reviews-dupes-part-1/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Colourizations: Double Feature Eyeshadow Duos Swatches, Photos, Reviews, Dupes (Part 1) Sample Reviews Jul 11, 2011 July 11, 2011 MAC Double Feature Eyeshadow Duos MAC Colourizations: Double Feature Eyeshadow Duos Swatches, Photos, Reviews, Dupes (Part 1) MAC Double Feature Eyeshadow Duos ($25.00 for 0.09/0.10 oz.) are pre-filled with nameless eyeshadows.

Once I can purchase #3, I will update this post with a review and photos/swatches for it. Edited @ 7/11: Added photos, swatches, and review for Double Feature 3! Double Feature 1 is a brightened banana yellow with a veluxe pearl finish / red-toned grape purple with a frost finish. The yellow shade is right on the border of yellow and gold, and the frosty finish makes it look more gold than yellow. It had good color payoff, and it seems a touch darker than MAC Going Bananas . The purple shade has good color payoff, but it could be a little more pigmented. It is slightly darker (and has a different finish) compared to MAC Vibrant Grape . Double Feature 2 is a neon, chartreuse-lime with a veluxe pearl finish / dark gray with a silvery shimmer and satin finish. The lemon-lime shade had good color payoff, and the finish felt very smooth. It is lighter and brighter than MAC Lucky Green ‚Äìit‚Äôs more like MAC Bitter with better color payoff and a shimmery finish. Inglot #343 is comparable in color but matte. The gray shade is on the sheer side and doesn‚Äôt apply very smoothly overall. It seems like a shimmery MAC Print. Double Feature 3 is a brightened teal with a matte finish / muted, gray-tinted brown with a satin finish. The color payoff of the teal shade is lovely, while the brown shade was harder to work with and felt very dry. Just the poor quality of the brown shade makes this duo rather expensive for one good color. The teal shade is very much like Inglot #372 ; it‚Äôs like a matte version of Surf USA . The brown shade is very similar to Urban Decay Shakedown . Double Feature 4 is a medium-dark teal with a veluxe pearl finish / muted, orange-toned brown with a matte finish. Both shades had nice color payoff and smooth textures. The teal shade was one of the better textured shades out of the six duos I tried. The teal is seems comparable to MAC Teal Pigment (but likely less frosted in the finish). I can‚Äôt think of a real dupe/comparable shade for the brown shade. I thought maybe Ochre Style (limited edition from many years ago), but it seems lighter from what I can tell. The color payoff was decent to good overall, but notably, the purple shade of Double Feature #1 was a little sheer while the gray shade of Double Feature #2 was sheer and uneven in color payoff. The best duo (in terms of quality) was Double Feature #4, because both shades had good color payoff and smooth textures. I can see each duo being worn on their own, though I think they may be better used in conjunction with other shades you may own at home. They tend to be rather strong, bold combinations if you stick with just the duo compact. I find it odd that there is no information about the finishes within the palette (thank goodness the press release listed them!), and even odder that none of these shades are named. MAC regularly gives names to the shades they include in various eyeshadow quads and palettes, so why skip the duos? I‚Äôm happy to say these are infinitely better than the last time MAC attempted eyeshadow duos‚ÄìSuite Array. If you remember Suite Array, you‚Äôll know what I mean! To this day, those are easily some of the absolute worst products MAC (or any high-end brand) has ever put out. They were the kind of product that made you wonder where QA was that day. These are actually better quality than many of the recent eyeshadow quad releases have been (which have felt rather inferior to many of MAC‚Äôs permanent eyeshadows). Generally, MAC eyeshadows are 0.05 oz. except for veluxe pearls, which come in at 0.04 oz., and I think this is why some of the duos are 0.10 oz. and others are 0.09 oz. as all of the duos that are 0.09 oz. have a veluxe pearl eyeshadow in it.) I tried to remove some of the eyeshadows from the duo, but I wasn‚Äôt able to, so I believe they are glued in. MAC eyeshadows are normally $14.50 (in the pot) or $11.00 (pan), while an empty quad is $6.00 (they do not sell empty duos at this time). The pricing on these is as expected ($22 for eyeshadows + $3 for compact), except that since you can‚Äôt choose your own shades, they could have made these more of a value deal (like pre-filled quads are $36 vs. $49 to fill it yourself).

It‚Äôs very, very intense. You‚Äôll need a light hand with this particular blush, because it is easy to go overboard. When you use a light hand, though, it does tone down to more of a medium-dark pink‚Äìit doesn‚Äôt look red‚Äìwhich looks like a soft flush. For such a pigmented blush, though, I had hoped for more blendability, but I felt like I had to do quite a bit of buffing and blending to get it to look even on me. Buffing was absolutely essential here, because without it, my cheeks looked splotchy and feverish. The texture is soft and smooth, just like other Joues Contrastes, but I did not find it as blendable as the others. I normally find Chanel‚Äôs blushes extremely easy to blend out and apply, but the color seemed to ‚Äústick‚Äù once it was applied. Joues Contrastes tend to fade after six to eight hours on me, rather than lasting a full eight to ten. MAC Bite of an Apple is a little brighter, pinker. NARS Exhibit A is much more orange. It‚Äôs a brighter, more vibrant version of MAC Love Thing . It compares best with MAC Frankly, Scarlet but perhaps a little darker. Rouge will be excellent on deeper skin tones, because of its rich color payoff, and it will also be good for anyone who reaches for dramatic blushes overall. If you are looking for more of a wear-and-go color, and ultimately, think you‚Äôd end up using this very lightly, you‚Äôd be better off picking up a product that takes less time to apply correctly. 27 5 Rouge 27 5 Rouge B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Chanel Dillard's 8.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 8 Longevity 3.5 Application 88% Total Read Full Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-07-11 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>799334db651833212c9a81d1a5c3ab5df1cf9a79</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>NARS Monoi Body Glow and Body Glow II Set is the Perfect Mini Skirt Accessory</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/nars-monoi-body-glow-and-body-glow-ii-set-is-the-perfect-mini-skirt-accessory/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>NARS Monoi Body Glow and Body Glow II Set is the Perfect Mini Skirt Accessory Reviews Jan 02, 2009 January 02, 2009 NARS Mini Monoi Body Glow and Body Glow II Set ($35) contains 1 oz. sizes of each. The full-size (3.9 oz.) costs $59 each, so this is definitely a good value set‚Äìespecially if all you‚Äôve wanted to do is try it. Let me tell you, I‚Äôve lusted after this set forever. There‚Äôs just something about it that has appealed to me, so I was really happy to snag the set at a mere $35 instead of $98 (a limited edition set of the full-size bottles). Body Glow is the one that‚Äôs a warm, bronzy-gold color. It‚Äôs designed to accentuate your natural tan or give you a little extra glam for your gams. Body Glow II is Monoi de Tahiti oil in a lightweight formula that also helps moisturizer your skin and can be used daily. First, let‚Äôs talk about Body Glow (the bronzy one). I wouldn‚Äôt classify it as a self-tanner, because it really doesn‚Äôt attempt to tan you for days at a time. It‚Äôs a bronzy oil that will warm your skin up with a little color and shimmer. What I love about it is that it dries quickly‚Äìyou don‚Äôt have to walk around the house for a half hour to an hour before you can get dressed. Just be sure to wait though, because when it is wet, it can stain your clothes. The scent of the tropical oil lasts forever, and it‚Äôs definitely potent! Body Glow II does sink in and absorb pretty quickly, and it leaves a nice sheen behind, so it can work as a daily moisturizer if you‚Äôre looking for one. I found that the scent of this one didn‚Äôt linger as long as Body Glow, and I really don‚Äôt have the foggiest idea as to why that is. Nevertheless, for those not looking for color but still want to draw attention to their legs, this isn‚Äôt a bad choice. All in all, this set is great for summertime. It‚Äôs not really worth using during the wintertime, because there‚Äôs just not much time where you can show off your glowy parts, you know? For the price tag of the full size bottles, you better believe I want to show ‚Äôem off! As far as usage goes, I think you can easily get these mini bottles to last through at least one summer, since you don‚Äôt need much per application. I don‚Äôt think I will be repurchasing, though, because I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm allergic to monoi-scented products‚Äìthis is the second product with ‚Äúmonoi‚Äù mentioned in it that‚Äôs caused me to sneeze up and down the hallway instantaneously. So unfortunately for me, I‚Äôll have to pass on this, but hopefully you‚Äôll give it a shot, for those of you blessed without allergies üòâ</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2009-01-02 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>5749fbf79fc32c99b0a29da6bb9dac49f06205bc</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Looks ‚Äì How to Wear Color at the Beach</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tag/mac-fast-thrills-lipstick/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Looks ‚Äì How to Wear Color at the Beach Aug 17, 2008 August 17, 2008 It‚Äôs rainy and gray outside, but it‚Äôs Hawaii, so I expect that to change soon enough.

If I knew I was going underwater, I would have skipped most of the makeup routine!

You can find official promotional photos and information on MAC Fabulous Felines here . I will not have full collection swatches and photos until I‚Äôm able to purchase the missing pieces. I purchased all of these through Bloomingdale‚Äôs, which is selling early online (no idea why). Palace Pedigreed Eyeshadow Quad ($36.00 U.S. / $43.00 CDN) Courtly is a semi-sheer dirty mauve with a satin finish. It seemed rather muted to me, and it took a little extra work to get it to swatch well. The closest permanent shadow I could think of was Seedy Pearl , which has a lot more shimmer, significant pink tones, and an iridescent glow about it that make them quite different in actuality. Palace Pedigreed a darkened plum with a soft sheen and satin finish. It reminded me of a darker version of Plum Dressing , less purple Nocturnelle . Quite Spoiled is a pinky purple with a soft, satin finish. It has a subtle sheen of shimmer. It reminded me of a purple version of Modest Tone (N Collection). Russian Blue is a darkened teal with a matte finish. The pigmentation seems lacking, but when used with a brush, it‚Äôs a lot better, though it‚Äôs still not quite as pigmented as I‚Äôd like. You‚Äôll want to use the pat-and-pack method rather than sweeping this shade on. Superslick Liquid Eye Liner ($17.50 U.S. / $21.00 CDN) Nocturnal is a bright metallic silver with a high frost finish. Signature Blue is a medium-dark navy blue with lighter blue micro-shimmer. Smoky Heir is a burgundy plum with violet, plum, and purple micro-shimmer. Pigment ($19.50 U.S. / $23.50 CDN) Bloodline is a darkened taupe-brown with a tiny bit of plum. When wet, it can be very intense. If used with a brush like an eyeshadow, it works well in the crease and darkens substantially. Mauvement is a chunky brownish mauve with flecks of gold. It‚Äôs an interesting shade, but it does have some chunkiness to the texture that can be bothersome.

It just appeals to me, and I couldn‚Äôt really tell you why. Perhaps it‚Äôs because the model has such amazing features that she can rock this cut. I‚Äôve always gone to the same hair salon for $8 hair cuts‚Äìyes, $8 haircuts‚Äìbut I‚Äôve always wanted to go to a professional hair stylist and have them do my hair. (Not to say they did a bad job; most of my visits were fine, but I didn‚Äôt ask for anything beyond lots of long layers!) Well, I finally took the plunge. I went to Allan‚Äôs Salon this afternoon (I was so excited that they had an opening!) after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp!. $65 (and tip) later, and I‚Äôm loving my new ‚Äòdo! Allan was amazing‚ÄìI brought in the photo above, but also something less tame, a lot longer, and he said I could totally work the one I wanted. But since I had expressed concern over going super short, he said he would add more length to it. Perfection. Absolute perfection. I watched him when he did my blow out, to see how I would need to style it myself, and it didn‚Äôt look overly difficult. It‚Äôll be interesting when I attempt it myself, but he just used a thermal protectant (duh), thickening spray by Bumble&amp;Bumble, and then some pomade/wax. I think what I am so happy with is it is obviously different from my hair of 21 years, but it doesn‚Äôt look overly drastic. I was also thrilled to hear I could go shorter (he said I had the facial features for it) if I wanted to. Never was sure if I could pull off short hair! Nonetheless, parts of my hair had at least 7-8 inches taken off, so it is definitely a lot shorter than it was a few hours ago. OK, OK, I know you just want to see how it turned out.

Reminded me of a lighter Soft Brown . Notoriety is a slightly sheer dirty brown with cool undertones and flecks of gold shimmer with a velvet finish. I really hate the pay off of Notoriety , even though it‚Äôs an interesting color. This is a repromote from Makeup Art Cosmetics. Style Predator is a gold-shimmered medium orange base with a veluxe pearl finish. It reminds me of a darker version of Straw Harvest (Spring Colour Forecast) and more of a gold sheen than Off the Page (Makeup Art Cosmetics). Furiously Fabulous is a deep, dark brown-gray with a veluxe pearl finish. This is the best textured eyeshadow of the three quads‚Äìit‚Äôs smooth and pigmented. I thought it was going to look like Knight Divine from an initial glance, but it‚Äôs very different. It‚Äôs like Brun and Satin Taupe had a baby. Superslick Liquid Eye Liner ($17.50 U.S. / $21.00 CDN) Pure Show is a true gold, and it seems a little less pigmented than the average Superslick liner ‚Äî it‚Äôs more shimmery with a sheerer color base. It can be layered for a more intense, opaque line, though. Marked for Glamour is a darkened gray that almost looks taupe when used lightly. On the Hunt is a very deep, dark black. It has a very semi-glossy look even when dried, but it‚Äôs not wet looking (but not 100% matte/flat). Pigment ($19.50 U.S. / $23.50 CDN) Lithe is a lightly shimmered peach-nude. It reminded me of Dazzleray and Jardin Aires pigments (both limited edition)‚Äìthe texture is much smoother and finer than either of those pigments, and Lithe isn‚Äôt as frosty. Old Gold is a green-based gold with touches of reddish brown. It flashes a green-gold overall. It‚Äôs a very interesting and complex shade; definitely worth a look if you haven‚Äôt acquired this previously. This is a permanent shade.

I have four of the seven to review for you! Black Velvet is a blackened purple base with darkened lavender glitte and multi-colored shimmer. It has an almost wet, slightly tacky/sticky texture and feel, but it‚Äôs surprisingly blendable. It‚Äôs something you‚Äôd pat on rather than sweep on. There was some fall out when I used it, but it wasn‚Äôt much at all‚Äìdefinitely a lot less than you‚Äôd think for a glitter shadow. Black Berry is a deep brown-burgundy with flecks of red-burgundy shimmer. It doesn‚Äôt quite feel or read like a real metallic finish to me, but it‚Äôs a pretty shade nonetheless. It reminded me of a shimmery version of MAC Sketch. Black Charcoal is a dark black with soft gray tones and a matte finish. It‚Äôs opaque, smooth, and doesn‚Äôt look chalky. Black Chocolate is a blackened brown with cool undertones. It‚Äôs also smooth with a soft texture that doesn‚Äôt look chalky. P.S. ‚Äî I also realized something I hadn‚Äôt before, which was that Bobbi Brown‚Äôs eyeshadows are not all the same weight! They just look the same size, so it never occurred to me that they may not actually be that way. RECOMMENDATION: Black Velvet is my favorite out of the bunch‚Äìit‚Äôs the one that feels the most original to me as well. If you love the way glitter looks but hate the mess it often makes, Bobbi Brown‚Äôs Sparkle Eyeshadows do a good job of giving you that fun, sparkly effect with minimal fall out.

The collection, due on counter in July, includes Gold Fiction , a softly shimmering nail polish, $30; Facettes D‚ÄôOr , a finely milled gold loose powder that reads on the skin as a subtle glow, $56; Gold Light Glossimer lip gloss , $26; Rouge Hydrabase lipstick shades in copper, plum and coral , each $27, and a quad eye shadow palette with gold, coffee, ivory and dark green eye colors , $56. ‚Ä¶ That said, Dagousset believes that Gold Fiction will follow in the footsteps of Vamp, Black Satin and other best-selling Chanel nail polishes. ‚ÄúI think it will be huge,‚Äù said Dagousset. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a soft honey gold, not a sparkling bright gold. It‚Äôs very wearable and very modern.‚Äù Another gold-hued nail shade expected to do well is Kaleidoscope, a shiny green gold, she said. As well, Chanel will reprise ‚Äî and amplify ‚Äî gold in its holiday color collection , due out in October, with Poudre Precieuse Or , a gold highlighting powder that will retail for $75; Gold Shine , a gold Glossimer lip shade, $26; Noir Scintillant , a black eyeliner with gold sparkle, $28, and Haute Chocolate , a gold brown nail shade, $20.

Bobbi Brown Black Sparkle Eyeshadow ($24.00 for 0.13 oz.) is a gray-black color base with layers of teal shimmer, lilac and silver glitter, and wet finish. I think the coolest characteristic about Bobbi Brown‚Äôs Sparkle Eyeshadows (or this breed of glitter eyeshadows in general) is how they look slick and wet. The glitter eyeshadows of yesteryear were just powder eyeshadows with glittery bits in them (think MAC Lustres), but this newer breed has a creamier consistency‚Äìeverything clings together and then smooths out when applied. There is significantly less fall out with these creamier glitter shades (but they are not cream eyeshadows!)‚Äìthere is a bit, but nothing undue given how dark the shade is. Upon first swatching, I thought it was exactly like Black Velvet , but swatched side-by-side, the differences are easily seen! (I actually went back and double-checked the shade name, and I thought maybe mine was mislabeled‚Äìthat‚Äôs how close they seemed at first glance!) Black has a soft black color base with multi-colored glitter that flashes blue, teal, purple, and silver. It looks very blue when swatched next to Black Velvet . It‚Äôs richer and multi-faceted compared to Stila‚Äôs Black Diamond , which is just a gray black base with silver glitter. Similarly, Urban Decay‚Äôs Void is grayer and sheerer than Stila‚Äôs Black Diamond , so that doesn‚Äôt really compare either. Do you rock the glitter eyeshadow or is it too much bling for you?

I think the highlight from the collection were the beauty powder blushes; talk about a powder that feels softer than silk. I know that beauty powder blushes had a great texture from before, but I don‚Äôt remember them feeling this soft. The dazzleglasses are back with four favorites and one new one (Miss Dynamite), and I know many of you were eager to get your hands on these! The mineralize eyeshadows are like mineralize eyeshadows‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt notice a difference in texture or feel compared to the last set that came out. I skipped these for now, but we‚Äôll see if I cave (like for Danger Zone‚Äìthe one with the red in it). I purchased the two beauty powder blushes and that‚Äôs it! See swatches here ! Get the detailed reviews for each product‚Ä¶ Lipstick Soft Pause is a semi-sheer plummy color with a bit of mauve-raspberry in it. It seemed a little frosty, but not over the top. Pomposity is a fuchsia-purple color, very frosty, and it has great pigmentation. It‚Äôs a nice color, but I have it from before (it came out with C-Shock). Red She Said is a pretty blue-based red that‚Äôs vibrant and pigmented. It didn‚Äôt wow me like last year‚Äôs Queen‚Äôs Sin, though. Crazee is a reddish coral color with a semi-sheer finish. It doesn‚Äôt have too much shimmer in it, so it doesn‚Äôt look frosty. Quiet Please is a very sheer peach-beige color; it didn‚Äôt show on me very well, unfortunately. Dazzleglass Miss Dynamite is a soft pastel orange gloss with lots of copper glitter. Dazzleglass is basically lipgloss with reflects glitter added to it, in case you ever want to make your own. (This is the new one.) Date Night is a plummy-raspberry color with fuchsia shimmer. Love Alert is a hot fuchsia-pink with fuchsia-purple shimmer. Baby Sparks is a milky pastel pink with soft whitish glitter. Sugarrimmed is a sheer white gloss with white glitter reflects. Mineralize Eye Shadow Word of Mouth is a trio of a soft shimmery pink-beige followed by a strip of copper and another strip of color that‚Äôs a gray with a blue cast. The copper strip found in three of the shadows is chunky glitter, reminds me a little of reflects glitter, though not as fine. Threesome has such a stunning pink color‚Äìit‚Äôs almost like a cool, blue pink in a sense. It also has the copper strip of color (it is the same in all three). The other color is a burgundy kind of color‚Äìreminded me instantly of Cranberry eyeshadow, actually. Danger Zone has a gorgeous shimmery red (but not overly shimmery‚Äìactually, less shimmery than most of the shadows) matched with a chalky black color (think Black Tied + Carbon). The silver strip of color is just like the copper strip in terms of feel: chunky glitter, not a very pigmented color. Outspoken is one of the shadows with the silver middle strip. The purple shade is a bright pop of purple, what most people wanted Parfait Amour to be, but more purple and less blue-purple. It is matched with a deep burgundy-brown color. Persuasive tempted me, because the medium blue is something MAC hasn‚Äôt put out really. It has nice color pay off as well. Too bad it is paired with a Deep Truth lookalike; yet another softly shimmered dark navy blue. Inter-view has a dark blackish color with blue tint to it, while the other color is a rich, warm-toned brown with gold flecks in it. The brown was incredibly pretty, actually. Fluidline Silverstroke isn‚Äôt swatched, because it‚Äôs normally available. It‚Äôs a silver gel liner, very metallic-y. Blacktrack is awesome, and you should have it if you don‚Äôt already! Beauty Powder Blush Enough Said is a peachy-brown shade with lots of gold flecks of shimmer in it. The texture and feel is beyond stunning, and the pigmentation is perfect. Stark Naked reminds me of a much pinker NARS Orgasm, actually! It is a medium toned pink base with gold and peach shimmer. Love it! Nail Laquer Rougmearie is a creamy vibrant blue-based red. Beiged Bliss is more of a brown with a little bit of gold and bronze in it.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-10-16 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>8db4896dd69efdfc310c5fe8b29a1ae2970fa7a6</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Bobbi Brown Black Velvet Lip Color: Black Maple, Black Raspberry</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tag/bobbi-brown-black-raspberry-lipstick/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Bobbi Brown Black Velvet Lip Color: Black Maple, Black Raspberry Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Sep 02, 2010 September 02, 2010 Bobbi Brown Lip Color : Black Maple, Black Raspberry Color May Not Appear as in the Tube Bobbi Brown Lip Color ($22.00 for 0.12 oz.) now includes two new shades for fall from the Black Velvet Collection : Black Maple (black red plum) and Black Raspberry (black burgundy). Black Maple is a rich burgundy brown. On my lips, it looks nearly opaque with a slight sheen. Black Raspberry is a semi-sheer browned red. It‚Äôs a different way to wear the red lip‚Äìit‚Äôs not an in-your-face kind of red, and it‚Äôs not incredibly dark either. It has a rather glaze-like finish, where there‚Äôs some sheerness up close, but it looks more cohesive and opaque from afar. There‚Äôs a funny thing about these lipsticks/swatches; they don‚Äôt look like they line up. Black Maple looks burgundy in the tube, while Black Raspberry looks nearly black‚Äìand yet it‚Äôs actually much, much lighter. I actually had to swatch them both again as I started to write out the review to make sure I didn‚Äôt have it written wrong in my notes! They both seem to be a little on the cooler side. Bobbi Brown‚Äôs Lipsticks are scent- and taste-free, which is something that can difficult to find high-end lipsticks. With these deeper, darker shades, I find myself getting between four and five hours of wear. They apply without difficulty, though I do find myself needing to check the application to ensure smooth, even color. I don‚Äôt find them drying, but I think if you have really dry lips, you may not find they‚Äôre very moisturizing either. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 26/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 RECOMMENDATION: I like these shades, though I‚Äôm not in love with them. They could apply a smidgen more evenly! Black Maple is surprisingly more wearable than the name would lead you to believe.

Year: 2008 Launches Aug 27, 2008 August 27, 2008 We all know LUSH as an eco-friendly brand, but this really takes it to the next level! Today, at 12 PM sharp, they will be leading a protest that urges shoppers to go ‚Äúnaked‚Äù by purchasing products free of packaging. The main event is located in NYC (Outside LUSH Soho, Broadway, &amp; Spring St.), but the activity will also take place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta, Washington DC, Orlando, Portland, Aspen, Boulder, Carmel, Pasadena, Scottsdale, Maui, Annapolis, Bethesda, St. Louis, Las Vegas, Kansas City and Providence. Why are LUSH employees shedding their clothes to talk about packaging? The environment is one of the biggest global issues we face today. In order to combat climate change and to protect the Earth‚Äôs scarce natural resources, shoppers need to take action by avoiding packaged goods. Unnecessary packaging can be found in almost every retailer: loose fruit individually shrink-wrapped or on plastic trays in supermarkets, the prolific use of plastic carrier bags and the mountains of plastic bottles used for cosmetic products are all contributing to the growing environmental crisis. Did you know‚Ä¶ LUSH only uses 100% post-consumer waste bottles for their plastic bottles? Their paper bags, cardboard boxes, and reusable tins are all made from recycled materials? Good luck to those very brave employees! You wouldn‚Äôt catch me struttin‚Äô my birthday suit all over town, even for a good cause, but then again, maybe I need to go on How To Look Good Naked , and then I‚Äôd be all over it.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-08-27 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>5a9720d96beb4102fa7437d66e88b9512f46ff33</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Spa Sister Microfiber Hair Towel for Faster Hair Drying?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/spa-sister-microfiber-hair-towel-for-faster-hair-drying/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Spa Sister Microfiber Hair Towel for Faster Hair Drying? Reviews Aug 15, 2008 August 15, 2008 Spa Sister‚Äôs Microfiber Hair Towel ($12.00) purports to quickly absorb moisture from the hair. It‚Äôs supposed to reduce the amount of time you‚Äôll spend blow drying your hair. The towel is a big bigger than a regular hand towel (the ‚Äúmedium‚Äù sized towel ‚Äì bigger than a wash cloth, smaller than a bath towel), and it is incredibly lightweight and feels quite thin. I imagine it‚Äôs the microfiber that keeps it so featherweight. I have long, thick hair, so I‚Äôm always on the lookout for anything that minimizes my drying time, so I jumped on this product when I heard about it. What I liked most about the product is how lightweight it felt, because I‚Äôll often put my hair up in a regular towel when I don‚Äôt feel like blow drying. I find having all my hair piled up on my head is weighty enough, and the towel just makes me feel a bit dragged down. Spa Sister‚Äôs towel doesn‚Äôt do that ‚Äì I don‚Äôt even notice. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúThe towel doesn‚Äôt way that much!‚Äù It just might weigh more when the water gets transferred into the towel from my hair, though! Anyway, in the past, whenever I‚Äôve towel-wrapped my hair, I get a crick in my neck. It doesn‚Äôt happen when I‚Äôve used the microfiber towel, which is a huge plus in my book. It does absorb a good amount of water, and the towel itself dries fast ‚Äì so it‚Äôs absorbing, drying, and absorbing more faster than the typical towel. I don‚Äôt feel like it trims a lot of time off of hair drying when I‚Äôm using it after washing my hair; it does reduce the time, but only by a few minutes. I‚Äôd say it might make my hair drying time 20% faster. I think it‚Äôs great for when your hair is wet, but not soaking wet (like from the shower) ‚Äì like the gym or the pool. For twelve bucks, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd recommend to those who often towel-dry their hair. I like it better than my regular, boring old towel.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-08-15 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>b306ed803de5d2c603d52ad08aedd2314f13c7bb</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics Adoring Carmine Holiday 2008 Gift Sets Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-adoring-carmine-holiday-2008-gift-sets-review/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics Adoring Carmine Holiday 2008 Gift Sets Review Reviews Oct 16, 2008 October 16, 2008 OVERALL , Adoring Carmine didn‚Äôt impress me like it originally did when I saw the promo photos for the launch. The packaging just isn‚Äôt as sleek and luxe as it looked in the images. Instead, the bright patent red portion of the bag looks too much for me. I also found that most of the lipsticks were just too sheer for my personal preference! I did pick up the Rose Lips set, mostly because of the pink gloss, which caught my eye. See swatches here ! Get the detailed reviews for each product‚Ä¶ Neutral Lips Set My Dear is a dirty pink color with a touch of beige in it. Real Treasure is a sheer, glossy brownish color with just a touch of pink in it. Soft Spot is a super sheer soft pink color that reminded me of the shimmer of Pink Opal pigment. Rose Lips Set Delicate is a blue-based pastel pink color, probably not my most complimentary color, but it‚Äôs not something I have. To Swoon For is a semi-sheer blue-based pink, but it‚Äôs not as cool as the lipglass. Romancin ‚Äò is a creamy pink-plum color with more pigmentation than most of the lipsticks. Red Lips Set Frostlight is a clear shimmery gloss with white flecks. Racy is a frosty burnt red with subtle shimmer; this shade had the best pay off overall. Adore It is a subdued pinkish red‚Äìit looks red in the tube, but because it‚Äôs sheerer, it goes on more like a pink than a true red.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-10-16 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>60a5cd29c5eebaa42024933e5cfc0eafbeee2bc7</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Look Book ‚Äì What would you pair MAC‚Äôs Nuance mineralize blush with?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/look-book-what-would-you-pair-macs-nuance-mineralize-blush-with/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Look Book ‚Äì What would you pair MAC‚Äôs Nuance mineralize blush with?

It has a medium glossy glint and rich, opaque color. The coverage is excellent, and it feels lightweight despite its pigmentation. It‚Äôs also more moisturizing than your average lipstick, which makes it comfortable to wear. I get about five hours of wear with this shade in particular, because it is more pigmented. Estee Lauder‚Äôs lipsticks are scented with a lightly sweetened fig but are taste-free to me. Is this the right red for you? Would you wear it? The Sultry Season is a series of posts featuring deep, rich shades of brown, berry, plum, and wine lipsticks and lipglosses ‚Äî just right for autumn ‚Äî that runs through October 2010.

It has the coveted mineralize skinfinishes in Petticoat and So Ceylon, plus permament and newcomer Soft &amp; Gentle. Several mineralize duos are back in action, though those aren‚Äôt really up my alley, despite looking so pretty when swatched. Sheer Minerals/Mineralize consists of a lot of mineral face products (foundations, powders, etc.) that will be permament. Some products will switch out as they release new ones (like the eyeshadows). I picked up the mineralize skinfinishes (this is probably my third time owning Petticoat‚Äìmaybe I‚Äôll keep it this time!) and the sheersheen powders. I already have several mineralize blushes, so I could pass on those! See swatches here ! Get the detailed reviews for each product‚Ä¶ Mineralize Skinfinish Soft &amp; Gentle is a gilded gold color, it‚Äôs almost a soft peachy-gold in a sense. This would compliment warm-tones very well as a nice highlighter. It doesn‚Äôt give a ton of color, though. Petticoat is a raspberry-pink kind of color, which does look lovely when swatched (moreso than I remember). So Ceylon is a richer bronze color, which would look lovely on both deeper skin tones as well as lighter ones. Mineralize Eyeshadow Duos Illusionary.Burning Ambition consists of a whitish-yellow gold color (similar to Nylon, but yellower), which I find appealing and lovely. The other shade is a rich, gold-flecked brown. Bright Side/Gallery Gal is a duo with a golden-toned olive green and a peachy-pink white shade. The green calls to me, but I stand strong for now! Heat/Element is a coppery red color (think Coppering) matched with a brighter, more gold than bronze color. Engaging has a coppery bronze color (not as bright as Amber Lights) and a soft whitish pink color. Earthly Riches is a combination of a deep, purple with black flecks and dark gray-black. Family Silver comes with a medium toned silvery-gray and then a brighter, more metallic shade of silver. Mineralize Sheersheen Powder Lucent is a soft pink color with subtle shimmer‚Äìthese are great for highlighting. Silver Aura is a soft white highlighter with a touch of beige to make it more wearable. These go on strong if you aren‚Äôt careful; a little goes a long way, and then you sheer it out for just a subtle bit of shimmer. I wore this and loved it (and I‚Äôm NC30). Sheerbronze is an intense coppery bronze color with lots of gold shimmer. You definitely have to use a light hand with this if you‚Äôre lighter toned (that goes for me, too), because it will show up vividly. I find this photographs a lot like Other Worldly ‚Äî not well!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-10-16 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>2ff46ad5e41fb96106758cb8373400fa53d91556</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cremesheen Color Story Information</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cremesheen-color-story-information/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cremesheen Color Story Information Year: 2008 Launches Jul 15, 2008 July 15, 2008 MAC Cosmetics Cremesheen (October 2nd, 2008) (This is not a promotional image for the launch ‚Äì model is wearing Speed Dial Cremesheen, though, from D Magazine shoot.)

It‚Äôs designed for application, blending, and smudging‚Äìso it can pretty much do it all in a pinch. I LOVE this for the face. I find it works really well to blend and apply liquid foundation all over the face, but it also works well to spot-blend concealer. It‚Äôs incredibly soft and not at all rough or tugging, which is why it does a good job for even the delicate eye area. As far as foundation goes, you wet the sponge, squeeze any excess water out, dab your foundation on it, and then apply to your face. What are the downsides? If you remember the buzz over the BeautyBlender , then you can rest assured that this is a worthy competitor, and a better bang for your buck (half the price!). It is somewhat larger, and it is obviously a different shape. I don‚Äôt find either to be a hinderance in application or usage. I think the only area where people may run into problems is cleaning it. I found that rinsing it with water first, and then adding a bit of baby shampoo helped me. The other thing is, if you‚Äôre in a hurry, this might not be the best way to go about daily application. You don‚Äôt want to let it sit dirty or keep re-using it without washing, which adds some time to the routine. With the great application you get, it is definitely worth it when you have the time or a really special occasion to go to‚Äìwhen you want to look your very best. If you‚Äôre anything like me, the flawless skin is priority number one towards looking your very best.

It is supposed to be filled with ‚Äúgood-for-you‚Äù ingredients. I‚Äôve yet to fall head over heels in love with any mineral foundation; I feel like I get more on my bathroom counter and my shirt (and somehow, I am always wearing black when I try a mineral foundation!) than my face. I also find that loose powders, in general, settle more into the lines and pores of my face, making my skin seem rougher. Prescriptives‚Äô mineral makeup does not share this common trait; I find that it doesn‚Äôt settle in the lines around my lips (those pesky smile wrinkles), which is a huge plus for me. So the fact that it doesn‚Äôt settle into fine lines makes this a supreme choice for those of us who are experiencing those telltale signs of aging and want to minimize‚Äìor at least not emphasize (!)‚Äìthem. Any downsides? I do feel the product gives you a little bit of a ‚Äúglow‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs not an ultra matte finish, which is what I‚Äôm used to (love you, SFF!), but it is a nice treat for minimal days. Add to the fact that it does indeed feel weightless and virtually as if you weren‚Äôt wearing makeup, it is a great option for those who haven‚Äôt settled on a foundation yet. With eighteen shades to choose from, most should be able to find a shade that matches their skintone. And hey, when all else fails? Px also does some amazing custom blending (well, I have heard this over and over again, haven‚Äôt yet succumbed myself‚Ä¶), which is really worth it if you‚Äôve spent years hunting for the perfect color match without luck. This is a light to medium coverage foundation; it starts out light and is buildable up to medium. I personally prefer a medium coverage foundation most often (so long as it feels lightweight!), and this gives me enough coverage to keep it around. Yes, the product has bismuth in it, though it is far down on the ingredients list. Many of you love BE, which also includes bismuth in it. A lot of people do not react poorly to bismuth (MAC, by the way, uses bismuth in many, many of their products, so you may want to try it), actually. Generally, those who do react feel like their skin is itchy or slight burning sensation.

You should check out Philosophy‚Äôs Never Let Them See You Shine line. The line is a trio of products, consisting of a primer ($20.00), a cleanser ($20.00), and a scrub ($20.00). The primer feels smooth, velvety ‚Äì it sinks into the skin and helps keep your makeup looking fresher all day. The primer both mattifies and keeps oil away throughout the day, which allows you to reduce the shine and oily appearance on your face. My skin is pretty normal, but on occasion my forehead might get a touch oily. I found this never happened when I wore the primer. Let me tell you about the cleanser and exfoliating scrub! The cleanser is very much in line with other cleansers, but this product purports to control oil and shine without drying out your skin. I can vouch for the fact that it doesn‚Äôt dry out your skin (yay!), and it does have a bit of a ‚Äúcooling sensation‚Äù after you‚Äôve used it (but nothing intense, very subtle). My skin feels soft and hydrated after using this, and I don‚Äôt feel like I have to reach for my moisturizer as soon as I‚Äôve used my cleanser. It also emulsifies nicely, and I‚Äôm all about that! The scrub has jojoba beads and diatomaceous earth to exfoliate the skin, while dissolving dirt and oil. From what I can tell, you can use the cleanser or scrub, but you don‚Äôt need to use both simultaneously. I‚Äôd recommend using the cleanser daily, and then use the scrub in its place every 2-3 days for exfoliation. The exfoliating agents in the scrub aren‚Äôt overly harsh or rough, so it can be used every morning (Philosophy says as much!), though.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-08-16 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>16aa3ec84c980533d40896b3751acdc79ce3310e</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Benefit‚Äôs One Hot Minute for Insta-Awake Glow</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/benefits-one-hot-minute-for-insta-awake-glow/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Benefit‚Äôs One Hot Minute for Insta-Awake Glow Reviews May 27, 2009 May 27, 2009 Breakfast with Benefit: One Hot Minute This morning, I drove up to San Francisco to have a little breakfast at the Benefit Boutique with the Benefit Team. In attendance were a few other local bloggers (hey, there aren‚Äôt that many of us Bay Area bloggers!), like my girl Karen of Makeup &amp; Beauty Blog , Lilan of The Daily Cookie , and Sonja of The Coveted . Benefit was hosting an event exclusively for bloggers to preview One Hot Minute‚Äìtheir newest addition to their line-up. Benefit One Hot Minute ($30.00) is one of the newest products to be launched by Benefit this summer. Called the ‚ÄúSexy-in-Seconds-Face-Powder,‚Äù it‚Äôs all about getting an easy, all over natural glow/finish in no time flat. Available exclusively at Sephora in July (and then available at counters in September), One Hot Minute is an extremely fine milled, loose powder meant for all skin tones. At the breakfast event, each of us bloggers got a little makeover a la Benefit, and of course, it featured the new product! (And you can see a full-face photo of me included in this post!) I‚Äôve always been a sucker for Benefit‚Äôs packaging, because it‚Äôs cute with a vintage edge and a modern twist. Plus, my first ever makeup haul was Benefit back in high school, so I always get a bit nostalgic when I use Benefit, too. One Hot Minute comes in a copper tin, and it includes a small, almost miniature-sized fan brush (but it‚Äôs a bit curvier ‚Äî reminds me of a peacock spreading his tail). There is also a ‚Äúsifter guard‚Äù to help keep your powder intact. Benefit makeup artists recommended using their fantail brush ($22.00) if you‚Äôre not on-the-go, but the included brush will do for touch-ups. (I always prefer to use my own brushes, because I like brushes with handles for more control!) One Hot Minute is a silky powder that gives you a ‚Äúluminous‚Äù finish, which is really that subtle, natural glow we‚Äôre all after. It‚Äôs not shimmery, shiny, or glittery. It really just gives you a very soft, subtle sheen and enhances your natural skin tone. It is also really quite universal, because the lovely Erin of Benefit is far fairer than I, and she was rockin‚Äô One Hot Minute. Karen of MBB is also significantly deeper in skin tone than myself, and she worked it, too. I was surprised, because the powder does look colored initially, but it really isn‚Äôt since we‚Äôre all wearing the same product. Benefit describes it as a ‚Äúloose rose-gold finishing powder‚Ä¶ for a gaze-at-me-glow.‚Äù (O h, by the way, Benefit is giving you 20% off ‚Äî but you can only use the code once per customer ‚Äî for a few days! Just use code MAKEUP20, good through May 29th. ) You can see for yourself how it looks like when applied ‚Äî see photos, swatches, and more ! Edited : A few of you have been inquiring as to what I‚Äôm wearing (makeup-wise, duh), and it‚Äôs a bit difficult to tell you. I first wore a look using MAC Juxt, Nehru, Bottle Green, and Soft Force (to-be-posted), and I wore Korres Tinted Moisturizer before arriving, too. During my ‚ÄúOne Hot Minute‚Äù makeover, Katie, the Benefit makeup artist, applied Hello Flawless! (in Honey) to touch-up, Posietint on cheeks and lips, and BeneTint on lips; then One Hot Minute all over. She layered Benefit‚Äôs Birthday Suit on the inner lid and Skinny Jeans on the outer lid; she used BadGal to line and BadGal mascara on lashes.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2009-05-27 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>4585e1def670ffd89143701137d1b3b3b34e6889</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Backstage Beauty: Keri Hilson @ TRL with MAC</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/backstage-beauty-keri-hilson-trl-with-mac/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Backstage Beauty: Keri Hilson @ TRL with MAC zArchived Jul 15, 2008 July 15, 2008 Keri Hilson will being debuting her solo album this September, so she‚Äôs been increasing her guest appearances, including 106th &amp; Park yesterday, as well TRL (which will air Wednesday).

Site News Aug 16, 2008 August 16, 2008 Aloha, all! For the next week, I am in Kauai (an island of Hawaii), vacationing with my family. (The boy is staying at home, and he gets to be on Mellan-sitting-duty!) Now, don‚Äôt run off thinking this means the blog will be at a stand still. No, no, NO! I have plenty of content geared up to post, and I expect to make plenty ‚Äòo posts about what I do, learn, and see in Hawaii when it comes to beauty. And I have no doubt I will learn a lot about water-resistant and heat-resistant makeup! I also tend to be much better at applying makeup everyday while on vacation, so I‚Äôll be showing you regular looks. You won‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm gone. In fact, you‚Äôll probably wonder if I ever relaxed at all! üòâ It‚Äôs my first time in Kauai ‚Äì I‚Äôve only been to Honolulu a few times in the past, and probably not for a good ten years since my last visit. If you have any spots or things to do to recommend, feel free!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-08-16 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>0d4e342d98ba645111ad7b1441ef6a1e763c1949</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Benefit‚Äôs One Hot Minute for Insta-Awake Glow</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tag/setting-powders/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Benefit‚Äôs One Hot Minute for Insta-Awake Glow Reviews May 27, 2009 May 27, 2009 Breakfast with Benefit: One Hot Minute This morning, I drove up to San Francisco to have a little breakfast at the Benefit Boutique with the Benefit Team. In attendance were a few other local bloggers (hey, there aren‚Äôt that many of us Bay Area bloggers!), like my girl Karen of Makeup &amp; Beauty Blog , Lilan of The Daily Cookie , and Sonja of The Coveted . Benefit was hosting an event exclusively for bloggers to preview One Hot Minute‚Äìtheir newest addition to their line-up. Benefit One Hot Minute ($30.00) is one of the newest products to be launched by Benefit this summer. Called the ‚ÄúSexy-in-Seconds-Face-Powder,‚Äù it‚Äôs all about getting an easy, all over natural glow/finish in no time flat. Available exclusively at Sephora in July (and then available at counters in September), One Hot Minute is an extremely fine milled, loose powder meant for all skin tones. At the breakfast event, each of us bloggers got a little makeover a la Benefit, and of course, it featured the new product! (And you can see a full-face photo of me included in this post!) I‚Äôve always been a sucker for Benefit‚Äôs packaging, because it‚Äôs cute with a vintage edge and a modern twist. Plus, my first ever makeup haul was Benefit back in high school, so I always get a bit nostalgic when I use Benefit, too. One Hot Minute comes in a copper tin, and it includes a small, almost miniature-sized fan brush (but it‚Äôs a bit curvier ‚Äî reminds me of a peacock spreading his tail). There is also a ‚Äúsifter guard‚Äù to help keep your powder intact. Benefit makeup artists recommended using their fantail brush ($22.00) if you‚Äôre not on-the-go, but the included brush will do for touch-ups. (I always prefer to use my own brushes, because I like brushes with handles for more control!) One Hot Minute is a silky powder that gives you a ‚Äúluminous‚Äù finish, which is really that subtle, natural glow we‚Äôre all after. It‚Äôs not shimmery, shiny, or glittery. It really just gives you a very soft, subtle sheen and enhances your natural skin tone. It is also really quite universal, because the lovely Erin of Benefit is far fairer than I, and she was rockin‚Äô One Hot Minute. Karen of MBB is also significantly deeper in skin tone than myself, and she worked it, too. I was surprised, because the powder does look colored initially, but it really isn‚Äôt since we‚Äôre all wearing the same product. Benefit describes it as a ‚Äúloose rose-gold finishing powder‚Ä¶ for a gaze-at-me-glow.‚Äù (O h, by the way, Benefit is giving you 20% off ‚Äî but you can only use the code once per customer ‚Äî for a few days! Just use code MAKEUP20, good through May 29th. ) You can see for yourself how it looks like when applied ‚Äî see photos, swatches, and more !

If you‚Äôve seen Benefit‚Äôs other powders like CORALista or Dandelion, it‚Äôs the same idea, but the powder is split in half ‚Äî half is a bronzer, half is a highlighter. The highlighter is a light, milky silvery-pink with soft sheen but no real glitter particles (that‚Äôs a good thing, by the way). The bronzer is similar in texture and sheen, except it‚Äôs a peachy-bronze color with gold sheen. You can see how I used it in a look here . 10 is one of those products that takes some trial and error before you can appreciate its genius. Once you do get the hang of it, though, it is a grab-and-go kind of experience. I personally used the 168 and 169 respectively for this product, and I found it worked just right for me. I do suggest using a light hand initially, so you don‚Äôt over-do it or get a ruddy/muddy result. The highlighter is just that‚Äìa highlighter‚Äìso unless you are extremely fair, don‚Äôt go into it expecting to use it as a pink blush!

If you‚Äôve seen Benefit‚Äôs other powders like CORALista or Dandelion, it‚Äôs the same idea, but the powder is split in half ‚Äî half is a bronzer, half is a highlighter. The highlighter is a light, milky silvery-pink with soft sheen but no real glitter particles (that‚Äôs a good thing, by the way). The bronzer is similar in texture and sheen, except it‚Äôs a peachy-bronze color with gold sheen. You can see how I used it in a look here . 10 is one of those products that takes some trial and error before you can appreciate its genius. Once you do get the hang of it, though, it is a grab-and-go kind of experience. I personally used the 168 and 169 respectively for this product, and I found it worked just right for me. I do suggest using a light hand initially, so you don‚Äôt over-do it or get a ruddy/muddy result. The highlighter is just that‚Äìa highlighter‚Äìso unless you are extremely fair, don‚Äôt go into it expecting to use it as a pink blush! See photos and swatches !

I think we could hedge and say it‚Äôs more neutral-cool than really, truly cool-toned. The formula is designed to have intense color payoff, and the eyeshadows are long-wearing and can be used wet or dry (always good to know‚Äìmore brands should note this!). I reviewed Dreamy initially, which I was really digging, and I like this one a lot, too‚Äìit‚Äôs not my personal favorite just by preference, but the quality is lovely and lives up to my readjusted expectations for Tarina Tarantino‚Äôs beauty line. I think Sephora is doing these palettes an injustice by not even taking the time to describe each palette‚Äôs colors! You just get this ridiculously tiny photo of the palette, but I think with a smaller brand like this, more would be better. I noticed this mostly because I like to start off each review with the brand‚Äôs official description of the shade as well as the formula. It helps me to breakdown what I should be looking for and hit on in the review. The top shade in the palette is a cool-toned medium-dark brown with a frosted finish; it‚Äôs almost taupe, but I don‚Äôt think it has quite enough gray tint to make it a true taupe. The pigmentation is excellent, and the texture is dense, buttery, and applies smoothly. It‚Äôs much lighter than the taupe-ish shade in Dreamy (just because at first glance, they seem similar). It‚Äôs a little darker than MAC Magical Mist , cooler-toned and less red-based than Urban Decay Wreckage , and it‚Äôs just a touch cooler-toned compared to Bare Escentuals A-Ha . On the left, there is a bright, frosted gold-tinged white. It‚Äôs almost too light to call it a white gold. It has good color payoff and applies smoothly. It is extremely similar to the white gold shade in Dreamy , but it‚Äôs also similar to several other shades, including theBalm Envious Erin , theBalm Tempting Tara , Urban Decay Zephyr , and Bare Escentuals Breathtaking . It‚Äôs the warmest shade in the palette and definitely not neutral or cool-toned. In the middle, there is a pale neutral pink with a white frost finish. The payoff is decent but could be better here (think 8/10); it‚Äôs not as intense as the other shades in the palette. MAC Fresh Ice is cooler-toned, almost lilac in comparison, while Bare Escentuals Muse is similar but less frosted and more opaque. On the right, there is a barely warmed golden peach with a metallic finish. It‚Äôs smooth and soft, while the pigmentation is good. Inglot #330 reminded me most in terms of color, but it has a matte finish. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything else that was similar, though. The last shade, on the bottom, is a slightly cool-toned dark brown with this slightly warm undertone peeking through. It‚Äôs interesting, because the sheen on this looks gray tinted, but the edging has a warmer tone to it. The texture is almost matte, kind of like half-matte, half-satin; and the color payoff is nice. It‚Äôs a bit grayer and lighter than MAC Charcoal Brown . MAC Double Feature 3 is a bit closer but not quite. Looking at the general range, I think they could have made one or two of these colors more cool-toned, because then they‚Äôd have a genuinely cool-toned but fairly neutral palette to offer. This palette will work well universally, though, because it‚Äôs a mix of cool and warm but for the most part, nothing leans too far in either direction. The color payoff was good on all the shades except the center shade, which was so-so‚Äìbetter than average but not as good as the others. I tested out this palette without a primer (just used three shades on one eye), and it made it to eight hours without creasing or fading, but it had very subtle creasing after ten.

It‚Äôs so fulfilling and satisfying to know you picked just the right thing for that one special person. Similarly, when you receive a gift that‚Äôs exactly what you wanted/needed, you get a sense of how much thought the giver put into the gift. It seemed like several readers struggled trying to figure out what kind of gifts to give friends and family when it came to beauty, particularly because they weren‚Äôt sure what colors to choose. I thought I would touch on some tips born from past experience on that particular issue as well as some more generalized tips and tricks when it comes to the art of great gift giving. Little Touches Count The little things can add tremendous value and appeal to your gift. Think about when someone takes an amazing gift but throws it into a paper bag at the last minute; or how about the time you totally forgot to grab a card and just shoved a gift in someone‚Äôs face? Fancy wrapping or expensive greeting cards are by no means necessary to a great gift, but remembering to take as much time in the presentation of the gift as you did in the acquisition of it is important. You can also keep an eye out for gifts that already come in festive packaging or bags. I do, personally, splurge on fancier gift wrap, because I have a thing for Christmas decor and like to see lots of shine and color under the tree. Holidays come earlier and earlier each year, so you can find great bargains on wrapping paper at local discount stores as well as online. You can also stock up right after the holidays for the next year if you have some storage space! I also like festive ribbons for smaller gifts or awkward-to-wrap gifts. I often make my own cards to attach to gifts with colored card stock and simply scrawl a short and sweet note to the recipient. It‚Äôs Not About the Money I cannot emphasize it enough, but it is the thought that really counts, especially when you‚Äôre not gifting to a five-year-old who‚Äôs been dreaming of the latest gaming system for the past 364 days. But in all seriousness, the majority of people, and hopefully, your dearest friends and family, are not googling what you bought them to see how much you spent on them. Your best friend who is the girliest girl you can imagine doesn‚Äôt want to receive a weed wacker for the holidays, and it‚Äôs just important to know your recipient and find a gift that would resonate with them. Don‚Äôt get caught up in the idea that more is better or that bigger is better! Keep gift ideas in mind all year round, even pricier ones (that are just outside your budget), because if you know your partner has their eye on such-and-such electronic, you can keep an eye out for price drops towards the second half of the year. Sales, Sales, Sales Stemming from looking out for deals on must-give gifts much earlier than the last two months of the year is taking advantage of sales, but I will caution you not to let them take advantage of you! Just because there‚Äôs a sale doesn‚Äôt mean you have to find something for someone there. November is the time for Friends &amp; Family sales and events, several having already taken place, but there are more to come. Similarly, the infamous Black Friday is nearing (along with Cyber Monday), which can be a good opportunity to take advantage of sales. Use Social Media and Networking So much of our lives are now online, from the photos and videos of our lives to our favorite interests. Many people have their favorite social networking sites that they use, and you can learn more about their various interests from a profile. I‚Äôm totally serious here! Sometimes you bond with someone over certain common interests (say, beauty), but you might not know their favorite music or movies. If you have friends or family members who are really active, you might be able to see what kind of things they‚Äôve liked in the past couple of months to help give you an idea of where to start your search from! Gift Guides from Everyone Almost everyone has some sort of gift guide these days, and I don‚Äôt mean bloggers but major retailers and individual brands. Most of them have a section on their website for gift sets/value sets as well as gift guides broken out by price or ‚Äúpersonality.‚Äù Perhaps you have a favorite brand you want a friend to experience or you know your friend‚Äôs favorite brand but you‚Äôve never used anything by them; either way, you can peruse through recommendations from the brand as a great jumping off point. 5-Minute Primer on Beauty Products for Others You have your beauty partner in crime, but you‚Äôre just not confident about buying them something because you don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll good in it or if it‚Äôs a shade they‚Äôd like. There are fantastic items that are more neutral and general that work across skin tones and undertones, but there are certainly plenty of products that just tend to look better on a certain skin tone/undertone. Stealthily get a grasp on their skin tone : if your friend wears a bracelet or watch, you can try to get a look at the underside of their wrist/forearm by asking to see their bracelet/watch close-up. Green veins indicate warmer undertones, while blue veins indicate cooler undertones; if you can‚Äôt really tell, they may be neutral. You can also use the jewelry trick; does your friend wear a lot of gold or silver jewelry? Is there one they look better in? Gold looks better on warmer skin tones, while silver looks better on cooler skin tones‚Äìbut be careful, a lot of people prefer a metal over the other, regardless of their undertone! Think about the colors/styles/products you see them in most : if you‚Äôve never seen your friend wear red lipstick and only baby pinks and barely-there nudes, buying them a red isn‚Äôt necessarily the best way to go (unless you‚Äôre deliberately prodding them to finally wear one and you know the perfect one for them!). Do they wear bold eyes? cheeks? lips? What feature do they emphasize? Something old or something new? Consider whether you‚Äôre trying to simply buy them something they would love to wear, which means it is likely to be similar to other shades they already own (so go see if you can snoop through their makeup bag!) or if you‚Äôre trying to get them to try something they wouldn‚Äôt normally wear (perhaps something they‚Äôve been curious about). Warm undertones look best in shades like earthy neutrals, coppers and bronzes, yellowy greens, metallic golds, corals, oranges, and yellow-based pinks. I believe anyone can wear anything‚Äìit‚Äôs just a matter of pairing it with the right products; this is merely a quickie guideline to pick the most-likely-to-suit products. Cool undertones look best in shades like sooty neutrals, beiges and taupes, charcoal browns and grays, blues, blue-based teals, blue-based reds, fuchsia pinks, berries, cotton candy pinks. Again, this is a mere snapshot of common colors that often work well on those with cooler complexions but you should feel free to wear whatever you like!

Studying several different art forms, Hunter‚Äôs creative background ranges from illustration and photography to fashion and interior design to music production and makeup artistry. He has worked for over a decade as a professional illustrator and his retail interior design concepts have been featured in nation-wide publications, receiving recognition for their uniqueness and creativity. Check out his blog and YouTube channel ! MAC Reflects Transparent Teal Glitter 7 Tried &amp; True Must-Have Products I‚Äôm a sucker for multi-purpose products: pigments, cream and liquid paints, mixing mediums, etc. I like to custom-blend just about everything! Not everyone feels the same way, though, and sometimes, it‚Äôs nice to have one product that does a job and does it well. These are some of my tried-and-true favorites from a few different companies (hopefully some that you haven‚Äôt heard of before)! Est√©e Lauder Pure Color Lipstick | Their Long Lasting Cream finishes are some of the best lipsticks I own. They cover well and feel luxurious on the lips. The BEST ones are almost always limited edition. Favorites in the Permanent Range: Cherry Passion, Melon and Rose Tea . Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics Lip Tars | I‚Äôm actually not a huge fan of these on the lips, but, OH, the blushes these make! They last forever and blend like a dream (they DO have mint in them though so avoid the eye area). Favorites: Cha-Cha and Divine . Face Atelier Ultra Sheer | I love these liquid luminizers because you can mix them with foundation, cream blush or bronzer for glowing skin or apply them on their own (I use a fluffy blush brush) for a natural highlighting effect. Favorites: Champagne . Terra Firma Gel Mineral Matte Finish Bronzer | I use this on myself all the time. It‚Äôs highly pigmented (I dilute it with body lotion), long-wearing, won‚Äôt rub off on clothes and looks SO amazingly natural ‚Äì If most bronzers are too orange for you, look no further! (There‚Äôs also a shimmering version if you like to twinkle.) MAC Reflects Glitters | A MAC PRO exclusive (but anyone can buy from MAC PRO). I‚Äôve used these in a multitude of ways: mixing custom lip gloss, over mascara for sparkling lashes, on top of just any eye look, pressed over lipstick for a metallic foil effect, as a face and body highlight, worked into a hairstyle, etc. Not many things are THIS pretty! (Be aware that MAC lists these products as ‚Äúnot for use in the eye area.‚Äù) Favorites: Reflects Bronze, Reflects Gold and Reflects Transparent Teal . MAC Blot Powder and Purely Cosmetics Diamond Perfect Finish Powder | My two favorite setting powders! Blot Powder by MAC is perfect for mattifying a look without adding any color or texture. Diamond Perfect Finish Powder by Purely Cosmetics is a transparent loose powder that easily outperforms the transparent powders I have from MAC and MUFE (smoother application, better line diffusing AND it doesn‚Äôt bounce light back in photography).

If you missed it, I already posted the under $30 guide! üôÇ Eyes: Long-time readers know I‚Äôm a huge fan of Aqua Eyes, and the Make Up For Ever Wild &amp; Chic Aqua Eyes Collection ($36.00) contains five travel-sized (I‚Äôm guessing 0.02 to 0.03 oz.) and one full-size (0.04 oz.) eyeliner; for the price of two full-sized eyeliners, you‚Äôre getting six shades to try of a fantastic formula. Urban Decay also has two Eyeliner Sets ($32.00 each) that contain five travel-sized 24/7 Eyeliners; there is also a Shadow Pencil Stash ($34.00). At this price point, you can find some excellent palettes that came out just in time for the holidays, like Urban Decay Mariposa Eyeshadow Palette ($39.00) and Bare Escentuals Ready 8.0 Eyeshadow Palette ($40.00). Cheeks/Face: Too Faced In Your Dreams Makeup Collection ($39.00) is an eye, cheek, and lip palette that‚Äôs great for someone new to makeup; I like it because everything is presented in an easy-to-digest manner, and the colors coordinate with each other, so there is no guessing. Benefit Project Flawless ($32.00) is a cutely packaged set that contains a highlighter (Girl Meets Pearl), mascara, lipgloss (Foxy Lady), and blush (Bella Bamba). If that‚Äôs not quite to your taste, you could check out Romancing the Mirror ($39.00), which contains That Gal, Sugarbomb, and BADgal Lash. Lips: I‚Äôve been really digging Bobbi Brown‚Äôs High Shimmer Lip Gloss Trio ($38.00); they‚Äôre fairly sheer, but they had so much dazzle and shine without feeling gritty‚ÄìI‚Äôve been reaching for these (because I need to do lip swatches for them!) to layer on top of other lipsticks. Estee Lauder‚Äôs Pure Color Gloss to Go Set ($32.50) comes in a cute red faux leather zipper cylinder case with six holiday-appropriate glosses, and I like that it‚Äôs ready to give (there‚Äôs also a lipstick version). Skin/Body: I love the way Estee Lauder set-up their skincare gift sets this year; they categorize them based on theme, like even skin tone or anti-wrinkle. Clinique has an excellent set for dry skin (Moisture Surge has saved my skin before!) called Total Moisture ($44.00). Consider giving a decadent, luxurious body cream in the form of this Laura Mercier Souffle Body Creme Sampler Set ($50.00 for 4√ó3 oz.). Fragrance: Elegantly packaged, convenient to use, and full-sized, Tocca Beauty Rollerball Trio ($48.00 for 3√ó0.33 oz.) contains three different scents (Florence, Cleopatra, and Colette), which can be gifted as a set or easily broken up. Juicy Couture ($35.00 for 3√ó0.33 oz.) also has a trio of fragrance sprays of their signature scents. Fresh Sugar Obsessions Rollerball Trio ($35.00 for 3√ó0.34 oz.) contains popular Fresh scents, and if you have a foodie friend, this might be a good one for them. What‚Äôs really great about rollerballs is they‚Äôre easy to give, and they can be re-gifted, too‚Äìif you give your friend a kit, and they dislike one scent, it‚Äôs so easy for them to pass along to a friend/family member. Do you have any suggestions for readers on the prowl for holiday gifts this year that came out just in time for holiday gift-giving?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-11-16 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>8e448a9df6ba528b054666a4055fbe8972d86c2a</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Mineral Makeup Brand Spotlight: Jane Iredale</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mineral-makeup-brand-spotlight-jane-iredale/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Mineral Makeup Brand Spotlight: Jane Iredale Reviews Jun 22, 2008 June 22, 2008 Jane Iredale is a full-line of mineral-based cosmetics. It first was introduced back in 1994, which makes it one of the more established mineral makeup brands available today. Some products I enjoyed: Amazing Base SPF 20 ($42.00) is one of Jane Iredale‚Äôs signature and best-selling products. It is a loose mineral foundation that gives a good amount of coverage without having oil, talc, dyes, or parabens. It is considered a water-resistant formula. I like that it has a lot of range in the colors it offers, which is always ideal so customers can choose the appropriate tone for themselves. If you‚Äôre not so keen on loose powder, think about trying Liquid Minerals ($46.00), which definitely caught my eye (and I hope to try sometime!). In Touch Cream Blush ($26.00) comes in five shades, all equally gorgeous. I really enjoyed Charisma for its subtle raspberry color. These mineral cream blushes come in a stick form, which makes application incredibly easy, even on the go. Active Light ($25.00) is an undereye concealer that comes in liquid form‚Äìwhich I think is great. I find that powder concealers never work quite as well as liquid does for me, though I couldn‚Äôt really tell you why. I also like that it comes in the form of a pen, which makes it even easier to apply and really get into the areas I need. Other products you may be interested in: Jane Iredale Sample Kit ($28.00), Moonglow Bronzer ($46.00), 24K Gold Dust Powder ($34.00), Eye Gloss ($15.00), and LipColour SPF 18 ($19.00). What could they improve on? Their prices seem a bit all over the map‚Äìtheir foundations are $40 or higher, while they have several lip products and staples under $20. I do feel the foundation seems a bit pricey, but I do like Jane Iredale‚Äôs overall quality and feel it may be worth it to those who can afford.

The packaging for the Colour Forms Collection is a glossy black, rather than MAC‚Äôs usual matte black, and there is a metallic red sticker that says ‚ÄúMAC Cosmetics.‚Äù Yes, it is a sticker, but it seemed much better adhered than the Fafi episode. It almost looks like metal, so they did a much better job with these stickers. The packaging for the palettes and brush sets is a mixture of brightly colored satin-y compacts that flip open and close by magnets. It‚Äôs fun packaging, which I think works well with the summer months. It doesn‚Äôt feel cheap or flimsy, either, which is something that is always a concern when it comes to mass-produced palettes. I didn‚Äôt take a super close look at the brush sets ‚Äì the packaging is just like the eye and lip palettes, and it seems like there‚Äôs a brush case and a brush bag, but I‚Äôm not 100% on that. A word on the new products‚Ä¶ The lipsticks do, in fact, have a true inner core, which is the same across all of the lipsticks, and it is a sheer, shimmery golden kind of color. I couldn‚Äôt tell you how it really changes the lipstick, as it all muddles together during application ‚Äì I think it may add some golden sheen. The richmetal highlighters do look like CCBs, and to be honest, it‚Äôs hard to tell them apart. They do seem creamer than some of the CCBs I‚Äôve tried in the past, so perhaps it‚Äôs more like an improved formulation of the CCB? The Colour Form Powders are both very pretty, though I‚Äôm biased and prefer Suncentered, which is warmer and has a nice level of shimmer. I think people will enjoy these, though ‚Äì especially those who liked beauty powders. You can see official product descriptions here . Check out individual product reviews‚Ä¶ Lipsticks Rose Go Around is a sheer, creamy deep red with soft sheen. I think this may be a great red for those who are new to red lipstick. Because it is sheer, it can be built up or easily blotted. It is also creamy and moisturizing. Pop Circle is a cool pink, not quite ‚Äúpornstar pink,‚Äù because it has a great golden sheen to it, as well as it‚Äôs not quite that frosty. Naked to the Core is the lightest of the four with its sheer, pinky-nude color and lots of golden shimmer (assumably from the inner core). Inner Hue is a creamy coral, not too orange nor too pink, with low sheen. I think this is a pretty color, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be wearable for most people, too. Richmetal Highlighters Positive Charge is a warm, rich brown with a gentle sheen. For those with deeper skin tones, this may actually work as a highlighter (because you can sheer it out). Otherwise, I presume these are to be used on the eyes. This would be a nice color for a neutral look. Dark Influence is a very pretty, intense purple ‚Äì kind of like Parfait Amour, but very true-to-color. Rose Buillon reminds me of a softer Rose pigment, without the chunky particles. This is a soft rose with a bit of gold pearl to it. This one would make a great cream blush! Deep Deposit is an insanely rich and intense burgundy-brown. I really liked this color, though I‚Äôm not full of ideas as to how I would personally use it. Quick Flash is a low sheen gold with just a touch of antique gold, but not a lot. It isn‚Äôt a bright gold like Goldmine eyeshadow, but it‚Äôs not so dark or cool. I‚Äôm sure this would make a nice sheen on cheeks aside from its usage on the eyes. Female is a cool pink color, very creamy, and again, it would make a nice blush. I make sure to talk about other usages beyond the eyes, because I haven‚Äôt had the chance to test these in a look, so I have no insight as to whether or not these are likely to crease or not. Pigments Royal Flush is cranberry-red color, probably more red than purple/cranberry. It does remind me a bit of Accent Red, or a less-intense Ruby Red. Jardin Aires is released once again, and it is still the same white-gold with peachy-gold shimmer and pearl. Pretty, but the texture is still a bit on the chunky side, so it‚Äôs not my favorite in terms of texture, but the color makes a nice neutral. Tea Time is an interesting shade of brown with gold undertones to it. It‚Äôs actually quite difficult to describe, but I imagine I will be picking it up. I think the texture allows you to get a less frosty finish than the typical pigment, which will make it great for those looking for softer looks. It was quite smooth when I swatched it as well. Steel Blue is a permanent color, and it is a chunkier pigment. It is blue with gold/greenish reflects in it. It‚Äôs not a bad color, but I do find that it takes more work to get it going in a look than other pigments. Gilded Green is a lovely pastel green with gold pearl. It reminds me a lot of Pastorale (but with way better texture) and Golder‚Äôs Green (though lighter, more pastel). Circa Plum is a great lilac-plum color, but it does remind me of Lovely Lily (perhaps a shade or two darker, not as frosty) and Quietly‚Äìnearly a dead ringer, from what I remember (it‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve played with Quietly). I believe Quietly was an Asia-only release, so it was not as readily available stateside. Colour Form Powder Sun Centered contains four different colors found in the same compact. They basically are around each other, and to be honest, it‚Äôll be pretty hard to get individual swipes of colors if you intend to use this with any face brush. (I was using a q-tip to swatch, and even that was difficult on one or two of the colors!) So while individually, the colors are quite lovely, together they makeup a peachy-gold color with light sheen that‚Äôll compliment warm tones amazingly. I was kind of reminded of Pearl Sunshine beauty powder, but more pigmented. Play Around Pink is filled with cooler, blue-based pinks. When swirled together, you get a cool shade of baby doll pink with low level pearl. I found this one was chalkier than Sun Centered when I swirled everything together. I think this shade of cool pink is similar to Don‚Äôt Be Shy from Barbie Loves MAC (which is an awesome shade that works for both cool and warm shades!). If so, that would be great, because I know a lot of people missed out on Barbie Loves MAC products. Warm Eyes Palette Chillproof is a frosty white‚Äìno hint of peach, gold, pink, etc.‚Äìit is truly a stark white. If anything, it almost has a silver reflective sheen to it because it‚Äôs so frosty and white. Tancentric is a peachy brown with soft gold sheen. It reminds me of some of the neutrals from MAC‚Äôs permanent line. Rolled Gold is a pretty golden olive with gold shimmer color. It seems a lot like Golden Olive pigment in eyeshadow form; it may be a little darker and less frosty, though. Rustic is an incredibly pretty color‚Äìit is a rich, antique red color. I‚Äôm not sure how it would swatch next to Coppering (which runs a bit orangey-red). I would say they do seem different enough. Fertile is a cool, dark brown that goes on soft and doesn‚Äôt feel too chalky (it is a satin). I believe this color has come out before, though I‚Äôm not positive. Cool Eyes Palette Radial Pink is a chalky white with pink undertones. I don‚Äôt see myself use this; it‚Äôs in the same family as Vellum. Brown Border is a frosty plum that looks very much like Circa Plum pigment! It also reminds me of Thunder eyeshadow from the Thunder Eyes Quad. Spot Colour is a cool purple with blue undertones, low shimmer. If you remember the soft sparkle pencils, one of them had a similar color to this. For a lustre, it had surprisingly smooth texture and great color pay off. Blue Spill is a satiny medium sky-blue. It‚Äôs not quite the bright sky blue, but more of the summery sky blue. I actually think this color is very lovely, and because it isn‚Äôt a frosty blue, it doesn‚Äôt feel like a regurgitation of the navy blues of the past few launches. Slate is a smoky gray in a satin finish, making it appear quite matte, but it goes on more smoothly. Warm Lips Palette Flash of Flesh is a sheer, peachy gloss with pink undertones. This has come out in the past. Fresh and Fun is something that called to me as soon as I swatched it‚Äìit‚Äôs such a great coral color. A bit of a brighter coral, rather than a muted one. Oh Garnet is a sheer raspberry-burgundy color with plum undertones. Cool Lips Palette Virginity is a soft pink with plummy-purple undertones. Miss Rose is a very cool blue-pink, reminds me a bit of Melrose Mood from Heatherette. Cassis Royale is a deep, plummy-berry color. It doesn‚Äôt have any real shimmer either, which makes it lovely. Neutral Lips Palette Lunar is a creamy white-beige with soft shimmer. It looks opaque, but it goes on fairly sheerly. Altered Beige is a creamy nude with yellow undertones. Looks like a typical nude color, personally. Square Root is exceptionally pretty as a deep red-bronze kind of color. I think this would be so lovely with deeper skin tones.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-06-17 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>84ce3176ad9d2a49f3e5608a55dd4f2bfb16a4b4</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Mineral Makeup Brand Spotlight: gloMinerals</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mineral-makeup-brand-spotlight-glominerals/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Mineral Makeup Brand Spotlight: gloMinerals Reviews Jun 22, 2008 June 22, 2008 gloMinerals was founded by Robin silver-McGee, and their mission is to develop mineral makeup using the best quality pharmaceutical-grade ingredients to create excellent makeup that‚Äôs good for the skin. gloMinerals is a full line of mineral makeup, from basics to blush to shadows, to even their own skincare range. Some products I enjoyed : gloPressed base ($39.00) comes in a bunch of different skin tones, which makes it great for those who need variety and really want to get a good match. This particular product is one of their bestsellers, as it is a pressed foundation with a matte finish. You can also use the gloMatte finishing powder ($33.50) for longer lasting matte coverage or touch-ups. gloPerfecting Powder ($33.50) is a translucent powder that acts to absorb oil buildup to keep your finish looking matte, rather than shiny or oily throughout the day. Again, it is a pressed powder, which makes it a convenient tool to carry around with you. gloShimmer brick ($31.50) is a compact that has four different colors that can easily be used individually or together. What I like about the Shimmer brick is that there is a low level of shimmer, so you get more of a subtle sheen than a glitter mess when used to highlight or add depth to cheeks. Other products you may be interested in : gloBlemish Stick ($18.00), gloLoose base ($37.00), gloFace Primer ($23.00), gloProtective Liquid Foundation ($30.50), gloDust 24K ($36.50), and gloMoist Lip Treatment ($16.00). What could they improve on? Their prices are steeper than other popular mineral makeup brands, though they do offer a lot of pressed variations in their mineral makeup line. They also do not seem to have any sample kits available, which can make it difficult to purchase online. Learn more about the brand at www.glominerals.com . Have you ever used gloMinerals?

With that said, I want to recommend some substitutions if you didn‚Äôt pick up this palette! For Medallion, try Pink Venus (from Fafi as well as a permanent color); for Trophy Pink, try Post Haste or Passionate; for Modern Heir, try Hepcat or Plum Dressing. Also, I would recommend using a different highlighting color ‚Äì more neutral, less frosty ‚Äì as I designed the tutorial to only use the palette colors! This tutorial is designed to show you step-by-step how to create a look using MAC‚Äôs Royal Assets Cool Eyes palette. Feel free to ask questions! You will need: Water-based Mixing Medium (glycerin based liquid adhesive), Your Ladyship pigment (frosty white with yellow undertones), Medallion eyeshadow (frosty pale pink), Trophy Pink eyeshadow (bright cool pink), Modern Heir eyeshadow (shimmery purple), and Graphblack technakohl (black liner). For complimenting cheeks and lips: Don‚Äôt Be Shy blush (cool pink) and Micro Pink beauty powder (cool pink); Culture Class lipstick (frosty coral-pink) with Contessa lipglass (frosty purple-pink). Brushes: 239, 239, 249 Get the step-by-step instructions with photos‚Ä¶ This is what you need. 1. Start with a clean eye-space; if you fill-in your brows, you‚Äôre welcome to do them now [or later]. 2. Use one of your 239s and add one droplet of MAC‚Äôs water-based mixing medium to the brush. If there‚Äôs excess wetness, run the brush against the back of your hand to dry it off. Pick up Your Ladyship pigment from the pigment that is stuck underneath the jar cap/top and apply all over lid, 3. Pull it outwards to be able to cover your entire lid area. 4. This is what it should look like. 5. With the 239 brush, pick up a generous amount of Medallion eyeshadow and apply to whole lid. 6. Make sure to cover the entire portion of the lid. 7. With the 239, pick up Trophy Pink eyeshadow and apply it to the outer third of the ild. 8. Pull it outwards to cover the entire outer portio of the lid. 9. Make sure to deposit some of the color into the outer crease. 10. This is what you should have. 11. Apply Modern Heir eyeshadow with the 239 to the outer crease. 12. Bring your brush outwards and into the outer crease to darken it. 13. Pull the brush upwards to help blend the color out. 14. This is what it should look like now. 15. With your 239, pick up more Trophy Pink eyeshadow to darken the outer third of the lid. 16. This is what you should have. 17. Using the 239 brush, apply Medallion eyeshadow above the crease, underneath brow. 18. Pull it outwards towards your outer brow to evenly deposit the color. 19. Swish the 239 brush back and forth to help combine the highlight and the crease colors together. 20. Go back and forth in quick, gentle motions. 21. This is what you should have.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-02-28 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>5e3228da9ea955fb956c2b54871e4701c526fe42</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Temptalia‚Äôs Summer of Fun #004: Mineral Makeup Diva</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/temptalias-summer-of-fun-004-mineral-makeup-diva/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Temptalia‚Äôs Summer of Fun #004: Mineral Makeup Diva Site News Jun 22, 2008 June 22, 2008 For our next giveaway in our Summer of Fun Giveaways , we want to treat the girl who wants to go mineral!

Please feel free to suggest more topics in the comments! Finish Descriptions ‚Äî Tekoa Eyeshadow Finishes Frost | Most frost finishes have high amounts of shimmer, and the majority I have encountered are fairly smooth when a brush goes to pick up color and the pay off is decent most of the time. MAC has a lot of shadows with this finish, including the coveted Parrot, as well as cult favorites Bronze, Goldmine, and Ricepaper. Lustre | More of a chunky, glittery finish; lots of shimmer and tends to flake off when the brush bristles touch it. This is not the most popular finish, because a lot of people experience too much chunkiness/flaking. However, several colors are nice (Aquadisiac, Greensmoke, Swimming, etc.). Matte | Flat, no shimmer color with decent color pay off in some cases ‚Äî they tend to be chalky in some specific shadows. Some favorites are Chrome Yellow, Passionate, and Soft Brown. Matte2 | An updated version take on matte finishes with a creamier, less chalky texture. Goes on smooth with much better color pay off. Some favorites are Clarity, Newly Minted, and Prussian. Satin | Similar to a matte, but it has just a slight touch of sheen to it. Color pay off is good for most satins. I do find some shades look like they have shimmer (e.g. Fade, Parfait Amour, Juxt) rather than just sheen, but it is a very seamless shimmer, which is why it is considered a sheen. Veluxe | Again, a finish similar to mattes, but much creamier and smoother. They tend to make think of going on like butter ‚Äì the pay off tends to be intense. Very few shadows have this finish‚Äìjust four permanent colors‚ÄìBrown Down, Kid, Samoa Silk, and Velvet Moss. Veluxe Pearl | Good amounts of shimmer, but very smooth when applied. This finish tends to give good color intensity and pay off, making them one of the favorite finishes. Generally no flaking or chunkiness whatsoever. Some of my personal favorites are Antiqued, Freshwater, Gorgeous Gold, Shimmermoss, Stars ‚ÄòN Rockets, and Woodwinked. This is my favorite finish as well. Velvet | A low-level shimmer finish that tends to be good in color and smooth when picked up. Some great shades are Bitter, Contrast, Juiced, and Texture. Lipstick Finishes Amplified Creme | Very creamy, opaque, and has a high gloss finish. This is my personal favorite finish, and it includes popular colors such as BLankety, Dubbonet, Girl About Town, and Vegas Volt. Frost | High in shimmer with a glossy sheen, color pay off may vary, but tends to be on the opaque side. Popular favorites are Bombshell, Lame, New York Apple, and Sandy B; it is also a popular finish for many of MAC‚Äôs lipsticks. Glaze | Sheerer colors that go on with a nice glossy finish, lipstick feels smooth. This finish is claimed by few permanent lipstick colors, but some to mention are Gleam, Hue, and Pervette. Lustre | Less shimmer than a frost, but still some, and this formula tends to run sheerer than frosts, but with more pay off than galzes. Usually color is fairly buildable. Some favorites include Capricious, Hug Me, Plink!, and Sweetie. This is a fairly popular finish for lipsticks. Matte | Intense color pay off, drier textures (in some cases), no shimmer, no sheen/glossiness. Popular favorites are Honeylove, Lady Danger, Ruby Woo, and Russian Red. Satin | Kind of like a matte and a glaze‚Äìvery subtle glossy finish. Color pay off seems to vary, but usually decent. Colors to think about include Brave, Cherish, Myth, and Snob. False Lashes ‚Äî Tekoa Specific lashes : 20 (half lashes meant to bulk up the outer half of lashes), 30 lash (kind of like individual lashes to fill in where you want), 38 (outer half of lashes) Natural length lashes : 1, 7 (really), 31, 32, 33 Full lashes : 3, 4, 7, 36 Dramatic lashes : 2, 6, 34, 35, 37 Lower lashes : 39, 40 Personal favorites : 7s, 36s (also known as ‚ÄúSultress‚Äù lashes) Keep reading to learn about Store Etiquette and Pigments! Store Etiquette ‚Äî Carrie When you arrive‚Ä¶ If it‚Äôs busy, it‚Äôs a good idea to scope out the products you‚Äôre interested in. Everything is pretty obvious in terms of what it is (like eyeshadows vs. lipsticks) and arranged in an organized manner, so you should be able to find it. Feel free to swatch products on your hand while you‚Äôre looking, too. If you find something you like, you can keep it on the side to let an artist know. Grab an artist by either waiting for one to ask if you need help (passive), or stop one and ask them if they can get you an item or help you try on a particular product (aggressive). Depending on why I‚Äôm there and whether I‚Äôm in a rush or not, I‚Äôll opt for either. If it‚Äôs not busy, don‚Äôt let any standoffish employees put you off‚Äìask them for help. They are paid to help you and make sales, so don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre intruding or let them intimidate you in any way! In general, though, when it isn‚Äôt busy, you shouldn‚Äôt have to wait too long to be asked if you need help. As a MAC addict, I tend to tell them politely that I don‚Äôt need help at the moment, since I‚Äôm mostly there looking at the new stuff anyway, but then I will grab them when I need them to get the products I want to buy. When you pay‚Ä¶ MAC usually asks you for your address, which is used to track your purchases. They say this for those who come in telling about this lipstick they loved, but don‚Äôt know the name of, and they can cross-reference to your previous purchases. It is also one way to get certain mailers for upcoming collections (but unfortunately, it is not a guaranteed method, sometimes you get them, sometimes you don‚Äôt). You might want to ask about any upcoming events the store has on its calendar, because MAC is often coming out with new launches, they tend to offer events often, too. Not sure? First, MAC has a great return policy. You are always welcome to return with receipt within thirty days of a purchase, whether or not it has been used. Second, MAC does provide sampling containers to provide customers with samples of products. If you‚Äôre timid, try saying something like, ‚ÄúOh, I think I like X product, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll look good on me at home‚Ä¶‚Äù which might get the makeup artist to ask if you‚Äôd like a sample. A safe bet is to ask for a sample of a foundation‚ÄìI have never been turned down for a foundation sample. In fact, I even encourage you to get foundation samples before committing to a color/formula‚ÄìMAC lighting is not the best and not at all like ‚Äúreal life.‚Äù Thus, I suggest you take a sample home and look at the foundation on your face in natural light, your bathroom light, etc. There are a few ‚Äústingy‚Äù makeup artists who may not give out samples or simply may not know that they can, but I haven‚Äôt encountered anyone that has said no to me, and I know SO many who have gotten samples of various products (foundation to skincare to pigments). Don‚Äôt let one bad experience phase you! In the past, MAC has been known to have some snobbish employees, but there are definitely many makeup artists who work for the company who are fountains of knowledge and just waiting to help you. Sometimes even a whole counter/store can give off a very bad vibe, and if you can, just avoid that one and go to another. You can even send an e-mail to MAC Cosmetics‚Äô customer service online letting them know about it. My closest freestanding store used to be notorious for its snobby artists, and enough customers complained. They did a major overhaul of employees and management, and now the store is full of some of the most amazing artists I‚Äôve had the pleasure of meeting! Don‚Äôt feel like you a) need to show up with a full face of makeup (hey, I go in bare faced all the time ‚Äì you never know if you want to try something!), or b) like you have to buy what an artist is recommending. At an event‚Ä¶ There are all sorts of events, but most of them are similar. Master Classes : Sometimes MAC stores will offer master/PRO classes that are open to the public. They may be called seminars, too. There is usually a pre-paid $50 fee (it may have gone up) that is redeemable in product after the seminar. The routine at these is you show up, head up to a makeshift classroom, and a senior artist will talk to you about the seminar‚Äôs topic. They usually do a demo on someone who has signed up for the seminar, and you can take notes. Afterwards, they have artists on hand for makeovers and to help you make your purchases. You are supposed to spend at least $50 on products afterwards, though some stores do not enforce this policy or simply do not keep track. Typical Events : These are events held to promote the latest launch at the store. Higher volume stores will have their events the weekend immediately following the launch (usually on Thursdays), while slower stores and some counters will have them later on in the month (anywhere from a week to three weeks later). For these events, you typically sign up to get a makeover done, which is where an artist (who is either an actual regular MAC employee or just a freelance makeup artist) will do your makeup using the latest products. They tend to ask you what kind of look you‚Äôd like, and be prepared if you tell them to go wild, they may really go wild. Like other events, there can be a pre-paid cost ($40-60) or they may simply tell you that you are supposed to purchase a minimum amount after you get your makeover. Unveiling Events : Higher volume stores may do unveiling events, which are when a store closes down for the evening to specially invited guests. For example, for Fafi, it launched on February 13th, but unveiling events went on February 10th. These special guests were allowed to preview and purchase the Fafi collection prior to its general public release on the 13th. These do not include makeovers or require you to spend a certain amount. In fact, they tend to be a bit crazy, as the store is filled to the brim with people. You usually get a list of products from the launch and you can fill in the quantity and which ones you want, which you hand off to any artist you can locate, who will grab your stuff. There are usually models representing the launch, as well as waiters serving appetizers and perhaps even a DJ. Tell me more about employees‚Ä¶ MAC employees do not work on commission, but they do have sales goals. So it‚Äôs definitely great to give your favorite MA your business, because it helps them reach their goals (or surpass them), and at the same time, don‚Äôt feel like you can‚Äôt ask the questions you want because you‚Äôll waste their time. Yes, if they‚Äôre busy and seem like they are running around without a head, I wouldn‚Äôt ask them to write out a novel, but a few questions shouldn‚Äôt hurt. When is the best time to go? Weekends tend to be busy across the board, but it will depend on your location. It‚Äôs best to just go a few different times, and observe when it is busy yourself. I know my local freestanding gets busy in the afternoons, weekends, and lunch time, which means I tend to go there in the morning. My store is particularly high volume, though, which is why they are busy for most of the day all the time. Pigments What are they? They are jars filled with loose particles of color. It‚Äôs almost like a ‚Äúdust,‚Äù with some pigments running chunkier (tend to be from the frost family) with others more finely milled (like mattes). How do I use them? This would depend on where you use it, but for the eyes, which is what I get asked about a lot, I always use MAC‚Äôs water-based mixing medium (okay, homemade version). I put a droplet or two on my brush, and then I swipe a bit of the pigment off of the top of the lid of the jar and apply to the lid. Mixing medium helps it adhere to the lid. I use a homemade version, which is one part [liquid] glycerin (found in most first aid aisles) to there parts water. Shake it up, and voila. Where do I use them? Depending on their safety guidelines (usually they come with a paper insert if they are unsafe for either lip, face, or eye), you can use them as you please. Glitters are not safe to use on the eyes, and the same can be true with more red and dark-pink based products (because red dye tends to cause a lot of irritation amongst test groups). You can mix them with clear gloss for lips, dust on cheeks to highlight, mix into moisturizer to apply to face or body, use them as shadows‚Ä¶ the list is truly endless. You can even add it to nail polish! What about samples? If you are interested in samples, you may want to ask your MA for one, if it‚Äôs just one you‚Äôre looking for. If you want to buy a lot of samples, I recommend perusing sellers on www.livejournal.com/community/mac_cosmetics . They are reputable and will be able to help you out. I would look to pay between $2-3 per 1/4 tsp sample (which will last you several uses!) for readily available colors, and up to $4-5 for harder to find colors.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-02-25 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>8929ac3e96074dd00fb0cb389c7df967d204952b</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Summer 2008 ‚Äì Prescriptives All Skins Mineral Makeup SPF 15</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/summer-2008-prescriptives-all-skins-mineral-makeup-spf-15/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Summer 2008 ‚Äì Prescriptives All Skins Mineral Makeup SPF 15 Year: 2008 Launches Jun 24, 2008 June 24, 2008 Introducing Prescriptives All Skins Mineral Makeup SPF 15 The proven purity and healthy benefits of mineral makeup meet the exact foundation expertise of Prescriptives ‚Äì introducing Prescriptives All Skins Mineral Makeup SPF 15 .

Acronyms | Many things get abbreviated on the internet, and makeup is no different. If you‚Äôve seen one and don‚Äôt know what it is, MakeUpAlley has an excellent abbreviation list that should help you! CCB | Cream Colour Base Depotting | This is the act of removing the eyeshadow pan/palette from the black container that it came in. There are several methods on doing this, the most common requires a lighter/candle and knife. To begin, you can pop out the plastic insert that lays in the container (basically, there are two pieces to the container, the entire outer casing and a little ‚Äúplate‚Äù that holds the eyeshadow pan). You can easily do this by taking your knife point and inserting it where the two parts meet, which is the same place where the lid closes and clicks in place. After you have removed that portion, take a lighter and melt the bottom of the eyeshadow container enough that you can push a knife point up through it to pop out the metal eyeshadow pan. You can also quickly melt the label found on the bottom of the eyeshadow pot (just enough to make it easy to pull off, too much and you‚Äôll blacken it) and adhere it to the bottom of the eyeshadow pan. E/s, L/s, L/g | Eyeshadow, lipstick, lipglass Eyeshadow ‚Äúin pan/palette form‚Äù | The typical eyeshadow comes inside a black plastic container with a clear top that pops open. Eyeshadow bought in pan/palette (means the same thing in this context) is when you buy a metal pan that is filled with the eyeshadow color with a magnet on the bottom of it. Essentially, it does not have any protective case or black plastic container. It is the bare bones product. You would then place them in an empty quad or palette. Empty palettes, quads | When you purchase an eyeshadow or blush in pan/palette form, you place it inside an empty palette/quad. An empty eyeshadow palette can hold either 15 or 4 eyeshadows (referred to as a quad), and it is a slim black container. An empty blush palette can hold 6 blushes. FOTD (EOTD) | Face of the Day or Eye of the Day; essentially, it is someone‚Äôs makeup from that day MA | Makeup Artist MLBB | My Lips But Better OTT | Over The Top ‚Äì as in, that bright blue eyeshadow is over the top for wearing to the office</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-02-23 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>498e40c12b6ce34ccaf74933c6cd3b7241e09dd9</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Lustre Twins, Sheer Minerals, Mineralize, Suite Array, CremeSheen, Emanuel Ungaro, Manish Arora, Gold Fever</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-lustre-twins-sheer-minerals-mineralize-suite-array-cremesheen-emanuel-ungaro-manish-arora-gold-fever/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Lustre Twins, Sheer Minerals, Mineralize, Suite Array, CremeSheen, Emanuel Ungaro, Manish Arora, Gold Fever Year: 2008 Launches Jun 24, 2008 June 24, 2008 Fall 2008 for MAC Cosmetics is CRAZY!

If you are a heavy makeup wearer, it is advisable to use separate products. Use a targeted cleanser to remove the majority of your makeup with a secondary cleanser to remove the last traces. You can always test your combined cleanser for its effectiveness by using it, and then using a makeup removing wipe to see if you missed any residue (and how much you missed). Cleansers remove oil, dirt, dead skin cells, and the like, which all help to provide the skin a chance to breathe better, renew, and keep pores open. Cleansers that contain acne-fighting ingredients may be too strong for dry skin, as many acne preventive ingredients dry out the skin. Oilier skin will demand a cleanser with more strength than drier skin, so it is important to pay attention to what kind of ingredients and what the product is advertised to do.

Start around the nose and mouth where there‚Äôs redness, then blend out to the rest of the face. Set concealer and foundation with Sheer Finish Loose Powder to make them longer-lasting and to ensure that skin looks matte in pictures. If your dress has an open neckline, be sure to warm up your neck and chest with a dusting of Bronzing Powder. Use a water-resistant liner that can withstand tears; try Long-Wear Gel Eyeliner applied with the Ultra Fine Eye Liner Brush. If you prefer to line with shadow, make it longer-lasting by applying it with a slightly damp Eye Liner Brush. Finish with a waterresistant mascara like Lash Glamour. After applying all your eye makeup, finish with a highlighter shade on the browbone to make eyes pop. Rub your finger in a light matte shade and pat lightly on the outer corner of the browbone. For a pretty flush that lasts, use two shades of Blush. First, apply a neutral shade on the apples of cheeks, blending up into the hairline, then downwards to soften. Then apply a brighter shade just on the apples of cheeks. Neutral and pale lip colors look washed out in photographs, so choose a lipstick that‚Äôs one to two shades brighter than what you normally wear. Pinks, roses and plums are great choices for brides. To make Lip Color last longer, line and fill in lips with Lip Pencil before applying your lipstick. Carry a touch-up kit with concealer, pressed powder, lipstick or gloss, lip liner, tissues, mints, and a mini sewing kit (for emergency clothing fixes like a dropped hem or popped button). Have Fun! Pre-Wedding Wellness Tips Eat smart . Choose whole grains, fresh greens and fruits, and clean proteins like chicken, fish, and beans. Hydrate . Drink lots of water daily to hydrate skin and flush out toxins. Move Your Body . Exercise at least three times a week to strengthen your body and calm your mind. Take Relaxing Baths . Add soothing Epsom salts or skin-softening powdered milk to your bathwater. Be Present . Slow down and appreciate what‚Äôs around you rather than rushing to get from start to finish. Wedding Day Touch-Up Tips Pack your purse with concealer, pressed powder, lipstick or gloss, lip liner, tissues, and mints. Sewing kit with prethreaded needles and a pair of tiny fold-up scissors to fix a hem or popped button. Static spray and lint remover to get rid of static cling and lint on clothing.

In addition to the traditional mineral makeup ingredients, they have added shea butter and Vitamin E to help bind their ingredients together. They do not use talc or oil or fillers in their products, either. In addition to their full range of mineral makeup, they also have skincare products available, which I don‚Äôt usually see from mineral makeup brands. Some products I enjoyed : 4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup Foundation with SPF 15 ($24.50) is, according to purminerals, the brand‚Äôs ‚Äúclaim to fame.‚Äù What I like about the pressed mineral compact is that it allows you to have the benefits of mineral makeup, but without the mess. I have always found that whenever I use a loose mineral powder, more often than not, it gets all over me and the bathroom countertop. There is a good range of colors within the product‚Äôs range, but if you are concerned, they also have a split pan version, where you get two shades instead of one (which is especially good for those who change skintones over summer!). Universal Marble Mineral Powder &amp; Bronzer (Bronze &amp; Brighten) ($21.50) is this gorgeous swirled bronzer that acts to highlight and brighten skin. It is universal, which means it runs lighter and sheerer than super dark or pigmented, but it is buildable, which is what matters in a sheerer product. There is also a Marble Mineral Powder in Pink, which looks incredibly pretty. Aside from bronzer, Pur Radiance Mineral Powder ($21.50) is a great pressed mineral highlighter/blush that gives you that just flushed, glowy complexion. pur truly has a full line of mineral makeup based cosmetics‚Äìnot just powders and face products, but lipsticks, glosses, and even lip tints. The Mineral Lip Tint SPF 15 ($16.50) comes in several fun shades, and they‚Äôre great for just a hint of color. The Lip Tints come in a sleek, silver tube with twist up color. Don‚Äôt forget about their Mineral Eye Defining Pencil with Smudger ($16.50) for waterproof, smudge-proof eye liner that‚Äôs mineral based. Other products you may be interested in : 4-in-1 Loose Mineral Makeup Foundation ($23.50), Mineral Eye Prep ($17.00), Pur-ly Abundant ($16.50), Pressed Mineral Eyeshadow Singles ($12.00), What could they improve on? There aren‚Äôt many loose powder options, which may make some traditional mineral makeup wearers wary or even pass them over. I like pressed mineral makeup, because it‚Äôs not as messy and it‚Äôs more travel-friendly, but I do think loose mineral makeup is part of the allure of mineral makeup in general. I do not think this is so much a con, as something that differentiates pur from other brands. Learn more about the brand at www.purminerals.com . Have you tried this brand?

MAC Cosmetics has collaborated with designer Esteban Cortazar of Emanuel Ungaro to launch a limited edition makeup collection, called MAC Emanuel Ungaro , which was inspired by the fashion house‚Äôs fall runway looks. The line, due out this fall, is meant to take Ungaro‚Äôs heritage in ultrafeminine and colorful clothing and apply it to makeup. Ungaro marks the second designer collaboration for MAC, which is owned by the Est√©e Lauder Cos. Inc. Its first was a collection for Alexander McQueen that was launched last fall. According to James Gager, MAC Cosmetics‚Äô senior vice president and creative director, the difference between the two designer collections and a previous makeup collection for Heatherette is that the latter is not based on runway looks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about bringing the makeup collections straight from the runway into the stores,‚Äù Gordon Espinet, MAC Cosmetics‚Äô vice president of global makeup artistry, said of the Ungaro initiative. Guillaume Jesel, MAC Cosmetics‚Äô president of global marketing, noted the cosmetics firm has been a long-time sponsor of Emanuel Ungaro fashion presentations. He added, ‚ÄúWe have a special relationship with Esteban, since we‚Äôve supported the young prodigy‚Äôs shows from the very beginning.‚Äù Cortazar, who‚Äôs been at the French fashion house for just over six months, recalled his first experience with the MAC brand at the age of 10, when he visited a MAC makeup store in Miami, his hometown. ‚ÄúI knew this was a cool place because I saw all the amazing, fun colors, glitter and girls with blue hair running around with outrageous makeup on their faces,‚Äù said Cortazar. ‚ÄúI used to have them dress me up for Halloween all the time.‚Äù As a seventh grader, Cortazar hired MAC makeup artists to do his first fashion show, held at his school, because he wanted to be ‚Äúas professional‚Äù as possible. MAC wanted to be sure that both the Ungaro designer collection and its fall MAC color collection, called Cult of Cherry, had different points of view. Cult of Cherry is inspired by dark, rich chocolates and cherry-red shades, while the Ungaro collection is about femininity and uses lighter textures. ‚ÄúWe were sure to not step on our fall collection,‚Äù said Gager. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre bringing the best of both worlds to our customers from a color standpoint, attitude and association with someone who‚Äôs going to reinvent a couture house. This gives us an edge in terms of being authentic in what we bring to our customers.‚Äù Cortazar worked together with MAC‚Äôs product development team and Sharon Dowsett, who was the key makeup artist for MAC at Emanuel Ungaro‚Äôs fall runway show, to create the MAC Emanuel Ungaro line. ‚Äú[Cortazar] was after something earthy, so I was inspired by a softer palette of delicate shades of pinks, blues and lilacs,‚Äù said Dowsett, referencing Monet‚Äôs ‚ÄúWater Lilies.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a colorful collection but very transparent so you don‚Äôt have to worry about overdoing it.‚Äù The 14-item MAC Emanuel Ungaro lineup, which is slated to launch in October, includes lipsticks and lip glosses, eye shadows and liner, cream color bases, blush, mascara and a brow set. The collection, which ranges in price from $11 to $22, could generate retail sales of $2 million according to industry sources. ‚Äî WWD</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-06-25 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>206857cc7ea767388d8a6481a3b984a549cf57c9</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Looks ‚Äì Bright Green and Blue with Kryolan Palette #5308-SF</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tag/mac-vibrational-lipglass/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Looks ‚Äì Bright Green and Blue with Kryolan Palette #5308-SF Looks Feb 13, 2008 February 13, 2008 Using my new Kryolan stuff!

Well, I purchased several of them out of curiosity, and while they seem legitimate, there is no way for me to know for sure quite yet. The packaging is new, which was expected of Dazzleglass (launching in May), so it‚Äôs even more difficult to determine if these are the real deal. As a result, I‚Äôve been sitting on these swatches for nearly a month now, and I figured I‚Äôd share them as long as I disclaim that these may NOT be real. Since there‚Äôs that chance, I also am not going to be doing a full review until much later, when they actually launch. Kiss and Makeup revealed official color information‚Ä¶ Comet Blue Violet blue Funtabulous Purple with violet pearl Ms. Fizz Bright pink with blue pearl Like Venus Clean light bubble gum pink with red pearl Baby Sparks Pale pink with violet pearl Money Honey Mid-tone rosy mauve with red pearl Rags to Riches Plumy pink with teal and red pearl Date Night Deep plum with blue and gold pearl Spanking Rich Raspberry pink with red and gold pearl Get Rich Quick Warm yellow brown Bare Necessity Caramel apricot with red and gold pearl Steppin‚Äô Out Clean yellow pink with red pearl Glamour O.D.

This is good news and definitely adds to the PRO column for legitimacy! I will give you a quick rundown of the texture/finish/overview of these, though! They are less sticky than lipglasses, but a little more sticky than lustreglasses. For those hoping for a non-tacky gloss, this is definitely not an answer to you. They are all sheer colors, so don‚Äôt expect a lot of opacity or color, especially for those with pigmented lips. There is a good deal of shimmer in each gloss, and the finish is a high, glossy sheen.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-02-27 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>7cb66bdd2957087e00607285fa0010b2a238af2d</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Red by Kiss Perfect Pair Tweezers and Nail Clippers</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/red-by-kiss-perfect-pair-tweezers-and-nail-clippers/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Red by Kiss Perfect Pair Tweezers and Nail Clippers Hands &amp; Nails Products Jun 25, 2008 June 25, 2008 Red by Kiss Perfect Pair ($5.99) is a tweezer and nail clipper set. Prior to trying these delightfully pink tweezers, I have been Tweezerman-snob. I think I have about three pairs of Tweezermans around my house, in various pockets of the apartment. However, Tweezerman tweezers don‚Äôt come cheap (I think all of mine were $10 or more). These tweezers look and feel a lot like my more expensive Tweezerman ones, surprisingly enough. I‚Äôve found myself using these for the past few weeks regularly (they‚Äôre sitting on my desk, beside my 10x magnifying mirror, ha!), and I haven‚Äôt felt the urge to go locate my Tweezerman tweezers either. The nail clipper is kind of cool, because it‚Äôll trap your nail clippings in it, so it creates less of a mess. I felt that the clippers felt a bit flimsy compared to the tweezers, which were sturdy. I‚Äôd probably opt just for the tweezers over these particular clippers.

But at different stages in a woman‚Äôs life, her skin needs different care. That‚Äôs why the experts at Cur√©l Skin Care developed the Life‚Äôs Stages Collection ‚Äì the first and only line of moisturizers designed to help women address the changing needs of their skin. Stage #1 ‚Äì Pregnancy &amp; Motherhood Skin Problems : tight, itchy, dry, sensitive skin, stretch marks. Problem Solver : Cur√©l nurturing comfort; Moisture Cream for pregnancy &amp; motherhood How it Helps : Dermatologist and Cur√©l Consultant, Dr. Diane Berson says, ‚Äù It helps improve skin‚Äôs elasticity and alleviates dryness via a paraben and mineral oil-free formula containing shea butter, Vitamin E, collagen and elastin. It increases skin‚Äôs elasticity 70% better than the leading pregnancy cream.‚Äù Stage #2 ‚Äì First Signs of Aging Skin Problems : rough, dry, discolored, dull, and transparent, loss of elasticity, wrinkles Problem Solver : Cur√©l youth-defense; Moisture Lotion for the first signs of aging How it Helps : ‚Äù It replenishes essential building blocks found in naturally young, healthy skin and increases skin‚Äôs moisture level via a blend of skin hydrators, Vitamins C &amp; E and collagen,‚Äù says OB/GYN and Cur√©l Consultant, Dr. Miriam Greene. ‚ÄúIt also contains sage to reduce redness and irritation.‚Äù Stage #3 -√© Menopause and Beyond Skin Problems : hot, dry, itchy skin, loss of elasticity Problem Solver : Cur√©l skin fortifying Moisture Lotion for menopause &amp; beyond How it Helps : ‚ÄúIt helps maintain skin‚Äôs elasticity, making it soft and supple via a blend of elastin and collagen, grape seed extract known to inhibit collagen loss,‚Äù says Dr. Berson. ‚ÄúIt also has a gentile cooling agent and a special blend of emollients designed to increase skin elasticity, maintain hydration, and improve the appearance of dry skin,‚Äù adds Dr. Greene. Availability: The moisturizers in the Life‚Äôs Stages Collection are each sold separately. They will be available at drugstores nationwide beginning in March 2008 for $5.49. What do you think of this concept? I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm going to try it yet, because I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm in the stage of ‚Äúfirst signs of aging,‚Äù you know?

Then I admired it because it looked like it could quite easily be a modern day torture device. Seriously, some of those attachments will leave the less hair removal savvy running! The Bikini Perfect is an at-home grooming system. It features a cordless, rechargeable, shower-friendly trimmer with six attachments. The kit also comes with trial sizes of their body butter &amp; an ingrown-hair exfoliating pad. Precision Trimmer : grooms bikini ilne Precision Comb : ensures even grooming results (5 length settings) Eyebrow Comb : trims entire eyebrow to a uniform length Micro Trimmer : shapes/defines/removes brows or a single hair Micro Shaver : extra smooth and safe shaver Epilator : removes hair by the root So what did I do? Being the not-so-hair-down-there savvy (hey, I don‚Äôt mind the disposable razor technique‚Äìgives me the results I want and keeps me bump free!), I went straight for the Epilator attachment. Now, let me tell you that I imagine the epilator attachment is the most painful of the six, because let‚Äôs face it, it‚Äôs plucking hair entirely, not just trimming or shaving it. When you first turn the device on, the speed it is spinning/whirring at is downright frightening. I was like, ‚ÄúOH GOD!‚Äù when I turned it on, and I looked at myself in the mirror thinking, ‚ÄúCan I really do this? Aww, what the hell!‚Äù For as daunting as it seemed, it wasn‚Äôt that bad when I was going around the bikini line and whatnot. This is not to say that it was painless. I think my pain tolerance is decent for down there, so the epilator and I got along fine. However, there were a few hairs that got pulled out that made me go, ‚ÄúGOOD GOD!‚Äù The pain is akin to plucking out the hair with tweezers‚Äìjust not as painstakingly slow. I‚Äôm trying to build up some courage to try the eyebrow comb, but we‚Äôll see! For the pricetag, this is a worth-it purchase if you‚Äôre into at-home shaving. If you‚Äôre a little terrified of having someone else see (or muck around with) your naughty bits, this is a less embarrassing method. If you‚Äôre into Brazilians, you‚Äôre probably better off getting a wax, since it‚Äôs faster (and the pain is probably about the same as with the epilator in THOSE areas). But for those who just want to trim, neaten, and take care of the bikini line‚Äìthis does a fine job of keeping you looking your swimsuit best!

It‚Äôs great that MAC introduced so many at once just for the fact that you‚Äôre bound to be drawn to at least one or two of them! The consistency is thicker than lustreglass, maybe even as thick or thicker than lipglass, but with less stickiness than lipglass (though they still felt a little tacky to me). The glitter doesn‚Äôt feel particularly gritty in the swatch, though I personally felt that as they wore away through the day that some did feel gritty. After playing with them a bit, it really does seem like these are colored glosses mixed with reflects glitters‚Äìthe new ones, the ultra finely milled ones. The texture of the glitter in these is nearly identical to reflects glitters (again, the newer ones that are finely milled). The packaging for this is larger than either lipglass/lustreglass, but it is not a glass tube as far as I could tell‚Äìit sounded and felt like plastic (nor were they very heavy), but they are kind of like test tubes. If you love super high reflecting glosses‚Ä¶ check these out! They really do look amazing on lips, especially in sunlight (looks like shimmering water!). Pleasure Principle is the sheerest of the sixteen Dazzleglasses, primarily because it‚Äôs intended to be a very sheer, semi-clear glossy color. Cute to put on top of colors! Sugarrimmed is similar to Pleasure Principle, but it‚Äôs more of a white with pink undertones in it. Bare Necessity is a pale peach color with great iridescence/reflection. If you have paler lips, this would be a great beachy/summery color. Baby Sparks is a baby pastel pink with cool reflects, and I see this one being quite popular. Rags to Riches is a soft pastel mauvey-pink kind of color with multi-colored reflects. Get Rich Quick is a warm brown with pink reflects that is more wearable than you‚Äôd think. Money, Honey is a darker medium pink with equivalent reflects that go pink and fuchsia-purple. This one stood out the most to me in terms of something I‚Äôd wear often. Date Night is a dark berry color with a burgundy tone and pink reflects. Very pretty and suited to its name. Steppin‚Äô Out is a brighter baby pink than Baby Sparks with warm tones, so I think those who‚Äôve been wanting a light pink gloss will find either or both suitable for them. Love Alert is a pink-fuchsia that‚Äôs fairly bright, but as the Dazzleglasses are all fairly sheer, it‚Äôs wearable. Glamour O.D. is a warm pink with coral undertones and pink reflects. It‚Äôs a cute color. Spanking Rich is a darker pink with peach-berry undertones with multi-colored reflects. Like Venus is surprisingly pretty, very much a light purple-pink with light pink reflects. I was tempted by this one! Funtabulous is a bright fuchsia-purple color with cool purple reflects. Like Love Alert, it looks quite bold when swatched. Ms. Fizz is a medium pink with purple undertones ‚Äì similar to Steppin‚Äô Out except it does have that purple-fuchsia dimension to it. Comet Blue is a cool blue with a little bit of gray undertones. It‚Äôs not straight blue, nor pastel blue, but a mix.

Chanel‚Äôs Blue Satin catches the light of camera flash well, because it manages to pick up on a touch of shimmer that you cannot see whatsoever in real life. Poison Blue is this gorgeous dark blue-black shade that adds drama to nails, and it has a definite duo-nature to them. Indoors, the color is nearly black with blue undertones, while in sunlight, the blue tones stand out more. There is no shimmer to this polish, it is more of a high glossy finish. I wore my Dior manicure for a week through moving apartments, and it held up amazingly. This stuff just would not chip, and it was really hard to even try and chip it myself (hey, I like to test polish durability). Despite packing boxes, unpacking them, assembling/disassembling, etc., I hardly had any tip wear either (say what?!). This is reason enough to opt for Dior Poison Blue over Blue Satin ! While Blue Satin has a thicker consistency than Poison Blue (thinner), Poison Blue is also glossier in its finish than Blue Satin . Personally, I preferred the consistency of Poison Blue , because it allowed me to do my dutiful two coats of polish without feeling like I might be wasting some (at $19 a pop, I don‚Äôt want to waste a drop ), whereas Chanel‚Äôs was thicker to the point where one coat was almost enough, but I prefer two coats to maximize durability and lasting power. The picture above shows half a nail swatched with Chanel‚Äôs Blue Satin with the right half in Dior‚Äôs Poison Blue‚Äìjust remember, the shimmer in Blue Satin is not visible with indoor light, and it better be a bright, sunny day if you want to see it at all!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-02-26 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>ac9492933a3abab62f32e5ef436427aec2ce364c</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Guest Look ‚Äî Stephanie Shares a Purple and Pink Look</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/guest-look-stephanie-shares-a-purple-and-pink-look/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Guest Look ‚Äî Stephanie Shares a Purple and Pink Look Looks Jan 31, 2008 January 31, 2008 She used‚Ä¶ Brow : fill in with Smashbox Smashing Brunette Brow Tech Brow Bone : MAC Jest Liner : Almay Liquid Eye Liner and cheap black pencil in waterline Lid : MAC Fuschia pigment Crease : MAC Nocturnelle and Satellite Dreams Above Crease : MAC Stars &amp; Rockets Lower Lash Line : Fuschia pigment Lashes : cheapie NYC Glamour lashes</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-01-31 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>c07eef684497438e0819b0b45f51d6fa09be4ce6</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Nordstrom‚Äôs ‚Äì The Bane of my Existence</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/nordstroms-the-bane-of-my-existence/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Nordstrom‚Äôs ‚Äì The Bane of my Existence Apr 24, 2008 April 24, 2008 Oh, Nordstrom‚Äôs, how you tempt me, let me count the ways‚Ä¶ Dior Golds 569 quint is calling to me.

These are an indulgence, not a necessity, but those with brutally dry or cracked heels will find these a nice way to get a little at-home spa treatment. The socks can be worn as they‚Äôre bought, or you can lotion up your feet with any shea butter-based product (I used Bliss‚Äô Lemon &amp; Sage Body Butter ) and then slip on the socks. The socks are lined with a ‚Äúself-activating gel lining,‚Äù which is supposed to release olive oil, jojoba seed oil, grape seed oil, and vitamin E for hydration. On my foot, the gel lining goes up to my ankle, while the sock itself extends up a few more inches (but I have big feet‚Äìsize 10). The gel kind of clings to your feet, and to be honest, the feeling is weird (not bad, but it is an odd feeling!) at first, but once your feet have warmed up the gel inside, they‚Äôre pretty comfortable. I usually will slip these on when I know I‚Äôm going to be at my desk for awhile, because I feel like you probably shouldn‚Äôt walk a mile in these, though nothing indicates you couldn‚Äôt (but it feels funny, ha!). I will wear them for about thirty minutes or so, and my feet come out feeling soft and smooth. For reference, though, I don‚Äôt have the most beat up feet. I have baby feet in the sense that I pad around the house in socks on the regular, so walking on pavement makes my poor feet cry. You can use these without lotioning up and still get a nice softness after twenty to thirty minutes of use, which is nice for those days where a thick body butter just won‚Äôt do. Those who just want an indulgence and general softening will find that enough, but for those with cracked heels, I definitely recommend using a body butter or Bliss‚Äô Sock Salve to really treat your feet. For those who can‚Äôt afford these socks, I recommend using a body butter (if you want to stick with bliss, I like Bliss‚Äô Lemon &amp; Sage Body Butter ) to slather on your soles and then slip into a pair of thick socks and leave on for an hour (or overnight) for softened feet.

These are an indulgence, not a necessity, but those with brutally dry or cracked heels will find these a nice way to get a little at-home spa treatment. The socks can be worn as they‚Äôre bought, or you can lotion up your feet with any shea butter-based product (I used Bliss‚Äô Lemon &amp; Sage Body Butter ) and then slip on the socks. The socks are lined with a ‚Äúself-activating gel lining,‚Äù which is supposed to release olive oil, jojoba seed oil, grape seed oil, and vitamin E for hydration. On my foot, the gel lining goes up to my ankle, while the sock itself extends up a few more inches (but I have big feet‚Äìsize 10). The gel kind of clings to your feet, and to be honest, the feeling is weird (not bad, but it is an odd feeling!) at first, but once your feet have warmed up the gel inside, they‚Äôre pretty comfortable. I usually will slip these on when I know I‚Äôm going to be at my desk for awhile, because I feel like you probably shouldn‚Äôt walk a mile in these, though nothing indicates you couldn‚Äôt (but it feels funny, ha!). I will wear them for about thirty minutes or so, and my feet come out feeling soft and smooth. For reference, though, I don‚Äôt have the most beat up feet. I have baby feet in the sense that I pad around the house in socks on the regular, so walking on pavement makes my poor feet cry. You can use these without lotioning up and still get a nice softness after twenty to thirty minutes of use, which is nice for those days where a thick body butter just won‚Äôt do. Those who just want an indulgence and general softening will find that enough, but for those with cracked heels, I definitely recommend using a body butter or Bliss‚Äô Sock Salve to really treat your feet.

A body scrub is a coarser product designed to help slough off dead skin cells on the skin that covers your body (which essentially excludes your face, possibly your neck), while a skin polish is a grainier, finer product that buffs and just tends to be gentler overall. Do they mean the same thing to you? I‚Äôm more curious than anything. We all have our own expectations/ideas depending on products and how they‚Äôre marketed! The body scrub has a fresh lemony scent that‚Äôs light and not synthetic, and it‚Äôs really not a scent that will last and last post-shower. It has rather fine, grainy particles that will get the job done, but if you‚Äôre looking for a coarser scrub like your typical salt/sugar scrub, I don‚Äôt think this will be vigorous enough for you. However, if you prefer something smoother, finer, and altogether gentler (particularly if you have sensitive skin), the consistency of this product is more up your alley. Bliss calls the exfoliating piece ‚Äúcircular scrubbing grains,‚Äù which is good, because their spherical nature will avoid tearing the skin.

I like that my legs feel rejuvenated and more moisturized after using this product. Not all scrubs impart moisture, and I can always appreciate one that multi-tasks (though if you suffer from drier, scalier legs like me, you don‚Äôt get to skip the body butter). Depending on your budget and what you like to splurge on, Bliss‚Äô body scrub isn‚Äôt for everyone‚Äìit can seem pricey. Personally, it takes me ten years (exaggeration!) to get through a jar of body scrub, so if it does the job I like, smells good, etc., I‚Äôm not overly concerned whether it‚Äôs $10 or $40, since I know I‚Äôm going to get plenty of use out of it.

I enjoy a nice neutral/nude look from time to time, so I thought that this palette would make a great addition to my travel bag or for occasions where minimal makeup is necessary. There are four eyeshadows, but three of the four look virtually the same on me (I‚Äôm medium toned), even with a white-beige base (MAC Soft Ochre paint pot). Naked and Bare are so similar and seem to differ mostly in texture, where Naked seems a little more shimmery and Bare more matte. Nude is a warmer version of Naked/Bear with more peach/rose undertones. Buff would be my favorite, because it is darker and distinguishable from the others. I also didn‚Äôt find any of these to be a great highlight color, though I suppose Nude is the one you might assume to use. When looking at pre-made palettes, I do expect that there will be several looks that I can using the palette exclusively‚Äìnot having to grab additional colors. From the promotional image, it did look like there was a little more color differentiation than you get in real life. Aside from my issues with the colors/color pay off, the textures are typical BB: smooth and soft. I didn‚Äôt bother using the brush that comes with the palette because the bristles were just too coarse against the delicate shadows‚Äìit cause them to flake more than I liked. Full-size Bobbi Brown brushes are much better than the baby versions put into palettes (which is no different than other brands‚Äô palettes, including MAC), so in a pinch, they‚Äôre great, but if you can, take your regular brushes with you. The lip colors were much more exciting than the shadows, because they all had good pigmentation and the color variation was there. Bare lip color makes an excellent subdued rosey shade with soft undertones of plum, while Beige is a shimmery bronze-tan that adds a nice layer of iridescence to lips. Brownie is a great sheer soft tan color that should work with most skintones. Cocoa was my least favorite, just because it doesn‚Äôt suit me well; it is a nice shade of brown with red undertones with low-level shimmer. The lip brush is cute and compact, but I never have the patience for lip brushes. I opted to use a larger, flat firm brush (meant for eyes) to apply it, just because it was faster. Overall, it dismays me to say that I don‚Äôt feel like this palette is worth it in the end, since the shadows did not offer me a variety of potential looks to create ‚Äì three look about the same, and one is dark enough to add depth to the crease/outer lid. I‚Äôve liked previous Bobbi Brown palettes much more, especially the Metallic trios. I also thought the lip palette for the Heart‚Äôs Truth was gorgeous, but this one just falls short for me!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-02-26 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>c54a3e37a59c99a262bd468848baa61c8364a9d6</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Bobbi Brown &amp; The Heart Truth‚Äôs Red Dress Collection 2008</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/bobbi-brown-the-heart-truths-red-dress-collection-2008/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Bobbi Brown &amp; The Heart Truth‚Äôs Red Dress Collection 2008 Jan 31, 2008 January 31, 2008 Bobbi Brown has done it again, for the third time, in supporting and promoting The Heart Truth .

Like the original Rouge G line-up, there is a theme‚Äìall of the names begin with a B. Brilliants different from the traditional Rouge G formula, because they are sheerer with more shimmer and a glossier finish. These are touted as a more natural lipstick. It feels lighter than Rouge Gs, but it looks considerably lighter on lips as well. These have a kind of ‚Äúwet‚Äù look to them, so you may not need a gloss to give you that glossy sheen. While the formula itself feels amazing on lips, without the wear (I only get about three to four hours as compared to four to six on regular Rouge Gs) and the rich pigmentation of the traditional Rouge Gs, I still prefer the original Rouge Gs over these, if I‚Äôm shelling out $46 a shade. But keep in mind that these were designed to be sheerer and glossier, so Guerlain hit the mark there. But for me, since I like my lipsticks pigmented, they‚Äôre not my favorite when I know the pigmented Rouge Gs exist! These are, however, not ultra sheer‚Äìthey do pack some color and change-up my natural lip color. Betsy is a softened berry plum with subtle gold shimmer. Applied, it has this wet, shimmering look‚Äìvery pretty and a color I‚Äôd slick on in a rush during the fall. Bianca is a semi-sheer pink-coral with barely-there shimmer. This is one of the more pigmented shades of Brilliant that I‚Äôve tried‚Äìthis is more semi-opaque than semi-sheer‚Äìand it imparts a healthy color to my natural lip color. Blondie is a subtle nude beige with champagne shimmer. On my lips, it actually does a fair job of giving my lips enough color, but it‚Äôs still sheer enough where your natural lip color can greatly affect how the color shows up on your lips. I see this turning much pinker and less nude on those with more naturally red lips. Packaging wise, these have the same fancy-pants packaging as Guerlain‚Äôs Rouge Gs, which is luxe, heavy metal. It‚Äôs a very solid piece of makeup, but I‚Äôve always felt that a lot of the price tag of Rouge Gs goes towards that indulgent packaging (which is nice, but I‚Äôd happily pay less for regular packaging!). Much of the value gets eaten up by this packaging, because this is a formula that I‚Äôd pay $30-35 for (which is typical for high-end lipsticks), while at $45-46, it‚Äôs more about finding those perfect shades you‚Äôll wear over and over again. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 29/30 Value : 7/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : If you like softer, sheerer lipstick color that goes on and feels almost like a thin yet creamy gloss, Rouge G de Brilliant hits the nail on the head. Colors are easy to wear, the formula feels fantastic on lips, and it is all housed in space-age packaging. Availability : Nordstrom , Saks Fifth Avenue See photos &amp; swatches!

I was actually disappointed that this didn‚Äôt smell more like gingerbread , because it was definitely more natural ginger scent with a kick of citrus‚Äìmaybe orange‚Äìinstead. Philosophy is usually totally on target with scent, so I‚Äôm not sure if maybe I just expected the wrong scent. It‚Äôs not a bad smell, but it wasn‚Äôt what I expected! I was also a little confused over the best way to apply/use it, because it is advertised as a scrub for the ‚Äútub and shower,‚Äù but the instructions tell you to apply to dry skin, rub in a circular motion, and then rinse off. I don‚Äôt know about you, but once I‚Äôm in the shower, there really isn‚Äôt any dry skin anymore! I tried it on dry skin once, right before I jumped into the shower, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the way to go. It felt much too harsh, was tough to apply (there wasn‚Äôt enough slip), and it was messy (I had salt granules all over my floor for days, much to my boyfriend‚Äôs chagrin). So, after that, I decided to try it another way ‚Äî in the shower. So, so much better! It‚Äôs a gritty scrub as it uses big salt particles to exfoliate, which means it might not be appropriate if you prefer softer granules or have sensitive skin. In the shower, it‚Äôs just gritty enough to give you lots of exfoliation while you rub it onto damp skin. It does dissolve, but it doesn‚Äôt do so immediately upon contact with water ‚Äî you can get a few minutes of ‚Äúscrubbing‚Äù time in before it‚Äôs time to rinse and still have granules left. Bottom Line: I didn‚Äôt notice much of a warming feel‚Äìmaybe just slightly‚Äìbut I did have much smoother, softer skin post-shower, and the scrub itself has enough hydration to keep my skin from getting scaly. I like that there‚Äôs no greasy residue or oily feel afterward as well! It‚Äôs a solid scrub, and you certainly get plenty for your money. After years of trying different scrubs, I‚Äôve found I prefer slightly less coarse scrubs, so that‚Äôs why this one didn‚Äôt have me on my feet ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still a worthwhile scrub if you do prefer coarse, salt-based scrubs.

A few weeks ago, when I reviewed Burberry‚Äôs Russet Blush , I had so many of you ask me about the lip color‚Äìin case you missed it, Ruby was it! It‚Äôs a nearly opaque shade that packs lots of color without feeling heavy or slick on lips. It‚Äôs lightweight in its feel, satiny in its texture. The application is even and smooth and doesn‚Äôt require a lot of layering (just one or two passes). There‚Äôs a soft sheen but not really a shimmer to it.

It has a glossier finish than your average lipstick, but it feels very lightweight and is moisturizing if you have healthier lips. It‚Äôs not overly creamy, bit it glides on lips easily and doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre wearing enough, but this also means that it‚Äôs just as easy to over-apply the product. (And trust me, with the amount you get, you don‚Äôt want to do that.) It doesn‚Äôt keep my lips moisturized all day though, and I do find myself needing to reapply every three to four hours. It also carries a rating of SPF 15 (titanium dioxide). So, this is a situation where I‚Äôm really bothered by the product‚Äôs price/quantity ratio. I‚Äôm willing to give all products a fair shake, and I recognize that there are brands at different price points with some brands trying to be more accessible and others remaining at arm‚Äôs length and obviously in the luxury category. I expect pricing to be in line with the brand‚Äôs image, similar products, etc., and I expect quantity to be around the average for that brand and/or direct competitors. I don‚Äôt understand why NARS‚Äô Lip Treatments are $25 (which is $1 more than their lipsticks and glosses) and HALF the size. This is not a product that packs a ton of pigment in a single swipe so you can put it up to using less, or it‚Äôs full of innovative, never-before-seen ingredients/technology. This is a product I‚Äôd easily use 3-4 times a day: two weeks of usage and it‚Äôs already over half gone. And so many thought Fresh was a splurge at $22.50 (but for 0.15 oz.)‚Ä¶ Dior (which tends to be pricier than NARS) has their Lip Glow ( $28.00 for 0.12 oz.), Fusion Beaut y has LipFusion Balm Lip Conditioning Stick ($22.00 for 0.17 oz.), and so on. If you want to go NARS, I‚Äôd suggest one of their lipsticks instead, which are quite moisturizing as far as lipsticks go (on average) with some colors on the sheer side, others more semi-opaque, but at least you‚Äôll get twice as much product. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 25/30 Value : 5/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 RECOMMENDATION: I would pass, because they‚Äôre just way too pricey for what you get. There are plenty of other more moisturizing tinted lip balms (that come in stick-form) with twice as much product for about the same price. If NARS was just a little below the average, it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, but they‚Äôre half as much and the size is half as much as their own lipsticks (which are fairly moisturizing!). If you have dry or peeling lips, this won‚Äôt be enough.

Temptalia : America has a very full, natural brow ‚Äì is there a way for women to mimic this or accentuate what they have? So many women have thin brows in a season where natural is becoming the trend. Vanessa : You can give the appearance of a fuller brow by using a brow pencil or a brow shadow (applied with an angle brush). Using a shade a touch lighter than your brow, subtlety fill in / shade the top of the brow. It is important to do this on the top because shading under the arch can close in the eye. Where you start shading depends on the shape and fullness of your brow. Very thin brows may want shading from end to end. Medium density brows can generally start at the arch and extend out to the end of the brow. Finish by brushing your brows up into the newly shaded area. Temptalia : What is the best way to get a long-lasting lip color that requires minimal touch-ups? Does lip liner really help it to stay in place longer? Vanessa : There are certainly some great long wear formulas and methods. Which you choose depends on what look you want. Because America is young and has beautiful full lips, I wanted to give her mouth intensity while maintaining a certain lightness / transparency ‚Äî nothing heavy and dated. I used the Lip Coloring Stick in Raisinberry all over the lip to ‚Äústain‚Äù the lip in a semi-sheer wash of color. The lip coloring stick is creamy enough to glide over the entire lip, dry enough to stay put, and has a very clean feel on the lip. Temptalia : What do you have to pay attention to or what additional products do you use to make America camera-ready, especially with the detail picked up by high definition? Vanessa : High definition TV picks up every detail. This means clean make up. Especially the skin. I use foundation and powder only where it is needed and very sparingly at that. To avoid powder buildup, I supply her with blotter papers for touch ups.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-01-31 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>16a3abdfb3e3c137a274e70f8b4834c0ca0f6312</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Video ‚Äì Go With Your Own Glow ‚Äì Skincancer.org</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/video-go-with-your-own-glow-skincancerorg/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Video ‚Äì Go With Your Own Glow ‚Äì Skincancer.org Year: 2008 Launches Apr 02, 2008 April 02, 2008 Found this little video with a nice tagline of ‚ÄúGo With Your Own Glow,‚Äù which I think is a fabulous motto.

It is a product geared towards those who suffer from excessive perspiration (or, you know, when you go somewhere that‚Äôs incredibly hot and humid‚Äìperhaps Florida!‚Äìwhere your sweat glands get confused and go crazy). In the package, you get two 1.32 oz tubes, which makes it easy to toss one in the purse for on-the-go emergency sweatathons. One thing I didn‚Äôt like about this was the scent ‚Äî too clinical/laboratory smelling. Does it work? I would say it works fairly well. I went through an hour of tennis, and I found that in areas where I tended to sweat more, they were drier, and some where even dry completely. Make sure you apply a thin layer of the product, because if it is too thick, you‚Äôll feel tightness around the area (I tested it on my arm and got an oops! too much amount). Less is more, and they do mean a ‚Äúpea size amount‚Äù when they list their directions! BAN Invisible Solids ($2.99) in Island Falls reminds me of a tropical getaway full of sun and sandy beaches. The scent is fresh, very reminiscent of late spring and early summer, lots of floral notes. With top notes of water greens and citrus with woodsy bottom notes, this scent is youthful and fun. I liked this because it wore well throughout the day, and it gave me no reason to worry about sweating or getting smelly despite being active. I have certain standards for any product that goes under my arms‚Äìsoft, lightly scented, leaves little to no tracks behind, absorbs quickly, and lasts at least half the day. This one worked on all accounts!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-03-31 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>4900360c352d913559977a384d55aa88fbd46e26</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Rant &amp; Rave: Eyelash Curlers</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/rant-rave-eyelash-curlers/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Rant &amp; Rave: Eyelash Curlers Features Nov 04, 2008 November 04, 2008 Tell us why/what you love, hate, or are indifferent about‚Ä¶ EYELASH CURLERS!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-11-04 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>418d6b2f0729a4f7749c870377a4a8cb81790247</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>The Spring Season: Guerlain Brit Rouge G de Brilliant Lipstick</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/the-spring-season-guerlain-brit-rouge-g-de-brilliant-lipstick/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>The Spring Season: Guerlain Brit Rouge G de Brilliant Lipstick Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Mar 19, 2010 March 19, 2010 Guerlain Brit Rouge G de Brilliant Lipstick The Spring Season: Guerlain Brit Rouge G de Brilliant Lipstick Guerlain Brit (B40) Rouge G Le Brillant Lipstick ($46.00) is a softened coral-orange with a rich, glossy sheen and subtle gold shimmer. As I mentioned in my review of a few shades of Rouge G Le Brilliant , the formula is smooth, glossy, lightweight, and moisturizing. It feels almost like a lipstick-gloss hybrid on lips, and the color is sheer but not ultra sheer. You get enough color pay off, but it‚Äôs sheer enough that those with more pigmented lips will find more variation in how these shades look on their lips. Brit lasts around three or four hours on me, as compared to the original Rouge G line-up that lasts an average of five hours. I love this kind of color for spring, though. It‚Äôs a pop of color without being bright or overwhelming and can be worn alone with just mascara or paired with a heavier eye look. Is this the right coral lipstick for you? Would you wear it? The Spring Season is a series of posts featuring my favorite soft beige, coral, and pink lipsticks and lipglosses ‚Äî all perfect for the first blossom of spring ‚Äî that runs through March 2010.

Colors include blue-pink lipsticks and Lipglasses, dirty purple and bright aqua eye shadows and coral blushes. Good news for collectors and fans: dolls and totes will be at freestanding stores, select Nordstroms, and online; scarves will only be available via MAC stores as well as online, while t-shirts will be an online exclusive.

Not only are the shades on the brighter side, the majority of them have a matte finish. The collection also has a lot of permanent shades, so check your stash before you run over to the store‚Äìand if you‚Äôre near a store, keep in mind you can purchase the permanent shades in palette form. The permanent shades are Free to Be, Lime, and Aqua, with Free to Be available at all freestanding stores and the latter two only at PRO stores. Louder, Please is a pinked red with a matte finish. This shade was quite pigmented and required very little fussing to get a nice layer of smooth, rich color. This is the closest to red I‚Äôve seen from MAC (but it is not a true red, to be clear). Free to Be is a pinky coral with a matte finish. It has some pigmentation, but it can be a rather difficult shade to really punch up. This is a permanent shade. Going Bananas is a soft, medium yellow with a frosty finish. It has a nice level of pigmentation, and it‚Äôs a particularly flattering yellow because it doesn‚Äôt run too bright or full-on yellow. This is a repromote. Sassy Grass is a medium-dark grass green with a matte finish. I thought it might resemble Wondergrass (limited edition, released with C-Shock), but it‚Äôs much darker and a wee bit greener. Lime is a muted, medium-dark chartreuse green with slight yellow undertones and a matte finish. This was probably one of the harder shades to work with out of the twelve; it‚Äôs a bit stiff and takes some layering. This is a permanent PRO shade. Aqua is a bright pastel aqua-blue with a matte finish. This is one of the more powdery matte shades by MAC, and it can be layered to get a nice level of color intensity, but it may look chalky on some complexions. This is a permanent PRO shade.

I‚Äôm proud to say I was at least able to get them on decently without 2 hours lapsing! They‚Äôre not perfect (both are a little high), but I tried to compensate by dabbing Blacktrack between my lashes and the false lashes. I will say that it‚Äôs not noticeable from a normal viewing distance ‚Äî but up close, you can kind of tell (even with my ‚Äúfix‚Äù). But for me, I‚Äôm pretty satisfied, since normally, it takes me 45 minutes to get one on, and by that point, the makeup is either so messed up or I‚Äôm so defeated I give up. (And trust, I have watched a bajillion tutorials, know all the tips, and I still struggle.) I should have also used more glue, because after 10 minutes, the edges seemed to pull back a bit. I only wore this for twenty minutes or so, as my upper lash line was itching something fierce.

Using the 239, apply Going Bananas eyeshadow on the inner third of the lid and pull upwards along the inner crease. Lightly blend Lime eyeshadow on the middle of the lid with the 239. Apply Zingy eyeshadow on the outer third of the lid with the 239 and lightly bring into outer crease. Next, apply Sassy Grass eyeshadow into the crease with the 226, lightly blending onto the outer lid. Blend Trench eyeshadow with the crease shade and highlight the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Deviant liner on the lower lash line. Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . Add false lashes if desired. For cheeks, apply Springsheen blush on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116, then lightly pat Mary Lou-manizer on the cheekbones. For lips, apply So Bad lipglass for a complementing lip. Check out more photos!

E stee Lauder Peach Nuance Blush ($26.00 for 0.25 oz.) may have escaped your notice, but it is now highly touted as a perfect dupe for MAC‚Äôs Ripe Peach . I was quite confused at the hype over Ripe Peach after it came out, to be honest. It‚Äôs pretty, but I am completely surprised at how collectible it has become. When murmurings began comparing Estee Lauder‚Äôs Peach Nuance , I knew I had to find out for myself. Peach Nuance is incredibly close, but I found it was a little lighter and a smidgen pinker‚Äìit also doesn‚Äôt have the shimmer-sheen of Ripe Peach . It‚Äôs close, truly, but it‚Äôs not a perfect dupe to me. When worn on the cheeks, the difference is much, much subtler, but when swatched, the difference is more noticeable. Peach Nuance is a lightened coral-pink with a very silky, nearly matte finish. If you want to get closer to Ripe Peach , stay more on the coral side of the blush and avoid the lighter side, which does most of the lightening. This is all to say that Peach Nuance is a lovely color, worth getting if you missed out on Ripe Peach and would love a gradated coral blusher. ( Estee Lauder also carries several other Nuance shades, which seem to all have the gradated look. ) It‚Äôs smooth and easily blended, though the color is soft and sheer and needs to be built up for a more intense look. It‚Äôs a great coral for both cool and warm skin tones, though, so it‚Äôs a very universal shade. It could be a little more pigmented, but it‚Äôs on par with the pigmentation of Ripe Peach.

Urban Decay Vegan Palette ($34.00) is a new and limited edition eyeshadow palette for fall, and it features six eyeshadows, one eyeliner, and a miniature-sized eyeshadow primer. It features only products that are vegan-friendly. The packaging is my favorite part about this product, which is creative, pretty, and functional. Otherwise, the eyeshadows are every bit of quality you‚Äôd expect from Urban Decay, but with the Naked Palett e released simultaneously and featuring three of these shades (Smog, Gunmetal, Half Baked), it makes getting both of them rather redundant. These are pitfalls of Urban Decay‚Äôs limited edition palettes, because long-time collectors often end up with multiples of several shades, since the brand reuses certain shades with great frequency. (I am personally tired of seeing Twice Baked and Baked in their palettes!) On the other hand, for newer Urban Decay fans, the palette is a cute palette with six great shades from the brand‚Äôs range. Each eyeshadow is 0.03 oz. in weight, along with a 0.03 oz. Zero 24/7 Eye Pencil and 0.13 oz. Sin Primer Potion. It‚Äôs a decent amount for the price tag, but‚Ä¶ The Naked Palette gives you so much for‚Äìdouble the eyeshadow shades (12 in total)‚Äìbut every single shade in it is full sized at 0.05 oz. For $10 more, you‚Äôre getting 0.6 oz. of eyeshadow, instead of 0.18 oz. Pretty awesome, right? All six of the Vegan palette shades can be purchased individually, in case you‚Äôre dead-set on one of them. I guess what I‚Äôm really saying is if you were waffling between the Vegan and the Naked palette, I would recommend the Naked palette and not even think twice about it. Minx is shimmering aqua green with tiny flecks of teal glitter. Urb is a softly shimmered olive green with a golden sheen. It was the least pigmented shade of the six, though I wouldn‚Äôt call it sheer or lacking in pigmentation overall. Gunmetal is a blue-toned gray-black with silver sheen. Very pigmented! Twice Baked is a satin-y medium-dark chocolate brown. Smog is a shimmering bronze with a copper-gold sheen. Half Baked is a lightened copper with a near metallic finish. The palette also includes a miniature-sized Zero 24/7 Liner (true black) and Sin Eyeshadow Primer Potion (a shimmery burnt champagne base). I need another Zero like I need another eyeliner, period, but it‚Äôs a solid black eyeliner which will work well with any of the six shadows and any combinations thereof. I find Sin very, very shimmery‚Äìso frosty that it‚Äôs hard to use as a base, particularly with frost finished shades like these. I think Eden would have been a better choice here to make it more versatile. Minx and Urb are the only shades that are on the glittery side, though neither is a glitter bomb. The other four shades are smoother and don‚Äôt feel glittery‚Äìjust shimmery. All six shades are very true-to-color with nice pigmentation and a soft, smooth texture. I really do like and enjoy the palette, and there is nothing wrong with it. It just depends on what Urban Decay palettes you already own and how much overlap you have between them all. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 28/30 Value : 9/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 4/5 RECOMMENDATION: If you don‚Äôt plan on getting the Naked eyeshadow palette ( how could you not?! ) and you don‚Äôt have too much overlap with previously released palettes, it‚Äôs an adorably packaged palette with quality in mind.

Happy Monday! P.S. ‚Äî Santal looks a little pinker on me today than it does usually, because I still had a bit of a CoverGirl lip stain lingering when I put it on! P.P.S. ‚Äî Can you believe I actually forgot to apply a highlighter? FOR SHAME! You will need the following‚Ä¶ Eyes : MAC Soft Ochre Paint Pot (neutral beige base), MAC Greengrease Greasepaint Stick (forest green), MAC Bright Sunshine Eyeshadow (PRO) (sunshine yellow), MAC Lucky Green Eyeshadow (yellowed green), MAC Bio Green Eyeshadow (PRO) (grass green), MAC Bottle Green Eyeshadow (PRO) (forest green), MAC Black Line Pearlglide Eyeliner (black with gold shimmer), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Korres Tinted Moisturizer (Honey) Cheeks : Benefit Sugarbomb Blush (peachy-pink) Lips : Chanel Santal Rouge Allure Laque (peachy-coral) Brushes : 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : N/A For eyes, start by applying Soft Ochre paint pot as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Apply Greengrease greasepaint stick on the outer half of the lid, blending out with the 217. Using the 239, apply Bright Sunshine eyeshadow on the inner third of the eyelid. Next, apply Lucky Green eyeshadow on the middle third of the eyelid and lightly blend with the inner corner. Darken the outer third of the lid with Bio Green eyeshadow with the 239, gently brushing it into the lower crease. Lightly blend Atmosphere eyeshadow , with the 239, on the outer corner and lid. Add depth to the crease by applying Bottle Green eyeshadow with the 226 into the outer crease. Lightly tap and brush Bright Sunshine eyeshadow directly above the crease to soften. To finish the eyeshadow look, sweep Femme-fi eyeshadow as a highlighter on the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Black Line eyeliner on the lower lash line and Lucky Green eyeshadow lightly patted below the lower lash line with the 219 brush. Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Sugarbomb blush to the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Santal Rouge Allure Laque for a complementing lip. Check out more photos!

As you can guess, the collection was designed to be wearable and natural, and Chanel delivered well on both. Rouge Allure Lipsticks Naive is a soft, sheer layering of subdued pink with a little mauve in it. It goes on very my-lips-but-better. It is slightly creamy, though not opaque nor overly so. It has just the lightest dusting of golden shimmer that‚Äôs extremely subtle (more so than Glossimers). Looking back at the swatches now, it‚Äôs reminiscent of Urban Decay‚Äôs Naked lipstick, just not as shimmery. Curious is a soft, sheer brown-based nude with subtle golden shimmer that‚Äôs just as slight as Naive. Both of these have finishes that look more like a soft sheen than glossy, shimmery, or frosty.

Santal is a subdued peachy-coral. It has just a little bit of a coral-tone to it, but otherwise it is quite peachy. There‚Äôs almost a hint of pink, but yet there‚Äôs definitely some golden-orange shimmer. This is exactly what I love about the Chanel Rouge Allure Laques: the colors have so much going on, it‚Äôs hard to classify them. It‚Äôs lightly glossy (but not quite as glossy as some of the other shades, like Dragon), packs plenty of color, and subtle shimmer that‚Äôs there but not glittery. I find one layer of color provides me plenty of full color coverage. I think the natural pink of my lips does add some of the pink tones I see in Santal, so if your lips are less pink, it may appear more peachy. Like Ming , this is a shade you can wear anywhere and anytime; it‚Äôs perfect for everyday or paired with a dramatic smoky eye. Since I don‚Äôt want to just re-write what I say about the formula (since it is the same‚Äìif there are any variations, you can be sure I‚Äôll call them out), here‚Äôs a quick bullet-point summary. Pros Satiny, creamy lip color that hydrates Opaque color in one layer‚Äìvery pigmented Lasts for hours and even through eating/drinking Glossy sheen Looks like a lipstick AND a gloss Easy to travel with Sleek packaging Cons Pricey at $32 each Product : 28/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 5/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : For easy, wearable color, Santal offers exactly that!

(I think the name of the product does a pretty good job of describing the product, yeah?) It‚Äôs a sheer, barely-dewy foundation that is an easy, on-the-go product. I typically use brushes/sponges to apply my foundation, but with tinted moisturizers, I tend to use my hands, as it‚Äôs the easiest method. Korres‚Äô tinted moisturizer is incredibly thin, and it applies easily, but I find I need to apply quickly or else it dries down before I‚Äôm done. I really liked the way the foundation makes my skin look, and I‚Äôm actually impressed that a tinted moisturizer could actually provide as much coverage as this one does. I do have post acne marks and the like, so I do have a few things I like to minimize/conceal, and Korres‚Äô tinted moisturizer gives me a pretty even skin tone with no fuss. The product is designed to give you a medium coverage, and it definitely does so, but it feels extremely light. It feels lighter than a moisturizer, actually. My only complaint about the tinted moisturizer is that it isn‚Äôt very moisturizing. It isn‚Äôt drying, but it doesn‚Äôt pack enough in the hydration department. I prefer to use my regular moisturizer first, let it dry, and then apply the tinted moisturizer. I have normal/combo skin, so I‚Äôm not usually super dry and rarely do I start off the day oily, so perhaps those with really oily skin would find this a great lightweight moisturizer, too. Korres‚Äô Watermelon Lightweight Tinted Moisturizer has the benefits of SPF30 (octinoxate, avobenzone), sheer to medium coverage, quick application, quick drying time, and it feels like you‚Äôre wearing nothing at all. It is also water-resistant with a ‚Äúsweat-proof tint.‚Äù I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty resistant, as it does almost feel like a tinted primer sometimes. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve gone swimming in this yet, but it does wear well all day for me under regular conditions. For those concerned about ingredients, Korres doesn‚Äôt use parabens, sulfates, mineral oil, petro-chemicals, propylene glycols, ethanoomines, GMOs, or synthetic dyes.

All of the colors are absolutely gorgeous, and I really do like how they‚Äôre nont extremely similar to existing shadows. Now, the question of whether or not they‚Äôre similar to other existing MAC products is another story! The lipgelees seemed to have more pigmentation than normal, which I liked, because usually they‚Äôre far too sheer for me to get into. I‚Äôm surprised there was no nude/neutral lip in the collection, but those who missed out on Rocking Chick should check out Pomposity and/or Vivacious. The lipsticks were not that different from past launchces, but the collection has a good mix of hues. What I purchased : Bang On Blue, Big T, Eyepopping, Fab &amp; Flashy, Goin‚Äô Bananas, Romping, and Wondergrass eyeshadows; Lil‚Äô Sizzler lip gelee; and Overrich and Pomposity lipsticks. LIPSTICK Blast O‚Äô Blue ‚Äì This is a very pale shimmery blue color, so it isn‚Äôt an in-your-face opaque blue lipstick by any means, but it would give you plenty of blue undertones underneath any lipglass or lipstick. I imagine with the right lip primer or some foundation on lips to lighten them, the blue would show up a bit more. Out To Shock ‚Äì I wanted to like this color, because it‚Äôs this shimmery pearl pink when swatched, but I knew it would end up looking more like porn-star-pink with my skintone. It would be fine paired with certain lipglasses and whatnot, but by itself, never for me. Overrich ‚Äì Overrich is this gorgeous pink-coral color, and it‚Äôs just one of those colors that works really well with my skintone. It is ultra creamy, despite being a frost. Pomposity ‚Äì This reminded me of a brighter Pink Maribu or a plummy version of Rocker Chick. Vivacious ‚Äì I found Vivacious to be extremely similar to Rocking Chick or a sheerer version of Fashionably Fuchsia, so it is definitely gorgeous. I love how creamy it felt. LIP GELEES Lil‚Äô Sizzler ‚Äì A rich coral color in a high gloss formula and no stickiness; it seems fairly pigmented, too. Mega ‚Äì This immediately reminded me of a thicker Negligee lipglass (released with Lingerie), and I know that Negligee is great over tons of lipsticks, so don‚Äôt fear the purple lipgelee! She-Boom! ‚Äì This is what a gloss would look like if it was matte, I think‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs just very glossy without the shimmer. It seemed quite pigmented as well, which is good. I‚Äôm not a lip gelee fan in general, so I skipped it, though this would be on the list if I liked lipgelees! Sugar Shock ‚Äì This is similar to She-Boom!, but then it‚Äôs ultra sheer compared to the other three lipgelees. It‚Äôs a sheer medium pink with some shimmer. EYESHADOW Bang On Blue ‚Äì A deep navy blue, but brighter‚Äìmore intense‚Äìand it goes on quite pigmented without an overwhelming amount of shimmer. I can‚Äôt think of any existing product that really compares well with this one. Big T ‚Äì I would have to say that this color isn‚Äôt nearly so unique amongst the collection, because it does remind me a bit of Pompous Blue or Zonk Bleu!. They might not be exactly the same, but they are close enough that you could skip this color. Eyepopping ‚Äì Like Big T, this one instantly reminded me of previous MAC shadows: Bitter and Overgrown. I would say it is more like Overgrown than Bitter, because Bitter is flatter and more matte than Wondergrass. It‚Äôs a lovely color, but not overly unique. I‚Äôm also reminded of True Chartreuse pigment when I look at it. Fab &amp; Flashy ‚Äì A shimmery medium orange without gold reflects, and it has such a smooth texture to it. This is close to Rule or Sunsplosion eyeshadows, though. Going Bannas ‚Äì If Chrome Yellow and Gold Dusk had a loveshadow together, Goin‚Äô Bananas would be the result. The brightness of Chrome Yellow is there, but it isn‚Äôt so overwhelming. It has a good amount of gold in it, so there is shimmer in the finish. Passionate ‚Äì First, this is a repromote/permanent color, so I hope not everybody rushes out to get this one! I happened to already have it, because it is an intense reddish pink color with a near matte finish. Romping ‚Äì A better version of Hepcat/Plum Dressing, in my opinion, because it has great payoff without using any base. It also a healthy dose of shimmer, but it isn‚Äôt glittery. I just find it to be much smoother than the aforementioned offenders. Wondergrass ‚Äì This is a lovely green; a true medium green without being dark or too light. Think Swimming without the lustre finish, lots of shimmer, and so much more payoff. It does seem like a good dupe for Kelly Green pigment.

Complementing the Fall 2010 runway looks that featured bright neon colors amid shiny black plastic, latex, and rubber reinventions of vintage must-haves, Plastix evokes the vintage classic trend with four new lacquers and a unique new formula that coats the nails with a smooth glossy matte ‚Äúplastic‚Äù finish. The exclusive finish and texture is a first in the nail category, delivering a monochromatic, shiny and rubbery look that takes experimentation to an entirely new level, with the focus being on both the distinctive nail surface, as well as the latest in color trends. The unique look can not be achieved with color alone as the finish is a must for recreating the true ‚Äúplastic‚Äù statement.

Or are you just a make-up artist that loves their products? A : Nope, I don‚Äôt work for MAC in the slightest! I‚Äôm just a fan of their products, and I don‚Äôt really consider myself a makeup artist, since it isn‚Äôt my profession or anything üòâ Q : So I was just wondering, could you do an article sometime about how you keep your makeup organized? I‚Äôm looking to start up my own collection, but I‚Äôm hesitant to buy very much since I won‚Äôt know how to keep it all nice and tidy so I‚Äôll actually use different colors. Do you use a case from Mac or do you have any other recommendations that‚Äôll keep everything organized? A : If you look at my collection post , you can see how I store my makeup. I don‚Äôt use a case for MAC, if you mean a traincase. I do own a traincase, but I bought it at a random beauty supply store for $30 or so. I only use that when I travel, but generally not for storage when I‚Äôm at home. Silverware drawers make excellent holders of pigments and pots! You can also find small plastic drawer sets at Target or Walmart that work really well for storing larger items. I‚Äôm moving soon, so maybe I‚Äôll do a new organization article when I get my stuff settled in! Q : Do you know what is similar to Melody e/s? A : There aren‚Äôt any colors very similar to it that are in the permanent line. Melody is nearly matte (or maybe it is, I can‚Äôt remember), and MAC‚Äôs permanent teal colors are shimmery. However, there is a collection coming out this Thursday that has a teal shadow called Big T that reminds me an awful lot of Melody ‚Äì at least moreso than any of the existing colors. Q : Where do you purchase the shadows and pigments that you use on your eyes? Do you just get things from mac.com? A : I purchase 90% of my items from freestanding MAC stores or MAC counters found in department stores. I very rarely purchase anything from maccosmetics.com! I prefer to see everything in person, I guess, which is why I go to check out new collections before making any purchases. Sometimes I‚Äôll pick up items from other sellers on Livejournal or EBay, if the price is right! Q : I was wondering why you usually don‚Äôt use pigments except as bases? A : It has a lot to do with the fact that I just have so many eyeshadows to use, so I tend to use them on top of my base. I really do prefer my pigments wet compared to loose or dry, too. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with using pigments for actual dry color, though. I also love to use a few pigments on my lips or on my cheeks. Q : I have two-toned lips and everybody says I should put foundation on my lips and use that as a base, but is that really good for you? Also, will you be doing tutorials with other brand besides MAC? A : Putting foundation on lips is an old make-up trick, and I do it myself sometimes, though not heavily. I tend to make a quick sweep across my lips whenever I‚Äôm almost finished with applying foundation on my face, so there is just a thin layer of foundation on my lips. You can also try something like MAC‚Äôs Prep + Prime Lip which yields similar results to the foundation trick, but it is made for usage on the lips. I suppose if you lick your lips a lot, then perhaps you‚Äôll be ingesting foundation a bit, but you‚Äôre also ingesting lipstick and gloss, which probably aren‚Äôt too yummy. Otherwise I can‚Äôt really think of how it would be bad. I can‚Äôt imagine doing tutorials for other brands as I own primarily MAC makeup. I have a couple of other non-MAC products, but not a whole lot! Q : I‚Äôm gonna be wearing a lime green outfit this Saturday and was wondering if you could give me any suggestions on eye color. I was thinking maybe a gold and a bit of lime, but I‚Äôm not sure what colors or exactly how to do it. A : I think gold would be an excellent choice! If it‚Äôs really lime green, your eyes should be more on the subtle side, since the dress pops on its own. I would think that a light gold wash with a touch of green or olive green in the crease might work out excellently. You could even get away with using no green and only focusing on gold toned hues, starting with a true gold on the crease (like Goldmine) and working to a richer, dark brown with gold reflects in the outer lid/crease (like Amber Lights). Q : I have my prom on July 4 and I was wondering what make-up would suit me as my prom dress is black with a band of cream on the top with a little cream bow. A : First, I definitely recommend reading my prom article , because that links to specific suggests for different types of dresses. I think you would look lovely in a very subtle eye and more dramatic lip (reds, dark berries, etc.), or you could do more dramatic eye like a smokey eye. You could do an eye with a touch of cream/beige or even cold on the inner lid or all over the lid, with just a subtle dark crease color and perhaps a bit of it on the outer portion of your lid.

I also used several other Korres products to bring it all together, but this was the first time I‚Äôve really done a full look using just Korres products. I loved the blendability of the eyeshadows‚Äìsmooth, pigmented, and easy to use‚Äìand the coverage of the Wild Rose foundation was a nice and buildable. As you can tell, I was test-driving quite a few products in this look ‚Äî the eyeshadows, eyeliner, mascara, blush, and foundation! You will need the following‚Ä¶ Eyes : Benefit Stay Don‚Äôt Stray (neutral base), Korres #44 Eyeshadow (light chartreuse green), Korres #42 Eyeshadow (sky blue), Korres #84 Eyeshadow (dark blue), MAC Vanilla Eyeshadow (soft highlighter), Korres #12 Eyeliner Pencil (aqua), Korres Abysynnia Mascara (black) Face : Korres Wild Rose Foundation (WRF2), Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder (translucent) Cheeks : Korres #44 Blush (coral orange) Lips : Korres #45 Coral Lipstick (soft coral), Korres #33 Nude Lipgloss (sheer champagne) Brushes : 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 116 (dense blush brush) For eyes, start by applying Stay Don‚Äôt Stray as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Using the 239, apply #44 eyeshadow on the lower lid. Apply #42 Eyeshadow on the middle of the lid with the 239 brush. Next, apply #84 eyeshadow into the crease with the 226, lightly blending outwards and onto the outer lid. Blend Vanilla eyeshadow with the crease shade and highlight the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying #12 eyeliner on the lower lash line. Finish by sweeping lashes with Abysinnia mascara .

It runs a little on the reddish wine side, and the shimmer is noticeable without being too much. It‚Äôs a diamond shadow, so it has a frostier finish than other iridescent shadows by Make Up For Ever. #141 is a sheer, slightly shimmery pale mauve-pink. It doesn‚Äôt have the best color pay off, but it can be layered to get a little more pop out of it. #162 is a matte, brownish-burgundy shade. It can be layered for increased intensity, though it has decent color pay off. I like it for the crease, personally! #84 is a shimmery, smoky green with gray tone. It has golden shimmer laced throughout. It reminded me of a lighter MAC Greensmoke eyeshadow, actually. #47 is a matte, grayed-down green. It‚Äôs kind of like a drab green in a way, but it‚Äôs a nice way to add depth to the crease without adding a lot of darkness. Which of these are your favorites? Check out more photos !

If bold colors aren‚Äôt your thing, consider Strata. It‚Äôs a mix of a golden, taupe-y brown, medium brown with neutral undertones, and a pearly white with subtle white gold sheen. The texture of these trios is so buttery, almost creamy, and nicely pigmented, too. I always think of Shiseido for skin care (perhaps because some of the first Shiseido products I tried were from their suncare range), but these eyeshadows are stellar. I mean, they‚Äôre truly impressive‚Äìyou gotta swatch ‚Äôem next time you‚Äôre near a Shiseido counter.

A : Katherine Hardwicke, the director, and I have previously worked together on a movie called ‚ÄúLords of Dogtown,‚Äù so we know each other very well. I began by preparing sketches of my vision, keeping in mind the descriptions Stephenie Meyers (Twilight‚Äôs Author) set forth in the books. Bella‚Äôs (Kristen Stewart‚Äôs character) description in the novel is very pale and extremely beautiful with large chocolate brown eyes, so she wore colored lenses every day. I also pictured her as a natural beauty, which is exactly what Kristen is. I used a light hand while applying all neutral colors to make her look as though she had no makeup on. Edward‚Äôs (Robert Pattinson‚Äôs character) description in the novel is impossibly handsome almost god-like. His skin is marble-pale, hard as stone and ice cold, but perfect and flawless. Edwards‚Äô eyes are described as topaz colored when he is normal and black like onyx, when hungry. Q: Were there any changes to the looks of the characters that weren‚Äôt planned? A : At the beginning, Katherine Hardwicke visualized Edward with long hair, yet after studying his face and jaw line in the makeup test, the decision was made to go with short hair to accentuate his amazing jaw line. Q: What was the overall look of the makeup in this movie? A : All the vampires had to be pale, but I didn‚Äôt want them to look to ghoulish, somewhere between Sweeney Todd and Interview with the Vampire. The choice was made for a denser, more opaque look for the supporting vampires and a lighter look for the leading man. The challenge was they still had to look beautiful and handsome. The key was striking the delicate shading balance. We had two weeks of makeup test. This is the time for a makeup artist to unleash their imagination. During the testing Katherine let me know when I was on the mark. Katherine has a fabulous eye for detail and everything I did had to be approved by her. Q: Were there any other challenges you encountered while working on location in Portland, Oregon? A: The rain was a huge challenge. We were outside, and it rained the entire time we were there. Most of the shots were exterior; trying to fix makeup in the rain with wet faces and wet brushes was difficult. In the end, I must say I loved working on this movie, it challenge my creativity as never before. The cast was such a great group of talented young actors. Q: What were your non-makeup related responsibilities in terms of creating this look? A: Another one of my jobs was too find a contact lens specialist. So I called upon the expertise of Cristina Patterson Ceret FX lens/painter from Professional VisionCare. Q: What MAC products did you use on the film Twilight? A : The M.A.C products I used on this film were eye shadows and powder for our principles. We had several other characters and day players I used M.A.C. foundations, lipsticks and blushes. Q: How long have you used MAC products? A : In 30 years as a makeup artist in my career and over 50 movies, MAC products have played an integral part in my work. I have probably used all of them at one time or another. I choose the cosmetics based on their skin tone and whether they are oily or dry. It also depends on how the product reacts to their particular skin type.

Call the look ‚Äúbeachy done‚Äù ‚Äì and we‚Äôre seeing it all over the NY spring runways; cheeks highlighted and accented on the brow bone. Beigey lips (the famous Spice lip pencil filled in with Subculture lip pencil and 2N lipglass) with a tint of pink and white eye pencil inside the eyes. Remember the smoky eye? This season, it‚Äôs on hiatus. Wide eyed is where it‚Äôs at. J. MENDEL How many times do we have to hear the name ‚ÄúLauren Hutton‚Äù before we smell a trend? For J. Mendel, Charlotte Tilbury evoked that seventies glamazon ‚Äì and a Jerry Hall feeling ‚Äì in the makeup. Last spring‚Äôs words like ‚Äúfresh‚Äù and ‚Äúpretty‚Äù have been replaced by ‚Äúdiva‚Äù and ‚Äúexpensive and glamorous.‚Äù On top of the glowing skin and the ubiquitous 4N lipstick (paled down by concealer), Tilbury bronzed out the models‚Äô eyes with MAC Paint Pots, placing a copper shade right over the eyeball. You could almost hear Roxy Music playing in the background. ‚ÄúMore than this‚Ä¶‚Äù BABY PHAT Okay, so perhaps the predicted death of colour for the Spring ‚Äô08 makeup palette was just tiny bit premature. But then Baby Phat always breaks all the rules. For Kimora Lee Simmons‚Äô collection, makeup artist Lisa Butler used fuchsia like Giorgio Armani uses greige. She blended strong fuchsia blush for both the cheeks and eyes, but applied them in a light dust of powder. But when it came to the lips, she didn‚Äôt hold back ‚Äì blending three different red fuchsias together to get the perfect dark pink pout. PORTS 1961 Designer Tia Cibani‚Äôs spring influence was African safari so makeup artist Greg Wencel kept the faces slightly moist (‚Äúfrom humidity‚Äù) and put emphasis on tanned cheeks and matte terra cotta mouths. ‚ÄúThink African clay paintings,‚Äù he explained. The eyes were opened up by a trend we‚Äôre starting to see everywhere for spring: a white line painted close to the lash line. So forget that fifties cat eye ‚Äì and stat thinking; white eyeliner! Keep reading to see what trends were created on Day 5 and Day 6 at spectacular Fashion Week! DAY 5 CATHERINE MALANDRINO To Pecheux took Catherine Malandrino‚Äôs theme; a petal palette ‚Äì and ran with it. ‚ÄúThink of the sunrise in St. Tropez,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut think of it rising over a beautiful old French hotel, where all the artists live and work.‚ÄùIn others, flowery ‚Äì but arty flower. Kind of Renoir. The rose colours went on the cheeks. The jasmine, lavenders, and lilacs went on the eyes. And the mouths were a pouty purplish pink reminiscent of peony. Think Flower Power a la Francais. RUFFIAN The theme of Madame Pompadour was taken pretty seriously at Ruffian. The models‚Äô hair was in literal pompadours ‚Äì and Polly Osmond applied white powder base to the outlining areas of their faces, reminiscent of powdered wigs. Then she painted on China Doll-like pink cheeks for a regal feeling and matched them with a soft pink mouth. On the eyelids ‚Äì only gloss. The effect? Marie Antoinette goes clubbing. ROSA CHA Okay, we already know that Spring ‚Äô08 is about channeling the casual jet set chic of Lauren Hutton. But at Rosa Cha, Gordon Espinet was going for the looks for all the great cover girls of the seventies. ‚ÄúThink Francesco Scaullo,‚Äù he said. To Espinet, seventies makeup implies, ‚ÄúNo structure in the makeup ‚Äì but lots of strong textures.‚Äù He made the skin shine with gold and bronze highlighters applied to the cheeks, eyes, and lips. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about taking beach style,‚Äù he said of the famous bathing suit line, ‚Äúand making it fashion.‚Äù TEMPERLEY LONDON We‚Äôve seen a hint of fluorescence slipping into makeup for Spring ‚Äô08 ‚Äì in the form of the matte electric orange mouth. Charlotte Tilbury invoked it to balance the palette in Alice Temperley‚Äôs frocks: we saw a lot of whites, neutrals ‚Äì and orange. Tilbury used a combo of three MAC tools to create the look: a MAC Orange Lip Pencil, the Lipstick Morange, and Lipmix. The mouth was counterbalanced by a large ‚ÄúC‚Äù shape of gloss painted in a semi circle from the brow and eye bone over the cheekbone. ‚ÄúI think of it was 1930‚Äôs makeup that‚Äôs mixed with rave culture,‚Äù Tilbury noted. Face ‚Äî Face and Body Foundation was applied to even out skin discolorations and Blot Powder was dusted where necessary. M√¢ÀÜ‚Ñ¢A√¢ÀÜ‚Ñ¢C Gloss was applied on the nose, cheekbones and temple for an all-over, sexy look.Face and Body Foundation was applied to even out skin discolorations and Blot Powder was dusted where necessary. M√¢ÀÜ‚Ñ¢A√¢ÀÜ‚Ñ¢C Gloss was applied on the nose, cheekbones and temple‚Ä¶ Eyes ‚Äî For a futuristic, wet looking glow, M√¢ÀÜ‚Ñ¢A√¢ÀÜ‚Ñ¢C Gloss was applied all over lids. Lashes were curled and coated with Plush Lash Mascara in Black. Tip Lips ‚Äî M√¢ÀÜ‚Ñ¢A√¢ÀÜ‚Ñ¢C Pro Orange Lip Mix was blended with M√¢ÀÜ‚Ñ¢A√¢ÀÜ‚Ñ¢C Pro Creme Color Base in Flaming Fuschia, defined with Lip Pencil in Redd and topped with Morange Lipstick for an extra punch of color. RODARTE James Kaliardos went eye to eye with Rodarte‚Äôs punk ballerina look for spring by creating an unusual and highly artistic eye makeup design: back lines underneath and above the eye that met in an exaggerated cat formation somewhere out in the nether brow bone area. The lids were dabbed with turquoise or cobalt, reflecting Rodarte‚Äôs major colour theme.An art statement or a new way to apply eyeliner that‚Äôs post modern and pushes the makeup envelope? At Rodarte, it was actually both. The rest of the face was dewy, natural, and young ‚Äì as were those Belle du Jour ponytails dipped in coloured ink. DAY 6 DKNY Remember ‚Äì if you‚Äôre old enough ‚Äì Scavullo‚Äôs photos of Patti Hansen in the seventies? Her gold hair, large, teased and waved, on the beach in a printed jersey caftan, with a beautiful pink pout and matching cheeks ‚Ä¶ the eye took a major backseat in Charlotte Tilbury‚Äôs DKNY spring face. The lips and cheeks matched like a purse and pumps, in a sheer shade lilac pink ‚Äì while the eyes were naked and shiny. Anyway, who needs eye makeup when they‚Äôre wearing a caftan? RICHARD CHAI James Kaliardos did perhaps the most minimalist makeup of the week at Richard Chai. There wasn‚Äôt even any foundation ‚Äì just concealer where needed. The eyes were dotted with Soft Ochre paint pot, touched with a little Nanogold eye shadow on the top of the lid. Coppering eye shadow was dusted on the crease and lightly under the eye. And Beurre cremestick liner adorned the mouth radiating from the center out ‚Äì so there were no harsh lines. It was practically a nudist camp for the face. Face ‚Äî To keep skin clean and minimal, MAC Select Moisture Cover was applied where needed. Loose Blot Powder was dusted over t-zone to complete a soft, clean look. Eyes ‚Äî MAC Paint in Bare Canvas was applied to lid as a base. All That Glitters Eye Shadow was then layered over with a MAC #239 Brush to give the eye an opalescent, golden goddess look. Copper Plate Eye Shadow was added to crease and underneath the lower lash line to create a soft, deep ethereal eye. Lashes were liberally curled with a MAC Eye Lash Curler MAC Paint in Bare Canvas was applied to lid as a base. All That Glitters Eye Shadow was then layered over with a MAC #239 Brush to give the eye an opalescent, gold‚Ä¶ Li ps ‚Äî MAC Lip Conditioner and Lip Erase in Dim were applied to lip as a base and Cream Stick Lip Liner in Buerre was buffed on to create a natural stain. TULEH If Grace Kelly went to the beach ‚Äì which she probably never did ‚Äì but IF he did, she‚Äôd be this season‚Äôs Tuleh girl. As envisioned by Polly Osmond, she looks beautiful ‚Äì but does not appear to have a lot of makeup on ‚Äì but she does. Osmond worked with bronze powder to highlight and low light areas of the face and cheekbones ‚Äì using her favourite color, MAC‚Äôs Taupe. In the crease of the eyes, she applied a pinkish gold eye shadow called Hey ‚Äì and then used the all important concealer on the lips, covered with Subculture lip pencil and 2N lipglass. Are you getting a hint of the trends now? 2N, Subculture, Taupe, and a white eye pencil inside the eyes have turned up at more than half the NY shows. BERARDI Mariel Barrera kept it chic and simple at Berardi, using safari warm hues on the lips and cheeks, and only a pale copper on the eyes. But the effect was terra cotta meets red earth; a bronzed goddess who goes Big Game Hunting with Peter Beard.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-09-10 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>508509a8adfb2c0b1602b5fbb3f10fb9899e2c95</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Tutorial ‚Äì Soft, Subtle Warm Neutral Eye with Goldmine, Bronze, Carbon, &amp; Indianwood paint pot</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tutorial-soft-subtle-warm-neutral-eye-with-goldmine-bronze-carbon-indianwood-paint-pot/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Tutorial ‚Äì Soft, Subtle Warm Neutral Eye with Goldmine, Bronze, Carbon, &amp; Indianwood paint pot Tutorials Sep 10, 2007 September 10, 2007 This tutorial is designed to walk you through, step-by-step, a very easy and subtle neutral eye that‚Äôs perfect for any occasion. Skill Level : Beginner Eyes : Indianwood paint pot (Warm golden brown cream shadow/base), Grain eyeshadow (light neutral), Goldmine eyeshadow (warm, rich gold), Rye eyeshadow (antique gold), Bronze eyeshadow (rich warm brown), Carbon eyeshadow (matte black), Graphblack technakohl (black kohl liner), and black mascara. Face : If you‚Äôd like to compliment the eyes, use Other Worldly blush (warm dirty brown) on apples of cheeks with Taupe blush to contour. Lips : For matching lips, try Strawberry Blonde lipstick with Tartlette lipglass. Tools : MAC 249 firm shadow brush, 239 shadow brush, 219 detailed crease brush Here are the products that you will be using. Start with a naked/bare eye. Using the MAC 249 firm, flat shadow brush, pick up a small amount of Indianwood paint pot ‚Äì the amount of product shown on the brush is all you need for each eye. Applying the product you picked up with the 249, begin applying the color on the inner portion of your lid. Cover your entire lid and just above your crease with Indianwood paint pot. It should be smooth and fairly even, but it does not need to be perfect. Using the 239 brush, apply Grain eyeshadow to the inner lid. This is how it appears. Pick up a generous amount of Goldmine eyeshadow with the 239 and apply to the middle of the lid. Bring the brush downwards as pictured to cover the entire middle portion of the lid. It should resemble this photo at this point. With the 239 brush, pick up some Bronze eyeshadow and apply it to the outer third of your lid. As always, bring the color from just around the crease area downwards to the lash line. This is why this is called an easy neutral eye, because we haven‚Äôt even started to blend! Repeat the step before, only this time place the Bronze eyeshadow in the very outer portion of your crease. Move the 239 sideways towards the outermost portion, just to darken slightly. This is what you should have right now. With the 239, pick up a very small amount of Carbon eyeshadow and move your brush to the outer half of your crease and sweep outwards. By sweeping outwards you will deposit the black shadow in the portion you want. It should be a very obvious black line, almost, because it has not been blended, only applied. Using the same method as used to apply the black shadow, use this method, only with less pressure, to sweep back and forth across the area with the black shadow to help blend it into the other lid colors. When meshed with the other colors, the black becomes a smokey brown color and less drastic and harsh. With the 239, pick up a generous amount of Grain eyeshadow and begin applying it beneath the inner portion of your eyebrow. Use a sweeping motion towards the outer edge of your eyebrow as pictured. This is what you should find yourself seeing. Continue to apply (and pick up more shadow if necessary) the highlight color directly below the first sweep of color and above the crease to help mesh the colors together. This is how all the highlight should be looking at this point. You can add more if you feel you need it (pictured here, more could be applied closer to the inner lid, directly below the inner brow) or less by dabbing the area with your fingertip (gently!). Using the 219, apply Bronze eyeshadow along the outer lower lash line. Like so. Again, using the 219, apply some Goldmine eyeshadow to the inner half of the lower lash line. Your lash line should look something like this. Apply Graphblack technakohl or your choice in black eyeliner to the lower lash line, keeping clear of the water line. Your finished product will be a subtle neutral eye that can be worn throughout the day, at just about any occasion. √Ç</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-09-10 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>06f9991a11d8187db8ce9247c39151c29ab90c94</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Tutorial ‚Äì Eyebrows &amp; Face</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tutorial-eyebrows-face/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Tutorial ‚Äì Eyebrows &amp; Face Tutorials Jan 30, 2007 January 30, 2007 Eyebrow tutorial with photos &amp; text-only ‚Äútutorial‚Äù of how I apply my face makeup and powders. Skill Level : Beginner Supplies: Expresso eyeshadow (use the shade that correctly matches your brows!), thick angled brush (like the 266), thin angled brush; moisturizing before with a facial cream is also a good way to help get the powder shadow to stay on longer (wait for the moisturizer to dry for the most part, though!). Using a thick angled brush, pick up the brow color and begin filling in the thickest part of your brows (or the innermost portion) by starting at the top. Blend outwards and upwards, make sure to repeat only starting at the bottom instead of the top. Your results‚Ä¶ Using a thin angled brush, pick up the brow color and place directly under the portion of your brow that may need slight darkening. For me, it is just past the thickest part of my brow. Move your brush along the underside of your eyebrow upwards and outwards. Continue along the tail of your brow until you reach the end of your brow. Repeat the process as before, only along the upperside of the brow following it until the end of the tail part of the brow. You should get something that looks like this. This is a tad messy, and when you do your eye makeup, your highlight helps bring it altogether in the end üôÇ It is also a good idea to take a clean mascara wand to help straighten out your brow hairs so they look all clean and proper! Face Tutorial Foundation : Apply your foundation using a fluffy brush, whether it be the 182, 187, or a blush/powder brush. This works best with liquid foundations, not powder or pressed ones. You can use either your fingers or the brush itself to pick up the liquid foundation and apply it to your face in a series of ‚Äúspots‚Äù or ‚Äústreaks‚Äù that will later be blended out. I usually apply a bit to each cheek, my chin, and the middle of my forehead. If you use a brush like the 187 that is not as easy to blend in circles as the 182, the best method is to stroke sideways and at an angle. I find that the 187 gives some ‚Äústreakage‚Äù around corner areas like the nose and underneath the eyes, so I end up using my fingers to blend these areas at the end. The 182, however, allows you to blend in a circular motion, as well as to the sides, and it eliminates most of the need to do any last-minute finger-blending at the end. Contouring : I only contour the hollows of my cheeks because I‚Äôm fairly happy with the thick/thinness of my nose. I do this by sucking in my cheeks and making a fish face (attractive, I know). I use an angled fluffy brush and pick up bronzer and apply my contour line a little after the hollow begins by my mouth and brush it along the emphasized hollow to your ears. If you do not plan to put any other color on your cheeks/face, you can easily blend this out using a fluffy powder brush (my favorite is the 182). Otherwise, leave the line as it is, as unblended as it appears. Blush : I use a fluffy blush brush and pick up the blush color and apply to the apples of my cheeks. You can figure out where your ‚Äúapples‚Äù are by smiling real big. You‚Äôll apply the color there and pull it towards your temples. After this, blend it downwards towards the contour line with what residual color is left on your brush. I usually only pick up color once or twice, and the bulk of it ends up on the apples of my cheeks. You can easily blend the two colors by placing the brush so that it touches both of them at the lowest point (closest to your mouth) and pulling your brush upwards along both of them towards your ear. You can swish the brush sideways as you move upwards to facilitate blending, as well. I prefer to take the 182 for the blending procedure after the color has been applied, because it is supremely amazing when it comes to rounding everything out. Highlighting : I usually highlight using some sort of pigment (like Pink Opal), and a good brush to apply this is the 182, but also the 187. The 187 has special bristles that allow for a very light application, so you can get the highlight color to fall just over the apples of your cheeks and by your temples without much trouble. Again, smile really big, and notice the apples of your cheeks. You want to apply the highlight color just above the apples, basically just before they flatten out at the top, but before the space underneath your eye begins.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-01-30 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>c7d3c77f8b5216e982c8279bb90a37861e9568e3</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC 192 Cheek/Face Brush Photos &amp; Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-192-cheekface-brush-photos-review/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC 192 Cheek/Face Brush Photos &amp; Review Reviews Jul 19, 2009 July 19, 2009 Beauty Basics: MAC Face Brushes Beauty Basics is a series covering basic products and tools that help to make applying your makeup easier. To view the entire series to date, be sure to visit the beauty basics , or you can view posts within the series about MAC Face Brushes . Focus On: MAC 192 Cheek/Face Brush MAC 192 Cheek/Face Brush ($32.00) is a flat, paddle-shaped brush with a more tapered edge than the typical paddle-shape. It‚Äôs made out of synthetic fibers, and it is designed to be used with creamy/emollient face and cheek products, like blushcremes, moisturizer, Strobe, etc. For application of blushcremes (or cream blushes‚Äìsame thing), I like to use the tip to just gently apply a few dots of color on the cheek. Then I use the entire brush to blend it outwards and get a soft, smooth look. I‚Äôve also found that the size of this brush (smaller than the 190) makes it a good brush for blending concealer in, too. It‚Äôs large enough that it only takes a few brush strokes to blend your concealer into place, but it isn‚Äôt so large that you can‚Äôt get into the nooks and crannies. This is a solid brush, and actually sometimes prefer this one to the 188 for blushcremes. How do you like to use this brush ?

She‚Äôs a celebrity esthetician with her own line (I love her AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel !), and she also regularly updates her blog with skin care tips and tricks. Go to bed early to avoid yawning . Every time you yawn at night, it increases fluids around the eyes resulting in tears. When you stay up too late and yawn excessively, those fluids increase swelling making you puffy in the morning‚Äîno different than if you cried a lot. Sleep on two pillows. Keep your head elevated by sleeping on two pillows at night to reduce under eye puffiness. This helps to reduce fluid retention in the eye area so you‚Äôre less puffy in the morning. Avoid using rich and greasy eye creams. Many companies formulate eye creams with rich oils to compensate for the lack of oil glands around the eyes. Although this moisture is so needed, the heavy oils can migrate into the eyes while you sleep and cause you puffiness when you wake up in the morning. The solution? Avoid the ingredients mineral oil and petroleum in your eye creams and don‚Äôt apply too close to the lower lash line. (Another problem with heavy eye creams containing these ingredients is that the oils can weigh down the delicate skin tissue and over the course of time, can weaken elastin fibers causing premature wrinkles.) All Ren√©e Rouleau eye creams are very hydrating‚Äîbut not greasy. Ditch the cucumbers. They don‚Äôt contain any miraculous puffiness-reducing properties but they do have a gel-like consistency (from the seeds) making it good for retaining cold temperatures‚Äîand it‚Äôs the cold that reduces puffiness. Since it‚Äôs the cold that reduces puffiness, you can grab anything out of your refrigerator (ice, bag of frozen peas) and it will do the trick‚Äîas long as it is held on the area for at least 10 minutes. (Note: The only type of puffiness that can be reduced from cold, is puffiness that is not normally there‚Äîlike when you wake up in the morning. Unfortunately, there is no cure for chronic puffiness/bags except cosmetic surgery.) Avoid eating salty foods at night. Avoiding salty foods (especially at night) can definitely help prevent under eye puffiness when you wake in the morning. Excessive sodium causes water retention resulting in excessive swelling of the eye tissue. If you are trying to avoid puffiness of the face (especially before a special event), it‚Äôs best to avoid salty foods at night and drink a lot of water to flush your system.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2010-08-31 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>be88082223a08e6e9d69db5bcf8254cdd9823e88</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Products ‚Äì Eye Shadows ‚Äì Browns</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-products-eye-shadows-browns/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Products ‚Äì Eye Shadows ‚Äì Browns Brand &amp; Product Round-ups Sep 10, 2007 September 10, 2007 This post contains product photos of brown eyeshadows. 07 Surprint Sepia All That Glitters Amber Lights Antiqued Antiqued Arena Bagatelle Banshee Beaded Beautyburst Beautyburst Boutique Brown B-rich Bronze Bronze Brown Down Brun By Jupiter By Jupiter Casino Century Cork Elite Elite Embark Embark Expresso Expresso Flipside Frenchcuff French Grey Hard To Please Honesty Honeylust Illusionary/Burning Ambition Kid Lightshade</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-09-10 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>0717d220f419eb66a4826f4531e71d34b6c4bcb5</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Products ‚Äì Eye Shadows ‚Äì Purples</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-products-eye-shadows-purples/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Products ‚Äì Eye Shadows ‚Äì Purples Brand &amp; Product Round-ups Sep 10, 2007 September 10, 2007 This post contains product photos for purple eyeshadows. 02 Iris Print Amethyst Au Contraire Beautiful Iris Beautymarked Blackberry Cinders Cranberry Creme de Violet Crystal Demi-sweet Digit Dovefeather Dreamy Endless Love Fertile Flirty Number Fuchsia Gallant Hepat Hush Into the Light Inventive Iris Print Jeweltone Laven-dah Lavender Sky Leisuretime Leap Li‚Äôlily Limo Limo Little Madame Little Minx Loungewear Melton Mauve Mercurial Mercurial</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-09-10 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>34c8db07510723a13d9e83742e7b996899699bb5</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Orange 001</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-orange-001-2/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Orange 001 Looks Feb 06, 2007 February 06, 2007 I used Copper Sparkle pigment on lid, Juiced eyeshadow on inner lid, Bronze eyeshadow on middle of lid, Coppering eyeshadow on outer lid and crease, Juiced eyeshadow above crease, Hush eyeshadow on brow, and Auto-orange liquidlast liner on lower lash line.

Skill Level : Beginner-Moderate You need the following tools for contouring: a contour brush (I use MAC‚Äôs 168) and a contour color (I use MAC‚Äôs Enriched Refined Bronze). An angled powder brush can usually double as a contouring brush, just like you can make your choice in the color you want to use to contour. In general, I would assume a color that is darker than your normal skintone is ideal. Contouring adds shadows to your face to create more dimension (carving the cheeks or accenting the cheekbones, thinning out the nose, etc.). Contouring is really pretty easy, so long as you place the contour line in the right position, and it is quite simple to find that right area. You need to make a ‚Äúfishy‚Äù face, which is when you suck in your cheeks as much as you can. You can see/feel the hollow it creates below you cheeks; this is the area! Using your contour brush, pick up your contour color, and apply in the hollow created by the fish-face. This is why makeup is done in private, usually, because this pose is not at all flattering üòâ The brush should fit nicely into the hollow of your cheeks, and you simply guide it upwards alongside the hollow/curve. I followed my natural curve, which you can see resembles the same angle/line of my jaw. This is what the finished product looks like, and of course, you need to blend this out if you weren‚Äôt going to use blush later on (which I will be doing). You can see that I have followed my jawline almost, only beginning in the hollow of my cheeks. For me, that means the curve ends around the middle of my ear. You need the following tools for adding blush to your cheeks: a blush/powder brush (I use Philosophy‚Äôs blush brush) and a blush color (I‚Äôm using MAC‚Äôs Margin blush for this tutorial). Any large, fluffy powder brush will prove to be a decent blush applicator. The blush color you choose can be whatever color you want, and I usually match my blush color with the rest of my makeup. There aren‚Äôt any restrictions on the blush color just because you have contoured your cheeks previously, though. It‚Äôs time to smile real big and cheesy-like! When you smile very large, your cheeks will puff up a bit, and these are the apples of your cheeks. You want to take your blush brush and pick up the blush color and apply beginning on the most pushed out part of the apple and then brush upwards toward your temple. As I have done here‚Ä¶ This is what it should look like at this point, and I have deliberately done my best not to blend as I go along so I don‚Äôt skip over steps someone might want to see! It is pretty clear that there is a pinkish color and a darker brown color on my cheek, and nobody wants to look like this. I usually blend my contour color into my blush by picking up more of the blush color with my blush brush and adding some to the gap/harsh line between the two, which is just under where I originally placed the blush. Again, I move from the inner part of my cheek towards my temple. It‚Äôs getting better, isn‚Äôt it? You can see that it isn‚Äôt quite blended at the innermost portion, so I‚Äôm going to fix that. I fix this by repeating the process and making sure to start lower and at the point that needs to be blended better. At this point, it‚Äôs not a bad idea to simply make small, light-handed circles on your cheeks to facilitate in blending. I usually move in small circles beginning at the bottom inside and move my way upwards and outwards. Make sure you do it to the apples of your cheeks, too! All the way up to your temple‚Ä¶ And just a little more. All done. You have to realize that even though it took several photos to show the process, in actuality, it takes but several seconds to do it. Mostly the photos are taken to show you the placement of the brush since this isn‚Äôt video. You will need the following to highlight: powder brush (I use MAC‚Äôs 182 buffer brush) and a highlight color (I‚Äôm using Pink Opal pigment in this tutorial). You can continue to use your blush brush, even an angled brush, but anything that is going to be soft and nice against your skin. A highlight color is usually quite light, and my two basics are Gold Dusk and Pink Opal pigments. I know some have been using Lightscapade mineralize skinfinish lately. When using pigments as a highlight, a little goes a long way. Using my 182 buffer brush, I pick up the Pink Opal pigment and dust it on very lightly right below my eye and on my cheek bone (you can use the cheesy smile pose to help find your cheekbones ‚Äì the cheekbone point is not the prominent part of the apple, but where it dips down to your normal face ‚Äúplain‚Äù at the top; press it, you should feel something hard ‚Äì bone!). Pull the highlighter out towards your temple. Voila. You can always blend the contour color less than I have in order to make it stand out more or give you a darker line of contour. It is important to blend between the contour line and blush line so that the two are seamless, though!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-01-30 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>612121cd53a3b22d2a2b51cbb839f7f393429170</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Win MAC Girlish Romp Mineralize Eyeshadow!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/win-mac-girlish-romp-mineralize-eyeshadow/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Win MAC Girlish Romp Mineralize Eyeshadow!

To view the entire series to date, be sure to visit the beauty basics , or you can view posts within the series about MAC Face Brushes . Focus On: MAC 192 Cheek/Face Brush MAC 192 Cheek/Face Brush ($32.00) is a flat, paddle-shaped brush with a more tapered edge than the typical paddle-shape. It‚Äôs made out of synthetic fibers, and it is designed to be used with creamy/emollient face and cheek products, like blushcremes, moisturizer, Strobe, etc. For application of blushcremes (or cream blushes‚Äìsame thing), I like to use the tip to just gently apply a few dots of color on the cheek. Then I use the entire brush to blend it outwards and get a soft, smooth look. I‚Äôve also found that the size of this brush (smaller than the 190) makes it a good brush for blending concealer in, too. It‚Äôs large enough that it only takes a few brush strokes to blend your concealer into place, but it isn‚Äôt so large that you can‚Äôt get into the nooks and crannies. This is a solid brush, and actually sometimes prefer this one to the 188 for blushcremes. How do you like to use this brush ?

Louise Zizzo created this retro-glam look that puts an emphasis on a large, natural brow (which she totally fauxed on some models by using mascara or Blacktrack fluidline) paired with a plump red lip using Mahogany lip liner nearly all over the lips and then Russian Red lipstick on top. One side of the tent were all the MAC artists dealing with creating all the fabulous runway looks, while on the opposite side were hair stylists creating fabulous dos. Louise managed to catch herself in this shot, but you can see just how crowded backstage can be when everything is done in a small tent on the sidewalk of San Francisco! A veritable feast for any true MAC-aholic, as four or five long tables were covered with a decadent display of every MAC product you could possibly wish for. Here is a model sporting one of the looks for Pink Elf. Victor Cembellin was responsible for the creation of this look, and he accomplished this by doing a strong smokey eye using Graphito paint, Blacktrack fluidline, and Smolder eye kohl. He paired it with a great neutral lip using Illicit lipglass and cheeks with golden bronzer. This next set of photos are taking you through the process of a demonstration of a look by Louise Zizzo so that her team of 4-5 MAC makeup artists could recreate it on their own models for the show. The model shown here is Alexa, who had enviable natural brows. Louise mentioned that it was very, very important for the skin to look absolutely flawless, and as a result, she spent a good amount of time showing the ways to blend and perfect the model‚Äôs complexion so that when she was on the runway, it would come off nearly plastic in its perfection. If only you and I had that kind of time (and skills!) to accomplish such absolutely divine skin. Louise used a mixture of studio select concealer/coverup, as well as various shades of Studio Fix Fluid. Louise did a dramatic eye for this particular designer, and she takes a generous amount of Blacktrack fluidline to cover the entire lid and just above the crease, and then a gentle wing on the side. Using an angled brush, the 266, she accomplishes such detailing as seen here. I was totally reminded of the black smokey eye that I do using Blacktrack as a base, actually! Surprisingly, despite how bold this makeup appears here in this shot, on the runway it is hardly noticeable. Check out that palette Louise is creating on her own hand. You can see the various colors of foundations and skin products that she used to give the model‚Äôs skin such clarity. Louise makes sure that her shape is flawless and that both eyes are about as even as she can get with the naked eye. What, I didn‚Äôt mention it already? Oh, Louise created this look of pure Blacktrack-ladened lid with a splash of thick, double liner in three different shades of liquidlast liner (pink, green, and purple). The whole theme of the look was icy, ice princess, ice queen. She chose green for this particular model. It‚Äôs the magical 266 again, look how precise that line is! Sigh, so jealous. To add further drama, Louise put false lashes on both the top and the bottom lash lines. She also doled out a great tip ‚Äì if you have trouble putting on false lashes, try cutting them into thirds and attaching each third by third. Here‚Äôs the finished eye look! Louise used Pink cream colour base on the cheeks and the lips, with Hush cream colour base to highlight. Pink cream colour base is a PRO only color, and you can see how it matches perfectly with the ice princess theme. Here is the completely finished look! And see how dramatic it is with the eyes closed? I‚Äôm still totally marvelling at the definition of those shapes. A quick snap shot of the look Victor did for the Vian Hunter line using Silver (metal) pigment on lid and Blacktrack fluidline to create the defined crease. Christine (makeup artist), two models, and Louise Z. posing for photographers. Still posing, as you can see, right next to the runway, behind the curtain. Kind of crazy, huh? Christine on her knees moisturizing one of the model‚Äôs legs, but really, check out those HEELS? My feet hurt just looking at them! Back in the dressing room, models chit chat and get ready while Victor does last minute touch ups. I swear, the dressing room was about as big as my own closet back at my parents‚Äô house when I lived there. It was quite tiny! So that concludes my little photo-experiment-journal from Backstage at San Francisco Fashion Week 2007. I had SUCH a blast, and it was an amazing opportunity (so glad I was able to take it, too). I meant several other beauty bloggers, like Karen, and it was awesome to see professional makeup artists working in their element. For photos of the actual fashion show, check out this post .

When she was starting out, she had a babyface but the sophistication of a woman. That manifested in the idea of playing with colour, just as Pecheux did he does bright Parrot blue shadow on the eyelids, then covered the creases with a shimmery dark grey to give what he called true sophistication. There was an obvious lack of cheek colour, and the mouths were dabbed with N3 lipstick a putty-ish pink nude. The effect? A grown up in the eyes and a tender young girl in the mouth. Face ‚Äî MAC Face and Body Foundation was applied all over the face. Blot Loose Powder was then dusted over skin with Brush # 136. Eyes ‚Äî Sea Me, a blue-green M.A.C Shadestick was applied all over the lid and under the bottom lash line. Knight Divine Eye Shadow was then applied densely in the crease and faded out toward the brow for a subtly colorful eye. MAC Pro Lash in black was used for both top and bottom lashes. Lips ‚Äî For a neutral mouth, Hug Me Lipstick was patted gently onto the lips. PHILOSOPHY DI FERRETTI The Philosophy show was a study in dark minimalism at least in the faces. While the clothes were perky stripes and checks, the face by Charlotte Tilbury was bare (except for concealer) but for soft and charcoal grey crescents painted under the eye. So instead of the south of France lushness we‚Äôve been seeing all week, it was a dose of Italian modernity. NANETTE LEOPORE To complete Nanette Lepore‚Äôs inspiration of Picasso‚Äô Mistresses, Polly Osmond channeled, well the look of a Picasso. So of course she did a heavy brow, clumpy spiky lashes achieved with rows of MAC lashes on the top and individuals on the bottom. A peachy cheek was followed by a juicy orange lip of Morange lipstick with lip conditioner added. It was absolutely Andalusian. Think Guernica hanging in the Prado. Face ‚Äî The face was primed with Face and Body Foundation to even out the skin. Select Moisture Cover was applied under the eyes and evenly over skin. Pleasureful and Lady Blushcremes were applied gently the cheeks. Eyes ‚Äî When Daryl Kerrigan says her collection is about body-conscious silhouettes, she‚Äôs not referring to bustier tops and form-fitting frocks. It‚Äôs about how everything feels on your body, she explained. In other words, her clothes are easy with a capital E: T-shirt dresses, drawstring vests, relaxed shorts and trousers, all to typical louche effect. Despite the sporty undercurrent pulsing throughout, Kerrigan managed to work in plenty of that rocker reference, from studs embellishing necklines, hems and sleeves to belt-like straps that crisscrossed low on the hips. When Daryl Kerrigan says her collection is about body-conscious silhouettes, she‚Äôs not referring to bustier tops and form-fitting frocks. It‚Äôs about how everything feel‚Ä¶ Lips ‚Äî MAC Morange Lipstick was mixed with Orange Dare Lipstick and applied with a #228 brush. Gloss Texture was layered on top for a soft, juicy look. CAROLINA HERRERA The Carolina woman is always very chic, but Diane Kendal made her eve a tad chicer, with a sophisticated minimalist face. The brows were filled in naturally, the eyes were glossed and shiny. But it was the mouth that was the standout. To go with Carolina‚Äôs fruity palette, the lips were dabbed with orange lipstick, then double dabbed with red in the centers of their mouths. Then a light wash of fuchsia was applied all over in a filmy layer the effect was a tangerine berry colour that was more like a Sex and the City cocktail colour, or the hue of a faded sunset, than a lipstick shade. Face ‚Äì Moisture Cover Concealer was applied to face with #242 Brush and set with Loose Blot Powder to create a velvety texture. MAC Iridescent Powder in Silver Dusk was sprinkled onto the bridge of the nose and cheek bones for a highlight. Eyes ‚Äì MAC Retrospeck Eye Shadow was applied to the entire lid. Boot Liquid Eye Liner was lightly wedged in between lashes for a thick lash line and Plush Lash Mascara in Black was used to coat top lashes. MAC Retrospeck Eye Shadow was applied to the entire lid. Lips ‚Äì Orange Lip Mix was feathered onto lip with a Concealer Brush. MAC Pro Lipstick in Full Fuchsia and Mattene Lipstick in Classic Dame were then mixed and layered onto the center of the lip for an intense, burst of color. For a touch of shine, Clear Lip Glass was patted onto the lips.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-09-11 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>f39d6a483a747271a15264459ac6c2a6cfdcecb6</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì MAC Cosmetics Pairs with BoomBox for London Fashion Week</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-mac-cosmetics-pairs-with-boombox-for-london-fashion-week/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì MAC Cosmetics Pairs with BoomBox for London Fashion Week Latest Collections Sep 10, 2007 September 10, 2007 MAC Cosmetics has teamed up with BoomBox for London Fashion Week and has sponsored 20 cabs painted in black (of course!) with both BoomBox‚Äôs and MAC‚Äôs logos in white.

A black and white photographic portfolio by Johnnie Shand Kydd offers vital portraiture, while Katherine Hamnett1s blurry vision soft-focuses on some questionable regions, and contribution from foxy queen of downtown erotica Ellen Cantor; Wolfgang Tillmans imagery is so real you‚Äôll wonder why you‚Äôre not sweating like his subjects.‚ÄúI spoke to Wolfgang and, as a regular at the club, felt that he would be perfect to document the club. I was excited by his approach to the project and his unique interpretation of the night. He came down to the club on several occasions to shoot, and we are both extremely happy with the resulting images.‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Mortimer Founder BoomBoxFashion is part of the DNA of M.A.C, inspiring their artists and products worldwide.

Guerlain Rue de Francs Bourgeois Eyeshadow Palette ($84.00 for 0.25 oz.) contains six different eyeshadows with a dual-ended natural-bristled brush housed in an incredibly luxe compact. Guerlain is normally on the more generous side with their products, but this palette‚Äìby weight‚Äìis more per ounce ($336) than their single eyeshadows ($292) or eyeshadow quads ($295). Like Rouge G Lipsticks , you‚Äôre definitely paying (more so than usual) for the packaging. It has a beautiful filigree design on the front of the compact along with Guerlain‚Äôs signature bee, and then inside is a flip-top mirror that opens to reveal the actual eyeshadows inside. There‚Äôs certainly a nice heft to it, and it feels very solid; it‚Äôs not cheap or flimsy in the least bit. Each palette utilizes a mix of three different finishes: iridescent, matte, and satin. In this particular palette, we have a light-medium beige with a matte finish (which nearly matches my skin tone‚ÄìNC20 for the underarm‚Äìfor reference) that would make for a nice highlighter on light to medium skin tones; medium-dark grayed brown with a satin finish; brightly shimmered copper with gold sheen in an iridescent finish; dark chocolate brown with a satin-matte finish; medium brown with subtle peach undertones in a satin finish; and a blackened brown with copper flecks in a satin finish. The darkest shade can also be used wet as a liner. None of the shadows are named, FYI! I‚Äôm underwhelmed by the overall color palette but more so by the consistency, texture, and intensity of the eyeshadows. They‚Äôre just not as soft, smooth, or rich as Guerlain‚Äôs other eyeshadows (singles and quads). The formula is entirely different‚Äìthey don‚Äôt have the creaminess that their other eyeshadows have. The pigmentation is just so-so; they‚Äôre not particularly sheer or chalky, but you may find yourself going back for seconds in a look. I will say that they perform better in practice than they do simply as swatches on the skin. Each shadow had a very soft, finely milled texture, but I missed the richness of Guerlain‚Äôs usual eyeshadow formula. These are not bad eyeshadows‚Äìbut they‚Äôre not out of this world, either; they‚Äôre nice but not phenomenal. Aside from some concerns about the formula itself, the colors seem very basic. There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with that (and I‚Äôm not taking any points away based on the colors themselves!), but I always have admired Guerlain for their ability to bring out nuances in their shades‚Äìparticularly noteworthy in the Rouge G lipstick line. I‚Äôm reminded of Urban Decay‚Äôs Naked Palette ( Naked, Buck, Half Baked, Darkhorse, Sidecar in particular). They do work beautifully as a palette, though; I was easily able to use several shades in a look with very little effort, and they applied better than they swatched. I am big fan of Guerlain, and having said so, have been rather hesitant about doling out the $84 it costs for each of the five eyeshadow palettes they launched with their fall collection . Ironically, the fact that this palette didn‚Äôt blow me away was what spurned me to finally purchase one! I ordered Rue 2 Vendome and will review that soon. I‚Äôm curious if that one will impress me more!

She provides regular skincare advice and tips on her blog , too! Cleanser Dos and Don‚Äôts by Skin Care Expert, Ren√©e Rouleau Cleansers all have generally the same basic function, which is to clean dirt, debris, oil, bacteria and makeup from the skin. But, there are definitely some things you need to know when it comes to choosing the right cleanser and using it correctly. Do choose a cleanser made exclusively for your skin type It‚Äôs difficult for me to understand how skin care companies are able to say that their cleansers are ‚Äúsuitable for all skin types.‚Äù All skin is different and therefore, each individual has very unique needs when it comes to skin care products. Because a cleanser is a staple in a day and evening skin care routine, it‚Äôs essential that you‚Äôre using one for your skin type. When talking to your skin care professional or whomever you purchase your products from, don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúIs this product good for me?‚Äù because chances are a salesperson will more than likely tell you yes. Instead, say ‚ÄúWhat type of skin does this product work best for?‚Äù With a specific question like that, you‚Äôre sure to get a specific answer that will help you decide if the product is right for your skin needs. When a cleanser is not a good fit, your skin will let you know. For healthy skin, never work against Mother Nature, always work with her. Check out more tips! Share your dos &amp; don‚Äôts in the comments! Do avoid cleansers containing synthetic fragrance if your skin is sensitive Individuals with sensitive skin can react negatively to synthetic perfumes. Before purchasing your cleanser take a look at the ingredients and avoid products that read ‚Äúparfum‚Äù or ‚Äúfragrance.‚Äù Information regarding artificial fragrance ingredients will usually be down towards the end of the list of ingredients. All Ren√©e Rouleau cleansers do not contain artificial fragrance. Do switch cleansers every season, if necessary Your skin‚Äôs ability to retain moisture or reduce oil production is directly correlated to the climate in which you live. If you are more accustomed to a humid environment or have oily skin, you will want to use a foaming or gel cleanser, and in dry environments, a lotion-based cleanser may be best for those with dry skin. Be sure to reassess not only your cleanser, but your other products as well, every change of season for best results. Do wipe over skin with facial sponges after cleansing Particularly when washing your skin at night with a cleansing lotion, it is important to do a physical wiping with facial sponges or a baby wash cloth to ensure makeup, dirt, and oil come off the skin and so you won‚Äôt find it on your cotton pad when applying your alcohol-free toner. Do limit the use of the Clarisonic brush with your cleanser The Clarisonic brush is a popular device to use along with a cleanser when washing your face. The company suggests for you to use it with every cleansing, but I feel this is way too much for the skin. Instead, I only suggest using it no more than three times a week. (You can check out a past review on the Clarisonic !) Do apply moisturizer within 60 seconds after cleansing After cleansing, you must immediately use an alcohol-free toner and moisturizer. If you leave your skin bare for more than 1 minute, it will start to dehydrate as the dry air attracts moisture out of the skin. Perform your skin care routine quickly, and be sure to always leave your toner damp on the skin. This will leave your skin protected and avoid the tight and dry feeling. Don‚Äôt use a cleanser that leaves your skin feeling tight or dry Many foaming and gel cleansers made today are formulated with an ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate or Ammonium Laureth Sulfate. This ingredient is a surfactant; a cleansing agent that cuts oil from the skin. These ingredients are simply too harsh and will strip the water out of the skin after every washing leaving the skin feeling tight and creating more oil and shine. And what you wash with is the most important part of your skin care routine. Why? Because if you wash with a foaming cleanser or soap that is too drying, it pulls all the water out of the skin and creates dead, dry skin cell buildup. Then you have to quickly run and put your moisturizer on to put back in what you just took out! It makes no sense! Choose either cleansing lotions or cleansing gels that avoid the harsh ingredient, Sodium or Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate. These will be better choices, as they will effectively deep clean the pores but will not rob the skin of much-needed water. Remember the rule: More lather, more drying. Less lather, less drying. Don‚Äôt wash with bar soap Washing with a bar of soap ‚Äì no matter how expensive it is or how moisturizing it claims to be ‚Äì is just an absolute no-no. The binders that hold a bar of soap together naturally have a high pH balance, so they are always going to be too strong for the skin. When you wash with something that‚Äôs too harsh, you strip the water out of the skin leaving it dehydrated with dry skin cell build up. Then, you have to run and put on moisturizer to put back in what you just took out. Skin cells are like fish, they need water to live and without water they die. Bar soaps are more suitable for the body, not the face. (Note: I‚Äôve had people through the years try to convince me that the bar soap they use is gentle and not drying to the skin. While I never suggest bar soap of any kind, if you have one that you love, then by all means use it.) Don‚Äôt skimp on choosing a quality cleanser When it comes to choosing skin care products, people will splurge and invest money into a moisturizer. But when it comes to using a cleanser, they don‚Äôt give as much thought and just use something inexpensive from the drug store. Since cleansing is the first part of your routine, if you use something that is not of good quality, leaving your skin tight, dry, or irritated, then your expensive serums and creams now have to do repair work to recover the skin from the potential dehydration caused by your cleansing products. Choosing a good quality cleanser can make or break your routine, so choose wisely.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-06-30 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>12216c647bd9c8e54b36541d94256658a338ca67</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Will my skin care products go bad if left in the heat?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/will-my-skin-care-products-go-bad-if-left-in-the-heat/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Will my skin care products go bad if left in the heat? Features Sep 20, 2011 September 20, 2011 This post was written by Ren√©e Rouleau , who is a skin-care expert and celebrity esthetician who has been helping men, women and teens attain healthy, glowing, beautiful skin for more than twenty years. Her philosophy is simple: With the proper tools, effective products and a disciplined approach, anyone can have great skin. Her skincare line embodies this same approach and follows her dos and don‚Äôts. In relation to this post, I fully recommend her AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel! She provides regular skincare advice and tips on her blog , too! Will my skin care products go bad if left in the heat? During the summer months, when temperatures are anywhere from 85 to 100 degrees depending on where you live, you might accidentally leave your skin care products in a hot car and wonder if the heat will affect the safety and performance of the product or worse, ruin them. Or, if you order your skin care products online, you will open up your mailbox or see them sitting outside on your doorstep and discover that because of the hot temperatures where you live, your products will be warm to the touch. Because of the heat, you may notice that a gel cleanser, a cleansing lotion, or a moisturizer will have a thinner consistency than normal. These scenarios may leave you wondering if the heat has affected your skin care products. The answer is no. Heat should not affect the performance of your skin care products. The reason for this has to do with when products are made. When a new product is made in the laboratory, chemists will put it through the ‚Äúoven test.‚Äù This is where a product is put into an oven with temperatures around 115 degrees Fahrenheit with 70 percent relative humidity, and is kept in there anywhere from six weeks to three months. The purpose of the oven test is to determine if a product can stay stable and maintain its integrity, since products can be left in hot cars or in other less-than desirable conditions. Heat can also mimic the long term shelf life of a product to determine if the product will remain constant for a two-year shelf life, and if the ingredients will separate or change consistency. All of the Ren√©e Rouleau products go through this oven test, exposing them to heat over long periods of time to ensure their safety, performance and longevity, so certainly a hot car for a day or two or a hot mailbox for a few hours should not affect the product at all. Note : The oven test does not factor in UV light, so if your product sits out for long periods of time in UV light or sunlight, this most likely will weaken the performance of ingredients such as antioxidants (which tend to break down in sunlight).

You would be surprised at how much of a difference adding a touch of black eyelilner on the lower rim of your eye can be. There are many different types of liner‚Äìfrom gel to kohl to liquid to pencil‚Äìand nearly infinite shades and colors. Even textures vary from brand to brand and certain types of liner have a specific texture. Gel liners are similar to both kohl and pencil liners, but they might seem a bit ‚Äúwetter‚Äù and more movable (kind of like fluidliners, which come in a pot-form). Liquid liner is just what it says; liquid color that is applied using either a separate brush or with an included applicator. The biggest differences between liquid and other forms of liner are that liquid liners can allow for stronger color, often have longer staying power, and more precision. When applied correctly (with a great deal of accuracy!), liquid liner allows for a distinct and precise line of color. Gel liners like fluidliners also allow for similar precision when used with thin angle brushes (like MAC‚Äôs 266). Fluidlines in particular also provide the same staying power and usually similar in color boldness as liquid liners. Kohl and pencil liners have a higher chance of the liner migrating to the corners of the eyes throughout the day, but they are easily handled by even makeup beginners because they give the user more precision and forgive more easily than a liquid liner‚Äôs applicator. However, kohl pencils are frequently used along the lower lash line, and especially for smokey eyes. It is easy to smudge black kohl liners with brushes, q-tips, or sponge-tip applicators (pick your poison!). Liquid liner is really great for lining the upper lash line because of the sensitivity of the eyelids, the softness and lightness in pressure of the liquid liner work very well. Sometimes pencil liners take several strokes to get the color strength desired, and lining the upper lash line is hard enough without taking this into account. Black is often known as a staple eyeliner color, and it is a good idea to have one in your make-up bag, but there are many other shades to choose from and shouldn‚Äôt be ignored. Of course there are liners in every color imaginable, but other good staples for a collection would be brown, dark gray, and gray. Even if you cannot find a particular eyeliner in the color you want, eyeshadows can be used dry or wet to line eyes, as well. Some people find that putting a touch of dry shadow on their lower lash line helps accent the colors they used on their lid. In terms of application of liner, users with small eyes may find lining both the upper and lower lash line to be counterproductive and actually make their eyes appear even smaller. Someone with naturally big, open eyes may find the opposite is true: lining both can further open and enhance their eyes. To apply liner on the upper lash line, one method to do this is by using one of your fingers to lightly pull your eyelid slightly upwards and to the side. To apply liner to the lower lash line, look up if you can and apply liner against lower lash line. To get deeper color, it may be necessary to go over the same area with the kohl pencil several times. The lower lash line is definitely easier to apply liner to than the upper lash line‚Äìat least for most people! When lining the upper lid or using liquid liner, be cautioned that liquid liner is much less forgiving for errors in application than pencil. Keep this in mind, because practice, practice, practice is essential to master the artistry of liquid liner (and liner, in general, too!). Just don‚Äôt get caught up in frustration when it doesn‚Äôt work. One way to practice without ruining your makeup for the day is to make liner attempts shortly before you are ready to remove your makeup for the day/night. This way you can see how it works for you without worrying about a jagged line or smudges over your eyeshadow. Another trick is to start off make-up application by lining the lid (upper, lower, or both) and using make-up remover (usually with a q-tip) to clean up any mistakes and keep the line defined and precise. It is truly practice that is going to give you the results you want, so stick with it and let it come as you experiment and try it out. Product Suggestions : I suggest the following specific products as my preferences in lining: MAC technakohl in Graphblack for a strong black; L‚ÄôOreal Automatic liner in Ebony for a good drugstore black; MAC‚Äôs fluidline in Blacktrack for a good gel liner black; MAC‚Äôs Boot Black liquid liner; MAC liquidlasts make for great colored liquid liners, as well.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-02-09 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>516af50f44924348e67a93f9561bedd32ba81806</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Superbowl ‚Äì Colts</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/superbowl-colts/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Superbowl ‚Äì Colts Jan 28, 2007 January 28, 2007 Super, super quick look to celebrate the Indianapolis Colts making it to the Superbowl!

You will need the following‚Ä¶ Eyes : NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base (neutral eyeshadow base), MAC Clear Sky Blue Pigment (matte sky blue), Urban Decay Aquarius Eyeshadow (aqua), Urban Decay Dashiki Eyeshadow (medium blue), MAC Atlantic Blue Eyeshadow (matte violet-hued blue), MAC Brule Eyeshadow (highlighter), Urban Decay Deviant 24/7 Liner (medium dark blue), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder (translucent) Cheeks : Benefit Sugarbomb Blush (peachy pink) Lips : Chanel Chintz Rouge Coco Lipstick (peach-nude), Chanel Petite Peche Glossimer (peach) Brushes : 242 (fluffy flat brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : For eyes, start by applying Smudgeproof as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. With the 242, apply Clear Sky Blue pigment onto the lid with water-based mixing medium. Using the 239, apply Aquarius eyeshadow on the inner third of the lid and pull upwards along the inner crease. Lightly blend Dashiki eyeshadow on the middle of the lid with the 239. Next, apply Atlantic Blue eyeshadow into the crease with the 226, lightly blending onto the outer lid. Define the crease with Atlantic Blue eyeshadow and the 226. Blend Brule eyeshadow with the crease shade and highlight the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Deviant liner on the lower lash line., and then smudging Atlantic Blue eyeshadow on the lower lash line. Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Sugarbomb blush on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Chintz lipstick first, and then layer Petite Peche glossimer for a complementing lip.

I asked on Twitter if it was of interest, and by the post title, I think you know what the response was! üôÇ The video is LONG. In previous years, I‚Äôve split up the videos into MAC and non-MAC, but it‚Äôs all in one big video this time around. I also talk in more detail about blogging, the size of my stash, and what I do with products I don‚Äôt want or why I keep certain products. Since the video is pretty lengthy, I want to recap some of that in this post, too! üôÇ The Why &amp; How: Video Summary I‚Äôve been collecting makeup for 6 years. My collection wasn‚Äôt built overnight! I am a *collector*! I may use what I buy and receive, but I am a collector at heart. Makeup is not purely utility for me, and this is why I consider it a hobby that I am passionate about. I have been blogging for nearly 4 years. Brands and PR do send me product to consider reviewing. I don‚Äôt get paid to review products, no one gets to edit or preview my posts, and I‚Äôve never lost a relationship because of a negative review, even the Ds and Fs. I donate products to to local organizations like battered women‚Äôs shelters. I‚Äôm currently trying to work with a local veterans organization to find a way to send products to service men and women overseas. The bathroom all my makeup is stored in is only used for makeup! I wish it didn‚Äôt have a shower and instead a giant closet‚Ä¶ I consider this also an archive of the makeup past ‚Äî it allows me to go back to previous launches for comparison. My Storage System 3 x Advantus Rolling Cart, 10 Drawer (in Smoke) ($50) ‚Äî also available in multi-color and white Clear Storage Boxes ($1.79 to $19.99) come in a variety sizes, but I typically use the Accessory Boxes and Shoe Boxes sizes for storing makeup. I also use the Sweater Boxes for storing body creams/washes and skincare. Linus Shallow Drawer Organizers ($2.99 to $6.99) have several sizes, but I typically use the 3‚Ä≥x6‚Ä≥, 3‚Ä≥x9‚Ä≥, 3‚Ä≥x12‚Ä≥, 6‚Ä≥x9‚Ä≥, and 6‚Ä≥x12‚Ä≥. Linus Deep Drawer Organizers ($3.49 to $6.49) are deeper by about 1 1/8‚Ä≥ compared to the Shallow Drawer Organizers. I use the 4‚Ä≥x12‚Ä≥ usually. Translucent Stack Drawers ($9.99 to $14.49) Fun Facts The Boy was the videographer for most of the video! I still have the first brush I ever owned ‚Äî Benefit‚Äôs Eyeshadow Blending Brush, which has long been discontinued. I don‚Äôt know how many of each item I have, and it would probably make me cringe even a little if I did. So don‚Äôt count! I keep a lot of products for comparison purposes‚Äìe.g. how does X shadow compare to Y shadow from 4 years ago? My memory is faulty, and though the improvement in my photographing skills over the years help me to photo-document everything, I like having it in real life to compare, too. In looks, I try to keep older limited edition/discontinued products out of them. I try to use new products (to show how they look applied) or permanent products. I have the Scarlet/Spring/Summer seasons to thank for finally getting some permanent lipsticks in my stash! My dream is to have California Closets come over and design me the ultimate makeup storage system . See more photos!

The new pressed eyeshadow formula has a SeaNutritive Mineral Complex that gives the shadow a ‚Äúcreamy, silky smooth‚Äù texture with ‚Äúseamless blendability‚Äù and ‚Äústay-true color.‚Äù It‚Äôs supposed to be long-wearing whether worn alone or with primer‚Äìyou shouldn‚Äôt see any creasing or fading. I‚Äôve tested various combinations of shades from the duos and quads, and I‚Äôve happily achieved ten hours of solid wear without a primer underneath. For a review of the packaging, please read my original review . Standing O is a light-medium gold with this faint hint of green. It‚Äôs not really green at all, but there‚Äôs just that inkling that keeps it from being more like an orangey gold. It has a frosted, metallic finish, and the texture and payoff are nice. It‚Äôs a touch darker than MAC Treasure Hunt . It‚Äôs not as yellow as NARS Goldfinger . It‚Äôs almost like the golden color of MAC Gorgeous Gold but lacks the greenish duochrome aspect. Climax is a purple-tinted navy blue with a satiny sheen. The texture is soft and smooth, while the pigmentation is right on. It‚Äôs similar to MAC Blue Storm , Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild Earth Looks Small From Down Here , and Urban Decay Goddess . bareMinerals Grand Finale Eyeshadow Duo Review, Photos, Swatches - Recommended We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

To finish the look, MAC Zoom Black Mascara was applied on the upper lashes. Lips ‚Äî Applied with a brush and then blotted with a tissue, MAC Plum Perfect Lip Conditioner gave lips a hint of tint.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-09-09 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>d4db5d44f9eecc60b92a528c2c3583e22b6608b5</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Gold 013</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-gold-013/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Gold 013 Looks Feb 10, 2007 February 10, 2007 I used Gold Dusk pigment on lid, Casablanca eyeshadow on inner lid, Jasmine eyeshadow on middle of lid, Silver Ring eyeshadow on outer lid and crease, Rye eyeshadow on outer lid and crease, Jasmine eyeshadow above crease, Casablanca eyeshadow on brow and inner lower lash line, Silver Ring eyeshadow on outer lower lash line, and Graphblack technakohl on lower lash line.

The new pressed eyeshadow formula has a SeaNutritive Mineral Complex that gives the shadow a ‚Äúcreamy, silky smooth‚Äù texture with ‚Äúseamless blendability‚Äù and ‚Äústay-true color.‚Äù It‚Äôs supposed to be long-wearing whether worn alone or with primer‚Äìyou shouldn‚Äôt see any creasing or fading. I‚Äôve tested various combinations of shades from the duos and quads, and I‚Äôve happily achieved ten hours of solid wear without a primer underneath. For a review of the packaging, please read my original review . Standing O is a light-medium gold with this faint hint of green. It‚Äôs not really green at all, but there‚Äôs just that inkling that keeps it from being more like an orangey gold. It has a frosted, metallic finish, and the texture and payoff are nice. It‚Äôs a touch darker than MAC Treasure Hunt . It‚Äôs not as yellow as NARS Goldfinger . It‚Äôs almost like the golden color of MAC Gorgeous Gold but lacks the greenish duochrome aspect. Climax is a purple-tinted navy blue with a satiny sheen. The texture is soft and smooth, while the pigmentation is right on. It‚Äôs similar to MAC Blue Storm , Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild Earth Looks Small From Down Here , and Urban Decay Goddess . bareMinerals Grand Finale Eyeshadow Duo - Recommended Read Full Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-09-19 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>97fd74ae0206043a0d3cc0bd8103f14442a7e9ca</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Holiday 2007 Collection Sign Up</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-holiday-2007-collection-sign-up/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Holiday 2007 Collection Sign Up Latest Collections Sep 11, 2007 September 11, 2007 Sign up at MAC Cosmetics to get the latest news and information regarding the Holiday 2007 collections by heading here .

How does a girl evolve from bell-bottoms o getting involved with the ultimate topper, makeup? A : Well, to me it‚Äôs all about colour, whether it‚Äôs a crazy pair of striped bell-bottoms or the perfect purple nail olish. It‚Äôs about a girl having a great time when she dresses up; and who dresses up without makeup? Q: As a line, a+o is known for its playful, fun use of colour and textures. How does this translate in terms f your new collection with M¬∑A¬∑C? A : We wanted the makeup to be fun and playful; for me clothing and cosmetics should be whimsical, they should both make you smile and feel flirtatious. With that in mind, I wanted our packaging and our colours o be like candy. Everyone loves candy. Q: You‚Äôre known to rock some pretty megacosmetics yourself. Can you describe your ultimate beauty look? A : I am known for wearing really dark, defined eye makeup, bright fun nail polish and pale glossy lip gloss; t was kind of amazing getting to translate my signature look into a M¬∑A¬∑C collection! Q: Who is your beauty icon? A : My daughter Eloise. I mean, she wakes up and looks perfect. She even looks perfect with peanut butter nd jelly smeared across her face and strawberry smoothie in her hair. I am so jealous. Q: What‚Äôs always in your makeup bag? A: I always have a little bit of body glitter, a black M¬∑A¬∑C Liquidlast Liner and some sort of cream blush. nd my secret for a dewy look is a touch of organic body oil on the cheeks. Q: How is designing a colour cosmetics collection different (or similar) compared to designing clothes? A: Designing clothes is more stream of consciousness. When we‚Äôre working on a season, it‚Äôs months and months of designing pieces and then creating a story out of them. With cosmetics, it was more like saying to M¬∑A¬∑C Product Development, ‚ÄúHere is our story, now what products and colours work into that?‚Äù They really brought it to life. But I think both clothing and makeup are very much about colour and exture and what each piece and product represents for the woman. Q: Any products in the line that you‚Äôre hopelessly obsessed with? A: All of them, obviously! (Especially the nail polishes!)</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2010-06-29 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>9cae211bf9d94692cecfb6cc347f4cb093c316a6</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Giorgio Armani #3 Smooth Silk Eyeliner Review, Photos, Swatches</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/giorgio-armani-3-smooth-silk-eyeliner-review-photos-swatches/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Giorgio Armani #3 Smooth Silk Eyeliner Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Sep 20, 2011 September 20, 2011 Giorgio Armani #3 Smooth Silk Eyeliner Giorgio Armani #3 Smooth Silk Eyeliner Giorgio Armani #3 Smooth Silk Eyeliner ($27.00 for 0.04 oz.) is described simply as ‚Äúnavy.‚Äù The Smooth Silk formula is supposed to be soft with rich color. The pencil also includes a tapered sponge for smudging on the opposite end of the pencil tip. The smudger is flexible and soft without being rough. It‚Äôs a gorgeous blackened navy blue with a hint of indigo in it. It could be more pigmented, because it takes a couple of passes to get solid, intense color; a single pass yields color but nothing opaque. I couldn‚Äôt think of a dupe for this, even after looking at all these navy blue eyeliners ‚Äìit is much darker with less blue in it than many potential dupes. The wear is good, though, despite shortcomings in payoff (at least it‚Äôs buildable), lasting nine hours on the lower lash line before it begins to look a little faded. It‚Äôs soft, creamy, and glides on well. I find the texture rather comparable to Urban Decay‚Äôs 24/7 Eyeliners; creamy enough to move along the lash line with ease and without tugging or pulling on the lid but not so creamy it migrates everywhere. 0 2 #3 0 2 #3 B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Harrods Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) Giorgio Armani Beauty (Canada) Beauty Brands Giorgio Armani Beauty 8.5 Product 6.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 84% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

This is a guide, of sorts, to help direct price-conscious consumers to cost effective products that actually work. Many more drugstore cosmetic lines are coming out with products that are made to rival higher-end items. There are several brands that offer great, more inexpensive alternatives for your cosmetic hauls. One of my favorites is called NYX, and I would consider it one of the best cosmetic lines I have tried‚Äìand the price is right. Their eyeshadows are extremely pigmented, and several colors are perfect dupes compared to MAC‚Äôs! Shadow textures are lovely, and apply evenly and smoothly with little fuss. NYX offers single shadows as well as shadows in sets of three, blush, and various lipglosses and eye/lip liners. Prices generally range from $3-7 for most items they offer. I would say that the only serious drawback from buying NYX is that it is not often readily available at your nearest drugstore. However, several sites offer it online, so that is always a good option for those who cannot find it in our local store. Most drugstores seem to carry two very low-budget lines: NYC and Wet ‚Äòn Wild. When I am looking to try out a new product, I often see if I can purchase something from either of these companies because sometimes you can score items for a dollar! Both offer full lines of cosmetics, including foundation, eyeshadows, bronzers, and travel-sized brushes. They also make decent false eyelashes, which are perfect for anyone who wants a pair to try‚Äìor those of us who often wear them once and throw them out. Far cheaper to buy these for one-time wear than MAC ones! While both of these lines are incredibly affordable, I do have to say that the quality is not near high-end brands. You get a little more than what you pay for, but neither of these are my favorite in drugstore brand cosmetics. Although, NYC does make lovely lipgloss! Many high-end users supplement their collection with finds from Milani, which offers several identical dupes to MAC existing shadows. These shadows are well-pigmented and apply smoothly, and again, these are perfect for anyone with a small budget. Milani has a full line, so there are many products for customers to select from. Sometimes Milani is so sought after that your local drugstore may have sold out of many options! Similarly, Rimmel offers some quality products, though I would say their shadows do not work quite as well as Milani or NYX. On the more expensive side of drugstore cosmetics lines is L‚ÄôOreal‚Äôs HIP product line. This line was meant to give you high-end cosmetic quality with drugstore prices. They did not quite deliver, but they did give you a result worth checking out. The prices for HIP range from $7-15, with many of their eyeshadows running around $10. When I think about saving money, it seems odd to pay $10 for an eyeshadow from L‚ÄôOreal when I can a higher-end product from MAC for the same price (for pans) or pay a few dollars more (for pots). They do offer gorgeous color choices, and even have loose color like MAC‚Äôs pigments. Some shadow colors are harder to work with than others, but many can be used with great success. The selling point of this line is that the colors are supposed to be highly pigmented, and this is usually true. Although, their foundation has much left to be desired; too much yellow/orange in the color selection. There are numerous brands of cosmetic lines constantly being inventoried in your local drugstore, and it is overwhelming. Many products offered through these lines are worth buying; companies like CoverGirl and Maybelline would not have stayed in business if their products were worthless! Instead of continuing by listing brand names and thoughts on them, here are some tried and true products available at your local drugstore: CoverGirl LastExact Mascara ‚Äî One of the more recent mascaras to be launched, and it is definitely a great one! I hear so many rave reviews about LastExact, and I am no exception. I will admit that sometimes it does not quite work as well as I want to, but usually it works just fine. I find have no need to pursue a better high-end mascara, and I get along fine switching between my drugstore versions. Maybelline Full ‚Äòn Soft ‚Äî I adore this mascara. I have used it for several years, and even though I have tried other mascaras, this is still my favorite one for lengthening, thickening, and building up my lashes to make them full ‚Äòn soft! L‚ÄôOreal Automatic Pencil Eyeliner ‚Äî This used to be my black eyeliner of choice. It was a great automatic-sharpening kohl that gave my lower lash line the perfect smoldering look. Although I have replaced this with a high-end product, I still recommend this as an amazing alternative. When I used it, so many people commented, asking what liner I was using, and they were shocked it was just L‚ÄôOreal. L‚ÄôOreal Colour Juice ‚Äî Gorgeous lipglosses that are fairly sheer and in different fruit flavors. They give lips that lovely glossy look, making them seem plump and‚Ä¶ juicy. OPI &amp; Sally Hansen nailpolishes ‚Äî I have always been a huge fan of both lines of nail polishes. They come in a variety of colors and finishes, and I love that Sally Hansen adds strengthening to many of their products. I find that either of these brands are often better than many high-end nail polishes. Ardell lashes ‚Äî Ardell makes a huge assortment of false eyelashes for a variety of needs. You can find bold lashes or singles to add fullness to your own natural lashes. These are quite affordable and can be reused. L‚ÄôOreal True Match ‚Äî This foundation gives decent coverage and comes in a variety of colors. I have already found my holy grail in foundation in a high-end brand, so I cannot say I am too willing to experiment ‚Äî trust me, lovelies, once you find your dream foundation, you will find a way to earn the money to buy it! Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse ‚Äî So many good reviews about this product makes it a definite foundation option to check out next time you are browsing the cosmetics aisle. The best way to purchase and try drugstore cosmetics is to find a retailer that does allow you to return opened and tested makeup. I know Rite Aid has this policy, and it is a great way to give a drugstore brand a chance without losing your money. This is one of the reasons many people prefer high-end brands, because they have the luxury of testing and trying a product before they buy it. Many beauty websites offer reviews by real customers, like makeupalley.com , which also lets you swap makeup you no longer need/want. And if you cannot seem to find the brand or color you want, there is always drugstore.com , which offers thousands of products, and most of the time, shipping is free when you spend more than $25! Just because you cannot afford or do not want to spend a lot of money on your makeup does not mean you will not be able to find quality products that fit within your budget, whatever it may be.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-01-26 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>38f50e6ceaa5926a878c37d02ff144f6ee32c042</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Estee Lauder Surreal Violet Nail Lacquer</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tag/estee-lauder-surreal-violet-nail-lacquer/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Estee Lauder Surreal Violet Nail Lacquer Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Aug 09, 2010 August 09, 2010 Estee Lauder Surreal Violet Nail Lacquer Estee Lauder Blue Dahlia: Surreal Violet Estee Lauder Surreal Violet Nail Lacquer ($18.00 for 0.3 fl. oz.) is a gray-toned pink-mauve with copper-bronze shimmer. It‚Äôs a little on the sheerer side with two coats, but it was nearly opaque, so I left the swatches with two‚Äìbut you could probably do a third for a totally opaque result. The formula itself wasn‚Äôt too thick or thin and applied smoothly without any issues. Drying time seemed average, and there was a soft glossy shine, but I‚Äôd still recommend a top coat. The amount in the bottle is a little below average, I‚Äôd say, while the price tag is a bit hefty. Those with larger collections may want to add this more unique shade to their stashes, but if you‚Äôre just building up your collection, this may be too much on the expensive side. You can grab Illamasqua ($14/0.5 fl. oz.), NARS ($16 for 0.5 fl. oz), and Lippmann ($18/0.5 fl. oz.), which are all stellar polish brands, and get more for your money.

They are: Heroine (bright violet plum), Pink Popcorn (lavender), Reel Sexy (light bright coral), and Watch Me Simmer (bright pink-orange). Heroine is a magenta purple with a near matte finish‚Äìthere is just a hint of sheen in the finish. It applies opaque and smoothly, despite being a matte finish. It looks a lot like MAC Violetta , which is a smidgen darker and has shimmer. Milani Magenta Madness is quite pinker. Pink Popcorn is a soft petal pink with a very subtle blue undertone. It has a lustre finish, though the color payoff is semi-opaque, actually. MAC Naughty Saute is paler, more opaque, and bluer-based. Revlon Carnation is a bit darker, less blue-based. Reel Sexy is a peach-orange with a little hint of coral, but it looks more peach/orange than anything else. It has an amplified finish, but it‚Äôs a bit streaky when applied and tends to settle into lips to some degree. The color coverage is opaque. MAC Gotta Dash is similar but sheerer. Bobbi Brown Soft Coral is more orange and darker. Illamasqua Brink is very similar. YSL Peach Passion is similar. Watch Me Simmer can be seen here , as it was just released in February of this year! MAC lipsticks are vanilla-scented but have no discernible taste. They typically last between three and four hours on the lips, but it largely depends on the finish. Lustre finishes wear off a little faster, between two and three hours, depending on the richness of the shade. Amplified and matte finishes tend to wear better, sometimes lasting as long as six hours. I tested out Heroine , and it lasted for over six hours and stained my lips for hours after that. Pink Popcorn only wore for three hours, and it did leave my lips feeling chapped, as lustres often do. Because Watch Me Simmer was in such high-demand when it first launched this past February, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was one of the first lipsticks to sell out. Heroine may also catch peoples eye, because it is purplish. 10 12 Pink Popcorn 10 12 Pink Popcorn B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 89% Total Read Full Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2012-03-30 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>7d8bb46621f828a34bca59876acb021609a1b206</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Products ‚Äì Pigments ‚Äì Part 2</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-cosmetics-products-pigments-part-2/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Cosmetics ‚Äì Products ‚Äì Pigments ‚Äì Part 2 Sep 11, 2007 September 11, 2007 View product photos of pigments in this post.

Sugar Snack is a light-medium pink with yellow undertones and a matte finish. It‚Äôs a really soft, almost buttery, matte so the color payoff is good without being powdery. It reminded me of MAC Pen ‚Äòn‚Äô Pink , which is a touch lighter. Inglot #356 is lighter. MAC Paradise Island is similar, perhaps darker, with inferior color payoff. Hypnotizing is a dark mauve-brown with high shimmer. It has a frost finish. It‚Äôs soft, smooth, and has good pigmentation. It‚Äôs similar to a fair amount of shades, including Tarina Tarantino Fantastical , MAC Winterized , Bare Escentuals Romp , and MAC Tendersmoke . Power Boosted is a fuchsia violet with a pearly sheen. It has a veluxe pearl finish. It has decent color payoff, though it is a little sheerer and drier compared to other shades in the palette. NYX Violetta is similar but less iridescent. Bare Escentuals Boudoir is pinker. Urban Decay Purple Haze is similar in color, but it has a matte finish. Shop &amp; Drop is a deep smoky blue with hints of purple with a pearled sheen. It has a satin finish. The color payoff is decent to good, but the texture is a touch dry. Inglot #321 is similar in color but matte. Bobbi Brown Blue Onyx is similar but a touch purpler. MAC Blue Storm is brighter. This is a good palette‚Äìnone of the shades are duds (which has been a more frequent concern with MAC‚Äôs eyeshadow quads). Both Sugar Snack and Hypnotizing are really nice and easy to work with, while Power Boosted and Shop &amp; Drop are decent to good but could be more pigmented or softer. Shop &amp; Drop looks less nuanced when worn, especially if you‚Äôre using a neutral base, because it does have a blackened-blue base.

When it was originally launched in MAC in Lillyland , it was described as a ‚Äúbright fuchsia,‚Äù which is so much more accurate. It is a brightened, light-medium fuchsia pink with strong blue undertones. MAC Overdyed is similar but slightly darker. MAC Amazon Princess is also very similar, perhaps a touch less pink. MAC Her Blooming Cheek has a bit more of a sheen but the color comes close. Unlike the permanent range of Cremeblend Blushes , this is a much more intense color, so while those neutral shades were easy to use and impossible to overdo, I recommend a light hand and/or a stippling brush with this shade! It‚Äôs intensely pigmented, so a little goes a long way‚Äìuse less than you think you‚Äôd need. It‚Äôs easier to build up the color than it is to tamp down the intensity once it‚Äôs applied. Cremeblend Blush has an interesting texture that‚Äôs creamy but slick; it‚Äôs not thick like a traditional cream blush; it almost feels like a gel or cheek stain in feel, but it applies and looks like a cream blush. Once applied, it has a natural sheen but no shimmer. I re-tested the wear of Florida earlier this week, and it wore for seven hours before it began to fade. 19 3 Florida 19 3 Florida B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8 Longevity 4 Application 89% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

All four are intensely pigmented, rich in color, and really will pop on your cheeks ‚Äî if you so desire. What‚Äôs nice about these is you can use a stippling brush like the 188 (smaller brush-head than the 187, so it‚Äôs ideal for cheek color) for a softer, less color-rich look, or you can layer and build up the intensity for a bolder cheek look as well. These seemed thinner and more pigmented than MAC‚Äôs Blushcremes as well. Note, I can‚Äôt comment on the wear of these, as I haven‚Äôt had them for more than a few hours! I will definitely do my best to use these in a look in the next week. Cremeblend Blush ($18.50 U.S. / $22.00 CDN) Optimistic Orange is a bright pop of orange. It‚Äôs not quite neon orange, but it is pretty bold and bright. Definitely a true orange, though; this is not coral on me whatsoever. Joie-de-Vivre is a bright pink-coral; it leans more pink than orange, which is why it‚Äôs predominantly pink, but it‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôs not a bubblegum pink. MAC described it as a ‚Äúpeachy coral,‚Äù but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more like a pinky coral. So Sweet, So Easy is a bubblegum pink. It‚Äôs a medium pink with barely-there yellow undertones. It‚Äôs the lightest and softest shade of the four. Florida is a bright fuchsia-purple. It‚Äôs creamy, ultra pigmented, and WOW-za, you know? This is the kind of the color that can easily scare you away. Again, try a stippling brush, use a light hand, and you may even find using fingers to blend out the color (after the initial brush-based application) may give you the right level of intensity.

The official descritpion baffles me, honestly! The blush itself is super-sized, being about the size as a Beauty Powder. A normal blush is 0.21 oz. ($18.50), while this is almost double the quantity. In comparable terms, the normal size is $88/oz. and the mega size is $63/oz. Despite the larger size, the way they split the blush still makes it a little difficult to use the smaller shade alone (I tried using the 116‚Äìyou have to be careful, not a lot of room). The larger side of the blush is a cool-toned, blue-based magenta pink with a satin finish, which is very pigmented and easy to over-do, so use a light hand. The smaller side of the blush is a dark berried pink with soft gold sheen, and it is also nicely pigmented. final thoughts: This will suit cooler skin tones, because of the stronger blue-base in the magenta shade. Because of the intensity of the colors, it will work beautifully on darker complexions. where to buy: MAC Cosmetics MAC Amazon Princess Blush Duo MAC Amazon Princess Blush Duo MAC Amazon Princess Blush Duo MAC Amazon Princess Blush Duo MAC Amazon Princess Blush Duo MAC Amazon Princess Blush Duo</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-01-26 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>8026b6d44b5854a9a2051b9b87e36317c64f5790</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Overdyed Blush Swatches, Photos, Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/mac-overdyed-blush-swatches-photos-review/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>MAC Overdyed Blush Swatches, Photos, Review Reviews Feb 24, 2011 February 24, 2011 MAC Overdyed Blush MAC Jeanius: Overdyed MAC Overdyed Blush ($19.50 for 0.21 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúbright magenta‚Äù and has a satin finish.

I received confirmation from MAC HQ this morning that these will be permanent going forward (just these shades). All seven shades available with this collection have been released previously. These shades include: Black Line (black with gold pearl), Black Swan (black with pearl), Designer Purple (iridescent violet), Industrial (periwinkle grey), Lord It Up (bronze with pearl), Petrol Blue (deep navy with pearl), and Undercurrent (teal with pearl). Black Line is a dark brown-based black with dirty gold shimmer. It has good color payoff in a single stroke. It‚Äôs similar to Shiseido Black Sand . Black Swan is a blue-based black with silver-blue shimmer. It has good color payoff in a single stroke. I don‚Äôt know of a dupe for this one. Designer Purple is a brightened violet purple with violet and silver shimmer. This shade had some of the chunkier sparkle. It has good color payoff in one pass. MAC Rich Purple was the closest dupe I could think of, but it‚Äôs darker, less violet. Urban Decay Delinquent is similar but not as bright. Industrial is a gray-casted blue with hints of brown. It‚Äôs an interesting color, and I found it difficuolt to describe. The color payoff is so-so in one pass, and even layering, it doesn‚Äôt build as well as the other shades. I couldn‚Äôt think of a dupe. Lord It Up is a warm bronze brown with gold-bronze shimmer. It has good color payoff in one stroke. It‚Äôs similar to Urban Decay Corrupt . Petrol Blue is a dark navy blue with sapphire shimmer. It has decent to good color payoff in a single pass but layers nicely. It‚Äôs similar, but brighter, than toki doki Skeletro . Make Up For Ever #3L is similar but not as intense. Undercurrent is a blue-based teal with green-gold and teal shimmer. It has good color payoff in a single pass. Urban Decay Junkie is nearly identical. The best part about Pearlglides is their intensity; they‚Äôre deep, dark, and look rich once applied. Some perform better in a single stroke than others, though you‚Äôll get the best results if you go back and forth (just once, so it‚Äôs like two passes in total). The texture is very soft and creamy, so they glide effortlessly across the lash line and never tug or pull. These wear around eight hours on me, and luckily, since these were repromoted, I was able to re-test these against the newer rating system in the past week. I tested out the wear of Black Line, Industrial, Lord It Up, and Undercurrent on the lower lash line. I‚Äôm not sure if these are water line safe, but my instinct is that they‚Äôre likely not, because of the high shimmer content in all of the shades.

Both the Pearlmatte Eyeshadow and Face Powder are lovely to look at with their floral design, but the product itself is just okay. Pearlmatte Eyeshadow This is basically three eyeshadows in one, and the pieces are big enough that you can get your brush into each. It consists of a lightly shimmered white, a soft yellow-green with gold shimmer (think Juxt), and a medium blue-based pink with light shimmer (think Da Bling, but blue-based). The design dusts off pretty fast ‚Äî I could barely see any of the floral portions once I did swatches. The shadows themselves are decently pigmented, but they‚Äôre not ultra rich. They also felt a little powdery, which I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with. Nice design, just an okay product. Pearlmatte Face Powder This contains four different shades within the compact, but realistically, as a face/cheek product, you‚Äôre going to end up with a swirl of colors, not just any of the four. In particular, the orange shade is incredibly small, so good luck wearing that alone if you‚Äôre brave enough to try! Nonetheless, I did swatch the four individual shades, and then I did a swirled swatch. The individual shades are: a yellowed, shimmered gold, mostly matte/satin peachy orange, sheer, deep pink, and a neutral tan-brown with no real shimmer. Swirled together, I ended up with a rather bronzy shade ‚Äî it ran a little orange and had the yellow-gold shimmer in it. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd use this as an all over face powder myself, because it seems more like a bronzer based on playing around with it so far. Coconut Ice Nail Lacquer I‚Äôd like to know why they named this Coconut Ice. Maybe I haven‚Äôt consumed enough coconut ice in my life, but I just envisioned a lightened shade ‚Äî based on the name. I‚Äôve read the description previously, so I wasn‚Äôt misled, but the name seemed off to me. This is a brightened peachy-coral kind of shade. It‚Äôs like Seasonal Peach with a lot more pink. It has a creamy finish, and I‚Äôd say it needs two to three coats to look right. It kind of reminded of an old, old nail polish called Pink Radar, except lighter and less pink. I liked it, but I like corals, so this wasn‚Äôt much of a surprise. See photos and swatches!

Flavored Lip Shines usually go for $12 a pop, but these two aren‚Äôt available for individual purchase, though buying together does save you $4. There‚Äôs something about Philosophy‚Äôs keen ability to flavor/scent their products just as they‚Äôre described that makes me want to collect ‚Äôem all. I collect (but I still use ‚Äôem!) their shower gels and these lip shines. Pink Bubbly is a sheer, glossy silvery pink color. The glitter is mostly silver in it, while the bsae is an extremely sheer pink. It really doesn‚Äôt transfer into a lot of color onto the lips by any means. Angel Food Cake is arguably just as sheer, but it has more pop in its shimmer/glitter. The glitter is a bright pop of pale yellow gold and more orange-y gold. The base is a very sheer pale yellowish shade (basically, clear with a tint of yellow). They both smell delicious, which is really my big reason for always having these on hand. (These aren‚Äôt designed to be ultra pigmented‚Äìso they‚Äôre not masquerading as color rich glosses!) Flavored Lip Shines are undoubtedly high in glossiness and low in stickiness. They‚Äôre one of my favorite ways to keep my lips moisturized throughout the day. The low color lets me wear these anywhere, any time. See swatches !

MAC describes the colors as peachy rose with pink shimmer, soft rosy bronze, and soft shell pink with fine shimmer. The oversize mineralize skinfinish does allow for easy use of each color individually, and I could see mixing and matching, though they‚Äôre wearable on an individual level. The way I looked at these mineralize skinfinishes was they included a ‚Äúhighlighter‚Äù shade, ‚Äúbronzing‚Äù shade, and ‚Äúblushing‚Äù shade. The ‚Äúhighlighting‚Äù shade, which I found was best used that way (more shimmer than color when applied), is a pale champagne beige with white-gold shimmer. The ‚Äúbronzing‚Äù shade is a mid-tone orange-tinged brown, but it doesn‚Äôt feel orange-y (like Golden Lariat) with a subtle satin sheen. The ‚Äúblushing‚Äù shade is a peached pink with a shimmer-sheen. my thoughts on the formula: Mineralize Skinfinishes can be used for a variety of things‚Äìfrom blush to bronzer to highlighter. The way you use it depends on your skin tone, how pigmented the particular shade of mineralize skinfinish is, the texture, and what you want to use it for. These are baked products, so they can be used wet or dry without fear of ruining the product. The texture is soft, but the fineness of the shimmer depends on the individual shade. Stippling brushes like the 187 and 188 are ideal for applying mineralize skinfinishes. Normally, mineralize skinfinishes retail for $28 (0.35 oz.), so this is double the size for $7 more. To put it simply, you‚Äôre paying $50/oz. rather than $80/oz. Whether you‚Äôll ever use all whopping 0.70 oz. of it depends on you! It does feel huge, though, and the size makes it less convenient to tote around in your bag or makeup bag. I also think that for its gigantic-size, I would have loved to see a mirror included. If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 27/30 Value : 10/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 3/5 final thoughts: I thought this one actually worked well‚ÄìI can see a variety of skin tones working this. Golden Lariat may pull too orange to be wearable for some, but Pink Power looks beautiful applied. It has enough warmth to work for my warmer-toned friends, but it‚Äôs not so warm that it turns orange, so it should be lovely on cooler skin tones, too. where to buy: MAC Cosmetics MAC Pink Power Mineralize Skinfinish Size comparison‚Ä¶ normal MSF vs. WW MSF (Golden Lariat pictured) MAC Pink Power Mineralize Skinfinish MAC Pink Power Mineralize Skinfinish MAC Pink Power Mineralize Skinfinish MAC Pink Power Mineralize Skinfinish MAC Pink Power Mineralize Skinfinish For full-face photos, I used the ‚Äúbronzing‚Äù shade to contour, the ‚Äúblushing‚Äù shdae to blush, and then the ‚Äúhighlighting‚Äù shade to highlighter. In order to get these up as soon as possible, I did these these three at once (my cheeks just can‚Äôt take more than 5 or so back-to-back cheek swatches).

Laundry Daze is a pale white-yellow with this faint hint of green. There‚Äôs just something slightly green in it, but it doesn‚Äôt cast or really look green. Whatever it is, it actually works really well with the rest of the shades because it coordinates and blends into them. This shade has a satin finish and has good color payoff. It‚Äôs, perhaps, a much, much lighter version of Dior Garden Pastels . I couldn‚Äôt think of any other potential dupes. Colour Added is a brightened yellow with a kiss of chartreuse. It had excellent color payoff and felt very smooth. It has a veluxe pearl finish. NARS Rated R is greener. MAC Double Feature 2 is noticeably greener but not as green as Rated R. MAC Bitter is closer but a touch greener. MAC Three Ring Yellow is pretty close. Pre-packaged is a darkened navy blue with a hint of teal. It has a veluxe pearl finish. The color payoff is good, and the texture is soft and smooth. Bare Escentuals Water is a bit like it, but tealer and more matte in finish. Guerlain Les Gris has a similar blue but a little muted. Self-Serve is a medium-dark gray-brown with a subtle pearled sheen. It has a satin finish. The color payoff is horrendous‚Äìit‚Äôs like a trick eyeshadow! The swatch I managed to capture is a layered swatch; that‚Äôs the color built up as much as I could muster. The texture is dry, stiff, and loathes to be blended. Guerlain Les Gris has a similar grayish-brown kind of shade with better color payoff, though it has more of a matte finish. MAC Scene is a bit similar but less brown. MAC Moody is darker and browner but seems to be kind of what they were going for. Everything was looking SO promising until I swatched Self-Serve , and then the eyeshadow loving part of me died a little inside. I was like, ‚ÄúWhat? How could you be such a tease?‚Äù Of course, a mere swatch on the arm only tells a partial story, so I went to test it in a look. It doesn‚Äôt apply much better over bare skin with a brush, but it is slightly better. It definitely needs a primer to yield truer color payoff, but here‚Äôs the rub: it‚Äôs just as dry, stiff, and difficult to blend applied as it was swatched. This lack of blendability made it a really frustrating shade to work with. I was loving the quad until I tried Self-Serve . It has potential, and depending on your level of patience and whether or not you have similar shades to the other three eyeshadows, it may or may not be worth it. The quality of the other three is much, much higher; the two veluxe pearls feel soft, smooth, and deliver so much color. If we ignore Self-Serve , the quad would have received an overall rating of an A . Unfortunately, Self-Serve is not just a little bad but really bad, which resulted in scores of 1, 4, 1, 9, and 1.5. (Packaging is a single score that isn‚Äôt averaged across the four shades since it‚Äôs not impacted by the individual shade‚Äôs performance.)

Urban Decay Stardust Sparkling Lipgloss ($19.00) will be available in-stores at ULTA and select Macy‚Äôs as well as online at ulta.com, macys.com, beauty.com, and urbandecay.com (no Sephora). I do not believe these are limited edition. This gloss is supposed to be multi-faceted with microscopic, ultra-reflective sparkle for a luminous effect on lips without the glitter grit. It includes vitamin E and jojoba oil. The texture is supposed to be buttery, non-sticky, and have a transparent but scintillating texture with a cushiony formula to give lips a fuller look without the bee-stung feeling. There will be three shades available. Urban Decay Holiday Nail Kit ($28.00) will only be available at select Macy‚Äôs in-store and online at urbandecay.com.

Manila Paper is a warm, white gold with excellent color payoff. This is a veluxe pearl finish. It is a repromote from Spring Colour Forecast. It is similar to Nylon but warmer. Valiant is a yellowed, pale chartreuse green‚Äìextremely yellowed. It has so-so color pay off; it is a little sheer. This is a frost finish. It‚Äôs a yellower version of Juxt. Diana Undercover is a darkened green with a brownish base. This is a satin finish. It had decent pigmentation but took a layer or two for it to show. It did work better in a look than swatched on the skin. The green is similar to the base color of NARS Blade Runner (but lacks the shmmer). Spinning Transformation is a olive-tinged khaki brown with a soft bronze sheen. This is a frost finish. Pigmentation was decent but the texture was so thin‚Äìjust not soft or silky smooth at all. It‚Äôs a less pigmented, less gold-shimmered NARS Star Sailor. It is a browner, less green-tinged Sumptuous Olive. I feel like Valiant is just a little better than Lady Justice‚Äìdecent but not as high quality as I‚Äôd like to see. Manila Paper is the standout shade in terms of color pay off and texture; creamy, smooth, and rich. Diana Undercover is a shade that MAC hasn‚Äôt done often, so I like it for its originality, but I wish it had a buttery texture. For a frost finish, Spinning Transformation wasn‚Äôt as soft and smooth as I‚Äôd expect.

I think the pigmentation is decent across the board in this palette, but it‚Äôs not above and beyond excellent. where to buy: MAC Cosmetics MAC Valiant Eyeshadow Quad MAC Eyeshadow Quad MAC Eyeshadow Quad MAC Eyeshadow Quad MAC Valiant Eyeshadow Quad: Manila Paper, Valiant, Diana Undercover, Spinning Transformation MAC Valiant Eyeshadow Quad: Manila Paper, Valiant MAC Valiant Eyeshadow Quad: Diana Undercover, Spinning Transformation MAC Valiant Eyeshadow Quad: Manila Paper, Valiant MAC Valiant Eyeshadow Quad: Diana Undercover, Spinning Transformation MAC Valiant Eyeshadow Quad: Manila Paper, Valiant, Diana Undercover, Spinning Transformation MAC Valiant Eyeshadow Quad: Manila Paper, Valiant MAC Valiant Eyeshadow Quad: Diana Undercover, Spinning Transformation MAC Manila Paper Eyeshadow MAC Valiant Eyeshadow MAC Diana Undercover Eyeshadow MAC Spinning Transformation Eyeshadow</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-01-27 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>26b532ab5655673a3010dfbc8a42b649c5afc9e0</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>bareMinerals The Elements Eyeshadow Quad Review, Photos, Swatches</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/bare-escentuals-bare-minerals-the-elements-eyeshadow-quad-review-photos-swatches/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>bareMinerals The Elements Eyeshadow Quad Review, Photos, Swatches Sample Reviews Sep 02, 2011 September 02, 2011 bareMinerals The Elements Eyeshadow Quad bareMinerals The Elements Eyeshadow Quad Coming in October, bareMinerals The Elements Eyeshadow Quad ($30.00 for 0.17 oz.) will debut, and it features four shades: Air, Fire, Earth, and Water. bareMinerals‚Äô pressed eyeshadow formula contains SeaNutritive Mineral Complex that gives the shadow a ‚Äúcreamy, silky smooth‚Äù texture with ‚Äúseamless blendability‚Äù and ‚Äústay-true color.‚Äù It‚Äôs supposed to be long-wearing whether worn alone or with primer‚Äìyou shouldn‚Äôt see any creasing or fading. I‚Äôve tested various combinations of shades from the duos and quads, and I‚Äôve happily achieved ten hours of solid wear without a primer underneath. For a review of the packaging, please read my original review . Air is a grayish beige with a frosted finish. The color is very similar to Urban Decay Ruthless . Air has good color payoff and a really soft, smooth texture that‚Äôs dense and buttery. Fire is a burnt orange with a satiny sheen. The color is much browner compared to MAC Rule , though it‚Äôs the closest shade I could think of. I was surprisd by how smooth and pigmented Fire was, because it almost has a matte-like finish so I was expecting a drier texture. Instead, it‚Äôs very workable and blendable. Earth is a gray-tinted green with a pearly sheen. It has more of a sheen than Fire but not as much as a traditional frost does. I love the uniqueness of this color, but the texture is on the drier side so the color payoff is uneven in places and not as dense as I would like. It seems like what MAC Evil Eye should have been, though Earth is lighter. Water is muted navy blue with an edging of teal. The finish has a lot of sheen to it but less shimmer. It‚Äôs bluer and less silvery compared to theBalm Sensational . I think MAC Bold Babe is closer, but it‚Äôs a lot less blue. Water had a really soft, silky texture and applied easily onto the lid. bareMinerals The Elements Eyeshadow Quad Review, Photos, Swatches - Recommended We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It‚Äôs slightly lighter compared to the usual Dior eyeshadow palette, which has 0.21 oz., while this palette only has 0.16 oz. I suspect it is due to the consistency difference somehow, since it doesn‚Äôt seem less full or smaller compared to other Dior eyeshadow palettes. The shade on the upper left of the palette is a yellowy green with a soft, frosted finish. The color payoff is good, and the texture is very smooth, though there‚Äôs a little dryness to it. If you‚Äôve played with Estee Lauder‚Äôs Cyber Eyes eyeshadows, you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs dry, but still very soft and smooth, and while dry, it‚Äôs not powdery. It‚Äôs a yellower and more subdued version of MAC LUcky Green , but it‚Äôs much darker than MAC Juxt . Inglot #412 is similar but more metallic, so it appears lighter. On the upper right of the palette, the shade is a bright frosted white with good color payoff and a smooth, soft feel. There‚Äôs not a lot to the color‚Äìit‚Äôs a neutral white, not too cool- or warm-toned, so there are a fair amount of white eyeshadow dupes . The center shade is a soft pastel pink with a silver shimmer. It has decent to good pigmentation, but there is some underlying sheerness. The texture is nice and smooth, though. It‚Äôs similar to Tarina Tarantino Diamond Dusk and is just barely darker than Tarina Tarantino Delightful . MAC Fresh Ice has more lilac in it. MAC Seedy Pearl is a bit darker and purpler. On the bottom left, there is a pale yellow with a frosted finish that‚Äôs just slightly metallic. This shade had the best color payoff of the five shades; really dense and opaque. Tarina Tarantino Wonderful is less yellow, less frosted. theBalm Wild Child is more golden. MAC Nylon is a bit lighter and more golden. The last shade on the bottom right of the palette is a green-tinted blue with a green-gold shimmer-sheen. It has decent color payoff, but like the center shade, it has underlying sheerness. It‚Äôs greener than Urban Decay Aquarius . Tarina Tarantino Violet Storm is similar but a touch darker and doesn‚Äôt have the same golden sheen. Make Up For Ever #302 is more teal. The texture of this palette is definitely different compared to previous iterations of Dior‚Äôs five-pan palettes. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a departure from their typical formula but something in particular for the spring collection. Part of it may have been necessary to incorporate the design, but it‚Äôs certainly not an unwelcome or bad different! The drier consistency feels off at first, but it works well on the lid. I like it, though perhaps not am not in love with it, since there are some sheerer shades in the palette. Everything has a fairly shimmered finish, so you may want to mix and match with other finishes to create more dimension. When worn together, it can feel like frost overload, depending on which shades you use! I went for the most obvious combination for testing: yellow, green, and blue/teal. The new palette for spring doesn‚Äôt have much in the way of a description, but based on Dior‚Äôs other five-pan palettes, their eyeshadows are supposed to have rich, versatile colors that are ‚Äúdesigned for easy application and long wear.‚Äù The drier consistency definitely helps these wear longer without creasing (without the aid of a primer), though I did find there was some slight fading after eight hours.

On my lips, it looks softer, less like Creamiscle orange, because of the natural tones of my lip color (and the redder your natural lip color, the more coral this will look). This looks a lot like Le Metier de Beaute Ginger Lily but a bit darker. MAC Woo Me is also similar applied. It looked a bit pale and pastel when swatched, but it should flatter a wider range of skin tones once it is applied, because it‚Äôs not fully opaque and lets the natural lip color shine through, which will, inevitably, alter the way the color looks based on your natural lip color. This formula is supposed to be extremely hydrating (purportedly ‚Äúfor eight hours after application‚Äù). The color applies with quite a bit of pigmentation, but there‚Äôs that soft, slightly transparent-nature of this type of finish that makes it less heavy. Although, the press release says the formula ‚Äúprovides translucent shine with sheer yet radiant color,‚Äù and this applies rather opaque. I found #N40 to be more moisturizing than Folk , but this shade also had a creamier, more slippery consistency in comparison. It wears three and a half hours on me, which is pretty good for something that has this kind of texture. I‚Äôd describe it has lightly moisturizing, but it‚Äôs not as hydrating as described‚ÄìI definitely couldn‚Äôt get away with not applying something else over an eight hour period. It was scent- and taste-free. 9 14 #N40 9 14 #N40 B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora Brazil Sephora (Australia) Make Up For Ever 8.5 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8 Longevity 4.5 Application 86% Total Read Full Review</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2012-05-14 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>341865d2a8847de76ccecc8120a72959a0ddc436</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>The Hit List: Worst Drugstore Lipstick</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/the-hit-list-worst-drugstore-lipstick/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>The Hit List: Worst Drugstore Lipstick Features Jan 27, 2011 January 27, 2011 What‚Äôs the Worst Drugstore Lipstick ‚Ä¶?

She completed her undergraduate degree in Literature/Writing at University of California, San Diego. She recently completed her master‚Äôs degree in Rhetoric and Professional and Technical Writing. Chelsea currently works as a proposal editor for a local defense company. She loves to freelance and edit, but between her full-time job and awesome pets, what little time she has left she devotes to fragrance! Red-Hot Romance: Serge Lutens Rousse Rousse explores cinnamon‚Äôs spice aspect. The top notes are candied‚Äìthink Hot Tamales‚Äìwith the composition getting drier and spicier as it wears, until it is ultimately warm and creamy at the base with the scent of cinnamon starring throughout. The official notes are listed as mandarin, cinnamon, cloves, spices, floral and aromatic notes, fruit, cinnamon wood, precious woods, amber, musk, and vanilla. If it sounds gourmand, it isn‚Äôt. It is, in fact, quite dry. Dry, spice-centric fragrances can feel like an big, empty cathedral on a cold day. Rousse hangs some curtains on the cathedral‚Äôs windows, carpets the floor, and cushions the pews with some throw pillows. It opens with a blast of cinnamon. As it mellows, tendrils of vanilla and musk creep in. This is also where I smell the juicy orange of the mandarin, a bright spot of orange on a pallet of muted maroons and russets. A woody heart keeps the cinnamon nice and hot and out of bakery territory. The vanilla, musk, and amber gradually intensify until they‚Äôre on nearly equal footing with the spices. By the drydown, they‚Äôve eclipsed the spices altogether. Rousse is warm, but feels sheer rather than heavy, so you could wear it year-round, although I find it works best for fall. What makes this fragrance particularly intriguing is a left-of-center lipstick accord, which is waxy and vaguely floral. I can‚Äôt help but think of a bold, matte red lipstick on a smoking hot redhead. Think Christina Hendricks in full retro glam makeup as Mad Men‚Äôs Joan. What could be better for Valentine‚Äôs Day? If all this red doesn‚Äôt rev your engine, Frederic Malle Noir Epices is a similarly spicy unisex perfume that dials down the cinnamon and swaps Rousse‚Äôs creamy base notes for patchouli, cedar, and sandalwood. Bombshell imagery aside, this scent is squarely unisex. Released in 2007, it is part of French perfume house Serge Lutens‚Äô export range (meaning it is available outside of Europe). House nose Christopher Sheldrake composed it. Lucky ducks who live in Paris can go to the Salons du Palais Royal Shiseido to sample Rousse or buy a bottle. The rest of us can buy samples at The Perfumed Court and The Posh Peasant t and full bottles at ucky Scent , Beauty Habit , or Aedes . for $120. Parfum 1 sells it for $108. Some Barneys, Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus stores carry Serge Lutens exports.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2012-01-17 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>aca8632362709a1d0c3329ecd6206cf31e334eb4</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Urban Decay Mariposa Eyeshadow Palette</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/tag/urban-decay-wreckage-eyeshadow/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Urban Decay Mariposa Eyeshadow Palette Affiliate Links , Sample Reviews Sep 03, 2011 September 03, 2011 Urban Decay Mariposa Eyeshadow Palette Urban Decay Mariposa Eyeshadow Palette Urban Decay Mariposa Eyeshadow Palette ($39.00 for 10 x 0.03 oz.) is a limited edition, Sephora-exclusive eyeshadow palette for the holidays. It comes in a metal tin with a hinged lid with ten eyeshadows and a travel-sized eyeshadow brush. These are the shades included: Rockstar (deep eggplant with metallic base), Gunmetal (gunmetal grey with silver glitter), Skimp (pale nude with gold shimmer), Infamous (shifty mauve), Wreckage (shimmery dark taupe), Haight (shimmering mermaid blue), Money (silvery pale green), Mushroom (shimmering fawn), Spotlight (medium taupe with gold sparkle), and Limelight (bronze with gold glitter). New shades include Infamous, Limelight, Spotlight, and Wreckage. All other shades are repromotes. The exterior of the palette is nice; it‚Äôs a good size, too‚Äìsmall enough to travel with but large enough to be easy to use with regular, full-sized brushes. There is no mirror in this palette, which is unusual for Urban Decay‚Äôs palettes. It‚Äôs not as slim as their six-pan palettes (like Dangerous, Feminine, etc.), but it is significantly smaller than the Book of Shadows volumes. It stays shut quite well, as the lid is kept on by hinges. The brushed metal finish of the tin hides fingerprints well. I don‚Äôt love the interior; it‚Äôs cardboard that shifts around a bit when you‚Äôve plunk a brush into one of the eyeshadow wells. It just feels a little‚Ä¶ cheap to me, and I generally don‚Äôt have issues with cardboard-based packaging so long as it feels sturdy. Rockstar is a smoky eggplant purple with very subtle red undertones; it‚Äôs not a fully neutral purple, but it‚Äôs close. Giorgio Armani #3 is darker, less purple. theBalm All the Way Annie and Make Up For Ever #142 are similar but neither has the blackened base. theBalm Kissy, Kissy is closer but not quite as red-toned. Gunmetal is a dark charcoal gray with silver glitter. This shade is part of the permanent range. If you feel like you‚Äôve just seen this shade, it‚Äôs true‚Äìit‚Äôs also in the BoS 4. It is similar to Inglot #451 but a bit darker. Because it does have glitter, it may have some fall out (I have found it less so than some of the really glittery shades). Skimp is a beige-peach with a pearled sheen. It, too, was most recently in the BoS 4. It is similar to Bare Escentuals Serendipitous but lighter than MAC Brule . The quality seemed better here‚Äìit didn‚Äôt feel dry at all. Infamous is a bright, plum-tinged fuchsia pink with a satiny sheen. This had a slightly drier texture than a lot of the other shades in the palette but the color payoff was still decent. It isn‚Äôt the same as Urban Decay Woodstock , which is much redder, brighter, and deeper. This is more like Woodstock and Fishnet got together and had baby. It is closer to Make Up For Ever #52 but muted and slightly purpler. Wreckage is a muted, medium-dark brown with subtle yellow undertones and a subtle golden sheen. The color payoff was decent but not as dense as most Urban Decay eyeshadows. It is very similar in color to Bare Escentuals A-Ha . It is reminiscent of Urban Decay Toasted but not as warm. Haight is a teal-tinged, medium-dark blue with a frosted finish. This shade is part of the permanent range, but it is a little duller than my individual pot of it. It will take on a more of a teal appearance when near greens. I can‚Äôt think of a great dupe for Haight. Money is a silvery green-gray with a cool-toned gold sheen. It‚Äôs a really cool, complex color. It does have silver sparkles in it, so there may be some fall out. I find Money has less sparkle than really glittery shades like Midnight Cowboy, though. I couldn‚Äôt think of a dupe for this shade either. Mushroom is a dark taupe‚Äìa little silvery, brown, and gray. It is a little less brown compard to Giorgio Armani #4 and grayer compared to theBalm Come Hither Heather . Spotlight is a pale champagne-bronze with gold glitter and a rather chunky texture. This was the worst shade in the palette‚Äìit was dry and chunky, not just from the glitter, but the powder itself didn‚Äôt adhere smoothly. It resulted in poorer color payoff and lots of fall out. Bare Escentuals Magnetism is a touch darker (and doesn‚Äôt have glitter). Limelight is a lightened coppery bronze with a warm golden shimmer and glitter. It‚Äôs more orange than Urban Decay Blunt but not by much. It‚Äôs a lighter version of Urban Decay Half-Baked . Funny enough, some of the lightness of the shade is due to the drier texture and uneven color payoff (which is decent but not great). I had similar issues with this shade as I did with Limelight, just not to the same degree. Long-time collectors and fans will find this palette with too many repromotes/similarly done shades. I think Urban Decay might want to cut back on creating more browns/bronzes, because they‚Äôre starting to run together. I don‚Äôt want more Half-Baked eyeshadows, but if you‚Äôre going to just make one-offs of it, I‚Äôd rather the original so I know I‚Äôm not getting anything new. They could consider doing more browns, even in the same tones and shades, but with different finishes‚Äìlike satins or mattes. I had major issues with Spotlight and Limelight and minor issues with Infamous. I would say that two of the ten eyeshadows were misses, but the other eight were varying degrees of good to great. Like other Urban Decay palettes, though, it‚Äôs a good deal‚Äìit has $102 worth of eyeshadows, plus a travel-sized version of the shadow brush ($26), so I‚Äôd approximate the value of the whole shabang for around $120.

I am now! Hourglass Prism Visionaire Eye Shadow Duo ($38.00 for 0.20 oz.) is a stunning, smoky duo of steel blue with a silver sheen and an intense, deep dark black with flecks of teal and silver running through it. The pigmentation of the two shades is absolutely insane‚Äìso vibrant, so smooth. The texture is excellent; smooth, soft, buttery, and easy to blend. The packaging is kind of a gunmetal silver-brown, very modern and sleek. It‚Äôs actually a swiveling compact, which is interesting. I like that the packaging is different and elegant, but I get the feeling that it obviously contributes a bit to the steeper cost of these. Just to put things in perspective, MAC eyeshadows are $290/oz. and NARS eyeshadow duos at $228/oz. ‚Äî with Hourglass at$190/oz. The pricing may be off-putting for some, but if it‚Äôs within your budget, I‚Äôd urge you to at least give ‚Äôem a swatch at your nearest Sephora sometime. They just might impress you as they did me! I‚Äôm quite pleased with the quality and feel of the duo‚ÄìI really didn‚Äôt expect it‚Äìand I‚Äôd say these are some of the best eyeshadows I‚Äôve tried, from the texture to the pigmentation to the colors themselves. I definitely have to look into some of the other duos and see how those stack up against Prism ( totally crossing fingers that they are just as amazing !). Other duos include : Dune (champagne shimmer/deep olive shimmer), Exhibition (mauve shimmer/eggplant shimmer), Gypsy (peach ivory shimmer/bronze shimmer), Lagoon (seafoam blue shimmer/teal shimmer), and Suede (ivory shimmer/light beige shimmer).

However, the young man‚Äôs creative strength and relentless hard work defied nature, and today one can still admire the garden in bloom and in particular, the fantastic rose garden planted with his own hands. Christian Dior also loved the excitement of parties, and often hosted the aptly named ‚ÄúGrand Balls of the Century‚Äù with enchanted beauties from the Normandy coast and Paris alike. The theme of the festive garden is still alive today throughout many Dior creations. The Dior spring color collection is inspired by Dior‚Äôs fantastic garden. Garden Clutch ($75.00) (Limited Edition) The clutch is reinvented in with the Garden Party spirit in mind. Featuring a glossy light pink leather-like shell, adorned with a woven pattern &amp; sealed by a ‚ÄúRosebud‚Äù clasp and makeup must-haves for eyes and lips.

For an overall review of the product, along with packaging, please see part one . Because there are differences in quality for each shade, I have listed a pigmentation and texture score for each (both scores are out of 10), which I then averaged across all sixteen shades to give the scores found in The Glossover below. Midnight Cowgirl is a warm, pale, peach-gold with a frosted finish. The color payoff is really lovely, as it is rich and buttery, though it does have flecks of gold micro-glitter. This shade is part of the permanent range. I find the majority disappears before you even apply it, but you may find that some fall out underneath the eye. It is a bit lighter than Bobbi Brown Desert Sand . It‚Äôs similar in color but lighter compared to Urban Decay Blunt . It‚Äôs also a lighter, less brown version of MAC Retrospeck . (9, 8.5) Sin is a pink-tinged champagne with a frosted finish and rather metallic sheen. This shade is part of the permanent range. Urban Decay Scratch is much pinker. Giorgio Armani #8 is similar but more metallic in finish. Inglot #397 is similar in color, less pink-tinged. (9.5, 9) Midnight Rodeo is a sparkly taupe brown. It does have glitter, but it‚Äôs subtle and doesn‚Äôt seem as large as Urban Decay‚Äôs other glitter-finished eyeshadows but may still have some fall out. The color payoff is good, and the texture is fairly smooth. I thought Urban Decay Toasted might be similar, but it‚Äôs not‚Äìmuch browner, less of a taupe. theBalm Insane Jane is grayer (more cool-toned), while Inglot #402 is nearly indistinguishable from Midnight Rodeo. This shade is a repromote from the 15th Anniversary Palette. (9, 8.5) Crystal is a bluish-purple gray with a silvered sheen. It lacks pigmentation, and the texture is dry and stiff to work with‚Äìyou‚Äôll have to pack it on to achieve the color you see in the pan. This shade is new and exclusive to this palette. Inglot #420 is similar but darker and lacks the bluish tones. Urban Decay Stripped has less purple and is much, much darker. (5, 7) Bust is a softened, gray-tinged taupe brown with a soft, frosted finish. This shade is new and exclusive to this palette. It has a really smooth application with a buttery texture, while the shade itself has excellent color payoff. NARS Grand Palais is slightly browner, MAC Street Cool is darker and browner, MAC Satin Taupe is much, much darker, and Inglot #402 is warmer and less gray. It‚Äôs like a frosted version of Urban Decay Shakedown . (9.5, 9) Missionary is a soft, beige-taupe with a frosted finish. It‚Äôs like a lighter version of Sin. It has good color payoff, but it‚Äôs not fully opaque. This shade is new and exclusive to this palette. It is pinker than MAC Butternutty . It‚Äôs a little lighter and has more of a sheen compared to Urban Decay Virgin . (9, 9) Skimp is a beige-peach with a pearled sheen. The color payoff here was a bit sheer, and the texture surprisingly dry. This shade is a repromote. It is similar to Bare Escentuals Serendipitous . It is a little lighter than MAC Brule . (8, 8.5) Zephyr is a warm white with a golden sheen. It has good color payoff, but it is a bit powdery. This shade is new and exclusive to this palette. It less yellow compared to Urban Decay Vanilla and MAC Nylon , but it is comparable to Bare Escentuals Breathtaking .

Her parents taught her to love nature and observe its colors, textures, sounds, flavors, and fragrances. She deeply appreciates nature and respects it, and she has found this education helped her develop a taste for beauty in all its various expressions, like music, photography, and cosmetics. She studied in Psychology and currently teaches at the University. D√¢maris believes there is an art of self-care, which is good for your emotions. She describes her philosophy as, ‚ÄúTaking care of the body is good for the heart, thoughts, and does good to the will to live. Highlighting your points of beauty is a secret we learn every day.‚Äù Check out her blog, Village Beaute ! Holiday Gift Guide: Brazil Edition Here in Brazil, our Christmas is spent among beaches, swimming, and most importantly, among the people we love. Exchanging gifts is a sign of affection with everyone. I‚Äôm happy to share with you some of the most interesting and beautiful holiday kits from my favorite Brazilian brands this season. The Cont√©m 1 grama released several kits with sets ranging from small travel bags to makeup palettes with shadows, blushes, applicators. Christmas, for me, is a solemn moment, so I suggest the Kit Glam (R$ 88,00), which is has appropriate colors for night use and, beyond the shadows, also includes a great black mascara. The value of the kit is good‚Äìit‚Äôs better to buy the set than the products separately. To stay smelling nice, O Botic√°rio launched kits for men, women, children and teens, with one prettier than the last! For the most value, I really enjoyed the Portinari Kit (R$148,00) for men, which comes with deo cologne, soap and nail care instruments. The Lily Essence Kit (R$ 199,00) contains my favorite Brazilian eau de parfum for women. For that person we want to gift, but we cannot spend too much, there are some beautiful bath sets that are good, with several fragrances that start at R$ 13,90. Finally, a brand in southern Brazil, which is a network of pharmacies, the Panvel . It has fragrant and moisturizing creams, makeup, and soft brushes all with very good prices! It is impossible to resist. Whenever I go to Panvel, I can‚Äôt get out of there without something. It has a travel brush kit (R$ 19,90) generously sized, as well as a pretty-in-pink (and super soft) kabuki for only R$ 19,00. Do you have any favorite Brazilian gifts to give this year?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-12-13 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>83e150dfe3c6d3ee986c5cee0d7f307fbb941988</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Back-to-School Makeup: Quick Looks</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/back-to-school-makeup-quick-looks/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Back-to-School Makeup: Quick Looks Features Sep 02, 2011 September 02, 2011 Back-to-School Quickies The alarm went off‚Ä¶ a half hour ago. You only have five to ten minutes before you have to head out the door‚Äìthese are my favorite ways to look and feel good when time is short! Neutral + Dark Crease : Pop a flesh-toned neutral all over the lid and add pop and oomph with a much darker crease. On warmer complexions, an eggplant purple adds definition and color without being over-the-top. On cooler complexions, navy and charcoal blues work well. Bright Eyeliner : Whether you line the lower or upper lash lines (or both!), using a brightly colored eyeliner can give you a really fun look without a lot of work! Find Your Duo : One of my favorite eyeshadow duos is Hourglass‚Äô Gypsy‚Äìit just works well for me‚Äìand I reach for it regularly when I‚Äôm in need of some color on the lid but don‚Äôt have a lot of time to think about what I want to do. Whether it‚Äôs neutral or not, totally up to you, but finding a duo, trio, or palette with a never-fails combination is essential for those mornings you wake up late! Bold Lips : Don‚Äôt be afraid of bold lip colors! Especially as we head into fall (officially, at least!), darker lip colors are always in style. You can add an instant brightness to your face by using a bolder, darker lip color. Plus, darker lip colors tend to last longer on lips, which means less reapplying. ‚ÄúNo Makeup‚Äù Makeup : Classic, polished, and easy to do once you figure out what products you love most for the look. Ideally, you want to add depth and brightness to the eyes as well as defined lashes; soft glow and natural color to cheeks; smooth, ‚Äúflawless‚Äù skin; and your my-lips-but-better lipstick/lipgloss‚Äìlook out for plums, mauves, and plummy-pinks.

Color Design Eyeshadows have varying finishes, but all of them are supposed to deliver ‚Äúlong-lasting, pigment-packed color [that] stays true for daylong wear.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rich, dark black with blue undertones and silver micro-glitter. I did a quick wash of this color on the lid (without primer), and it wore for eight hours before subtly creasing. Over a primer, it wears for twelve hours without any issues. The texture is smooth, and the color payoff is really true-to-pan‚Äìit‚Äôs a dark black, and it doesn‚Äôt drag or go on patchily, as some blacks do. The glitter is embedded in the powder itself well, but there are the occasional pieces that fall out. This shade reminded me of Chanel Mirifique , though The New Black has a stronger blue-base. I imagine it‚Äôs also similar to MAC Black Tied but more pigmented.

It looks a bit darker, less silver (and certainly less metallic) when applied dry compared to when it is applied wet, where the metallic sheen and therefore silver nature of the hue comes through much more. Either way, though, the color payoff is tops. The shade reminded me of Dior Smoking Blue , but this is more metallic. It‚Äôs a little lighter compared to Bobbi Brown Silver and Urban Decay S&amp;M . Of the three I tried, I thought Cyber Silver had the most depth, and it applied really smoothly both wet and dry. It wears for around six hours without a base when applied dry but reaches eight hours when applied dry; there were no wear issues if used with an eyeshadow base. The texture feels almost like a baked eyeshadow but with a much smoother feel and the product holds together infinitely better. 4 2 Cyber Silver 4 2 Cyber Silver A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Macy's Harrods Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) LookFantastic Bloomingdale's FeelUnique bluemercury Estee Lauder Dillard's 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4 Application 91% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The closest dupe I could think of was MAC Goody Goody Gum Drop which is similar but slightly cooler-toned and with a less noticeable golden sheen. The texture is good, but it could be a touch smoother; when applied to the lid, it seems to be better than swatched. It‚Äôs not bad, it truly is good, but I think the texture has a little room for improvement. This is a great one-and-done shade, though, and it has more oomph than a beige/champagne wash of color does. Bonus? It could totally be used as a blush or highlighter. Lancome‚Äôs eyeshadows are supposed to be long-wearing (without a base), and while I don‚Äôt quite achieve all-day wear, I get around eight hours with subtle creasing, but I don‚Äôt have any creasing issues if I use a base underneath. 32 2 Kitten Heel 32 2 Kitten Heel B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Amazon Macy's Net-A-Porter Harrods Harvey Nichols (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's HSN FeelUnique Lancome (Canada) Cosbar Dillard's Lancome 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8 Longevity 4 Application 86% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Chanel Sari Dore is more vibrant, while MAC Made to Order is glossier and has some shimmer in it. Bobbi Brown Soft Coral is lighter, while CoverGirl Delish is just slightly lighter. NARS‚Äô Satin lipsticks are creamier than some of the other formulas, though they‚Äôre not super creamy or soft. Because they‚Äôre not too creamy, they don‚Äôt apply too thickly either‚Äìyou get a nice lightweight feel with your more opaque color. Casablanca wore for around five hours, and it almost stretched to six, but I felt it needed reapplication by the sixth hour. It‚Äôs not drying, but it‚Äôs not really moisturizing over the duration of wear. I didn‚Äôt detect any scent or taste. As far as oranges go, this is a more wearable one, especially for cooler complexions, though it‚Äôs still warm-toned. 23 13 Casablanca 23 13 Casablanca A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Ulta Saks Selfridges Macy's Net-A-Porter Barneys Harvey Nichols (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's FeelUnique Space NK (UK) bluemercury Dillard's NARS 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 92% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It‚Äôs a great variation on taupe‚Äìa cool-toned brown with a grayish overcast and has more of a satiny sheen than an overt shimmer finish, but it doesn‚Äôt deliver on full color coverage. As far as similar shades, theBalm Selfish and NARS Grand Palais are close in color but much more shimmery. MAC Satin Taupe is much more intense and deeper. Unfortunately, the color payoff is somewhat lacking; it deposits decent color, and I discovered it performed a little better applied on the eye, but it‚Äôs just not as good as it could (or should) be and definitely requires some packing and pressing of the color onto to the lid to get decent payoff. The texture is soft without being powdery or too fragile.

I‚Äôve never been a huge fan of using super dark bases overall, just because I‚Äôve always found they have a tendency to eat color and not enhance it as much as lighter bases can do.

It seems like it‚Äôs exclusively available at Sephora for the time being, and Sephora describes the new mascara as: DiorShow Extase provides built-in treatment benefits and high-impact lashes in a single stroke! The spherical-shaped Black Pearl Pigments create a 3D volume effect and the exclusive Metamorphosis Powders expand in size by up to 50% after application. Also, SR38 Patented Ceramid brings additional care, reconstructing damaged lashes and promoting stronger and fuller lashes. The Extase mascara features a ‚ÄúTiered Brush‚Äù that is inspired by the ‚Äútiered‚Äù couture dresses created by the House of Dior. The brush is designed for performance and contains an Exclusive Duo of Fibers: The Black Elastomer Fibers brush out and define the lashes for panoramic fringe and the Gold Nylon Fibers hold and deposit formula, generously coating each lash for outstanding volume. Whenever I review a mascara, I look to see what exactly the mascara is claiming to do, because I find that like some anti-aging products, mascara is a product type that is often more marketing than results. Extase is designed to volumize and thicken lashes while defining them. Extase delivers length best ‚Äî it‚Äôs exceptionally good at providing you with instantly longer lashes, even with just one light coat of the mascara. That‚Äôs really the part that I noticed first. It adds some volume, but I wouldn‚Äôt label this a volumizing mascara. My lashes really looked longer, but not so feathery (as my lashes tend to look with a more volumizing mascara). As far as thickening goes, it thickens well for a such a multi-tasking mascara. I think what stands out about this mascara is the lengthening aspect of it; everything else is decent, but it‚Äôs hard to separate the volume, thickness, etc. from the dramatic increase in length. The color of the mascara is definitely a deep black; I‚Äôd say Chanel Exceptionnel and MAC Plushlash are slightly richer, but they‚Äôre all in the same ballpark. I don‚Äôt have any issues with the pigmentation‚Äìit‚Äôs black enough for me. It does a good job of defining lashes, but to a point, because the mascara will clump up on you if you‚Äôre not careful. The brush often has excess mascara on it, so removing excess certainly helps, and you can get a good two or three coats of mascara with very minimal clumping. I always recommend using a mascara comb regardless of the mascara you‚Äôre using, just because it helps separate and define lashes. I wouldn‚Äôt say this is perfectly clump-free, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a relatively clump-free mascara. If you like to get multiple coats on, just follow my aforementioned tips for a better application. I‚Äôve been wearing Extase for over a week now, so you can see it used in a variety of looks here in addition to the comparison photos included in the review. The original DiorShow gave me good length, some thickening and volumizing, and looked good overall, but it flaked and smudged on me within an hour, so it was a no-go. I am so pleased to report that Extase doesn‚Äôt flake, budge, or smudge at all, even with twelve hours of wear. It also holds a curl like nobody‚Äôs business! The brush has a sort of ‚Äúswirled‚Äù look to it, and even though they mentioned black and gold fibers, it all looked black to me, so it was difficult to assess that particular aspect of it. The brush didn‚Äôt seem too large, though it felt a little long. It takes an application or two to find the right method for application, but it didn‚Äôt require much thought or effort to get good results. OVERALL , I did enjoy the way Dior DiorShow Extase made my lashes look. It‚Äôs particularly lovely for lengthening lashes, even the stubbier ones I have on the outer lash line, and does a decent job everywhere else to make it one of the better multi-tasking mascaras I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs very comparable to Chanel Exceptionnel but clumps less (but doesn‚Äôt thicken as well). Extase is also priced higher than Dior‚Äôs other mascaras at $28, so it‚Äôs not the most affordable mascara you‚Äôll come across. Just for reference, DiorShow is $24 and DiorShow Iconic is $27.

It includes two ‚Äúluggage‚Äù tags that slide open and reveal lipgloss inside, available in Coral and Pink for $60, two Eyeshadow Quints in Ready-to-Glow (649) and Crush Glow (659) for $58, Golden Spotlight Extreme Eyeshadow for $28, Rose Trendsetter (574) High Shine Lipgloss for $28, Crystal Gloss (001) for $26.50, and Nude Glow , a Bergdorf Goodman‚Äôs exclusive, for $46. While Ready-to-Glow looks like a slightly cooler variation of Crush Glow, Crush Glow is fabulously warm. This is excellent news for those warm-toned beauties, but cooler skin tones may want to swatch in person before deciding. I personally think that cooler skin tones can still wear this palette, and I‚Äôd recommend pairing the eyeshadows with a cooler cheek and/or lip to bring everything together. There are five shades in the Crush Glow palette: a peachy-gold with a frosty finish; lightly iced pink with champagne shimmer; muted mostly pink coral with a low frost finish; plummy-mauve with brown with a light frost finish; and ambered bronze with more of a pearly sheen than frost finish. All five shades were well-pigmented, smooth to the touch, and easy to use. I don‚Äôt always have good luck with Dior‚Äôs Quints, but Crush Glow is definitely a palette that appeals to me, on a personal level (I am a fiend for golds and coppers!). It‚Äôs a fitting color palette for summer, because it‚Äôs warm and shimmering. I love that all five shades coordinate really well with each other. Sometimes you find palettes that look lovely and swatch beautifully, but you‚Äôre not always sure how you‚Äôll make them work together. It‚Äôs a very travel-friendly palette, because you can create easy daytime looks or smoke it up with the plummy or bronzy shades in the palette for a more sultry evening look. I think this is one of Dior‚Äôs better palettes in the past few years that I‚Äôve followed the brand. The eyeshadows are high-quality with good color pay off, a smooth, buttery texture, and they work exceptionally well together. This is a palette you can take with you on your summer travels or enjoy at home. Though the official details indicated April 2010 as a release date, I already saw the ‚Äúluggage tags‚Äù available on Nordstrom.com ‚Äî so I think it‚Äôs safe to say we‚Äôll be seeing Dior‚Äôs summer collection launch in full quite soon! If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 29/30 Value : 8/10 Ease of Use : 5/5 Packaging : 4/5 Recommendation : All five shades do have a shimmery appearance, so those who prefer a mix of shimmers and mattes may find themselves wanting with this palette. If you say ‚ÄúNo thanks!‚Äù to shimmer typically, I don‚Äôt see this palette changing your mind. On the other hand, if you say ‚ÄúYes, please!‚Äù to shimmer and are looking to add some warmer toned eyeshadows to your collection, this is a nice palette to own.

The two other shades that will be available are Rose Tint and Gold Tint. The new Meteorites are designed to enhance/correct certain issues with skin. From the press release, ‚Äú[ A] rosy complexion tends to show redness, while a beige complexion turns grey with the onset of fatigue and a golden complexion becomes yellow and dull. As the uncontested expert in color and powder, Guerlain has created three different M√©t√©orites Perles color harmonies to address the ways that different skin tones reflect color and light, in line with the principles of the color wheel and interaction of secondary colors. Which one is for you? Harmony 01 / Teint Rose (Rose Tint) corrects by using mauve to reflect light and brightening the complexion along with green to reduce redness; pink to give skin a more even look; and white for illumination, gold for ‚Äúradiance.‚Äù I think this is suitable for those with cooler undertones, rosacea, or uneven or reddened skin. Harmony 02 / Teint Beige (Beige Tint) corrects with mauve and pink to keep skin from looking dull; beige and apricot beige to add warmth; and white and white gold to reflect light. I think this is suitable for most skin tones, though warmer skin tones may find this more beneficial than those with particularly cool undertones; also good for those with more neutral or beige undertones. Harmony 03 / Teint Dore (Gold Tint) corrects with mauve and blue to eliminate yellowness amongst a golden tone; beige and chocolate beige enhance golden tones; and white gold reflects light while pearly apricot brightens. I think this is suitable for those with yellow, golden, or olive undertones to bring out the natural warmth in the complexion. Keep in mind that Meteorites are not an opaque powder in the least bit! Just like traditional Meteorites, the ones from Meteorites Perles have the same feel and texture. I‚Äôve only tried Beige Tint in person thus far, which is a good thing, considering it‚Äôs the one that matches me best. I think I could also work with the Gold Tint as well, but it may be more of a definite highlighter than all over powder. We shall have to wait and see on that aspect! Beige Tint contains several different colored spheres ranging from champagne-peach, peach-apricot, shimmering white, pinky-apricot, darkened apricot, and lilac. On skin, it has a champagne-lilac illuminating base with sparkles of gold and champagne. It‚Äôs a soft, fine-milled shimmer/illuminating powder that looks subtle against skin, even when used all-over. If you do choose to use it as an all-over face powder, using a fluffier or stippling brush ensures you don‚Äôt overdo it. Otherwise, it can be used as a light highlighter wherever you want to reflect light (usually cheekbones, Cupid‚Äôs bow, etc.). The Meteorites Perles Meteorites are packaged in a ‚Äúmetal‚Äù container. I think it‚Äôs more of a harder, metal-like plastic than pure metal (it just doesn‚Äôt have the weight of metal), but it‚Äôs certainly an upgrade from some of the cardboard-esque packaging they‚Äôve used in the past. Though I don‚Äôt mind myself, since it‚Äôs still pretty, more eco-friendly than plastic, and I don‚Äôt carry my makeup around very often, except when I travel (then I bring the whole bathroom‚Ä¶ and the bathroom sink!). It‚Äôs sleek, classy, and elegant‚ÄìI love it. The very idea of running out of one of the Meteorites is not something I can fathom, because it takes so little to get what you want out of it as a highlighter/illuminator. I think one will last you quite awhile (aka years), but it does carry a steeper price tag than other high-end highlighters‚Äìthough in line with Guerlain‚Äôs pricing point overall.

For those with cooler or pinker undertones, consider Rose Tint; and for those with more golden and yellow undertones, consider Gold Tint.

It includes a softly teal-shimmered muted sky blue and a rich, blackened forest green with gold and green shimmer. At first, I thought that the bluish side was like Benefit‚Äôs Mermaid Eyeshadow , but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs more like a blue version, if anything, but after looking at both, they‚Äôre definitely not similar. The forest green shade originally reminded me of NARS Night Porter , but the finish is softer and smoother and it‚Äôs a shimmer/sheen rather than a glitter finish. The texture of Dolce &amp; Gabbana eyeshadows is amazing. It‚Äôs soft, smooth, and buttery. I love that Dolce &amp; Gabbana puts out colors amongst more muted shades, too, because I think it gives them more variety. But even better is that their colors actually show-up true-to-pan! Surprisingly, Dolce &amp; Gabbana is cheaper by the ounce than NARS Eyeshadow Duos‚Äì$211/oz. vs. $228/oz. (and not so surprisingly, cheaper than NARS, Make Up For Ever, and MAC singles), but you do get the luxe, ‚Äúgold‚Äù metal casing for your buck, too (but it does hold fingerprints as is typical with metal packaging).

For each award, the winning brand/product gets a brief description of why, and where appropriate, a link to any in-depth review. These awards are given out by me based on my personal experience with the products. Readers‚Äô Choice Awards are completely separate üôÇ I would LOVE to hear what you think about my picks ‚Äî any of these your favorites, too? The very opposite of your favorite? Tell me in the comments! Part 2 focuses on my favorite products to use on the eyes ‚Äî from eyeshadow to eyeliner to mascara. These were not restricted to new products in 2009; any brand, any product, from any time can win. Best Pencil Eyeliner (High-end) : Urban Decay 24/7 Eyeliner Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil ($17.00) are soft, smooth, and come in a variety of colors. They‚Äôre vibrant with rich pigmentation, and they glide on so smoothly. I love how long-wearing they are on my lower lash line. The color range and the softness of the pencil itself really make this one a huge winner in my book. You can read my full review here . Best Pencil Eyeliner (Budget) : L‚ÄôOreal HiP Chrome Eyeliner L‚ÄôOreal HiP Color Chrome Eyeliner ($10.00) are some of the richest eyeliners I‚Äôve tried. Black Shock is easily one of the deepest blacks I‚Äôve come across in a pencil form. I love the metallic finish of these, and I find them to be very much like Urban Decay‚Äôs 24/7 Liners. I do hope to see more of these from L‚ÄôOreal HiP in the upcoming year. You can read my full review here . Best Gel Eyeliner (High-end) : MAC Fluidline MAC Fluidline ($15.00) is an excellent gel eyeliner that is easy to work with, doesn‚Äôt budge or smudge throughout the day, and has a decent color selection. (They used to have more, and MAC used to regularly release limited edition shades, but it‚Äôs been a minute since that‚Äôs happened.) I just find Fluidline to be the best of both worlds ‚Äî smooth and creamy without being too wet nor too dry that it creates drag. Best Gel Eyeliner (Budget) : Sonia Kashuk Gel Eyeliner Sonia Kashuk Dramatically Defining Long-wear Gel Eyeliner ($8.99) are a great budget-friendly alternative for grabbing yourself a gel eyeliner. They‚Äôre creamy, long-lasting, and easy to use. The only downside is that there are only three shades available (a vibrant blue, cocoa brown, and black). You can read my full review here . Best Liquid Eyeliner (High-end) : MAC Penultimate MAC Penultimate Eye Liner ($16.50) is an easy-use liquid liner in a felt-tip pen delivery system. The pointed felt tip edge really helps to make it easier to use, stabilize, and get a rich, even line across the upper lash line. You can read my full review here and see me use it in a look here . Best Liquid Eyeliner (Budget) : Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild MegaLiner Liquid Liner Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild MegaLiner Liquid Eyeliner ($2.99) are easily some of the better liquid liners on the market, but they‚Äôre also ridiculously affordable. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to try your hand at liquid liner, I totally recommend grabbing a few MegaLiners to play with. The Turquoise shade has always been one of my favorites! Check out the Best &amp; Worst Mascaras, Best Eyeshadows, False Eyelashes, Bases, and Palettes! Best Mascara (High-end) : Chanel Exceptionnel Chanel Exceptionnel Mascara ($30.00) gives me long, dramatic lashes that are thick, full, and oh-so-black. It‚Äôs as close as I‚Äôve gotten to my dream mascara! I love how black my lashes look, and the length it gives me is incredible. But not only does it give me dramatic length, it thickens, too ‚Äî I often find a mascara can lengthen, but not thicken or vice versa. Rarely do you get both done well in a single mascara! If $30 is a bit steep for you, my second favorite is still MAC Plushlash, which yields similar results, though just slightly less dramatic results ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also half the price. You can read my full review here . Best Mascara (Budget) : Maybelline Full ‚Äòn Soft Maybelline Full ‚ÄòN Soft Mascara ($6.59) has been a long-time favorite for me. It gives me lush looking lashes without effort. It has a nice black pigmentation (Very Black is my favorite shade) while being a very, very clump-free formula‚Äìeven when you pile it on as I often do. You can see me wearing it here . Worst Mascara (High-end) : Dior DiorShow Dior DiorShow Mascara ($24.00) was just one of those very anticipated, much-loved-by-everyone-else products I was hoping to fall in love with, but couldn‚Äôt because it smudged and flaked horribly. Even though I felt like I saw good results (nice length, some thickening, decent volume), having black flakes and smudges after an hour just isn‚Äôt very sexy. I don‚Äôt have many mascaras that flake on me, but this one was one of the worst. Worst Mascara (Budget) : Maybelline Great Lash Maybelline Great Lash Mascara ($4.99) is a really poor performing mascara. It might even be one of the worst mascaras I‚Äôve ever used. It‚Äôs alsoa huge let-down, because it consistently wins awards in magazines and yet it really is nothing to write home about. (Well, no, you may write home to tell your best pal never to waste her $5 on it!) It doesn‚Äôt do much to lashes, and I found it a particularly dry and clump formula overall. Best False Eyelashes (High-end) : shu uemura shu uemura False Eyelashes has a wide variety in false eyelashes; from the eccentric to the avant garde to the natural. They‚Äôre beautiful, soft, and really well-designed. Some of the more wearable/everyday kind of lashes are more affordable than the couture lashes. Best False Eyelashes (Budget) : Revlon Revlon Fantasy Lengths Eyelashes ($4.00) are affordable false eyelashes that get the job done. I like that every pair you purchase comes with either a self-adhesive strip or a mini tube of glue (which will give you more glue than you need). Best Eyeshadow Base (High-end) : MAC Paint Pots MAC Paint Pot ($16.50) is an excellent product to layer underneath your eyeshadows to give you bolder, truer color that lasts all day without fading or creasing. (Of course, as with all beauty products, your mileage may vary!) I know some prefer to use a combination of Urban Decay‚Äôs Primer Potion and MAC Paint Pots, but I just need to lay down a Paint Pot, and I‚Äôm good to go. My favorite is Soft Ochre, because it has a matte finish, so it can be incredibly versatile. If you‚Äôre cooler-toned, I recommend Painterly for the same reason; I‚Äôve just found that Soft Ochre works better on warm skin tones while Painterly works better on cool skin tones. Best Eyeshadow Base (Budget) : NYX Eyeshadow Base NYX Eyeshadow Base ($6.00) is a short and sweet product in three different shades (White, Pearl, and Skin Tone). I find Pearl is nice under more shimmery shades, but Skin Tone is good in a variety of situations, so it‚Äôs more versatile. It does a good job of extending the wear of your eyeshadow and giving you a base for the color to grab onto and look true to form. Best Eyeshadow (High-end) : MAC Eyeshadow MAC Eye Shadow ($14.50) is an amazing product at the end of the day. MAC has a huge range of well-pigmented, easy-to-use shades in their permanent line-up, and I think the permanent range is often overlooked with the sheer amount of limited edition shades MAC releases on a yearly basis. Even if you‚Äôve been a little disappointed in the quality of limited edition shades, you‚Äôre really missing out if you don‚Äôt check out their permanent line of shades. No matter what brand I try, I always come back to my MAC eyeshadows. They‚Äôre just so easy to use, come in so many different shades and textures, it‚Äôs hard to stay away for long. I also love that you can use palettes or pots, depending on your preference. Best Eyeshadow (Budget) : Sonia Kashuk Eyeshadow Sonia Kashuk Eyeshadow ($6.99 to $14.99) is a brand that I find incredibly reliable. Reliability in beauty is actually a really good thing, because there‚Äôs a consistency of quality across the brand that makes it easier to try new shades or products without fear of disappointment. Sonia Kashuk has pigmented bright colors, but there are also some lovely neutrals in the range as well. Best Cream Eyeshadow (High-end) : Benefit Creaseless Cream Eyeshadow Benefit Cosmetics Creaseless Cream Shadow/Liner ($19.00) are creamy, smooth eyeshadows that can be used as a base, liner, or worn alone or mixed together. I absolutely love the shade range‚Äìthere are lots of shades that are perfect for everyday, but then there are a few ‚Äúfun‚Äù shades, too. The packaging is cute and functional, and the product itself is amazing. You can read my full review here . Best Cream Eyeshadow (Budget) : Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild MegaEyes Cream Eyeshadow Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild MegaEyes Cream Eyeshadow is a quick-drying cream shadow that stays in place once you‚Äôve applied it. It appears to have been discontinued this year, unfortunately. I was originally going to give out the award to another product, but I just didn‚Äôt feel like there was another one that rivaled this. I hope Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild brings it back or calls it something else but is virtually the same product. Best Eyeshadow Palette (High-end) : Urban Decay Eyeshadow Palettes Urban Decay Eyeshadow Palettes are some of the best around. They always have a good selection of shades and the quality is consistent across the board. You may find one or two out of ten or twelve shadows isn‚Äôt your favorite, but the majority are soft, buttery eyeshadows with rich pigmentation. Best Eyeshadow Palette (Budget) : NYX Eyeshadow Palettes NYX Color Palettes ($9.00) are surprisingly well pigmented for such an affordable palette. They have both five and ten-color palettes, and the quality is decent in them. Sometimes you get a few chalkier shades, but they‚Äôre some of the best I‚Äôve seen at such a low price point. Best Eyelash Curler (High-end) : shu uemura Eyelash Curler shu uemura Eyelash Curler ($19.00) is easily my favorite curler, and it has been since I first had it. I used to have a Revlon one, and I didn‚Äôt even realize that an eyelash curler could really have levels of quality. Shu‚Äôs is easy to use, works well, and it lasts awhile. The only thing I wish they did was sell replacement curling pads, since it would be more cost-effective (for us!) and more environmentally-friendly (for everyone!). I know shu recommends replacing the entire curler after about two years or so (because the springs weaken, supposedly), but I‚Äôve had mine for longer and couldn‚Äôt tell you I‚Äôve noticed a thing! Best Eyelash Curler (Budget) : e.l.f. Mechanical Eyelash Curler e.l.f. professional Mechanical Eyelash Curler ($1.49) also gets the job done, no matter how tight your budget. (Seriously, $1.49!) It‚Äôs handy, easy-to-use, and gives lashes a nice curl. It‚Äôs not quite as comfortable use as shu‚Äôs, but you‚Äôre not using it for long, anyway.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2009-12-29 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>2bb0f9d83a23445156689cf31a1313a556ba0b5b</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Look Book ‚Äì What would you pair with Make Up For Ever #93 Eyeshadow?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/look-book-what-would-you-pair-with-make-up-for-ever-93-eyeshadow/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Look Book ‚Äì What would you pair with Make Up For Ever #93 Eyeshadow?

Guerlain has built a color collection that revolves around these ever so famous Pearls with a Purpose, with soft, delicate shades and a twist of audacity. Two limited edition items, specially designed for the collection have been added to capture this summer-time celebration of absolute radiance. Ombre Eclat ‚Äî Eyeshadow Quad ($59.00) Ombre Perlees This monochrome palette features four shades of natural hues with a subtle touch of iridescence for a soft, pearly effect. With tones ranging from soft beige and satiny pink to taupe and smoky brown, these eye shadows glide over and blend beautifully onto the skin, adding a velvety soft luminosity to the eyes. A white rosette, the symbol of the M√©t√©orites, is stamped on the palette and can be used as a fifth light-enhancing shade. KissKiss Baby ($31.00) Cherry Summer Cherry pink Coral Sunset Coral Ombre Eclat ‚Äî Eyeshadow L‚ÄôInstant d‚ÄôUn Baiser Pearly pink L‚ÄôInstant d‚ÄôUne Caresse Smoky beige L‚ÄôInstant d‚ÄôUn Reve Smoky brown L‚ÄôInstant d‚ÄôUne Emotion Pearly verdigris Guerlain Meteorites Pearls Collection for Summer 2010 Meteorites Perles ($56.00) Guerlain‚Äôs M√©t√©orites Perles may be the best-kept manufacturing secret ever ‚Äì with no imitators ever coming close to replicating the power of these pearls. In 2010, their power is enhanced through new shades and a new formulation specifically adapted to the needs of different skin tones: a rosy complexion tends to show redness, while a beige complexion turns grey with the onset of fatigue and a golden complexion becomes yellow and dull. As the uncontested expert in color and powder, Guerlain has created three different M√©t√©orites Perles color harmonies to address the ways that different skin tones reflect color and light, in line with the principles of the color wheel and interaction of secondary colors. Each colour harmony is comprised of six shades, from three different color families, which were specially chosen to recreate customized radiance: Corrective pastel colors to even out skin tone. Green diminishes the excessive pink hue in fair skin; pink adds a healthy glow to a dull complexion; blue takes the yellow tone out of tired skin; mauve reflects light and adds brightness to shadowed areas in all complexions. ‚ÄúIntelligent‚Äù unifying colors that adapt to each different skin tone. Light-enhancing translucent colors that capture and reflect light, to sculpt the face Harmony 01 ‚Äì Teint ros√© Corrective Effect: mauve reflects light, brightening up the shadowy areas and green diminishes redness. Unifying Effect : pink evens out the complexion and champagne accentuates this action by reflecting light. Light-Enhancing Effect : white, a touch of light par excellence, illuminates the complexion without ever making the skin appear pale and gold adds additional radiance. Harmony 02 ‚Äì Teint beige Corrective Effect: mauve and pink combine to add a healthy glow to a dull complexion. Unifying Effect: unifying beige and apricot beige add a warm glow to the face. Light-Enhancing Effect: white and white gold accentuate the light reflecting result. Harmony 03 ‚Äì Teint dor√© Corrective Effect : eternal mauve and blue eliminate the yellow hue in a golden complexion. Unifying Effect: unifying beige and chocolate beige enhance a golden complexion. Light-Enhancing Effect: white gold reflects light and pearly apricot brightens. M√©t√©orites Brush ($36.00) A formidable ally This brush, which is ideal for applying M√©t√©orites Perles, is now more attractive and even more perfect. Supple and silky soft, it turns powder application into a unique moment of softness. With round and full bristles, this brush is both soft and firm, with the optimal density to make it ideal for ‚Äúcrushing‚Äù the pearls and removing the right amount of powder, thus ensuring that it is never over or under applied.

Previously, we reviewed Teint Beige and Teint Dore . These can be used as highlighters or all over the face‚Äìless for setting, more for an all over glow. Guerlain makes a Meteorites brush, but you can use any blush or highlighting brush to swirl in the pot for application. According to Guerlain‚Ä¶ Harmony 01 / Teint Rose corrects by using mauve to reflect light and brightening the complexion along with green to reduce redness; pink to give skin a more even look; and white for illumination, gold for ‚Äúradiance.‚Äù This particular Meteorite has a blend of champage, white, yellow, green, pink, and purple pearls that create a soft, subtle micro-shimmered glow. It‚Äôs a very silky and finely-milled product‚Äìthis is not powdery, heavy, or cakey. It doesn‚Äôt feel heavy, and it never looks unnatural. Admittedly, it is difficult to see the nuances between the three Meteorites. Even in person, they don‚Äôt look terribly different on me when applied. Teint Rose is less golden, more white/champagne shimmer, while Teint Dore is a little more golden-bronze, and Teint Beige is is still a bit bronze but less yellow. After seeing all three in person, I think any one of them would be appropriate across skin tones and undertones. They effect they have is so subtle, I can‚Äôt imagine any looking bad because of skin tone. Still loving the totally upgraded Meteorites packaging, too! If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 28/30 Value : 9/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 5/5 Recommendation : It‚Äôs always nice to see a brand maintain or improve a product, particularly when they‚Äôre changing such a cult favorite! If you already have the previous versions of Meteorites, you may find this shade redundant, but if you don‚Äôt yet have Meteorites in your stash, you should take a gander next time you‚Äôre at a Guerlain counter.

Because it is much easier to coordinate with just one person (myself!) than it is with thousands, I do have more categories than the Readers‚Äô Choice Awards does. ( Can you just imagine having to nominate products for 40+ categories? Exactly! ) I also breakdown each award into best high-end winner and budget-friendly winner. For each award, the winning brand/product gets a brief description of why, and where appropriate, a link to any in-depth review. Part 1 focuses on some of the biggest awards I give out each year ‚Äî they‚Äôre the best of the best, creme de la creme ‚Äî these products are some of the absolute best released in 2009. Best Brand of the Year (High-end) : Guerlain Guerlain won me over this year with their beautiful limited edition collections along with their permanent range. I always find ‚ÄúBest Brand‚Äù to be an extremely difficult category to choose a winner for, but I felt like taking my experience with the brand throughout the year was the best way to go about figuring it out. Between the ultra luxe and lovely Rouge Gs to their silky soft blushes to the cult-favorite Meteorites, Guerlain just impressed me. Many of my latest and greatest holy grail products are by Guerlain (Gems Rouge G lipstick and Parure Gold Foundation, just to name two). You can read all of our Guerlain coverage here . Best Brand of the Year (Budget): Maybelline Maybelline showed me why they‚Äôre a worthwhile, budget-friendly brand this year. They‚Äôre incredibly reliable, and I just don‚Äôt run into too many products within the line that are just devastating. They make one of my favorite drugstore mascaras (Full ‚Äòn Soft), as well as an excellent line of affordable lipstick and lipgloss (Color Sensational). You can read all of our Maybelline coverage here . Find out who won Best New Product, Most Surprisingly Amazing Product, Most Disappointing Product, Best Seasonal Collections, and the Best and Worst of MAC! Best New Product of 2009 (High-end): Chanel Rouge Allure Laque Chanel Rouge Allure Laque ($36.00) took it home this year. Seriously, did you think I‚Äôd be picking anything else? I‚Äôm pretty sure the majority of you had this one pegged. They‚Äôre like liquid lipstick, except completely made out of awesomeness. They‚Äôre creamy and moisturizing while they still cling to lips. I‚Äôll tell you right now that Dragon is my favorite shade out of the bunch with Santal close behind. I recommend that everyone, at the very least (!), visit their local Chanel counter just to try it out. You can read my full reviews on all the Rouge Allure Laque shades here . Best New Product of 2009 (Budget): L‚ÄôOreal HIP Chrome Eyeliner L‚ÄôOreal HiP Color Chrome Eyeliner ($10.00) are ultra metallic, totally chrome-d out eyeliners. It‚Äôs available in four shades (at least right now; readers mentioned there have been other shades previously released). They hold up quite well on my lower lash line, and they really knocked my socks off. They‚Äôre fun, easy to use, and so, so soft. They reminded me a lot of Urban Decay‚Äôs 24/7 Liners, except with a wicked metallic finish. I‚Äôm wearing them here , and you can read my full review here . Most Surprisingly Amazing Product of 2009 (High-end): Stila All Doll‚Äôd Up Palette Stila for Barbie All Doll‚Äôd Up Palette ($28.00) took me by complete surprise when it released during the fall of 2009. I was absolutely not expecting to fall in love with it or even be particularly impressed. I just figured it‚Äôd be decent to good, but instead, it was absolutely excellent. From the price to the quality of the products inside, this palette was exceptionally well-done. You can see me wearing it here and here , plus read my full review here . Most Surprisingly Amazing Product of 2009 (Budget): Aveeno Positively Ageless Warming Scrub Aveeno Positively Ageless Warming Scrub ($9.29) is a fun, warming scrub that gets the job done with no frills, just results. Even though I‚Äôve always enjoyed Aveeno products, I don‚Äôt always turn to them for my day-to-day regimen. Their Warming Scrub is something I keep in my shower and use once or twice a week. It‚Äôs a nice, gentle facial scrub that warms up when it comes into contact with water. You can read my full review here . Most Disappointing Product of 2009 (High-end): Chanel Les Folies Noir Eyeshadow Quad Chanel Les Folies Noir Eyeshadow Quad ($60.00) was beyond disappointing ‚Äî it was devastating (as far as one can be truly devastated by a beauty product‚Äìlet‚Äôs not get too carried away). The Noirs Obscurs Collection just seemed so dark, dramatic, and intense, but the eyeshadows were poorly pigmented, not nearly as soft as Chanel often is, and the colors looked chalky and uneven. You can read my full review here . Most Disappointing Product of 2009 (Budget): L‚ÄôOreal Extra Volume Collagen Mascara L‚ÄôOreal Extra Volume Collagen Mascara ($7.95) was a mascara I really looked forward to trying, because L‚ÄôOreal‚Äôs Voluminous performed so well in the past. Unfortunately, upon trying it, it was just not a great mascara. It did everything poorly (although it lengthened well); clumped quickly, dried too fast (which contributed to the clumping problem), and just didn‚Äôt add enough length or thickness to make this a go-to mascara. You can read my full review here . Best Spring 2009 Collection : Guerlain Exotic Paradise Collection Guerlain Exotic Paradise Collection was my favorite spring collections, because it was fun, perfect for spring, and the quality of the products released was high. I will say that I wasn‚Äôt over the moon for any spring collections, but this was the best of what was released. (It was good, don‚Äôt get me wrong!) The eyeshadow quad was definitely a favorite for me, but the glosses were pretty fun, too ‚Äî who doesn‚Äôt want to pull out a green gloss (that‚Äôs wearable)? Best Summer 2009 Collection : Dior Cristal Collection Dior Cristal Collection was particularly memorable for its Electric Lights Quint (lots of blues with a standout royal purple) and the Pop Diamond Skin Shimmer (I am a fiend for those!). I felt like there was a coherent theme within the launch, and I really liked how you could wear the new products together‚Äìthey coordinated in a way that isn‚Äôt always apparent with other collections. Best Fall 2009 Collection : Bobbi Brown Ivy League Collection Bobbi Brown Ivy League Collection was a very basic launch, but it released products that worked really well. The new Creamy Eye Pencil was creamy, soft, and had some great shades (Caviar and Hunter). Though the Lip Crayons weren‚Äôt as memorable, Forest Long-Wear Gel Eyeliner and Bash Metallic Eyeshadow were enough to get me on board with Bobbi during the fall. (Though I must also say she knocked it out of the park with her Chrome eyeshadows for holiday!) Best Holiday 2009 Collection : Guerlain Imperiale Collection Guerlain‚Äôs Imperiale Collection was the right mix of easy-to-wear shades and fun, sparkling finishes. It was beautifully packaged and everything worked together. I might even say that Imperiale was not just my favorite holiday launch, but my favorite launch of the year‚Äìit was that good. Lovely lipsticks, silky eyeshadows, and gorgeous highlighters! Best MAC Collection of 2009 : Makeup Art Cosmetics Makeup Art Cosmetics was my favorite launch by MAC this year, but I will admit that I had a tough time deciding‚Äìand it wasn‚Äôt so much because there were so many standout collections to choose from. There were several contenders on my radar: Blonde, Brunette, Redhead, Naked Honey, Sugarsweet, and Makeup Art Cosmetics. I ended up going with Makeup Art Cosmetics, because I feel like it hit the mark the best out of the ones I was considering. It had a good mix of quality and shade range. I think the last two collections I really loved by MAC were in summer of ‚Äô08 ‚Äî Neo Sci Fi and Cool Heat. Worst MAC Collection of 2009 : In High Def In High Def felt like a holdover collection, rather than answering the call of consumers for HD products. I know that this was MAC‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôve had HD-ready products in our line forever , so we‚Äôre just going to make it easy for you by putting them together in a ‚Äòcollection,'‚Äù but it was just boring in the end.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2009-12-29 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>d28c514ea478b1716e9c8be3ab9d51c2334ca1cb</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>This Week‚Äôs Beauty Report: Saturday, March 27th, 2010</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/this-weeks-beauty-report-saturday-march-27th-2010/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>This Week‚Äôs Beauty Report: Saturday, March 27th, 2010 Features Mar 27, 2010 March 27, 2010 This Week‚Äôs Beauty Report: Saturday, March 27th, 2010 Did anyone else notice an explosion of Nordstrom Beauty Exclusives ?

Meteorites are something of a phenomena, but they are beautiful highlighters that just add glow and warmth to the skin without going overboard with glitter or heavy shimmer. I find the shimmer imparted by Meteorites to be part glow, part shimmer, because it‚Äôs subtle but still noticeable. It‚Äôs light enough to be able to dusted on the face, but it also works beautifully on the top of the cheekbones. The new Meteorites come in much-improved packaging, too. Gone is the cardboard! Instead, it‚Äôs this metal-like plastic (I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs real metal based on touching and holding it), but it has the metallic sheen of metal. I like that both the lid and the cylinder itself have detailing that is definitely a signature of higher end brands like Guerlain, so it‚Äôs just nice to see it fully translated into the Meteorites range. I‚Äôm also happy that Meteorites still pack quite a punch in quantity‚Äìa full ounce or thirty grams of satin-y, shimmering pearls. Teint Dore is a mixture of champagne, chocolate, and golden pearls. Together, they create a very soft golden sheen with just a touch of bronze that‚Äôs just really barely there. It‚Äôs almost like a bronze undertone. I think this is easily worn by all skin tones, because it‚Äôs not overly warm. It will warm up any complexion a smidgen, and I think it would be beautiful on both pale and darker skin tones as well. I‚Äôd recommend trying this over a coral blush or bronzer!

If you already have the previous versions of Meteorites, you may find this shade redundant, but if you don‚Äôt yet have Meteorites in your stash, you should take a gander next time you‚Äôre at a Guerlain counter.

MAC Water-Based Mixing Medium ($18.00 for 50ml) is an absolute must-have if you work with MAC Pigments or Glitters. It actually took me many years before I purchased the real deal Mixing Medium‚Äìpreviously, I had always done the DIY version. (For reference, the DIY version is one part glycerin and three parts water, mix, and enjoy!) To be honest, I think either version works just as well, but I know the official Mixing Medium is designed to have a much longer shelf life than the DIY version (since it lacks any preservatives). This Mixing Medium is water-based, and as such, the texture feels just like water. I like that, because it doesn‚Äôt feel thick, goopy, or sticky. The way I use my Mixing Medium is primarily with pigments and occasionally with glitters. I usually put one drop (it dispenses by droplets) on a flat brush like the 239 or 249, pick up some pigment, and then apply on the lid (or wherever). Together, it creates an excellent eyeshadow base, but it also intensifies pigments and keeps them together‚Äìthere‚Äôs no fallout here! Though I haven‚Äôt used it for such things, you can also use this with other MAC liquid or powder products. I will also say that one bottle will last me a lifetime (though I will obviously replace it before then!). There is also an alcohol-based Mixing Medium (used from the neck down), an eyeliner Mixing Medium (comes in a tube), lash Mixing Medium (allows you to create customized shades of Pro Long Lash Mascara), and gel-based Mixing Medium (not to be used around the eye area). It is a PRO product, which means it was originally designed to be used by makeup artists and not necessarily consumers, but everyone is able to purchase PRO products, regardless of your resume. If you live near a PRO store locally, you just have to show up and shop like you would any other MAC location. If you don‚Äôt, I know in the U.S., you can place a phone order with any PRO store and they‚Äôll ship you your items for a flat rate of $7 (this is usually how I get any PRO products). Since shipping is a flat rate, I usually make up a good list of PRO-only items I want so I can make it worth it, too üôÇ By the by‚Ä¶ some PRO stores will have collections in a week early, and so if SF, LA, or SCP PRO have it out, sometimes I place a phone order and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôll get the products a couple of days earlier than the national launch date. Secrets from a MAC addict‚Ä¶ LOL!

I am not sure if it was the base I chose to use (Soft Ochre paint pot), or the shadows themselves. All I know is that the resulting look looked messy, uneven, and all kinds of awful, LOL. I mean, if I can see obvious problems in a regular mirror, then I know they will show many times more in photos!

On me, it really enhances the natural rosiness of my lips and takes it to the next level. It‚Äôs definitely a my-lips-but-better (MLBB) shade, but it‚Äôs easy to wear, feels great, and looks very natural for those days when you need a toned-down lip. The lipstick itself has no scent or taste, which is great for those with more sensitive senses. Is this the right pink lipstick for you? Would you wear it?

Argh! I always do this ‚Äî have mascara on for some other purpose, decide to do a look, but don‚Äôt want to waste time (aka being lazy) removing mascara and then waiting for the area to dry (don‚Äôt want to apply eyeshadow base on top of remover‚Ä¶ counterproductive!)‚Ä¶ and then the mascara looks all clumpy and yuck at the end. No more being lazy! I did upper lash liner because I know some will be disappointed otherwise if they saw this look sans the liner. I was just playing around with the combo last night anyway, so removing it after ten minutes wasn‚Äôt going to break my heart so it worked out üôÇ Well, except for the minor swelling this AM, lol! You can easily pair this look with a toned down coral, pink, or even nude lip. I went for the gusto and used Gimme That! but it‚Äôs not necessary. You will need the following‚Ä¶ Eyes : NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base (neutral eyeshadow base), MAC Going Bananas Eyeshadow (light yellow), MAC Free to Be Eyeshadow (pinky coral), MAC Louder, Please Eyeshadow (pinky red), Burberry Trench Eyeshadow (highlighter), Urban Decay Zero 24/7 Liner (black), MAC Blacktrack Fluidline (black), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Make Up For Ever HD Foundation (140), Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder (translucent) Cheeks : Korres #15 Natural Blush (neutral brown), theBalm Mary Lou-manizer (highlighter) Lips : MAC Gimme That!

Using the 239, apply Going Bananas eyeshadow on the lower half of the lid. Lightly blend Free to Be eyeshadow on the middle of the lid, horizontally, with the 239. Apply Louder, Please eyeshadow on the outer half of the crease with the 239 and lightly blend upwards. Blend Trench eyeshadow with the crease shade and highlight the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Zero liner on the lower lash line and Blacktrack fluidline on the upper lash line with the 208. Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . Add false lashes if desired. For cheeks, apply #15 Natural blush on the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116, then lightly pat Mary Lou-manizer on the cheekbones. For lips, apply Gimme That! lipglass for a complementing lip. Check out more photos!

It looked pretty in the pan, but unfortunately looks rather chalky when swatched, and it took some effort to get a decent level of pigmentation. Being a black eyeshadow, though, you could easily use this in the crease and not notice any chalkiness‚Äìbut you might think of it as more of a dark gray-black than pure black. This is the only tokidoki eyeshadow I have tried, so please don‚Äôt take this review of this single shade as representative of the whole line! I‚Äôm definitely going to check it out in person or grab another one or two shades online to see if this is just a poor man within an otherwise good range. Hopefully, Temptalia readers have also given these a try, so they can speak up on some other shade‚Äôs behalf! üôÇ I know the lovely Muse reviewed Carnivora, Diamante, and Savana ‚Äî Savana looks way better in terms of pigmentation. The packaging is very tokidoki inspired‚Äìif you dig it, you dig it; if it‚Äôs not your thing, that‚Äôs okay, too. I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôm neutral on the whole thing myself, but I think it‚Äôs done well. It‚Äôs not luxe, ultra high-end packaging, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like something you‚Äôd find in the dollar bin either. I like that each of the eyeshadows has a different colored lid‚Äìit‚Äôs just a nice touch. The price is also just right at $15, because these are actually cheaper than MAC eyeshadows by the ounce‚ÄìMAC eyeshadows are $14.50 each, but you only get 0.05 oz. while the tokidoki eyeshadows are $15 each, but you get 0.07 oz. So right now, though I‚Äôm disappointed in this shade, I am going to keep an eye out for more shades at my local Sephora and see how those hold up for me. I definitely want to check out Bastardino, Bruttino, Ciao Caio, Killer Candy, Savana, Skeletrina, and Soya . Shocker, I‚Äôm sure, that those are all some of the brighter shades available. Shades : Adios Star (glitter black), Bastardino (dark green glitter), Bruttino (blue pearl), Bulletto (brown pearl), Carnivora (beige pearl), Choco (brown pearl), Ciao Ciao (pink pearl), Diamante (glitter pink), Donutella (nude multi-glitter), Killer Candy (purple pearl), Nancy Rocks (lavender pearl), Romeo (plum pearl), Samba (gray pearl), Savana (gold glitter), Skeletrina (indigo pearl), Soya (green pearl).

These officially launch on July 29th, and they are exclusive to Sephora and limited edition. Each shade is designed and created after several of NARS‚Äô best-selling blush shades that go by the same name. I showed you swatches and photos a week or so ago, but now I‚Äôm pleased to be able to give you lip swatches, too! üôÇ NARS Lip Glosses have a thinner texture, and they feel lightweight and don‚Äôt dry out lips. They‚Äôre not ultra hydrating, but they impart some moisture into lips while you wear ‚Äôem. I find them a little tacky but not sticky, but it definitely depends on how much you apply. They‚Äôre scent- and taste-free, and you get a good amount for your $24 (0.28 oz.). Colors are on the sheerer side, like most lip glosses, but they all gave lips a different look than au natural, which is fantastic. Albatross is a semi-sheer champagne beige base with brighter champagne gold shimmer with a glossy sheen. Luxor is a sheer milky pink base with brighter pink shimmer and a glossy sheen. It‚Äôs very similar to Albatross, just pink-toned. Luxor has a bit of an iridescent flash to it, which makes it a step up from your ordinary lip gloss. (This shade is a Nordstrom exclusive!) Super Orgasm is a light pink with golden sparkle. It has a slight milky, jelly kind ofl ook, but it gives some color, though it‚Äôs hot opaque. Luster is a brownish beige with orange-gold shimmer. It‚Äôs semi-sheer, and it‚Äôs one of the shades that didn‚Äôt seem to apply as evenly as I‚Äôd have liked. From a normal viewing distance, you couldn‚Äôt really tell, though. Angelika is a bright pop of blue-based pink with a slight lilac edge. Despite the strong cool undertones, it‚Äôs definitely wearable on warmer skin tones. Oasis is a mauvey pink with golden shimmer and a glossy look. This one was definitely my favorite, because it gave me some color but looked really lovely all on its own. More jelly, less milky, but still plenty glossy.

Using the 239, apply Manila Paper eyeshadow on the inner third of the eyelid. Next, apply Straw Harvest eyeshadow on the middle third of the eyelid and lightly blend with the inner corner. Darken the outer third of the lid with Hot Hot Hot eyeshadow with the 239, gently brushing it into the lower crease. Lightly blend Hot Hot Hot eyeshadow , with the 239, on the outer corner and lid. Lightly tap and brush Straw Harvest eyeshadow directly above the crease to soften. To finish the eyeshadow look, sweep Ricepaper eyeshadow as a highlighter on the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying El Dorado eyeliner on the lower lash line and Zero eyeliner on the lower waterline. Finish by sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara .

The powder itself has a heart and crossbones raised design in the middle, and there‚Äôs no overspray on it, it‚Äôs just the same as the rest of the product‚Äìwhich is nice, just because I hate being duped by those oversprays! Though I was disappointed with the color pay off of Adios Star , I had no such pigmentation issues with Royal Pride. This swatched beautifully‚Äìpigmented, smooth, and gorgeous to look at. As far as bronzing goes, I think this will work nicely on lighter medium skin tones to deeper medium skin tones, but it may turn orange on some of the paler beauties. I‚Äôd recommend paler and very cool skin tones to swatch in-store if they‚Äôre able to. tokidoki also has Diavolina, which is described as a ‚Äúmedium/tan with gold shimmer.‚Äù I felt like Royal Pride was a pretty deep bronzer, but it‚Äôs described as a ‚Äúlight/medium with gold shimmer.‚Äù I think Diavolina may be best for medium deep to deep complexions, but I haven‚Äôt seen it to be sure. The packaging is made out of plastic, but it feels heavy and thick enough that I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm using dollar-store makeup (which is always my fear whenever I see a non-beauty brand enter the beauty biz!). It‚Äôs solid, semi-clear, and should be sturdy enough to tote around. You also get a whopping 0.37 oz. of product, which is rather hefty for a bronzing product. MAC Bronzing Powders are also $22, but you get 0.30 oz. I think tokidoki did a good job pricing themselves above mass, but they didn‚Äôt price themselves out of range, either. I wouldn‚Äôt go crazy buying hundreds of dollars over this without testing it first, but I can see myself picking a few items just to try and see (and if all else fails, take advantage of Sephora‚Äôs excellent return policy).

It‚Äôs quite pigmented, so use a light hand or a fluffier brush when you go to use it to keep from overdoing it!

It looked pretty in the pan, but unfortunately looks rather chalky when swatched, and it took some effort to get a decent level of pigmentation. Being a black eyeshadow, though, you could easily use this in the crease and not notice any chalkiness‚Äìbut you might think of it as more of a dark gray-black than pure black. This is the only tokidoki eyeshadow I have tried, so please don‚Äôt take this review of this single shade as representative of the whole line! I‚Äôm definitely going to check it out in person or grab another one or two shades online to see if this is just a poor man within an otherwise good range. Hopefully, Temptalia readers have also given these a try, so they can speak up on some other shade‚Äôs behalf! üôÇ I know the lovely Muse reviewed Carnivora, Diamante, and Savana ‚Äî Savana looks way better in terms of pigmentation. The packaging is very tokidoki inspired‚Äìif you dig it, you dig it; if it‚Äôs not your thing, that‚Äôs okay, too. I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôm neutral on the whole thing myself, but I think it‚Äôs done well. It‚Äôs not luxe, ultra high-end packaging, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like something you‚Äôd find in the dollar bin either. I like that each of the eyeshadows has a different colored lid‚Äìit‚Äôs just a nice touch. The price is also just right at $15, because these are actually cheaper than MAC eyeshadows by the ounce‚ÄìMAC eyeshadows are $14.50 each, but you only get 0.05 oz. while the tokidoki eyeshadows are $15 each, but you get 0.07 oz. So right now, though I‚Äôm disappointed in this shade, I am going to keep an eye out for more shades at my local Sephora and see how those hold up for me. I definitely want to check out Bastardino, Bruttino, Ciao Caio, Killer Candy, Savana, Skeletrina, and Soya . Shocker, I‚Äôm sure, that those are all some of the brighter shades available. Shades : Adios Star (glitter black), Bastardino (dark green glitter), Bruttino (blue pearl), Bulletto (brown pearl), Carnivora (beige pearl), Choco (brown pearl), Ciao Ciao (pink pearl), Diamante (glitter pink), Donutella (nude multi-glitter), Killer Candy (purple pearl), Nancy Rocks (lavender pearl), Romeo (plum pearl), Samba (gray pearl), Savana (gold glitter), Skeletrina (indigo pearl), Soya (green pearl).

If you want to know more about how products are evaluated, read out Rating System FAQ ! üôÇ Product : 20/30 Value : 9/10 Ease of Use : 4/5 Packaging : 5/5 Recommendation : I would skip this particular shade of the Cromatico Eyeshadow line-up ‚Äî I haven‚Äôt tried any of the others, so I can‚Äôt speak for those!

I have so much to say and so much to share, and I‚Äôm going to let my lips and lipstick do the talking!‚Äù ‚Äî Cyndi Lauper, M¬∑A¬∑C VIVA GLAM Spokesperson ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been familiar with the campaign and have been wearing M¬∑A¬∑C since I was ten years old. To be joining the likes of iconic former VIVA GLAM spokespeople is an honor. My new VIVA GLAM lipstick colour is amazing. It‚Äôs very me ‚Äì a bluish pink, great for everyday, a little bit ‚Äô80s. I hope that women buy this lipstick, and honor themselves and honor the cause.‚Äù ‚Äî Lady Gaga, M¬∑A¬∑C VIVA GLAM Spokesperson Since the very early days of the AIDS epidemic, women have been heroes ‚Äì as advocates, activists, healers, legislators, and program designers. These women have volunteered to join the fight and support people living with the virus, often because they had lost children, parents, friends or lovers to the disease, and because they felt they could make a difference. And they have. In honor of all the women who are living with the virus and those working to curb its spread, the M¬∑A¬∑C AIDS Fund is pleased to announce $2.5 million in new donations to support efforts waged by women and on behalf of women. From Our Lips energizes women and answers the needs of an important, underserved population with HIV and AIDS. From Our Lips focuses on global HIV hot spots like South Africa, the Caribbean and the United States‚Äô rural South and Washington, D.C. It supports programs in regions that are confronting the complicated causes of HIV infection in women and girls: Violence, discrimination and unequal access to financial and social resources. The initiative will encourage donor support and cast a media spotlight on the women who have been powerful heroes: those who help others cope with the illness, and those who are now underdogs in their efforts to fight HIV among themselves. Check out the Lady Gaga &amp; Cyndi Lauper Q&amp;As‚Ä¶ Q&amp;A WITH LADY GAGA You used to sing to Cyndi Lauper as a little girl and now she is a big fan of yours. How does it feel to be working with her on the new M¬∑A¬∑C VIVA GLAM campaign? She has such a beautiful spirit, and the best thing about her is that she‚Äôs a really genuine person. She gave me some pointers at the VIVA GLAM shoot. We have so much in common, and we just really enjoy one another. It‚Äôs surreal. M¬∑A¬∑C VIVA GLAM Lipsticks and Lipglasses have raised over 150 million dollars for the M¬∑A¬∑C AIDS Fund to help people living with HIV/AIDS around the world. How do you feel about this? I‚Äôve been familiar with this campaign since it began, and I‚Äôve always respected M¬∑A¬∑C for what it stands for ‚Äì ALL AGES, ALL RACES, ALL SEXES. This is more than just makeup. Anything I can do to help raise money for HIV/AIDS awareness ‚Äì that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here for, and I‚Äôm very honored to be a part of this. You are very theatrical and creative in your performances and even create your own outfits. How important is makeup to your performance? I‚Äôve been wearing M¬∑A¬∑C since I was 10 years old. I see vanity as a form of identity and lifestyle. M¬∑A¬∑C always has shocking and outrageous VIVA GLAM spokespeople. How does it feel to join the likes of Boy George, Ru Paul, and Lil Kim? To be joining the likes of iconic former VIVA GLAM spokespeople is an honor. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm here. I am truly grateful and excited to do whatever I can for AIDS awareness. You got your start performing on the club scene, which has a largely gay audience, and a part of the population that is very susceptible to HIV/AIDS. How do you think you can send a message to them about HIV/AIDS prevention or education? Considering how rooted I am in the gay community and the deep respect I have for them, research and charity work for this cause is very important to me. By being vocal and raising awareness about HIV/AIDS and being as outspoken as possible on this subject we can raise awareness and protect the health of those we love. But it isn‚Äôt just the gay community. It‚Äôs all communities, and this is an important message to relay to the younger generation. Women account for almost half of the HIV/AIDS cases around the world. You and Cyndi are both strong, vocal women, and the two of you create one very powerful voice. What would you say to young women today about HIV/AIDS? Use protection, and be selective and strong about those you love. Your body is sacred, and it‚Äôs ok to say no. Make your partners get tested, go together: it will only make your relationship stronger and healthier. You and Cyndi have seen two very different stages of the AIDS epidemic and the changes in the public‚Äôs perception of the disease. In the ‚Äô80s people were dying daily and today people with HIV/AIDS are living full lives. As a young person, do you think that today‚Äôs youth feel they are not at risk for the disease? Certainly the public perception is very different now than it was in the ‚Äò80s, because (and this is good news), we have more ways to control the virus today than we did before. However, this is precisely the reason VIVA GLAM is so important: were taking a commercial organization and using its values of strength and identity to raise CURRENT awareness in the EXISTING public sentiments about AIDS. Tell us about your new VIVA GLAM lipstick/lipglass colour? My new VIVA GLAM lipstick colour is amazing. It‚Äôs a bluish pink, great for everyday. It‚Äôs a little bit ‚Äò80s, which is very me. It‚Äôs for the everyday woman ‚Äì anyone can wear it and feel great about themselves and embody what VIVA GLAM is all about. I hope that women buy this lipstick, and honor themselves and honor the cause. Q&amp;A WITH CYNDI LAUPER You are a music icon with fans from all over the world. You are a fan of Lady Gaga‚Äôs, and she is a big fan of yours. How does it feel to be doing a M¬∑A¬∑C VIVA GLAM campaign together? I am really looking forward to it. Lady Gaga is the undisputed breakout star of the year, and I have been cheering for her. She‚Äôs a very cool and different artist. As far as working together on this campaign, we share a passion for fashion and music and performance. And yes, cosmetics. I think we are going to have a blast. HIV/AIDS was ravaging the world in the early ‚Äô80s, a time when you were becoming one of the most important female singers in history. How did AIDS affect you during that time? I lost a lot of dear friends to AIDS before we even knew what it was. People are still dying more than twenty years later, and we have to help find a cure. The M¬∑A¬∑C AIDS Fund has supported numerous GLBT organizations around the world. You have also been a vocal advocate for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender equality and cofounded the True Colors Fund. What motivated you to do this? I‚Äôm not a politician. I am just a mom who happens to have the benefit of being famous and can bring attention to something that is wrong and needs to be righted. I think standing up for one another is something that we all have to do. So that we all count. I want my son to live in a country free of bigotry and hatred. That won‚Äôt be possible until we all have the same rights ‚Äì that one segment of our population isn‚Äôt given less so therefore can be treated as less, ya know? What do you hope to bring to the VIVA GLAM campaign? The VIVA GLAM campaign has always been amazing. I am thrilled to be part of it in 2010. Tell us about your new VIVA GLAM Lipstick/Lipglass colour? A really fabulous red‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs called Cyndi. How cool is that? M¬∑A¬∑C VIVA GLAM Lipsticks and Lipglasses have raised over 150 Million dollars for the M¬∑A¬∑C AIDS Fund to help people living with HIV/AIDS around the world. How do you feel about this? I am very proud to be involved with the M¬∑A¬∑C AIDS Fund, and I am very glad to lend my name and time to help raise money for people living with HIV and AIDS. Women account for almost half of the HIV/AIDS cases around the world, and your new VIVA GLAM campaign will focus on helping women living with HIV/AIDS. You and Lady Gaga create one very powerful voice. What would you say to young women today about staying safe from HIV/AIDS? Be smart, be careful, protect yourself, practice safe sex and look out for your sisters to make sure they are doing the same. But there are also huge populations of women in many places like South Africa and in the Congo who are becoming infected through rape. For them, I ask the world to stand up and get involved. They are all sisters, mothers and daughters, and they need our help.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2010-02-10 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>f49bce209e847d5ba6948b57c883ed01befb37b1</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>5 Ways to Wear Spring Colour Forecast</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/5-ways-to-wear-spring-colour-forecast/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>5 Ways to Wear Spring Colour Forecast Features Feb 09, 2010 February 09, 2010 For eyes, try Manila Paper eyeshadow on the inner third of the lid, Flip eyeshadow on the middle of the lid, Straw Harvest eyeshadow on the outer lid, and finish with Hot Hot Hot eyeshadow in the crease.

There are four from part one and four from part two. Additionally, there are two eyeshadow quads being released in parts three and four, respectively, that will be reviewed separately . My favorites: La La, Very Violet; Hot Hot Hot, Straw Harvest. What are your favorites? Spring Colour 1 Forecast ‚Äî Eyeshadows Rosy Outlook is a dusty medium pink with a satin finish. I think there was a shade called Riviera Rose‚Äìthis reminds me of it, only not as cool-toned, but still has that dusty pink feel. Very Violet is a crisp darkened violet-purple with very little sheen, not at all frosty like its frost finish would suggest. I can‚Äôt remember MAC doing a purple quite like this in recent history. La La is a rich magenta fuchsia with fuchsia shimmer-sheen. It reminds me of Brash &amp; Bold Pigment from Makeup Art Cosmetics last fall, but in eyeshadow form (so more convenient and easier to work with overall). Very nicely pigmented and smooth‚Äìand surprisingly not that frosty, despite its frost finish. Da Bling is a slightly paled medium pink with a frosty sheen but excellent color pay off in a veluxe pearl finish. This is a permanent eyeshadow, though, so no need to rush to purchase. Spring Colour 2 Forecast ‚Äî Eyeshadows Nanogold is a semi-sheer pinky beige. This is probably one of the nicest lustre-finish eyeshadows I‚Äôve ever come across. It feels nothing like a lustre! This one has come out previously, though always limited edition. Hot Hot Hot is an intensely pigmented orange-based red that looks mostly matte, though it has very subtle shimmer, since it is a satin finish eyeshadow. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen MAC put out a shade like this since being a fan (about five years). Straw Harvest is a gorgeous shade of warmed-up peach gold with a lighter gold sheen in a veluxe pearl finish. Perky is a satin finish light salmon-y pink with good color pay off. Not quite like anything in the permanent line from what I can see. See product photos &amp; swatches!

When I swatched it on my arm, it had a glossy look to it, but on my lips, it looked less glossy and more shimmery/frosty. Peroxide is a semi-opaque shade that lightens up my natural lip color while giving it more of a soft rose look and feel. Surprisingly, with a name like Peroxide, it‚Äôs quite wearable. It‚Äôs lightened but not so light that it‚Äôs hard to pull off. Urban Decay lipsticks have a creme brulee-ish scent (kind of a sweetened, kind of burnt‚Äìbut not in a bad way‚Äìsmell), and I didn‚Äôt taste anything off with this shade. Is this the right pink lipstick for you? Would you wear it? The Spring Season is a series of posts featuring my favorite soft beige, coral, and pink lipsticks and lipglosses ‚Äî all perfect for the first blossom of spring ‚Äî that runs through March 2010.

The eyeshadows included in the palette are Flash (bright iridescent purple), Maui Wowie (medium gold with silver glitter), Chopper (coppery fawn with silver microglitter), and Smog (deep coppery bronze). Everything in the palette is available individually, should you only fall in love with one of the shades! As such, everything included is also permanent. However, for those who do not already have the majority of these eyeshadows either individually or in various past-released palettes, you get a good amount of product in the palette itself. Normal eyeshadows are 0.05 oz. (and retail for $17) while the palette versions are 0.03 oz. ‚Äî still plenty to use. The eyeliner is typically 0.04 oz. (and retails for $17) but 0.03 oz. in the palette. Plus, you do get the mini-sized Sin Primer Potion (my least favorite of the primers, though‚Äìso metallic!). All in all, the palette is a good deal with lots of value‚Äìif you don‚Äôt already own the shades in it. Flash is a cool-toned violet purple with a slight iridescence. It‚Äôs very smooth, pigmented, and vibrant. Maui Wowie is an antique gold with silver glitter. It has great color pay off, and I swear this version felt so much smoother than the one included in the Alice in Wonderland palette, which felt much grittier. You may encounter some fall out with this shade from the glitter. Chopper is a muted copper with a gilded-bronze sheen/shimmer. It has nice pigmentation and applies smoothly. Smog is a deepened chocolate brown with a warm bronze sheen. It, too, is a vibrant shade that has rich pigmentation. Urban Decay seems to really love releasing summer palettes with a series of browns and then a pop of color. ( Remember Get Baked from last year? ) I do like this color variation a lot better than last year‚Äôs, because I feel like there is a good amount of differentiation between each shade. The packaging fits with their theme‚Äìdefinitely groovy and all that‚Äìbut I‚Äôm not digging the vintage photographs on the back. I would have personally loved to have seen the floral pattern continue around the mirror, like it did in Get Baked. It‚Äôs cool that the graphic designer‚Äôs parents are now immortalized in a makeup palette, but for me, it‚Äôs just, ‚ÄúWho are these random people?‚Äù Like the majority of Urban Decay products, it is made out of sturdy cardboard. I like these flip-open palettes, because they‚Äôre slim, streamlined, and easy to travel with and store. It‚Äôs a nice option for a summer palette, but as always, I wish Urban Decay would release new shades of eyeshadows rather than using their permanent shadows. It makes it hard to purchase as a fan, just because you probably own all of them with the palettes you already have! Maybe Urban Decay should make palette forms available of all their eyehadows so we can just mix and match throughout the year! üôÇ P.S. ‚Äì I think I have enough mini-sized Bourbon liners to get me through year 3000.

Period. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you love or hate MAC, it‚Äôs an incredible campaign that truly cares about its cause. The entire selling price of every Viva Glam Lipstick/Lipglass goes towards MAC‚Äôs Aids Fund. Every penny. That‚Äôs not proceeds, that‚Äôs not a portion of‚Äìthat‚Äôs 100%. To date, MAC Aids Fund has raised over $150 million for the cause. Viva Glam Cyndi is a muted coral-red with a glossy finish and goes on semi-opaque. You get a good amount of color out of this, despite it being a lustre finish. It reminds me of some limited edition shades, but nothing quite with the same finish/look. Viva Glam Gaga is a slightly cool-toned, bubblegum pink with a glossy finish and also applies semi-opaque. Again, despite its lustre finish, there‚Äôs a good amount of color pigmentation. While Cyndi didn‚Äôt seem immediately dupe-able, Gaga is similar to shades like Snob. (Though, if you‚Äôre going to buy one, why not go Viva Glam so you can donate $14 towards MAF?) MAC did a standout job with the two latest, limited-edition launches of Viva Glam. The packaging is thoughtful and classy but still fun. Each Viva Glam Cyndi/Gaga Lipstick is housed in traditional black cardboard packaging, but each celebrity‚Äôs signature is embossed in metallic red, sprawled across one side of the packaging. The lipstick is the traditional Viva Glam black bullet with a metallic red ring around the center, but uncap the lipstick, and each lipstick also has the celebrity‚Äôs signature printed in black inside. I just think this attention to detail is particularly exceptional. Well-done, MAC! Read all about how MAC AIDS Fund works and what $14 can do at www.macaidsfund.org .

It‚Äôs expensive, but it‚Äôs a definite luxury. Vanilla &amp; Anise is new for spring, and it is delicious! It‚Äôs times like these that I wish I had a more sophisticated sniffer, because I‚Äôve been bumbling over how to describe this scent for the past week! Top Notes: Sicilian Bergamot, Tunisian Neroli, Wild Fennel Flower, Star Anise Heart Notes: Oleander, Tuberose, Frangipani, Purple Vanilla Orchid Base notes: Clove, Tonka, White Amber, Creamy Musks, Vanilla Bourbon Absolute, Vetiver Haiti Initially, it has a spicy, lightly vanilla scent mixed with a sharper citrus taste, which is pleasant and enjoyable, but the dry down is fantastic. It‚Äôs like a heady, seductive mix of tempered vanilla and amber with an almost woody feel. The vanilla notes you find in this scent is not the vanilla cupcake scent you‚Äôll find at a bakery. It has a definite sweetness to it, but it‚Äôs not cloying or sugary-sweet. Though the scent is the most important part of the product, I was particularly impressed by how well and long it wears. I‚Äôve been using this before I go to bed on my arms and legs, and the scent lingers beautifully. I find a lot of scented body lotions and creams don‚Äôt last long and often have a stale smell, if they do last a few hours. Vanilla &amp; Anise stays with me until I wake up and take a shower, though it has gently worn over through the night‚Äìbut I can still smell it on me without trying. The Body Creme also does a bang-up job keeping my dragon-lady legs at bay, which I was surprised at as well. I just imagined that, despite enjoying Jo Malone products in the past, it wouldn‚Äôt be a truly rich and luxurious body cream, but it was and is. The texture of the Body Creme is certainly rich, but it‚Äôs creamy without being too thick or stiff. You don‚Äôt need much (which is good, ‚Äôcause you don‚Äôt get much!), and despite being a richer cream, it absorbs within minutes and doesn‚Äôt leave behind any greasiness or stickiness. Last night, I walked into the office, and my boyfriend instantly took notice and was like, ‚ÄúMmm!‚Äù It‚Äôs always a wonderful thing when you and your significant other can agree on your beauty favorites!

It has a glistening sheen that makes lips look a little fuller and more pout-y. It applies easily and goes opaque in about two layers. It‚Äôs a very natural, soft shade of pink, so it‚Äôs suitable for everyday wear or to complement a darker eyeshadow look. I like the way it hugs lips and looks subtle but still way better than my natural lip! I get decent wear (about four hours) with this shade, and it‚Äôs moisturizing without being thick. It smells very sweet, maybe a creme brulee or caramel kind of scent. Is this the right pink for you? Would you wear it?

Reviews Apr 29, 2009 April 29, 2009 Urban Decay Get Baked Eye Kit ($28.00) includes Baked, Half Baked, Twice Baked , and Flipside eyeshadows , along with a travel-sized 24/7 Eye Pencil in Bourbon . It also comes with a mini Sin primer potion . Baked is a stunning shade of ultra pigmented, deep bronze. Half Baked is a softer, more golden-toned bronze shimmer shade. Twice Baked is a dark, chocolatey brown with subtle gold shimmer. Flipside is a bluish-teal with blue-green shimmer. I love the Baked shades, because they‚Äôre really rich in color and go on so smoothly. I just see these being stunning in neutral looks, especially during the summer. Flipside is a bluer version of MAC Shimmermoss, and it is a welcome addition in my collection! I already have Bourbon and Sin in full-size, and I do like both. LOVE Bourbon , but I love all of the 24/7 Pencils. I like Sin for a shimmery base ‚Äî I do, personally, like it more than regular UDPP. Get Baked is a great summer palette with a good price to boot. Check out your local Sephora or Urban Decay counter to see for youself!

Of course, freezing here is 55 degrees, but I swear, it felt way colder! I was happy with how this looked turned out; I hadn‚Äôt initially planned on putting Wonderland in the crease, but it looked so much better when I did‚ÄìI was so tentative applying it at first! I was like, ‚ÄúOh man, I‚Äôm going to wreck this look by doing this‚Ä¶‚Äù But it worked out. So, don‚Äôt be afraid to try is the lesson learned there! Oh! And I‚Äôm happy to say that I found my perfect shade in Bobbi Brown‚Äôs Extra Tinted Moisturizing Balm ‚Äî it‚Äôs light-to-medium. Medium was a little dark and looked a bit yellow-ish on my skin tone, but the next lighter shade blended perfectly . You will need the following‚Ä¶ Eyes : Urban Decay Eden Primer Potion (matte yellow base), Urban Decay Muchness (X) Eyeshadow (melon), Urban Decay Oraculum (Half Baked) Eyeshadow (copper), Urban Decay Queen (Last Call) Eyeshadow (reddish burgundy), Urban Decay Underland (Flash) Eyeshadow (violet), MAC Femme-fi Eyeshadow (neutral highlighter), Urban Decay Lucky 24/7 Liner (copper), Smashbox Liquid Liner Pen (black), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Bobbi Brown Extra Tinted Moisturizing Balm (Light-to-Medium Tint) Cheeks : Bobbi Brown Nectar Shimmerbrick (coral bronze) Lips : Bobbi Brown Coral Reef Lipstick (soft coral-orange), Bobbi Brown Coral Sand Lip Gloss (soft bronze) Brushes : 226 (fluffy crease brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : For MAC substitutes, try Melon Pigment (Muchness), Amber Lights (Oraculum), Cranberry (Queen), Stars ‚Äòn Rockets (Underland); Femme-fi = Shroom For eyes, start by applying Eden Primer Potion as your eyeshadow base all over the lid with the 249. Using the 239, apply Muchness eyeshadow on the inner third of the eyelid. Next, apply Oraculum eyeshadow on the middle third of the eyelid and lightly blend with the inner corner. Darken the outer third of the lid with Queen eyeshadow with the 239, gently brushing it into the lower crease. Lightly blend Queen eyeshadow , with the 239, on the outer corner and lid. Next, define the crease by applying Underland eyeshadow with the 226. To finish the eyeshadow look, sweep Femme-fi eyeshadow as a highlighter on the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying Penny eyeliner on the lower lash line. Finish by applying Liquid Pen Liner on upper lash line and then sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Nectar shimmerbrick to the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Coral Reef lipstick first, and then layer Coral Sand lipgloss for a complementing lip. Check out more photos!

On one side, it‚Äôs a melon-y peach kind of shade with a shimmery, slightly frosted finish‚Äìit would appear that this is just one of those shades for the spring season (like Benefit Nice Melons , MAC Flip , Urban Decay Muchness ; or even MAC Melon Pigment ). The other side is a reddened burgundy with a softer frost finish and sheen. I don‚Äôt love this eyeshadow duo, and I really thought I‚Äôd be all over it, given the way it looks. However, this is an eyeshadow duo one really needs to use wet, because the color pay off is not up to my expectations for a brand like NARS when they‚Äôre used dry. When used dry, particularly on the lid, they tend to look incredibly sheer and have a good deal of fall out (primarily of the shimmer). I didn‚Äôt expect to have any fall out troubles with this, considering they‚Äôre pressed powder shadows with shimmer, rather than glittery bits! The texture of Kuala Lumpur is very soft‚Äìthe shadows are smooth and soft to the touch but powdery, and when swatched, they look nicer than it was when I attempted to use the colors dry in a look. In order to make the look come together better, I ended up using the colors wet, which definitely helped quite a bit. I didn‚Äôt love it even wet, though, because once it dries, it does fade back a bit. It‚Äôs like, when you use the eyeshadow wet, it doesn‚Äôt remain looking like it does when wet, but it doesn‚Äôt completely become how it looks when dry. Instead, it settles somewhere in between. ( You can see me wearing this duo in this look . ) I also found that when used dry, it just didn‚Äôt seem to apply evenly and I really had to pack on the color to get an even (though sheer) application. For $32, I want an eyeshadow I can truly use wet or dry, not just wet. I also don‚Äôt want to have to work too hard to make it work for me, either. I can get down with having to experiment a bit for just the right application method when we‚Äôre talking about a $2 eyeshadow, but if you‚Äôre going to buy high-end, it should work right outta the compact, you know? The good news, for those concerned with the $32 price tag, is you get plenty for your money. The math works out to NARS eyeshadow duos being cheaper by the ounce than both MAC and Make Up For Ever. But maybe you‚Äôre better off picking up a different duo‚Ä¶ Oh, p.s. if you dig these colors, you may find that layering them over a more metallic base will help enhance their colors. Like say MAC Rubenesque Paint Pot. I always find poor performing shadows seem to work better when layered over colored and shimmery/metallic bases.

For those interested in picking one up for themselves, both U.S. and Canadian Sephoras are taking phone orders. I know the U.S. number is 1-877-SEPHORA. Last I heard, Sephora would have it online around the 26th and retails for $52. In the Book of Shadows, Alice in Wonderland style, you get sixteen eyeshadows, each weighing 0.03 oz. You also receive a miniaturized Primer Potion (0.13 fl. oz.) and two miniaturized 24/7 eye pencils (0.3 oz.) in Zero and Flipside. It is important to note that the eyeshadows included in the palette are not new shades; they‚Äôre existing/previous shades re-named to fit in the Alice in Wonderland theme. That being said, if you own Urban Decay‚Äôs Ammo, Book of Shadows Vol. I/Vol. II, or the Sustainable Palettes, you may already own the majority of the shadows in the Alice in Wonderland kit. Below is a shadow-by-shadow review with the real-name of the eyeshadow in parentheses (for your reference). Eyeshadows Underland (Flash) is a bright, cool-toned medium purple with an icy lilac shimmer. It‚Äôs soft, smooth, and richly pigmented. Alice (Painkiller) is a bright aqua-blue with an icy sheen. Like Underland, it‚Äôs smooth, silky soft, and has lots of pigment to it. Oraculum (Baked) is a warmed-up copper with a softer copper sheen. Smooth, soft, well-pigmented. I do find this one has a bit of a frostier finish than some of the other shades. Queen (Last Call) is a reddened eggplant with a burgundy edge. It has a frost-like sheen, but it is smooth and pigmented. Chessur (Chopper) is a cooler-toned, not nearly as bright, copper shade. It has the same soft texture as the majority of Urban Decay‚Äôs shadows, but it has silverish glitter particles that may contribute to some fall out in practice. White Rabbit (Polyester Bride) is a gently yellowed white (though still, very white) with a white-gold sheen. Like Chessur, it also has some glitter to it, so it‚Äôs not quite my favorite texture. Wonderland (Maui Wowie) is a tarnished gold, maybe an antique gold, but not quite so dark. It has a golden bronze sheen to it. It‚Äôs pigmented and smooth, but it also has a few glitter particles (though I think this is one of the more manageable glitter-based shades in the bunch). Curiouser (Grifter) is a lightened fuchsia-purple with icy purple sheen. It also has silverish glitter particles in it, which may lead to fall out. This is one of the lesser pigmented shades, though it still has decent color pay off. Muchness (X) is a peachy-melon with a gold sheen. It almost has a little mauve to it, in certain lighting. It reminded me of MAC‚Äôs Melon pigment quite a bit. This has a frosty finish, but it doesn‚Äôt have the glitter, so it‚Äôs smooth and easier to work with. Mushroom (Mushroom) is a taupe brown with kind of a silvery sheen and shimmer. It‚Äôs not quite as rich as some of the other shades, but it can be layered for a more intense look. (Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it has nice pigmentation‚Äìjust not as intense as the other shades in this palette.) Midnight Tea Party (Midnight Cowboy Rides Again) is a flushed champagne with silver/gold glitter particles. This is quite possibly my least favorite Urban Decay eyeshadow. It is a pain in the behind to work with, because the glitter fall out is pretty insane. It‚Äôs a shame, because the color itself is pretty, but the glitter means ‚ÄúNo, thank you!‚Äù for me. Vorapal (S&amp;M) is a neutral, slightly cooled down silver with a brighter silver sheen. Smooth and pigmented. Absolem (Homegrown) is a grassy green with a golden shimmered sheen. Very pigmented and true-to-color. Drink Me, Eat Me (Sin) is a pinked champagne with a bright, frosty sheen. It‚Äôs like a pinker version of Midnight Tea Party‚Äìand sans all the glittery fall out. Mad Hatter (Twice Baked) is a lightly glittered dark brown with warm undertones. I don‚Äôt remember Twice Baked behing so lagging in pigment, but I really had to layer this one on to get a decent evenness. It gave me some drag and a faded look. Jabberwocky (Oil Slick) is a dark black base with icy blue and silver glitter. While not as prone to fall out as Midnight Tea Party, it‚Äôs still one of the glittery shades that may lead to some fall out while applying it. Bottom Line: From the beginning, I‚Äôve been a little disappointed that Urban Decay didn‚Äôt create some new shades for this palette, in light of the partnership between them and Alice in Wonderland. The names are certainly excellent and totally work with the theme, but I would have appreciated (and just loved to have seen!) brand new shades. I like the shades and palette overall, but I think I already own the majority in various other palettes, too, so I‚Äôll probably end up passing this on to my sister after I do some looks with it (well, hopefully!). I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Urban Decay‚Äôs more glittery shades (of which there are six, with one being exceptionally hard to work with) and tend to prefer their smoother shades. I think the palette could have done with a few matte or semi-matte shades, too, just to break up the frost and shimmer. The packaging is very cohesive, and it looks good. It fits with the theme, but I think they put it together quite nicely. My lid won‚Äôt stay open, so it being used as a mirror is not happening as of yet. Since the theme, while well-done, isn‚Äôt a driver for me though, I probably would have passed on this palette under normal circumstances. It‚Äôs a better buy if you are looking to try a bunch of Urban Decay eyeshadows without investing in singles; it‚Äôs definitely a value palette if that‚Äôs the case! Love it or hate it?

It has just enough richness in texture (it is most definitely a cream‚Äìthick, viscous) to leave me feeling like I‚Äôm really treating my skin right during the drying winter season, but it‚Äôs not so rich that it never sinks in. Duration : 4 weeks, once daily in the evening Applied With : Clean fingers Alongside : Kiehl‚Äôs Rare Earth Daily Deep Pore Cleanser (AM), Soap &amp; Glory Catch a Wrinkle in Time Day Moisturizer (AM), shu uemura high performance balancing cleansing oil (PM), Mario Badescu Drying Lotion / Drying Cream (as treatments, as needed) As per usual, I tested this cream out for a full four weeks (I‚Äôm actually still using this, though‚Äìhaven‚Äôt decided what to try next!). I typically spend anywhere from two to six weeks trying out skincare products, but usually four to six weeks for creams and the like (cleansers, toners, etc. I don‚Äôt feel obligated to try for as long‚Äìparticularly since I don‚Äôt review for anti-aging efficacy). It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve reviewed any Origins products, but I‚Äôm really glad Origins thought to send this to me as a possible way to combat my dry, winter skin. According to Orgins‚Äô website, ‚ÄúTested on the driest of skins. Clinically proven to instantly satisfy the deepest of thirsts. This rich, quenching cream owes its endless hydration to the drought-resistant resurrection plant, The Rose of Jericho. But there‚Äôs more. Reviving Trehalose virtually erases visible dry lines to restore smoothness. And oceanic Padina Pavonica rebuilds skin‚Äôs barrier to help keep moisture levels up to 100% all day. Discover why when it comes to renewing and refreshing dry skin, only nature can Make A Difference‚Ñ¢.‚Äù It‚Äôs recommended for dry skin, and I‚Äôd definitely say it‚Äôs meant for dry skin. I have normal-to-dry skin, and I love the way it feels and keeps my skin moisturized all night. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too heavy for me at all, but during the winter, I can get dry patches if I don‚Äôt use the right moisturizer. I think this is a moisturizer that doesn‚Äôt have a lot of bells and whistles‚Äìit‚Äôs not claiming to turn back the hands of time by 40 years, that it has all these funny patent-pending technologies that do this and that, etc. etc. The only claim the product really seems to make it is it‚Äôs going to restore your skin‚Äôs hydration level. The copy says ‚Äúerases visible dry lines to restore smoothness,‚Äù but note it says dry lines so I don‚Äôt interpret that as aging lines, but merely more like the cracked-skin-look that dried out skin can have. I was using a few other moisturizers during the late fall/early winter, and I noticed I was still getting dry periodically, but I haven‚Äôt had a single dry patch since using this cream, so my experience has been really pleasant. It has this slightly citrus-y scent that has the smell of freshness. I use this as a night cream, because it is a heavier cream and works best for me at night time, since I can really let it sink in and not worry about whether my makeup will work with it or not. I find it sinks in within fifteen minutes or so; I always apply it about a half hour before I go to bed (which is typical of my night time regimen) or whenever I remove makeup‚Äìwhichever comes first. By the time I get into bed, it‚Äôs sunk in and my skin feels happy.

It has just enough richness in texture (it is most definitely a cream‚Äìthick, viscous) to leave me feeling like I‚Äôm really treating my skin right during the drying winter season, but it‚Äôs not so rich that it never sinks in. Duration : 4 weeks, once daily in the evening Applied With : Clean fingers Alongside : Kiehl‚Äôs Rare Earth Daily Deep Pore Cleanser (AM), Soap &amp; Glory Catch a Wrinkle in Time Day Moisturizer (AM), shu uemura high performance balancing cleansing oil (PM), Mario Badescu Drying Lotion / Drying Cream (as treatments, as needed) As per usual, I tested this cream out for a full four weeks (I‚Äôm actually still using this, though‚Äìhaven‚Äôt decided what to try next!). I typically spend anywhere from two to six weeks trying out skincare products, but usually four to six weeks for creams and the like (cleansers, toners, etc. I don‚Äôt feel obligated to try for as long‚Äìparticularly since I don‚Äôt review for anti-aging efficacy). It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve reviewed any Origins products, but I‚Äôm really glad Origins thought to send this to me as a possible way to combat my dry, winter skin. According to Orgins‚Äô website, ‚ÄúTested on the driest of skins. Clinically proven to instantly satisfy the deepest of thirsts. This rich, quenching cream owes its endless hydration to the drought-resistant resurrection plant, The Rose of Jericho. But there‚Äôs more. Reviving Trehalose virtually erases visible dry lines to restore smoothness. And oceanic Padina Pavonica rebuilds skin‚Äôs barrier to help keep moisture levels up to 100% all day. Discover why when it comes to renewing and refreshing dry skin, only nature can Make A Difference‚Ñ¢.‚Äù It‚Äôs recommended for dry skin, and I‚Äôd definitely say it‚Äôs meant for dry skin. I have normal-to-dry skin, and I love the way it feels and keeps my skin moisturized all night. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too heavy for me at all, but during the winter, I can get dry patches if I don‚Äôt use the right moisturizer. I think this is a moisturizer that doesn‚Äôt have a lot of bells and whistles‚Äìit‚Äôs not claiming to turn back the hands of time by 40 years, that it has all these funny patent-pending technologies that do this and that, etc. etc. The only claim the product really seems to make it is it‚Äôs going to restore your skin‚Äôs hydration level. The copy says ‚Äúerases visible dry lines to restore smoothness,‚Äù but note it says dry lines so I don‚Äôt interpret that as aging lines, but merely more like the cracked-skin-look that dried out skin can have. I was using a few other moisturizers during the late fall/early winter, and I noticed I was still getting dry periodically, but I haven‚Äôt had a single dry patch since using this cream, so my experience has been really pleasant. It has this slightly citrus-y scent that has the smell of freshness. I use this as a night cream, because it is a heavier cream and works best for me at night time, since I can really let it sink in and not worry about whether my makeup will work with it or not. I find it sinks in within fifteen minutes or so; I always apply it about a half hour before I go to bed (which is typical of my night time regimen) or whenever I remove makeup‚Äìwhichever comes first. By the time I get into bed, it‚Äôs sunk in and my skin feels happy. I‚Äôve been loving it, and this is the first time in awhile that I‚Äôve liked a skincare product enough not to want to switch over to something else to test out for you all!

On skin, he applied NARS Fiji Sheer Glow Foundation, followed by NARS Eden Pressed Powder for a perfectly smooth finish. He contoured Amber‚Äôs cheeks with NARS Amour Blush then highlighted her complexion with NARS Albatross Highlighting Blush Powder. On the eyes, Fran√ßois applied the golden moss shade of the NARS Camargue Duo Cream Eyeshadow over the entire upper lid, then blended outward. The sienna shade was used to define the lower lash line with the NARS Push Eyeliner Brush. He then layered the sienna side onto the lid and brow bone, and swept the hue into the lash line. For additional brightness, NARS Albatross Highlighting Blush was dusted onto the eye, and NARS Nabucco Eyeliner Stylo was swept on to line the top lashes. NARS Blondie Single Eyeshadow was used to create an impactful brow. Lastly, two coats of NARS Larger Than Life Lengthening Mascara were applied to the top and bottom lashes. To complete the look, Fran√ßois lined the lips with NARS Borneo Lipliner Pencil, filled them in with NARS Cruising Lipstick and layered on NARS Easy Lover Lip Gloss for extra shine and fullness.

D. Gorgeous is a chalky matte with very sheer, light color. It‚Äôs an almost gray-lilac when swatched, but it has this dusty, chalky look to it that‚Äôs not very flattering. It‚Äôs also incredible sheer and powdery‚Äìthe minute I dipped my brush in it, it was like, poof! The only good thing I can say about the texture is at least it isn‚Äôt a hard-to-swatch matte that just looks like it drags. D. Gorgeous is smooth and soft to the touch, it‚Äôs just much chalkier than other NARS‚Äô eyeshadows. By the way, NARS also raised the price on their single eyeshadows (from $22 to $23). You‚Äôre always better off purchasing a NARS eyeshadow duo over a single, because the price per ounce in singles makes it more expensive than MAC, Smashbox, and Make Up For Ever. It‚Äôs really too bad that this went so powdery on me, because it seemed like such a nice shade for spring. It‚Äôs not the worst matte I‚Äôve tried, but with the dustiness and lack of pigmentation, it‚Äôs not the best, either. Considering its NARS, I expect pigmentation to never be a problem!

I had to use this duo wet in order to get the intensity I wanted. The cheeks and lips are still goin‚Äô strong with MAC Spring Colour Forecast, so never fear! Oh, man, I really wanted to add more to the crease. I wanted some more depth, more darkness‚Ä¶ just MORE! But I held myself back. I told myself, ‚ÄúGo softer, let‚Äôs try it!‚Äù You will need the following‚Ä¶ Eyes : MAC Soft Ochre Paint Pot (neutral beige base), NARS Kuala Lumpur Eyeshadow Duo (soft melon/plum burgundy), NARS Mediteranee Eyeshadow Duo (soft gold), Urban Decay 1999 24/7 Liner (burgundy), MAC Plushlash Mascara (black) Face : Kiehl‚Äôs Tinted Moisturizer (Medium) Cheeks : MAC Vintage Grape Blush Ombre (dirty plum) Lips : MAC Radicchio Lipstick (pinky plum), MAC Almondine Lipglass (frosty white-gold) (sheer gold) Brushes : 226 (fluffy crease brush), 219 (pointed crease brush), 249 (flat, firm brush), 239 (fluffy shadow brush), 116 (dense blush brush) Substitutes : Try MAC Motif, MAC Cranberry, MAC Ricepaper For eyes, start by applying Soft Ochre paint pot as your eyeshadow base all over the eye area with the 249. Using a dampened 239, apply Kuala Lumpur eyeshadow (the peach side) all over the lid. Next, apply Kuala Lumpur eyeshadow (the plum side) on the outer third of the eyelid and lightly blend into the outer crease. Lightly tap and brush Kuala Lumpur eyeshadow (the peach side) directly above the crease to soften. To finish the eyeshadow look, sweep Meditaranee eyeshadow (the golden side) as a highlighter on the brow bone. Bring everything together by applying 1999 eyeliner on the lower lash line and sweeping lashes with Plushlash mascara . For cheeks, apply Vintage Grape blush ombre to the apples of the cheeks and sweep upwards towards the temple with the 116. For lips, apply Radicchio lipstick first, and then layer Almondine lipglass for a complementing lip. Check out more photos!

I originally expected to include this as part of the Spring Season, but obviously, it doesn‚Äôt fit that theme. It‚Äôs such a beautiful shade of bright pink with just a hint of coral with a golden sheen. It gives lips full-coverage, opaque color and a glossy sheen. Rouge Gs are always moisturizing and tend to look and feel really good on lips. (It is definitely one of the best formulas I‚Äôve tried, though very pricey!)

This is a gently warmed up pink, which isn‚Äôt always the easiest kind of pink to find, and it looks glossy and pretty-in-pink on the lips.

I will also have to reiterate that I really think and wish they would give you a little bit more (say 0.12 oz.) for your money as well‚Äìat least to stay in line with the average lipstick size. I‚Äôm a firm believer in that, for some, Extra Silky Lipsticks are worth every penny of the $52 (which is a recent price increase of $2, by the by). Often, this is the kind of lipstick you may find your holy grail color in. I have heard from so many who aren‚Äôt lipstick lovers but have fallen in love with the feel and texture of these.

It‚Äôs more like an orange-coral, perhaps, but the pink really is downplayed. Paradise isn‚Äôt the most unique shade, but Smashbox‚Äôs Blush Rush formula is particularly lovely. It‚Äôs smooth, soft to the touch, and applies beautifully to cheeks. The color always look natural and never overdone, but they offer buildable color for those who want a light cheek and others who want a more intense look. Paradise is just one of those shades that‚Äôs incredibly easy to wear with a variety of looks from the everyday to the bold and dramatic. If you like blushes like MAC Springsheen and NARS Orgasm , Paradise is right there with ‚Äôem! I‚Äôve always liked Smashbox‚Äôs permanent product packaging ‚Äî it‚Äôs functional and sleek. Cute packaging is fun, but it‚Äôs gotta be functional, too. It just has a very clean look to it, which I dig. Price-wise, it‚Äôs a little more expensive than your average blush at $184/oz. (compared to MAC blushes at $88/oz. and NARS blushes at $156/oz.), but actual investment is in line with NARS ($25) and Illamasqua ($23).

These wipes don‚Äôt get the job done when it comes to long-wearing, water-resistant, or otherwise ‚Äústubborn‚Äù makeup like mascara and eyeliner. I also found that my pack seemed a little dry, so I put a little water in it and turned it upside down (my trick for keeping wipes moist!). The best part about the Korres‚Äô wipes is that it‚Äôs a non-greasy, non-oily makeup remover, so it won‚Äôt leave you feeling greasy nor do you need to rinse after you use one. I actually like these more for a post-workout wipe down than removing my makeup (just because I do often wear more long-wearing products). They‚Äôre extremely refreshing, and since they‚Äôre not at all oily, it takes care of your skin without adding anything to it. Really gives me a clean feeling without the tightness. Price-wise, the Korres‚Äô wipes work out to be just under $0.50 each, so they‚Äôre a little pricier than I‚Äôd like. At the end of the day, though, say you used this nearly once per day, it works out to about $12 a month as a cost‚Äìnot necessarily make-or-break, you know? Less than a MAC Lipglass! I wish they‚Äôd have a better closure device on the Korres‚Äô wipes, but it‚Äôs just a peel-back sticker/closure that you press close (which just isn‚Äôt as secure as something with a ‚Äúclick‚Äù). My favorite wipes for makeup removing are MAC Wipes (available for $26 for 100, works out to be $0.26 each), because they‚Äôre effective without being drying. However, they‚Äôre not designed to be used around the eyes (no, seriously), and I know that I can‚Äôt use them for eye makeup removal, because they‚Äôll burn/sting around the eyes. Korres‚Äô wipes don‚Äôt burn around the eyes, so that is a huge difference between the two for me. MAC Wipes, though, are one of my beauty blogging staples (along with an awesome camera!), because it‚Äôs so easy to remove even stubborn eyeliner that‚Äôs been stuck on your arm for hours. I tried Korres for this task, but it just couldn‚Äôt get everything off as cleanly or smoothly as MAC Wipes. Korres‚Äô Wipes are decent, but they‚Äôre not superb. They work well if you wear more minimal makeup or stick with less long-wearing makeup. One sheet will remove the majority of my tinted moisturizer. They smell lovely, too, with that rose-ish scent (I know, it‚Äôs supposed to smell like pomegranate, but I get a lot of floral when I sniff it!) and didn‚Äôt irritate my skin (always a plus!).

It‚Äôs a non-sticky gloss that feels moisturizing and lightweight on lips. On me, I found it gave me about three or four hours of wear without touch-ups, which is about average. This is beautiful on its own for a hint of red, but it can also be layered over a lipstick to give it a glossier, slightly shimmered look. It has Lancome‚Äôs signature lip applicator, which always reminds me of a bubble-blowing wand! I do like how it applies fairly evenly without having to work at it, too. What about you? Would you wear this red? The Scarlet Season is a series of posts showcasing and featuring my favorite shades of red lips‚Äìfrom glosses to lipsticks that runs through December 2009.

Benefit‚Äôs Silky Finish Lipsticks have this really moisturizing, glossy feel. It‚Äôs almost like lipstick and lipgloss had a baby and called it Silky Finish.

Reviews Mar 13, 2009 March 13, 2009 Simple Skincare Cleansing Facial Wipes ($6.49) make cleaning your face easy as 1-2-3. I do prefer to follow my nightly skincare routine, but sometimes I‚Äôm already half asleep and would rather just crash. It‚Äôs nights like those that I keep a package of cleansing wipes on hand. Simple Skincare is a popular brand in the UK, and it recently launched its products here in the U.S. The Cleansing Facial Wipes do a great job of removing stubborn makeup and lip gunk without leaving any oily residue. It‚Äôs actually supposed to cleanse and tone your skin simultaneously. Even when I‚Äôm not feeling totally and utterly lazy, I often reach for one of these to remove heavier eye or lip makeup ‚Äî it just makes my cleansing process more effective. I get to wipe off a bunch of makeup and dirt rather than massaging it into my skin like a traditional liquid cleanser, you know? Simple wants to give Temptalia readers a chance to try these out! 25 lucky Temptalia winners will receive a pack of Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes .

This is probably my least favorite Eye Studio Eyesahdow Quad I‚Äôve tested‚Äìit‚Äôs very faint overall. The pigmentation just isn‚Äôt there in three of the four shades (all but the eggplant-y one). I like the concept of four different purple shades, but I must say the blue-based purple might have been nicer with another, stronger medium purple with red undertones. The eyeshadows themselves are soft and smooth, they just lack pigmentation. I‚Äôve been happier with some of the other variations in this product type, like Good with Gold . This is definitely a skip variation to me ‚Äî if the colors had more pay off, it could be a nice a way to try out purple eyeshadow, but since they‚Äôre already so soft, it‚Äôs hard to build up the intensity with these.

This lipstick‚Äôs compact was designed by Lorenz B√§umer, a famous jeweler from the Place Vend√¥me in Paris, which is one reason this lipstick compact comes with a high price tag. Gaela is a pretty-in-pink shade. It‚Äôs a medium pink with a slight sheen but not a whole lot of shimmer. I‚Äôd classify it as a neutral-warm pink, and it‚Äôs bright enough to add a pop of color to lips, but it‚Äôs not so bright that it stands out from miles away. It applies opaquely with one layer, and even from the tube, it goes on fairly evenly. Le Rouge G de Guerlain Lipsticks are creamy, long-wearing, often opaque to semi-opaque in color pay off, and they feel hydrating once slicked onto lips. The wear-time depends on the intensity of the shades (e.g. darker shades like reds and burgundies will last longer and easily get through a meal with minimal fading, but lighter shades disappear a bit faster), but I get no less than six hours of wear with these babies. I can even get through drinking/eating, too. I do find that there is some noticeable fading after eating a meal, but it‚Äôs not a deal-breaker. These just feel very lightweight and yet give you amazing color with a few swipes. They last long enough to get me through the day without worrying about fading lip color, and they leave my lips feeling hydrated. The packaging is sleek, luxe, and more than most look for in lipstick packaging. It‚Äôs a heavy, metal-based compact (the heaviest lipstick I‚Äôve personally owned) with a flip-top mirror on the outside casing, which can be handy for re-application. Now, I‚Äôm not willing to fork over extra money for a mirror (hey, I can buy a $2 mirror and keep that in my purse instead!), and even though I love innovative packaging, I‚Äôm not sold on paying for it, you know? The packaging does keep fingerprints like other Guerlain packaging, but I will say that fingerprints are a lot less noticeable (hardly noticeable, in fact) compared to their other packaging. It‚Äôs most noticeable when I take flash photography of the product (ha!), but not when you‚Äôre just looking (admiring?) it. Bottom line: packaging is gorgeous and every bit luxe, but I‚Äôd rather pay $35 and skip some of the bells and whistles of the case. For those who love to splurge on luxury beauty items, Guerlain Le Rouge G de Guerlain didn‚Äôt disappoint me. In fact, I really love the lipstick formula itself, and I‚Äôd love to see it offered sans the heavy-duty luxe packaging if only so I could feel better about purchasing these!

It‚Äôs limited edition and part of Laura Mercier‚Äôs Polished Collection . It‚Äôs very much like lipgloss in a pot, to be honest. The texture and feel reminded me a lot of MAC‚Äôs Tendertones, actually. On my lips, it goes on like a slightly bronzed pink shimmer. It gives some color, but it still acts much like a gloss‚Äìmore shimmer than color‚Äìwhich is fine. It‚Äôs very moisturizing, feels nice on lips, and looks pretty for a quick lip. It doesn‚Äôt have much staying power (fades in about two hours or so), but I like it as a fancier lip balm, actually. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd reach for if I did heavier eye makeup or anything, but if I was just running out to errands, I‚Äôd consider wearing this to give my lips a little more oomph. Pricing is fair, I‚Äôd say, relative to Laura Mercier‚Äôs price point. You get a good amount of product for your money, too. I‚Äôm just not a fan of the packaging, because I personally find potted lip products to require lip brushes in order to remain hygienic. As germaphobic as I can be, I still tend to just make sure I wash my hands really well before slicking this on, because I really am too lazy to bother digging out a lip brush just to apply a product like this.

Using the 239, apply Dolce &amp; Gabbana Gold Eyeshadow Duo (gold) on the inner third of the eyelid. Next, apply Dolce &amp; Gabbana Gold Eyeshadow Duo (copper) on the middle third of the eyelid and lightly blend with the inner corner.

Rouge G de Guerlain Le Brilliant Lipstick is a new kind of lipstick from Guerlain just launched this spring. The lipstick formula is a spin-off from the original Rouge G formula, and the twist is all about a glossier, shinier look that feels lighter but still creamy like the original formula. Barbara is semi-opaque and truly glossy; it definitely feels like a mix between a lipstick and gloss. It also doesn‚Äôt pull moisture from my lips, so it keeps them feeling hydrated while I‚Äôm wearing the color. Because it is particularly glossy and creamy, it does have some slip to it. In the past, I have found that more slippery lipsticks and glosses have a tendency to fade and wear off faster than drier or tackier lipsticks and glosses.With this particular formula, I found it did outlast many of the other lipsticks I‚Äôve tried with similar formulas‚Äìabout three to four hours‚Äìthough not nearly as long as a typical Rouge G, which is four to six hours). The glossiness is what fades first, but the color does linger. The price is wicked, so it‚Äôs definitely an indulgence! Is this the right nude lipstick for you? Would you wear it?

Some of the goals behind the new lipstick formula was creating a lightweight, long-lasting lipstick with plenty of color. It nicludes ruby powder that will be radiant when it interacts with ultraviolet rays as well as mother-of-pearl to smooth and even lip surfaces. You‚Äôll also find hyaluronic acid microspheres, which will help plump your lips. Other ingredients included will be aimed at reducing the appearance of lip lines and filling them. When the lipstick launches, Guerlain expects it to reach about 100 doors, including Saks, Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman, and select Bloomingdales and Nordstroms. They have not designed this lipstick as being affordable luxury, but they describe it as an ‚Äúaspirational lipstick line.‚Äù Rouge G de Guerlain will launch with 25 shades, and each one will retail for $45 in the U.S. or 38 euros in France. The packaging is described as‚Ä¶ Each generally had a hidden hinge, which is an element in Rogue G packaging. The new product‚Äôs wholly metal case that lies on its side also makes a gentle clicking sound when the tube is removed, causing the case to flip open and reveal two mirrors.

Most shades are mostly opaque to fully opaque, though a few are less pigmented. I find the formula to be consistent overall, but there are a few that I like less than others. I reviewed the majority the range four or five years ago, and of course, any newly released shades since, but I thought it was time for an update for the shades still available today. I‚Äôve been working on this for sometime now when time allows, so I‚Äôm SO excited to post finally! üôÇ I went through Guerlain‚Äôs list on their own website, and I also checked a few retailers‚Äô websites for available shades, and here‚Äôs part one! >> You can find Rouge Gs at Sephora , Nordstrom , Saks , Neiman Marcus > See all the permanent Rouge Gs in the Swatch Gallery ! &lt;&lt; Gabrielle is described as a ‚Äúpearly pale pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a light golden champagne shimmer with a glossy, luminous finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, but the lighter color paired with the creamier consistency makes this one slightly streaky applied. It wears well for four hours on me while being hydrating. See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Gemma is described as a ‚Äúrosy mauve.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, rosy pink with subtle, cool undertones and a warmer, golden pearl. The finish is lightly glossy with a fair amount of shy. The consistency is lightweight, hydrating, and glides on easily but doesn‚Äôt settle into lip lines or look streaky on. It had mostly opaque color coverage and lasted for five hours on me. See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Georgia is described as a ‚Äúrosy pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, yellow-toned pink with warm undertones and a glossy sheen. It had full color coverage, while the formula was comfortable to wear, moisturizing, and lasted for five hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Geraldine is brightened, medium pink with cool undertones and a glossy finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage that lasted for five and a half hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Girly is described as a ‚Äúbright coral pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark coral-pink with warm, reddish undertones and a glossy finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered evenly and smoothly while wearing for six and a half hours on me. See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Gigi is fuchsia-red with cool undertones and a glossy finish. It had rich color payoff that covered well and lasted for six and a half hours, while it left a stain behind. It was nicely hydrating and comfortable to wear. See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Gladys is medium-dark fuchsia-red with cool, pink undertones and lighter pink pearly shimmer. It had rich, full color coverage that went on beautifully with even, smooth color. It‚Äôs the kind of formula that makes lips look fuller and healthier than they really are. The color lasted six and a half hours on me and was hydrating while worn.

Collection: Pop ‚Äòn Green Eyeshadow Quad Lancome Pop ‚Äòn Green Eyeshadow Quad ($42.00) is a sultry blue and green palette for spring. It‚Äôs surprisingly un-spring-like and yet it‚Äôs not totally out-of-season either. It‚Äôs almost like the perfect accompamiment to a gloomy, rainy day‚Äìand I do mean that as a compliment! Pop ‚Äòn Green includes a bright silvery-white with shimmer; a greenish-gray with taupe with a more metallic finish; an olive-green with a subtle yellow-olive sheen/pearl (not really shimmery); and a blue-teal with soft silver shimmer over a pearly sheen finish. I don‚Äôt have colors quite like the olive green and teal in my collection‚Äìsimilar, but the pearly finish makes them distinctive against anything I might already own (all of which are either more matte or shimmery). I think it would have been cool for the entire palette to have the same pearled sheen finish, actually. The green-gray-taupe shade is so-so; a little on the sheer side, even though it has a kind of ‚Äúwet‚Äù look to it, I wish the pay off was more. The silver shade has decent pigmentation, but it‚Äôs not as color-rich as the olive green and teal are. I like the palette, though I can see this not being something for everyone. I like the way it fits a different side of spring; not the blossoming, pastel side, but the cooler, rainier weather. I think I‚Äôm really swooning for that green, though, and I must say, I‚Äôm a sucker for olive greens, so‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in love with half the quad, but the other half is just so-so‚Äìthe pigmentation is perfect and the texture isn‚Äôt as smooth as the good half. I do like that the other half makes sense, though‚Äìyou can wear these four shades together or variations of three of the four.

The Colorful Blush formula is supposed to be long-wearing, buildable, and have a lightweight texture. My experience with the formula has shown that they‚Äôre soft, lightly powdery at times (some are worse than others) with semi-sheer to semi-opaque color coverage that blends fairly well and lasts seven to eight hours. There is some variance between shades, but there are some gems in the range. As described, Fiji is a buildable shade from semi-sheer to mostly opaque coverage (two to three layers, and it doesn‚Äôt look like you‚Äôve over-applied powder) with a soft, very lightly powdery consistency, that is blendable on the skin without emphasizing pores. The shimmer is noticeable but flatters the skin by giving it a lovely sheen. If you like your contour to have some shimmer, it could certainly be used as a contour on some skin tones, but it seems more like a traditional bronzing shade. On me, it wore well for eight hours before fading slightly. 17 7 Fiji (25) 17 7 Fiji (25) A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora Brazil Sephora (Australia) 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

For this month‚Äôs limited color release, we get another quality release, even though I still would love to see a little more risk-taking or originality in the limited releases. The consistency was moderately creamy with some slip and easily glided across lips without tugging, but it didn‚Äôt feel or look heavy on nor did I get any feathering or bleeding around the edges while wearing it. The formula was comfortable and lightly hydrating, while the color had mostly opaque coverage (you could still see my lip freckle slightly) and helped lips look a little smoother. It lasted for over six hours, and it left behind a stain. 31 5 #009 31 5 #009 A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9 Product 9 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 93% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The formula is supposed to ‚Äúimpart a lit-from-within glow,‚Äù and they are a pressed, powder highlighter that is similar to products like MAC In Extra Dimension , NARS Dual Intensity Blush , Estee Lauder Gelee , and so forth. So Hollywood had good color payoff that was mostly opaque but could be applied with a lighter hand for sheerer coverage or blended out for less intense color/finish. It has a high-shine finish that looks nearly metallic on the skin, so this is a formula best suited for someone who likes a bold highlight. I was surprised, but it didn‚Äôt emphasize pores for me; almost like it was so reflective that the pores appeared smoother as a result. The texture was soft, smooth, and didn‚Äôt feel dry or dusty, while the wear was eight hours for me. 86 19 So Hollywood 86 19 So Hollywood A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Beautylish Ulta Cult Beauty DermStore Macy's Net-A-Porter Skinstore.com b-glowing Sephora (Australia) Beauty Bay (UK) Beauty Brands Dillard's Anastasia 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It had a natural finish, which is glossier than a true satin (to me)‚Äìthe sheen was noticeable until an hour and a half into wear, and then it was more satiny. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied beautifully with smooth, even coverage that was comfortable to wear but didn‚Äôt slide around. It wore for eight hours and didn‚Äôt feel drying (I want to say it is a little hydrating, but more in the sense that my lips don‚Äôt feel worse for wearing it while it is not hydrating my lips more‚Äìmaintaining their moisture-level). MAC Double Shot (P, $16.00) is cooler. MAC Tabla (P, $16.00) is darker, brighter. NARS Het Loo (P, $25.00) is lighter, brighter, warmer, less glossy. Maybelline Touchable Taupe (940) (P, $7.49) is lighter, glossier. Bite Beauty Marzipan (P, $28.00) is lighter, warmer. Tom Ford Beauty Gustavo (LE, $32.00) is more shimmery, darker.

See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . Urban Decay Stark Naked Matte Revolution Lipstick ($22.00 for 0.09 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúmatte light nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, slightly muted peach with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation, but the texture was thicker and heavier that seemed to pull into lip lines noticeably. The texture was creamy and glided on without dragging, but it looked drier on than it felt. The creaminess saved it from wearing really poorly, as the color pulled more and more into lip lines over wear, but the heavier consistency meant you could smooth the color back out by pressing your lips together. It lasted for six and a half hours and was lightly drying after four hours of wear for me. This was my least favorite shade of the nine I tried. MAC Wholesome (LE, $16.00) is lighter. NARS Isola Bella (P, $25.00) is darker, warmer. NARS Floralies (P, $25.00) is lighter, brighter. Too Faced Melted Nude (P, $21.00) is lighter, cooler. Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics Covet (P, $18.00) is warmer. NARS Liguria (P, $26.00) is warmer. Colour Pop Precocious (LE, $5.00) is lighter, more muted. Maybelline Nude Embrace (P, $7.99) is lighter. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . Urban Decay Blackmail Matte Revolution Lipstick ($22.00 for 0.09 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúmatte deep berry wine.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened berry-purple with cooler, pinky-red undertones and a satin sheen. It was mostly opaque, and while application could have been slightly smoother/more even, it was one of the better applying vampy shades I‚Äôve tried. It was creamy enough to glide on without tugging, but it wasn‚Äôt slippery or too heavy, so it didn‚Äôt slide around. I noticed that this wasn‚Äôt a shade that applies well without a lip brush, as it is very hard to get a really crisp edge with the tube. It wore down to more of a semi-matte to matte finish after an hour or so of wear, and on me, the color was still lingering after eight hours with little noticeable fading. My lips didn‚Äôt feel dry after wearing it. MAC Soulfully Rich (P, $18.00) is lighter, less glossy. NARS Train Bleu (P, $25.00) is lighter, less glossy. Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics Anita (P, $18.00) is lighter, warmer. MAC Instigator (P, $16.00) is lighter, warmer. Colour Pop Feminist (P, $5.00) is cooler. MAC Prince Noir (LE, $16.00) is lighter. Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics Black Dahlia (P, $18.00) is lighter, glossier. See comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . Formula Summary | Urban Decay Matte Revolution Lipstick ($22.00 for 0.09 oz.) is a new formula releasing on July 8th (later for retailers). There are eleven shades in the range with two exclusive to Urban Decay‚Äôs website and freestanding stores. The formula is supposed to be smooth, pigmented, creamy, and ‚Äúprovide long-lasting moisture.‚Äù It‚Äôs a very pigmented, semi-matte to natural finish formula that wears a really, really long time and wears away evenly without bleeding or feathering. My only issue with these is that they‚Äôre more of a satin finish than a true matte one, but if that‚Äôs not a deal-breaker, they‚Äôre worth checking out. I was extremely impressed by how long-wearing the formula was without being drying. I could wear a shade from 9AM to 9PM and not once think, ‚ÄúI really wish I could apply lip balm.‚Äù Some shades have more slip than others, and as a result, the ones with more slip have a more satin-like sheen to them, while a couple were less creamy and applied with more of a semi-matte finish from the get-go. Most shades wore down to a traditional matte (but not liquid lipstick flat-matte finish) within an hour to two of wear. The texture is significantly less creamy with a lot less slip compared to the Sheer Revolution and original Revolution formulas, which have a much more luminous sheen with a slight tackiness to the texture, whereas these have no tackiness and a more velvety feel (they remind me of NARS Audacious Lipsticks in that respect). These hug the lips more as a result but surprisingly, they‚Äôre very comfortable to wear. What‚Äôs particularly nice is that the texture has some creaminess and weight to it, so while it can transfer onto cups and the like, there‚Äôs so much of it that it doesn‚Äôt wear away the color, and you can also smooth out any smudges if you dabbed with a napkin. There was no discernible scent or taste.

The quad will be available online on May 16th and in-stores May 23rd (of course, it usually is online earlier than the stated date). It is packaged in a matte bronze with a rubbery texture‚Äìif you‚Äôre familiar with NARS‚Äô packaging, it‚Äôs very much like that, only bronze in color. Romantico is a soft, medium-dark bown with a frosted finish and subtly warm, reddish undertones. It had nice color payoff and applied smoothly. Giorgio Armani Summer 2013 Eyeshadow #3 is warmer. Too Faced Hot Cocoa is lighter. NARS Flowers 3 is warmer. Milani Caramel Brown has a more metallic finish. MAC Buckwheat is darker. MAC Lie Low is more orange. MAC Sable is darker. Bare My Soul is a gold-shimmered coppery brown with warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had good color payoff and applied smoothly when I used it on the lid. Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild Sparkle ‚ÄòTil Morning #2 is very similar. Guerlain Calligraphy Eye &amp; Lip #2 is slightly darker. Urban Decay Penny Lane is darker. Le Metier de Beaute Goldstone is more golden, brighter. bareMinerals Golden Iris has more of a satiny sheen. Friendly is a rich, chocolatly brown with subtly warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had fantastic color payoff, and it applied incredibly smoothly, too. Inglot #421 is slightly more coppery. Laura Mercier Cedar is more matte. MAC Make Your Mark is not quite as intense. MAC Mulch is redder. When in Rio is a deep, red-brown base with a greenish-teal sheen. It had good color payoff when layered, but it was a little on the drier side and slightly stiff when I tried blending it out on the lid. It‚Äôs workable, but it‚Äôs not as nice as Romantico or Friendly. Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild Comfort Zone #8 has a much redder base. bareMinerals Mirage is browner. MAC Double Feature #5 #2 is similar in design but much redder in practice. Tarte Exquisite Emerlad is similar though not as intense. MAC Woodsmoke is bluer. Inglot #414 is greener. MAC Club would also be similar, though I think the duochrome is not quite as obvious (and also Blue Brown pigment). Initially, it reminded me of the Burmese Beauty quad from a few years ago, but they‚Äôre definitely not one-for-one. Burmese Beauty had a more golden, rather than copper-toned, shade, but it did have a similarly duochrome blue-brown shade ( Burmese Beauty ). The other two eyeshadows are not similar to the other two found in this quad. I liked the quad overall, but at this price point, I really wish When in Rio was softer, more pigmented, and more blendable. In the world of MAC eyeshadow quads, this is certainly one of the better ones in the past few years. I wore all four eyeshadows together yesterday, and I didn‚Äôt have any issues with creasing or fading after nine hours of wear (no primer).

This product claims to deliver long-wearing opaque color without feathering and all with a glossy shine‚Äìoh, and they‚Äôre supposed to be moisturizing, too. There are currently five shades: F-Bomb (bright red cream), Punch Drunk (bright orange cream), Adrenaline (bright fuchsia sparkle), Crush (hot pink), and Big Bang (bright pink with sparkle). F-Bomb is a bright, medium-dark red with subtle ruby shimmer. It‚Äôs opaque, and it does stain a little (but surprisingly, not as much as some reds). It does have a subtly glossy shine. Overall, it leans a touch blue, but it‚Äôs not strongly blue-based. Make Up For Ever #44 is similar but not quite as dark. Guerlain Gwen is less vibrant. NYX Hero is not as opaque, slightly darker. Burberry Hibiscus seems a touch lighter. Chanel Dragon is a bit darker and has more shimmer. Punch Drunk is a vibrant, darkened orange with creamy finish and subtle shine. It‚Äôs completely opaque. MAC Strut Your Stuff ius similar, perhaps not as dark. Giorgio Armani #405 is similar in vibrancy, but it is brighter, less red-based. Dolce &amp; Gabbana Sheer is very similar. Adrenaline is a darkened raspberry red with ruby and pink shimmer and glitter. I did not find that this was really glossy at all‚Äìit felt a little dry when I applied it, and it looked more like a regular lipstick than a gloss. MAC Quite the Thing is similar, more iridescent. Estee Lauder Wild Violet is slightly redder. NYX Chloe is similar in base color but has more iridescence. Crush is a creamy blue-based fuchsia pink with a glossy shine. It‚Äôs nearly opaque in color. NARS Schiap is pinker, not quite as blue-based. MAC Florida is similar in color but lighter. Big Bang is medium-dark raspberry pink with fuchsia glitter. It is lighter, less opaque, and not nearly as red as Adrenaline. This is cooler-toned as well. MAC Pink Burst is very similar, while MAC Quite the Thing is darker. The majority of these shades are vibrant and rich in color, which means they definitely wear longer rather than shorter. Shades like F-Bomb wear three to four hours with a subtle shine, but the color itself lasts through a meal and still looks presentable six hours later. I only tested the wear on F-Bomb and Big Bang, so I could test out different finishes. Both Adrenaline and Big Bang have a fair amount of glitter (‚Äúsparkle‚Äù) in their finishes, and as a result, they have a slightly gritty texture, which becomes more noticeable over time, as the creaminess of the product wears away. It doesn‚Äôt travel too much, but as fun as the sparkling glitter might be, it is more troublesome than the creamier finishes. I did get four hours of wear with Big Bang. Crush was the only shade that had a high gloss shine‚Äìthe kind expected from these‚Äìwhile the others fell a little flat. Adrenaline was the only shade that I felt really missed the shine. F-Bomb, Punch Drunk, and Big Bang all had a subtle shine. After I wore them, I‚Äôm pleased to report my lips did not dry out, so they delivered on their ability to moisturize while worn. I also did not experience any bleeding while wearing F-Bomb, which is the most likely to bleed as it is a rich red. This product is easy to sharpen, but you‚Äôll waste doing so (from what I can tell, 1-2 uses), and you won‚Äôt particularly enjoy cleaning out your sharpener afterward. It shaves off the actual product, while it sharpens, and because of the creaminess of the formula, it smears easily when you attempt to clean. I tested it twice by removing the entire sharpened portion (so initially, the entire tip, then I sharpened until about 3mm of product was exposed, removed that, repeated). Aside from the sharpening issue, the new pencils are rather good‚Äìas long as you don‚Äôt mind the lack of glossy shine. They look more like lipsticks than glosses (except for Crush). It falls short of that particular claim, which is reflected in the product rating, but it is certainly something that may be easily overlooked.

Altered Beige is a warm-toned, pinky beige with a frosted finish and semi-sheer to semi-opaque color. I felt like the frost made it appear more opaque, but a lot of the natural lip color will come through, given that it‚Äôs a lustre (which is a sheerer formula). It lasted two and a half hours on me. Giorgio Armani Moonlight Beige #4 is similar. MAC Pure Zen is pinker. Giorgio Armani #111 is similar, slightly warmer. MAC Tropical Mist is very sheer on me but the two have a similar effect. MAC Japanese Maple is similar. MAC Marquise d‚Äô is pinker. Revlon Creme Brulee is also similar. Caliente is a brown-toned burgundy with red, copper, and burgundy sparkle. Dazzle finish isn‚Äôt one that pops up often, but it is a very sparkle-packed lipstick; the grit is less than glitter, but it‚Äôs more than shimmer. I find that these are moderately gritty about halfway through wear, and some of the sparkle travels outside of the natural lip. The effect can be very interesting and fun, but there are some downsides that you‚Äôll have to weigh. Because of the sparkle, it can feel a little rough (not painful, not horrible, but not as creamy or as smooth) when applied. The other thing that I‚Äôm not crazy about with the Dazzle finishes is that they tend to have splotchy base colors. Caliente is true to form; slightly gritty after two hours, a definite grit you can feel in the bullet itself, some sparkle goes on a voyage across the plains of your face, and the color isn‚Äôt totally even. It lasted three hours on me. MAC Infused with Glam is warmer, more coppery. MAC Snazzy Dazzle is more plum, pinker. MAC Oh, Oh, Oh is more plum, less brown. MAC Subverted is browner, redder, deeper. Feel My Pulse is a magenta purple with a soft, almost frosted sheen. It has mostly opaque color payoff with a little bit of translucency. It looks a bit purpler in the tube than on, which I imagine is the natural pink tones pulling out the pink on the lip. It lasted four and a half hours on me. MAC Heroine is purpler. Maybelline Brazen Berry is similar but glossier in finish. MAC Seductive Intent is purpler. MAC Style Curve is close in color but has a slight pearl in its finish. MAC Love Forever is pinker. MAC Spitfire is a bit pinker. Sheer Seduction is a warm, orange-copper with copper sparkle. This shade also has a Dazzle finish, so it does feel a little gritty when initially applied, and as it wears away, the texture of the sparkle becomes more noticeable on the lips. The color payoff is more semi-opaque and even compared to Caliente . There were a few stray sparkles that abandoned lips while I wore it. It lasted three hours on me. OCC Authentic is darker and more metallic (rather than sparkly). LUSH Vibrance is brighter with more of a golden shimmer. Chanel Sari d‚ÄôEau is redder in tone. MAC Hot Sass is more subdued. When it comes to Caliente and Sheer Seduction , they‚Äôre going to be love-it-or-hate-it products, because of the finish. If you love the sparkle, you might not care about the texture. But if you‚Äôre really concerned about texture, creaminess, and comfort, you‚Äôll probably dislike this finish on the whole. It‚Äôs just one of those formulas that leaves something to be desired but the finish may be unique or fun enough to put up with (for some).

It did seem to lighten on my lips compared to swatched, and it looked quite different swatched/applied compared to how it appeared in the tube! It makes me think that it will look a little different across skin tones and undertones. The liquid lipstick was richly pigmented with full coverage in a single layer, and the color spread evenly across the lips without streaking. It dried down with enough time to spread the product but not have to sit around waiting for it dry over an hour. This shade wore well for seven hours and was slightly drying after five hours of wear. The Liquid Lipstick is supposed to be an ‚Äúultra-saturated‚Äù formula that gives opaque coverage in ‚Äúone swipe‚Äù that ‚Äústays put for hours.‚Äù I think the formula has improved over time, as some of the initial shades I tried were more problematic, but a lot of the newer shades have applied more evenly, been more opaque, and haven‚Äôt been quite as drying. The majority of shades are semi-opaque to opaque in a single layer, dry down evenly, and stay on for at least six hours, if not well beyond eight hours. I personally find most shades to be lightly to moderately drying over time. Top Dupes View Swatches View All Dupes MAC Evening Buzz (LE, $17.50) is lighter, glossier (95% similar).

The finish of this after it had dried down was still lightly tacky, and it was unlike any shade I‚Äôve tried in the formula, so it might be due to the metallic finish (also a first for me in this range). It was thinner than usual, but it was still nearly opaque in coverage and applied fairly well. There was room for improvement, as there were a couple of areas that did not seem to be as opaque as other areas. It did sit well on the lips and didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcrack‚Äù when I smiled. The color wore well for over seven hours, though it started to feel drying after five hours of wear. However, I felt like this shade was more prone to breaking down with a solid meal compared to other shades in the same fomrula.

Formula Overview $17.00/0.11 oz. - $154.55 Per Ounce Urban Decay Vice Lipstick ($17.00 for 0.11 oz.) is available in six finishes, which are primarily distinguished by level of sheen, shimmer content, and coverage. Mega Mattes are the thinnest and have the most ‚Äúcling‚Äù as they are drier and more matte (but most are semi-matte and not a totally flat matte) and can be drying, though they are longer-wearing. Comfort Mattes are creamier, a little denser, with richer color payoff on average (they are the most pigmented out of the finishes), and have a satin finish that is fairly comfortable to wear, usually lightly hydrating, and longer-wearing. Creams are usually softer and creamier, though not too soft (they don‚Äôt mush or break from the base easily), with some being tackier and stiffer in the tube until they warm up against the lips; they have good color payoff, are hydrating, and are comfortable to wear but have more typical wear (four to six hours‚Äìsix hours for deeper/richer shades like a red). Sheers and Sheer Shimmers have a more balm-like consistency that feels a little thinner but is wetter/more emollient than Mega Mattes, so ultimately, they feel quite different applied; they have sheerer coverage, though more semi-sheer to semi-opaque than very sheer, and have the shortest wear time at two to fours with light hydration. Metallized is the most shimmery of the finishes, though some of the other finishes have shades that are actually as shimmery (to me), but the Metallized formula has a thinner, more emollient base that isn‚Äôt as dense or as cream-like as the Creams; they feel more like the Sheers but a bit heavier and more pigmented (but seem to run semi-opaque to opaque, not always fully opaque) with average wear (four to five hours), light hydration.

Metallized is the most shimmery of the finishes, though some of the other finishes have shades that are actually as shimmery (to me), but the Metallized formula has a thinner, more emollient base that isn‚Äôt as dense or as cream-like as the Creams; they feel more like the Sheers but a bit heavier and more pigmented (but seem to run semi-opaque to opaque, not always fully opaque) with average wear (four to five hours), light hydration.

MAC Prom Princess is lighter. NARS Mata Hari is bit lighter, less cool-toned. Tom Ford Narcissist is much brighter and bolder, more magenta. MAC Supernova is very similar. Tom Ford Wicked is lighter, more shimmery. MAC Amazon Princess is also similar. Hot Nights is very intense‚Äìit has amazingly rich color payoff! In a blush, this is excellent news for deeper skin tones, while it can be taken with less enthusiasm from those with very fair complexions. For fairer complexions, I recommend using a very light hand, a soft brush, preferably a stippling one. I applied this using MAC‚Äôs fan brush (184), and it was still quite intense even on my medium skin tone. Though rich in color, the texture itself was slightly dry, and I felt like trying to blend such a pigmented blush on my cheeks took a lot of doing. I ended up blending more foundation along the edges to soften them! Hot Nights wore for eight hours well, and after nine hours, it was beginning to fade. 23 7 Hot Nights 23 7 Hot Nights A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It takes the Pure Color Envy and adds shimmer to it with the end result varying from lightly pearlized to more frosted and near-metallic. The shimmer is finer, so the lipsticks do not feel gritty on the lips, and the particles don‚Äôt migrate as the lipstick wears down. I would describe the coverage as more semi-opaque overall, though a lighter hand could achieve more medium coverage and two layers would give you near-to opaque coverage. It is lightly creamy with some slip that is more noticeable as the formula warms up against the lips. The wear ranged from four to six hours and was typically hydrating. The formula features a vanilla scent but no discernible taste.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2016-11-10 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>f516ec623d97bb62a458523102d222a917b2f2ce</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>How to Apply Liquid Eyeliner ‚Äì Tips &amp; Tricks</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/how-to-apply-liquid-eyeliner-tips-tricks/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>How to Apply Liquid Eyeliner ‚Äì Tips &amp; Tricks Features Apr 30, 2013 April 30, 2013 Makeup &amp; Beauty Tips on How to Apply Liquid Eyeliner Share your best tips and tricks for applying liquid eyeliner!

The new formula will be available in four shades: Copper Strip (frosty mid-tone copper), Life‚Äôs Luxury (deep bronze brown), Polished Jet (charcoal with pearl), and Rich Glance (light gold). Copper Strip is a warm, coppery bronze with a soft, frosted finish. It had good color payoff in a single pass, and it was creamy enough to apply without tugging or pulling on the lid. Make Up For Ever #22E is a bit lighter. Clinique Fuller Fudge looks nearly identical. MAC Eclair is also very similar. Maybelline Bad to the Bronze is less coppery. Life‚Äôs Luxury is a deepened, warm-toned bronze brown with coppery-red pearl. It had nice color payoff in a single pass and was buildable on the lid. I don‚Äôt have it myself, but a guest swatched NYX‚Äôs pencil range here , and Black Bean seems rather similar. Benefit Bronze Have More Fun is warmer. Bobbi Brown Bark doesn‚Äôt have the frost/shimmer finish. Polished Jet is a soft, gray-black with silver sparkle. It had decent pigmentation in a single pass but was more buildable. Urban Decay Mercury is bluer. Urban Decay Barracuda is similar. Maybelline Audacious Asphalt is lighter. Rich Glance is a warm-toned, champagne beige with a metallic sheen. Urban Decay Midnight Cowboy is a bit darker. Urban Decay Sin is pinker. NYX Yogurt is also pinker. Maybelline Barely Branded is lighter. MAC Mooncake is darker and more glittery. The first thing I noticed was these seemed small; smaller in overall size compared to other jumbo eyeshadow pencils, but the weight is only 0.055 oz. To put this in perspective, consider these competing brands‚Äô jumbo pencils: Make Up For Ever at 0.14 oz., NARS at 0.14 oz., Urban Decay at 0.10 oz., and Clinique at 0.10 oz. It‚Äôs only slightly more than your average eyeliner pencil (which is usually 0.04 oz.)‚Äìand MAC is more expensive, by the ounce, than all of those brands but even just ignoring the size, only NARS‚Äô is more expensive ($24). I wore all four shades yesterday, and they lasted for eleven hours without creasing. There was some very slight fading, but it was minimal and all four shades looked mostly intact. These set nearly instantly, which makes them harder to blend together. I recommend working very quickly if you use multiple shades and one eye at a time. I ended up ‚Äúblending‚Äù by lightly stippling color over the shade next to it and using the pencil‚Äôs tip to sort of blend the two together, because most of the brushes I tried weren‚Äôt getting the job done. As far as brushes went, NARS‚Äô Small Dome Brush worked the best for blending. The formula is lightly creamy; each pencil glided across skin well and didn‚Äôt pull or tug, and there was a good amount of color payoff without having to go back and forth. If you used this as a base or only one or two at a time, I think they‚Äôd be easier to use. I also tried using two shades as eyeliners, and they held up well‚Äìthere was some slight thinning apparent after eight hours of wear but no migration or smudging. Lastly, these do require sharpening, so there will be some waste (which is certainly a bummer, given how little product there is!). 20 5 Copper Strip 20 5 Copper Strip A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9.5 Longevity 4 Application 90% Total 21 3 Life's Luxury 21 3 Life's Luxury A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9.5 Longevity 4 Application 90% Total 14 3 Polished Jet 14 3 Polished Jet A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9.5 Longevity 4 Application 90% Total 20 0 Rich Glance 20 0 Rich Glance A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9.5 Longevity 4 Application 90% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It was very pigmented with a lightly glossy, smooth consistency. I did have some issues with the color adhering to the center of my lip, so there‚Äôs a bit of translucency there. The texture was lightweight and comfortable to wear without the color sliding around over time. On me, the color wore well for seven hours and was non-drying.

MAC Blue Beat Liptensity Lipstick ($21.00 for 0.12 oz.) is a deep navy blue with strong, cool undertones paired with a lightly glossy finish that had some visible pearl. It was almost so cool-toned that it looked almost purplish. The consistency of this shade had a bit more slip than other shades, which led to slightly uneven application. For this type of shade, it still went on rather well, but there was still room for improvement. It had good pigmentation, though not quite opaque, in one stroke and was fairly comfortable to wear over time.

Formula Overview MAC Liptensity Lipstick ($21.00 for 0.12 oz.) is supposed to have ‚Äúintense amounts of pigment‚Äù with a gel-like texture that melts on lips that leaves behind a satin finish and wears for ‚Äúeight hours.‚Äù It‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù to wear, but there are no claims about hydration‚Äìand overall, they were non-drying. The majority of the range varied from semi-opaque to fully opaque in one stroke, while the texture had some body and thickness to it but was not heavy. The consistency feels firmer in the tube, but it became softer and more pliable as it warmed up against the lips. This was also true about how the color settled and looked on the lips‚Äìit tended to fill up lip lines without emphasizing them as much after thirty seconds of wear. The formula didn‚Äùt have a lot of slip, and it was actually lightly tacky, which helped it stay in place better. The wear ranged from four to eight hours with lighter shades typically wearing shorter than deeper and more intense shades. The finish was anywhere from satin to natural with noticeable sheen, sometimes glossiness, but it often wore to a satin to semi-matte finish after a few hours. The formula has MAC‚Äôs typical vanilla scent but had no discernible taste. 13 11 Stallion 13 11 Stallion A- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 91% Total 11 12 Blue Beat 11 12 Blue Beat B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 8 Product 9 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9 Longevity 4 Application 84% Total 36 9 Galaxy Grey 36 9 Galaxy Grey A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 10 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It was supposed to be matte, but it definitely took a couple of hours for the shine to wear it down to more of a matte finish in my experience. The Be Legendary formula is supposed to have ‚Äúrich, vibrant color‚Äù that is long-wearing and moisturizing. The consistency was smooth, creamy, and non-tacky but still emollient enough to glide across the lips with ease. It was comfortable to wear for the four and a half hours it lasted, and I felt like it kept my lips hydrated. The consistency was smooth without being too firm in the tube, so it didn‚Äôt drag and applied fairly evenly to my lips. The biggest issue I had with this shade was that it tended to look ‚Äúcracked‚Äù as the color pulled apart noticeably wherever I had stronger lip lines. It lasted for three hours on me before fading unevenly enough that it would need a reapplication. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.

It had mostly opaque color coverage and a medium thickness, which did make the color more prone to pooling in my lip lines (mostly the bottom, deeper ones).

It had medium coverage, which was hard to build up as the first layer pulled up and became very patchy and uneven when I tried to put on a second layer. The consistency was smooth, thin, but it spread decetnly across the lips and only had some streaking. It lasted for four and a half hours before fading strongly from the center first, and the formula was slightly drying. The Showstopper Creme Stain formula is supposed to be ‚Äúlong-lasting‚Äù and ‚Äúhighly pigmented and offers effortless, buildable coverage.‚Äù Highly pigmented and buildable make it confusing what the coverage actually is, since something that is buildable means that it is less pigmented but can be layered for greater coverage. The majority of shades were medium to semi-opaque in coverage, hard to build as they often pulled up the first layer and shifted color around. The formula rarely applied well; it was streaky, dried so fast that there was no time for corrections (and attempts to correct just made it worse), and clingy. I found the applicator rougher, and the packaging made it seem that sometimes it was more like I wasn‚Äôt getting enough product on the wand to even coverage half of a lip (it seemed like the opening was wiping away too much product from the doefoot applicator). For every single swatch, I had to dip and pull the wand two to three times just to get enough product to cover my lips (it was impossible to stretch out the product very far as it dried as I was spreading it). It did dry to a transfer-resistant finish, but it did not survive eating well (most liquid lipstick formulas have survived better for me). Though transfer-resistant, it remained slightly tacky for one to two hours‚Äìand if you use more than one to one and a half layers, it often lifted and separated the color. The brand‚Äôs swatches and lip swatches showcase a seemingly opaque product, but I could not achieve opaque coverage with several shades, even trying four or five layers, and the result after five layers of product was uneven, patchy, and cakey. The wear was average‚Äìfour to six hours with significant fading from the center, which is more what I‚Äôd experience with a typical lipstick and a liquid lipstick‚Äìand surprisingly, little staining, even with deeper shades. So far, they have been slightly drying to somewhat drying. There are so many high-performing liquid lipsticks on the marketplace already, so I was caught off guard by the poor application and performance of this formula.

Formula Overview $12.00/0.19 oz. - $63.16 Per Ounce The Showstopper Creme Stain formula is supposed to be ‚Äúlong-lasting‚Äù and ‚Äúhighly pigmented and offers effortless, buildable coverage.‚Äù Highly pigmented and buildable make it confusing what the coverage actually is, since something that is buildable means that it is less pigmented but can be layered for greater coverage. The majority of shades were medium to semi-opaque in coverage, hard to build as they often pulled up the first layer and shifted color around. The formula rarely applied well; it was streaky, dried so fast that there was no time for corrections (and attempts to correct just made it worse), and clingy. I found the applicator rougher, and the packaging made it seem that sometimes it was more like I wasn‚Äôt getting enough product on the wand to even coverage half of a lip (it seemed like the opening was wiping away too much product from the doefoot applicator). For every single swatch, I had to dip and pull the wand two to three times just to get enough product to cover my lips (it was impossible to stretch out the product very far as it dried as I was spreading it). It did dry to a transfer-resistant finish, but it did not survive eating well (most liquid lipstick formulas have survived better for me). Though transfer-resistant, it remained slightly tacky for one to two hours‚Äìand if you use more than one to one and a half layers, it often lifted and separated the color. The brand‚Äôs swatches and lip swatches showcase a seemingly opaque product, but I could not achieve opaque coverage with several shades, even trying four or five layers, and the result after five layers of product was uneven, patchy, and cakey. The wear was average‚Äìfour to six hours with significant fading from the center, which is more what I‚Äôd experience with a typical lipstick and a liquid lipstick‚Äìand surprisingly, little staining, even with deeper shades. So far, they have been slightly drying to somewhat drying. There are so many high-performing liquid lipsticks on the marketplace already, so I was caught off guard by the poor application and performance of this formula.

The blush formula is supposed to have ‚Äúlong-wear‚Äù with a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúsilky‚Äù feel that ‚Äúcan be layered for your desired intensity.‚Äù The highlighter formula is supposed to have ‚Äúhigh-shine‚Äù with a ‚Äúbuttery-soft‚Äù feel that has ‚Äúhigh colour intensity.‚Äù The two shades coordinated well with each other, and despite the difference in textures, actually layered nicely. In general, ColourPop‚Äôs powder blush formula is thinner and can feel a little dusty or powdery, depending on the shade, and has sheerer, more buildable coverage, while the powder highlighter formula is much denser, almost to the point where a dense brush is required to pick up a modicum of product. The upside is the denser quality of the highlighter makes it harder to overdo it from the get-go, so the highlighter has a more buildable glow. I wish their blushes had more of the substance that their matte eyeshadows have, which would give them better adherence and overall coverage. 9 3 The Knockout 9 3 The Knockout B+ Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Colour Pop 8.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 88% Total 01 /03 View All Colour Pop Excuse My French Pressed Powder Blush Colour Pop Excuse My French Pressed Powder Blush Colour Pop Excuse My French Pressed Powder Blush View On One Page Excuse My French Excuse My French is a bright, medium orange with warm undertones and a matte finish.

Formula Overview $8.00/0.21 oz. - $38.10 Per Ounce The formula is supposed to go on "smoothly" and have a "natural and healthy flush" that has "long wear" and "can be layered to your desired intensity." It is a lightly to moderately powdery powder blush with semi-sheer to semi-opaque, buildable color payoff. The consistency has a drier, thinner feel and though it feels silky to the touch, I found it the type of powder blush can be tricky to blend out evenly on the skin, depending on one's skin type or base preferences. The drier the skin/base, the better the formula would blend, but any natural oils or slip caused the blush to go on unevenly and was difficult to blend out. The wear was between seven and eight hours on me on average. Browse all of our Colour Pop Pressed Powder Blush swatches .

In general, ColourPop's pressed highlighter powders have a smooth, moderately dense texture that was soft enough to be picked up easily by a brush but not kick up any powder in the pan. The formula was semi-opaque to opaque but easily sheered out for less shine and coverage if desired.

The formula is supposed to be pigmented, long-wearing, and blendable (for more on how it compares to the previous formula, check out this post ). The color payoff was buildable from medium to semi-opaque coverage, and the color did darken slightly once I applied to my bare skin. In the reformulation, the color got lighter and has less pink in it compared to the original shade. The consistency was soft, but it was dusty enough to kick up quite a bit of powder in the pan and looked a smidgen dry applied to the skin, even though it was easily blended out. On me, it wore well for seven and a half hours before fading. 11 2 Bliss 11 2 Bliss B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Beauty Bay (UK) Makeup Geek 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 86% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

There was something about the texture that made this really sing when applied; it didn‚Äôt seem particularly special (not bad, just more dupable than not) when I initially opened it up nor when I swatched it, but on the lids, the finish is very pearly and shiny‚Äìalmost wet-looking. It yielded a very bronzy, beachy vibe to me applied, a melted, lived in look that wasn‚Äôt messy. The three neutral shades were really nice, while the darker green was blendable and wore well, it could have been more pigmented, though at least it was buildable.

Guerlain Pinktie (002) La Petite Robe Noire Lip Colour ($32.00 for 0.09 oz.) is a bright, medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a fine, pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage after two layers, which applied fairly evenly but seemed to emphasize the texture of my lips, rather than soften it (which is what a lot of Guerlain‚Äôs lipsticks do!) as a result of the consistency being thinner and a little clingy. It wasn‚Äôt drying, but this shade didn‚Äôt feel hydrating to me either. The color lasted for two and a half hours. MAC Lustering (P, $17.50) is more pigmented, cooler (90% similar). MAC Pink Pearl Pop (P, $17.50) is more shimmery, lighter (90% similar). Chanel Mighty (116) (P, $37.00) is lighter (90% similar). Colour Pop Juice Bar (LE, $5.00) is lighter (90% similar).

Guerlain Black Perfecto (007) La Petite Robe Noire Lip Colour ($32.00 for 0.09 oz.) is a muted, blackened plum with subtle, warm undertones and a fine, pink pearl sheen. It might appear deep and near-black in the tube, but it is more of a darkening shade on the lips. It had sheer coverage after two layers, and a third layer didn‚Äôt intensify or darken much more than two layers, so it‚Äôs more like My First Lipstick in that respect and less like the majority of the range. It wore well for two hours and was very lightly hydrating. Urban Decay Sheer Shame (P, $17.00) is darker, more pigmented (85% similar). Guerlain Mauve Gloves (068) (P, $32.00) is darker, more pigmented (85% similar). Colour Pop Promenade (LE, $5.00) is darker, warmer (80% similar).

FORMULA OVERVIEW | Guerlain La Petite Robe Noire Lip Colour ($32.00 for 0.09 oz.) is supposed to be a ‚Äúbuildable, lightweight lipstick‚Äù with an ‚Äúultra-luminous‚Äù finish. They are deliberately scented to smell like La Petite Robe Noire, which is a sweet, fruity and floral fragrance‚Äìthe scent is noticeable both in the tube and applied, though I do not notice it after about about an hour or so of wear (if you are sensitive to scent, I would consider trying these in person or purchasing with the ability to return). There was a somewhat soapy, sweet taste (it contains Stevioside, used as a sweetener) at times, particularly if I ate/drank with the lipstick on. The coverage varied from semi-sheer to semi-opaque with a more stained-like appearance, as it wasn‚Äôt too slippery and had a natural sheen. Some of the shades run together, but they tend to look more varied once they are on the lips (and depending on the coloring of your natural lips, this may or may not be as apparent, particularly with pinker or redder lips). The sheerer nature of these makes it harder to know how they will look on against a mere swatch on the skin, and even from the tube-to-swatch comparison, they can look different. They have a balm-like feel on the lips, and they tend to feel softer and melted as I applied them, but they weren‚Äôt too emollient or too thin or too thick. The formula wore between two and six hours on me with some of the richer, deeper shades lasted the longest, and it was lightly hydrating. As they‚Äôre a buildable formula (Guerlain describes it as one, two, and three-layer coverage), all swatches I did were using two layers. A couple of side notes: 1) the label is on the cap only, so if you take off multiple caps, it is possible to inadvertently put the wrong cap on the wrong shade, and 2) they can be less-than-ideal for storing, if you typically have yours vertical, as the flat-side has the label on it. 5 10 My First Lipstick (001) 5 10 My First Lipstick (001) D+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Cosbar Dillard's 7 Product 5 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 5.5 Longevity 5 Application 69% Total 4 6 Pinktie (002) 4 6 Pinktie (002) C+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Cosbar Dillard's 8 Product 8.5 Pigmentation 7.5 Texture 7 Longevity 4.5 Application 79% Total 5 5 Black Perfecto (007) 5 5 Black Perfecto (007) C+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Harrods House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil FeelUnique Cosbar Dillard's 8.5 Product 7 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 6.5 Longevity 5 Application 79% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Formula Overview Bite Beauty Amuse Bouche Lipstick ($26.00 for 0.15 oz.) is supposed to have ‚Äúbold, creamy color‚Äù with ‚Äúextreme moisture, soft texture, and creamy wear.‚Äù The majority of the range is very pigmented‚Äìtypically opaque with one pass‚Äìwith a few shades being semi-opaque but usually buildable. All 34 shades are shimmer-free and vary being a soft satin finish to a natural finish (light shine but not glossy). The consistency is very lightly creamy to lightly creamy with some shades requiring light-medium pressure and can pull the lip a bit when gliding it across the lips, though the color doesn‚Äôt appear ragged and the bullet itself doesn‚Äôt feel stiff (while other shades applied without tugging, so check individual shade reviews!) The majority of the shades I‚Äôve tested have been lightly hydrating to non-drying and fairly comfortable to wear for the long-haul. They wear longer than average, from four to eight hours, depending on the intensity and propensity of the shade to stain. In comparison to the Luminous Creme formula : The level of color payoff and lemony scent are the two things that are similar, but they feel quite different on. If you have drier lips and need the intense hydration that the Luminous Creme formula offered, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre going to like these. The Luminous Creme formula had a thicker consistency with a very creamy texture that glided on and never tugged at all, and the thicker consistency paired with the glossier finish was more forgiving on lips as it didn‚Äôt emphasize lines, natural texture, dryness, or flaking. Some had issues with the Luminous Creme formula bleeding/feathering and shorter-wear due to the amount of slip (high), and the Amuse Bouche formula has much, much less slip, so the wear is longer. I didn‚Äôt typically experience bleeding/feathering with the Luminous Creme formula, and that is also true with Amuse Bouche, but I would expect less with this more satin-finish formula for most (but not all). The scent seemed slightly stronger in the Amuse Bouche range, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable after I was done applying the color. 30 14 Spritzer 30 14 Spritzer A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9.5 Longevity 5 Application 93% Total 17 15 Gin Fizz 17 15 Gin Fizz B+ Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 8.5 Product 9 Pigmentation 8 Texture 9 Longevity 4.5 Application 87% Total 26 14 Dragonfruit 26 14 Dragonfruit A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9.5 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 97% Total 45 3 Eggplant 45 3 Eggplant A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It was mostly opaque after two coats, and the consistency was a little thin but not enough to impact the application negatively.

The finish is mostly matte, textured, and glittery. It had opaque color coverage with two coats of polish, and the consistency wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin. It feels fairly bumpy/textured, so depending on your preference, you might want a couple of layers of top coat (which will also make it shiny). I don‚Äôt have anything like this in my stash that I can recall, due to that textured finish, so no dupes to recommend. 40 17 Spectrum 40 17 Spectrum A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora Brazil 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 93% Total 31 20 Solar Flare 31 20 Solar Flare A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora Brazil 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 10 Longevity 5 Application 96% Total 36 23 Astrolady 36 23 Astrolady A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora Brazil 8 Product 10 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 91% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

They felt creamier rather than waxy to me. On me, the formula wore between six and nine hours on me before noticeably thinning. None of them lasted for more than a few hours on the waterline, and some shades applied better/worse on the waterline. Some shades flaked while they wore, between four and six hours in (noted by the shade). Swamped ($17.00 for 0.01 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúdeep khaki green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark forest green with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling, pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage in one stroke, which built-up to opaque coverage in two layers. The consistency has noticeable sparkle, so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs truly recommended/safe for the waterline (the formula is supposed to work for the waterline). When I tested it, the color lasted for four hours on the waterline and about eight hours on the lower lash line, but there were some flakes of eyeliner at the six-hour mark.

It had good pigmentation in a single stroke, and it had a lightly creamy consistency that felt thicker than other shades overall. It didn‚Äôt layer on itself as well (seemed to become uneven). The color lasted for five hours on the waterline, eight hours on the lower lash line. Revlon Empire (P, ) is darker, warmer (90% similar). Kat Von D Swanly (P, $18.00) is lighter (90% similar). Urban Decay Walk of Shame (P, $20.00) is lighter, cooler (80% similar). MAC Bare Asset (P, $17.00) is darker (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Polar Ice ($17.00 for 0.01 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúpearly white.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium white with cooler undertones and a mostly matte finish. It doesn‚Äôt read that pearly to me, though it is not quite matte. It had semi-sheer coverage that was buildable to mostly opaque. It had more slip to it than other shades, so it seemed to look almost streaky when passed back and forth. On the waterline, the color wore for four hours, seven and a half hours on the lower lash line. Make Up For Ever M16 Matte White (P, $21.00) is cooler (90% similar). Stila Alpine (P, $22.00) is less shimmery, brighter (90% similar). Colour Pop Exit (DC, $6.00) is less shimmery, brighter (90% similar).

It had good pigmentation with a very smooth, blendable consistency. It wasn‚Äôt stiff, but the texture was firmer relative to a lot of the other shades in the range (which tended to be a little powdery in the pan).

KIKO 107 Tomato Soft Touch Blush ($12.00 for 0.17 oz.) is a bright, medium-dark reddish-coral with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color payoff with a soft, fairly blendable texture. It could have been easier to apply and diffuse on the skin, but it wasn‚Äôt a fight to even it out‚Äìfairer skin tones may prefer something more foolproof, though.

See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . FORMULA OVERVIEW | KIKO Soft Touch Blush ($12.00 for 0.17 oz.) is supposed to be a ‚Äúradiant and highly pigmented blush‚Äù with ‚Äúlong lasting colour.‚Äù It‚Äôs a powder blush that has a thinner, fairly smooth, blendable texture that ranges from semi-opaque to mostly opaque coverage. Most shades are matte to satin with the more matte shades still having a natural-looking finish to them (not flat or dry-looking applied). The wear has varied from six to eight hours depending on the shade. Per readers comments, it appears these have been discontinued in some countries, though all shades except one appear to be available on the U.S. website. (It‚Äôs hard to tell if they‚Äôre just on sale, as they‚Äôre presently available for $3.90 a pop instead of $12, or if they are discounted to move, as I have seen KIKO do 30-50% off before.) I wasn‚Äôt intending to review these back-to-back but will be doing my best to get reviews out quickly in light of seeming to be discontinued. Readers have said the replacement is the Shade Fusion Trio Blush (which I haven‚Äôt tried, so I don‚Äôt know anything about), which would sure be a bummer, since it is more expensive and a trio of shades, so it is different enough that it doesn‚Äôt seem like a true replacement to me (boo!). 21 1 106 Beige Rose 21 1 106 Beige Rose A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links KIKO Kiko Milano (UK) 9 Product 10 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total 11 1 107 Tomato 11 1 107 Tomato B Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links KIKO Kiko Milano (UK) 8 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 8 Texture 8.5 Longevity 4.5 Application 86% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

For spring, the polishes are all shades that are also available in full-size in the permanent range. All three polishes were good and applied well with opaque coverage in two coats (two were nearly opaque in one coat, see below). I get about a week of wear with no chipping and minimal tip wear with Louboutin‚Äôs formula overall. Last spring, I reviewed the nail coffret and mentioned that the brand needed to include a styrofoam piece that fit over the bottles to help ensure they didn‚Äôt loosen during shipping (I had a bottle break). I was happy to see that the brand included a foam panel inside the box (and no broken bottles this year!) in the style and spirit of the brand but definitely kept bottles from loosening in the box. Very Prive is described as a ‚Äúdeep wine red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque coverage after two coats with a slightly thin consistency that produced a more watery, streaky first coat but looked perfectly even and smooth after the second coat was applied. Chanel Rouge Fatal (LE, $28.00) is warmer (95% similar). China Glaze Merry Berry (LE, $7.50) is lighter (95% similar). Burberry Oxblood No. 303 (P, $22.00) is darker (95% similar). NARS Chinatown (P, $20.00) is warmer (90% similar). NARS Paros (P, $20.00) is lighter (90% similar). MAC Sunset Sky (LE, $12.00) is darker (90% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Batignolles is described as a ‚Äúcross between a sky and turquoise blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, green-leaning aqua with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It was opaque after two coats with a consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, so it spread easily across the nail without pooling along the edges. When I tested this shade for wear, it lasted for seven days with minor tip wear but no chipping. Zoya Wednesday (P, $9.00) is darker (90% similar). NARS Thasos (P, $20.00) is lighter, warmer (85% similar). Illamasqua Nomad (P, $17.00) is brighter (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side . Miss Loubi is described as a ‚Äúdeeply vibrant coral pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark coral-pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It was nearly opaque in a single coat, though I applied two to ensure total opacity (it can sometimes be hard to tell until I‚Äôm editing). The consistency was just right‚Äìnot too thick or too thin‚Äìand applied well without streaking or bubbling. I wore this one for a week with no chipping and only minor tip wear (average wear for me, no base or top coats). Chanel Fracas (LE, $28.00) is cooler (95% similar). MAC Impassioned (LE, $16.00) is darker, warmer (95% similar). Chanel Tapage (605) (P, $28.00) is darker (90% similar).

The texture was light-medium in weight, and it looked pretty good from a normal viewing distance, but it could benefit from a lip liner or primer as it tended to emphasize lip lines and pull into them over time. The color lasted for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating. The lipstick was vanilla-scented with no discernible taste.

NARS‚Äô eyeshadows are supposed to be ‚Äúhighly pigmented, longwearing, and crease resistant‚Äù while the ‚Äúcolor glides on smoothly, evenly, and blends effortlessly.‚Äù Some of the issues I had with this palette are issues that I have found to occur with several NARS eyeshadows I‚Äôve tried in the past. There are some NARS eyeshadows I absolutely love, but there are a lot that leave me wanting more. In general, if you always use an eyeshadow primer, then this palette is workable, but if you don‚Äôt, some of the shades have trouble adhering to dry skin‚Äìif you have slightly oily lids, then that should help the powders stick better as well. The texture of the eyeshadows in the palette are all a little harder/firmer than corresponding singles/duos (I don‚Äôt have them all, but comparing to the ones I did have in their original single/duo form, it held true). Wear varied between seven and nine hours, depending on the shade. All of the eyeshadows are from existing singles or duos (and all of them are currently available, I believe, though a couple are considered Vintage, and one is limited edition), so if you only love one or two, you might consider buying them individually. In regards to value, NARS eyeshadow singles are $24.00/0.07 oz. or $342.86/oz., while duos are $34.00/0.14 oz. or $242.86/oz. The palette is $175.56/oz., so you will get more product for less money when you purchase them together. I think if you love more than five or six shades, then the palette is probably the way to go. 0.03 oz. is plenty of eyeshadow to last you a good while, and if there are any you really use up all the time, most are available permanently. To clarify, the #1/#2 or I/II is to indicate left/right side of a duo. This palette appears to be fully sold out online at this time, though it was supposed to be exclusively available through NARS‚Äô e-commerce website beginning January 15th with February 1st as the launch date for department/specialty stores. Nordstrom did release it early (January 13th), but it went ‚Äúunavailable‚Äù shortly after‚Äìwhether it sold out or if they took it down until February 1st, I don‚Äôt know. So while sold out for now, there should be other retailers/stores that you can purchase from closer to February 1st, but if it‚Äôs really something on your wish list, you might trying calling your local store/counter and asking if they have it available for sale. All About Eve #1 is described as a ‚Äúflesh-toned neutral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, yellowed beige with a soft, frosted finish and warm undertones. It had nice color payoff, though it‚Äôs close enough to my skin tone that it might not look that way, but I can assure you that it was opaque. It applied smoothly and evenly to the lid. Tarina Tarantino Delightful #4 (P) is similar. Chanel Quadrille #2 (LE) is lighter. Too Faced Cheers! (LE) is less beige. Maybelline Barely Brazen (P, $6.99) is warmer, darker. MAC Jest (P, $15.00) is similar. MAC Naked (P, $21.00) is slightly warmer. MAC Naked Lunch (P, $15.00) is warmer. See comparison swatches . Madrague #2 is described as a ‚Äúmatte caramel.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium brown with warm, yellowed undertones and a matte finish. The texture was somewhat stiff to work with, so the color payoff wasn‚Äôt fully opaque. Scraping off the top layer helped a little bit going forward. This shade showed signs of creasing after seven and a half hours. Makeup Geek Latte (P, $5.99) is darker, less yellow. Makeup Geek Frappe (P, $5.99) is slightly shimmery and less yellow-toned. Makeup Geek Creme Brulee (P, $5.99) is warmer, less brown. Chanel Charming #2 (LE) is darker. Too Faced Chocolate Milk (LE) is slightly darker. Bobbi Brown Frappe (LE, $29.00) is lighter. LORAC Taupe (P) is darker. MAC Brownluxe #2 (P) is shimmery. theBalm Allegro (P, $16.00) is slightly darker. Inglot #342 (P, $6.00) is darker. See comparison swatches . Fez is described as a ‚Äúvelvety cocoa.‚Äù It‚Äôs a warm-toned, coppery-bronze with a frosted finish. This was the best eyeshadow in the palette; incredibly pigmented, very soft and buttery. It wore well for nine hours. Charlotte Tilbury Golden Quartz (P) is a cream product, darker. Clarins The Essentials #7 (LE) is slightly darker. Chanel Charming #3 (LE) is similar. MAC Her Cocoa #3 (LE, $15.00) is lighter. Urban Decay Ambush (LE, $18.00) is browner. MAC Divine Decadence (P, $15.00) is similar. Too Faced Gangsta (LE) is more golden. Milani Intermix (P, $6.99) is slightly browner. See comparison swatches . Bali is described as a ‚Äúneutral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark brown with cool undertones and a matte finish. This eyeshadow just wouldn‚Äôt adhere to bare skin well; on my arm, I could pack it on (tried it with fingertips, brushes, and sponge-tip applicators), but it would sheer away to nothing. When I later worked with it on the lid, it adhered better (my eyelid is less dry compared to my arm), but it was a little stiff when blending. Over NARS‚Äô primer, it did just fine, though. The texture was really soft (can be a little powdery), and it is incredibly pigmented in the sense that a lot of product gets on the brush just lightly tapping it on the surface of the powder‚Äìit just doesn‚Äôt stick to bare skin well. Compared to the permanent single of this, it is less pigmented and doesn‚Äôt bind as well. It was hard to rate this one, because technically, pigmentation was fine except it didn‚Äôt stick, which is more of a general quality (maybe a texture) issue. Tarina Tarantino Delightful #5 (P) is not quite as matte. Too Faced Dark Chocolate (LE) is darker. bareMinerals Boardroom (LE) is darker. Kat Von D Wolf (P) is warmer. Urban Decay Secret Service (P, $18.00) is is similar. Urban Decay Faint (P, $18.00) is lighter, warmer. MAC Cross-Cultural (LE, $15.00) is warmer. MAC Charcoal Brown (P, $15.00) is similar. Inglot #363 (P, $6.00) is slightly plummy. Bobbi Brown Hot Stone (LE, $29.00) is cooler-toned. See comparison swatches . Coconut Grove is described as a ‚Äúdeep brown infused with reflections.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep brown with a matte finish. It might say ‚Äúinfused with reflections,‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt see any sparkle when applied! I had all the same issues with this as I did with Bali, though this one wasn‚Äôt as powdery and did adhere better‚Äìso same issues but not as severe. Laura Mercier Espresso (LE, $23.00) is redder in tone. Chanel Charming #4 (LE) is lighter. Too Faced Dark Chocolate (LE) is slightly lighter. Tom Ford Beauty She Wolf #1 (LE) has a redder tone. bareMinerals Boardroom (LE) is similar. theBalm Matt Ramirez (LE, $16.00) isn‚Äôt quite as dark, warmer. MAC Midnight Flurry (LE, $15.00) is cooler-toned. MAC Dance in the Dark (P, $15.00) is cooler-toned. MAC Showstopper (LE, $15.00) is similar. MAC Embark (P, $15.00) is similar. bareMinerals Foreshadow (P) is cooler-toned. Inglot #329 (P, $6.00) is slightly warmer. See comparison swatches . Madrague #1 is described as a ‚Äúmatte cream.‚Äù It‚Äôs a pale, yellow-toned beige with a matte finish. It‚Äôs another shade that matches my skin tone, so it may not look like it‚Äôs as pigmented as it really is‚Äìbut it was nicely pigmented, soft and blendable, and easy to use. bareMinerals Velvet Nude (LE, $14.00) is similar. Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild Hard Being the It Girl #3 (LE, $2.29) is a touch lighter. Disney by Sephora Ali Ababwa (LE) isn‚Äôt as warm-toned. Urban Decay Foxy (P, $18.00) is slightly yellower in tone. See comparison swatches . Nepal is described as a ‚Äúsoft sheer rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a soft, peachy brown with a warm undertone and a frosted finish. It had fairly good color payoff, and the texture was soft and applied smoothly overall. Too Faced Marzipan (P) is similar. bareMinerals Ball Gown (LE) is lighter. LORAC Light Bronze (P) is warmer. See comparison swatches . Ashes to Ashes is described as a ‚Äúshimmery violet based brown.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium brown with a frosted sheen and subtle warm undertones. The texture was stiffer, and the color didn‚Äôt go on as strongly as it looked in the pan‚Äìit also looked a lot more golden swatched than it does in the pan. MAC Crushed Clove (P, $15.00) is warmer. Too Faced Jingle All the Way Eyeshadow #4 (LE) is more golden. Sleek MakeUP Court in Cannes (LE, $9.99) is more golden. bareMinerals Schmooze (LE) is similar. See comparison swatches . Brousse #2 is described as a ‚Äúblack violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, smoky purple with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was a drier, stiffer color to work with, and the pigmentation reflected that with semi-opaque color payoff. This one creased on me after eight hours of wear. Makeup Geek Drama Queen (P, $5.99) is slightly brighter. Illamasqua Queen of the Night (LE) is also similar. See comparison swatches . Mekong is described as an ‚Äúespresso infused with shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deepened brown with subtle warm undertones and gold sparkle and shimmer over a matte finish. It had good color payoff, and the texture was soft and fairly blendable. Despite its more matte finish, it adhered a lot better to bare skin than Bali or Coconut Grove! MAC Midnight Hour (LE, $15.00) is more matte. MAC Beluga (LE, $15.00) is darker. Chanel Mystere #1 (LE) is darker. Disney by Sephora Cinders (LE) is also darker. Dior Night Golds #3 (LE) is similar. See comparison swatches . Bellissima #1 is described as a ‚Äúshimmering beige with subtle glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a pale, peach-tinged beige with sparkle. It had fairly good color payoff, and the texture was soft and blendable‚Äìa smidgen powdery. There are so many similar beiges to this, though not as many that have the sparkles ‚Äî see comparison swatches . Lhasa is described as a ‚Äúlavender grey.‚Äù It‚Äôs a purpled taupe with a frosted finish and cool undertones. It had fairly good color payoff, but the texture was stiffer than it is with the permanent single‚Äìand the color payoff isn‚Äôt as good. It is buildable, so I think you can get comparable color to the single, but Lhasa is a really lovely eyeshadow as a single and less stellar here. Guerlain Les Tendres #4 (LE) is less shimmery. Bobbi Brown Smokey Grey (LE, $21.00) is darker. Urban Decay Darkside (P, $18.00) is brighter. MAC Graphic Style (LE, $15.00) is cooler-toned. MAC Hypnotizing (LE, $15.00) is more frosted. See comparison swatches . Bad Behaviour is described as a ‚Äúdeep pewter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark gray with a teal shimmer and frosted sheen. It had good color payoff, and the texture was mostly soft and smooth, but it was different than the single that was released over the holidays. The texture is completely different‚Äìfirm versus incredibly soft and almost pliant‚Äìand the color of the palette shade leans very teal with a stronger sheen, whereas the single looks grayer. Makeup Geek Galaxy (P, $5.99) is grayer. Dior Golden Snow #5 (LE) is less frosted. MAC Nighttrain (LE, $15.00) is grayer, darker. See comparison swatches . Dogon #2 is described as a ‚Äúcharcoal.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened navy with very fine navy shimmer over a matte base. It had so-so pigmentation, and the texture was a little stiff (definitely not as soft as Bali/Coconut Grove). bareMinerals Black Leather (LE, $14.00) is blacker. Anna Sui Diamond Blue (LE) is similar. Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild I Don‚Äôt Do Camouflage #2 (LE, $2.29) is bluer. Inglot #389 (P, $6.00) is lighter, bluer. See comparison swatches . Pandora #2 is described as a ‚Äúmatte black.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, dark matte black with neutral undertones. This had similar issues as the ones I experienced with Bali and Coconut Grove‚Äìit just doesn‚Äôt stick that well to bare skin, even though it is seemingly quite pigmented as plenty of product gets onto the brush, it just sheers away quickly. As it is a more basic color, there are a lot of similar shades ‚Äî see comparison swatches . 67 65 NARSissist Eye 67 65 NARSissist Eye B Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora

It had a matte finish with rich, opaque coverage that applied evenly and smoothly. It dried down to a transfer-free finish, but it wasn‚Äôt as flat/pure matte as a lot of liquid lipsticks can be. It tended to stretch and show lip lines when I smiled, though the color itself lasted for six hours before fading. It was slightly drying. MAC Easy Babe (LE, $17.50) is cooler (90% similar).

The consistency was thin and runny but applied fairly smoothly and evenly. It dried down fairly quickly and tended to emphasize lip lines when I smiled or stretched my lips at all.

ColourPop Rooch Ultra Matte Liquid Lipstick ($6.00 for 0.11 fl. oz.) is described as a ‚Äúdeepened russet wine.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark, burgundy red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It reflects almost copper at times (I noticed this even in person; it‚Äôs an effect that seems heightened by camera but I noted it as I watched it dry down before seeing the photos for once!), even though it doesn‚Äôt seem shimmery. This one dried down unevenly with some parts of it drying down surprisingly quickly while other areas seemed to take longer to fully dry down. The texture was drier, not smooth to the touch, and flaked away and faded heavily from the center of the mouth. It was pretty drying over the six and a half hours it lasted.

Pool Boy and Kimber are both part of the original, matte formulation of Lip Tars, so they have no shimmer. When you initially apply Lip Tars, you‚Äôll see a satin finish, which dries to a matte finish somewhere between a half hour and an hour after application. I had no trouble applying either shade, and they both lasted awhile on the lips. OCC Pool Boy Lip Tar ($18.00 for 0.33 fl. oz.) is described as an ‚Äúaquatic blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium sky blue with cool undertones and a satin-matte finish. For something as light and pastel, plus nowhere near the natural lip color (so it‚Äôs easier to see any unevenness), I was impressed by how evenly Pool Boy applied. It was very nearly opaque, and it was even overall‚Äìit appeared even at a distance, though the close-up photo shows that it‚Äôs not perfect. It wore well for six and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me. I couldn‚Äôt think of any dupes for this. If you like mixing and matching, this would be a great way to add a cooler, blue undertone to shades you already have as well. Kimber Lip Tar ($18.00 for 0.33 fl. oz.) is described as a ‚Äúneon orange coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, coral-orange with a satin-matte finish. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs neon; it has a muted quality to it, actually. This shade was more satiny compared to the other Lip Tars in the collection, and it takes a little longer (about an hour and a half) for it to become mostly matte. It had rich, opaque color coverage. When I wore it, the color lasted for seven hours and was neither drying nor hydrating. theBalm First Officer (LE) is more matte, slightly less orange. NARS Lodhi (P, $25.00) is a smidgen pinker.

Please remember to be respectful of ALL types and forms of beauty; should someone want to wear blue, beige, black, red, or pink lipstick, Temptalia is a place where anyone can wear any color they want without judgment or comments like, ‚ÄúEw!‚Äù It‚Äôs not constructive, and one person‚Äôs opinion on what‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty‚Äù is just that. If it‚Äôs not your thing, it‚Äôs not your thing, but it might be someone else‚Äôs new favorite lip color, and this post is for them.

Though I was pretty jazzed about Pool Boy, I have to admit, I was really, really excited for the new metallic Lip Tars, because they looked like they would work beautifully as highlighters, too. They‚Äôre both subtle highlighters‚Äìthey give off a lovely glowing sheen that‚Äôs more apparent in person than in photos, but it‚Äôs a little dewy, slightly luminous. As highlighters, they wore well for eight hours. As lip colors, the finish and lightness of both shades made them high maintenance shades‚Äìit‚Äôs imperative to exfoliate prior to applying so that they look and apply smoothly and evenly. OCC Pleasure Model Lip Tar ($18.00 for 0.33 fl. oz.) is described as a ‚Äúpearlescent pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, rosy pink with subtle warm, peach undertones and a cooler pink iridescent sheen. It was mostly opaque on lips, but some of the natural lip color peeks through. The thing I noticed about this shade on the lips was that between the lighter color and the frostier, more metallic finish, it‚Äôs unforgiving if you have any imperfections‚Äìit‚Äôs definitely a higher maintenance lip color. I highly recommend exfoliating prior to applying it. It wore five hours on me, which is longer than the average lipstick, but short for a Lip Tar. I mixed this to brighten, warm, and add a little shimmer to Mannequin Lip Tar, and it mixed well. NARS Paimpol (P, $25.00) is lighter, and it looks a lot different applied. MAC Annemiek (LE, $22.00) is cooler-toned. Guerlain Rose Innocent (LE, $49.50) is pinker, cooler-toned. See comparison swatches . Hollywood Lip Tar ($18.00 for 0.33 fl. oz.) is described as a ‚Äúbeige/gold shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light peachy-beige with a golden sheen. It had mostly opaque color coverage, but it had a very slight translucency that allowed the natural lip color to come through a bit. Like Pleasure Model, I think it is one of the more unforgiving Lip Tars, as it will catch on any imperfections on the lips. This shade also lasted five hours on me. MAC You‚Äôve Got It (LE, $16.00) has a similar sheen but is pinker and sheerer. MAC Warm Companion (LE, $16.00) is sheerer. MAC Secret Lover (LE, $16.00) is cooler-toned.

They‚Äôre pigmented in the sense that they go on like they swatch and look in the pan (but you have to envision the shades mixed/swirled together), but none of them are really dark or bright by the nature of their colors. The quality was consistent across all six shades, which was great. I only noticed that Luminous Flush had a slightly rougher texture for the peachy portion (in places), but it didn‚Äôt affect the application or was something I noticed when applying or wearing the product. COOLEST-TONED: Ethereal Glow (by a long shot!) is the only truly cool-toned shade. Mood Exposure may possibly look cooler-toned on fairer, naturally cooler-toned skin (I can‚Äôt get it to look very plum on me, but in the pan, it looks cooler-toned). LIGHTEST to DARKEST: Ethereal Glow , Dim Infusion , Diffused Heat , Radiant Magenta , Luminous Flush , Mood Exposure LEAST LIKE THE OTHERS: Ethereal Glow A TRIO OF CORALS: Diffused Heat is lighter than Radiant Magenta and Luminous Flush ; Radiant Magenta is brighter, a smidgen lighter, and pinker compared to Luminous Flush . PERSONAL FAVORITES: Four of the six look almost the same on me when applied (I see marginal differences, so they exist), one being a little lighter and less pink, and one doesn‚Äôt really show up, so for me, they‚Äôre really interchangeable since the quality is consistent. If I had to pick, then I would say Diffused Heat and Radiant Magenta . You can see them side-by-side, where you can also move them around into whatever order you‚Äôd like (just click and drag!), in the Swatch Gallery . All but one have sold out during the VIB early access/preview. Sephora notes these will be in-stores beginning February 21st, so I would expect them to release the remaining stock of the shades to all customers somewhere around then for online as well.

It doesn‚Äôt feel gritty in the tube, despite the high shimmer content, initially or as it wears away. On me, the color lasted four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating over time. It is a Viva Glam, limited life, shade, and it is packaged in a metallic red, rubberized tube.

It‚Äôs the more updated, velvety-smooth matte formula that glides on without tugging on the lips but has some shine to the end result for the first hour or so of wear. It was very pigmented, but the thicker consistency made it harder to apply without the thicker consistency gathering and emphasizing lip lines. The color lasted for four and a half to five hours, but there was noticeable settling into lip lines over time. It was neither drying nor hydrating when I wore it.

It had mostly opaque coverage with a lightly creamy consistency that felt wet almost when applied but didn‚Äôt slide around the lips much (there were a few ‚Äúlines‚Äù that were very slightly noticeable if I pressed my lips together, but the color/brightness seem to camouflage them a lot).

It had mostly opaque coverage, though there‚Äôs translucency across the shade so the natural lip color can come through enough to influence the tone, brightness, or color of the end result somewhat if you have stronger natural lip color.

Each eyeshadow is 0.04 oz., which is just shy of the average size of a full-sized eyeshadow (0.05 oz.). Overall, it‚Äôs a nice palette; I only had trouble with a few shades‚Äìthe beige shade having the oddest texture I‚Äôve encountered; crumbly and difficult to blend. All of the more frosted eyeshadows had excellent color payoff, soft, buttery textures, and were easy to apply and blend on the eye. With the exception of the lightest, more matte shade, these eyeshadows wore well for eight to eight and a half hours without fading or creasing. The palette is encased in thick cardboard with ties that hold the lid in place. The Essentials #1 is a soft, yellow-toned beige with a satin finish. I had to really scrape out the product and dust it on to get a swatch of it, because the texture was really strange. When I applied it, the powder would stick to itself and clump up against the skin. Even on the lid, it looks flaky and dry‚Äìcrumbly‚Äìand it was just oddly difficult to use. Urban Decay Broken (LE, $18.00) is a smidgen lighter. MAC Shroom (P, $15.00) is lighter. Estee Lauder Halo (P, $24.00) is a cream product. Make Up For Ever #126 (P, $20.00) is more shimmery. See comparison swatches . The Essentials #2 is a light-medium, white gold with a frosted finish. The texture of this one was very soft, slightly crumbly, but it was workable. I‚Äôd actually recommend trying this with a dampened brush to get a smoother result. Bobbi Brown Sunlight Gold (P, $28.00) is a cream product. MAC Greenluxe #2 (P) is similar. MAC Chilled on Ice (P, $18.50) is a cream product. See comparison swatches . The Essentials #3 is a medium brown with warm, subtly orange undertones and a frosted finish. It was very soft, a little powdery, but it had good color payoff. CoverGirl Melted Caramel (330) (P, $4.99) is darker. Disney by Sephora Palace (LE) is less warm-toned. Disney by Sephora Sultana (LE) is slightly rosy. See comparison swatches . The Essentials #4 is a light-medium, muted brown with subtle warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, and the texture wasn‚Äôt too soft. LORAC Taupe (P) is similar. MAC Soft Brown (P, $15.00) is warmer. Inglot #360 (P, $6.00) is darker. Inglot #337 (P, $6.00) is similar. See comparison swatches . The Essentials #5 is a light-medium taupe with slight warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had nice color payoff, and the texture was soft and buttery. MAC Until Dawn #1 (LE, $21.00) is darker. MAC Vintage Selection (P, $18.50) is a cream product. MAC Era (P, $15.00) is darker. Giorgio Armani Terra Sienna #2 (P) is cooler-toned. Bobbi Brown Heather Brown (LE, $29.00) is similar. See comparison swatches . The Essentials #6 is a medium-dark brown with warm, coppery tones and a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation and a soft, smooth texture. LORAC Gold (P) is more coppery. Bobbi Brown Tiger‚Äôs Eye (LE, $21.00) is very similar. Urban Decay Baked (P, $18.00) is slightly darker. NARS Isolde #2 (P, $24.00) is similar. MAC Love Connection #2 (P, $21.00) is similar. See comparison swatches . The Essentials #7 is a dark, chocolate brown with warm undertones and a smooth, frosted sheen. It had excellent color payoff, and it applied very evenly on the skin. Too Faced Brown Sugar (LE) is similar. MAC Her Cocoa #4 (LE, $15.00) is lighter. MAC Divine Decadence (LE, $15.00) is similar. Inglot #421 (P, $6.00) is very similar. See comparison swatches . The Essentials #8 is a medium-dark, taupe with a soft, frosted sheen and subtle, cool undertones. It had so-so color payoff, but it was buildable. Chanel Gri-Gri (101) (LE, $28.50) is slightly grayer. Urban Decay Juju (LE, $20.00) is similar but a cream product. MAC Vintage Selection (P, $18.50) is a cream product. Giorgio Armani Terra Sienna #2 (P) is cooler-toned. See comparison swatches . The Essentials #9 is a medium-dark, reddish-brown with warm, orange-red undertones and a frosted finish. It had excellent pigmentation, and the texture was soft and buttery. Makeup Geek Blitz (P, $6.99) is slightly less red. MAC Tan (LE, $21.00) is lighter. MAC Take Root (LE, $18.50) is a cream product. Guerlain Les Fauves #1 (LE) is darker. Estee Lauder Violet Underground #2 (LE, $21.00) is slightly redder. Benefit Dandy Brandy (P, $18.00) is similar. See comparison swatches . The Essentials #10 is a cool-toned, deep, dark brown with a frosted finish. It had great color payoff, and the texture was soft and smooth. theBalm Sophisticated (P, $16.00) is less frosted. Urban Decay Muse (LE, $18.00) is similar. Urban Decay Barlust (LE, $18.00) is similar.

Beauty Powders ‚Äúcan be applied as a highlight, soft blush, or overall finish,‚Äù according to MAC. The texture of the powder feels smooth to the touch, and it‚Äôs not rock solid, but it is more firmly pressed in the pan than the last few Beauty Powders, which gave it a slightly chalky, drier consistency that just didn‚Äôt sit or blend out as nicely on the skin. The lighter shade made it more forgiving overall, and the light sheen saves it from looking powdery on the skin. It had semi-sheer, buildable coverage (up to medium), which is in line with how the product is marketed, and it did have a slight brightening/warming effect on my skin (I‚Äôm about NC25/NC30, medium in color). On my skin, the powder lasted seven and a half hours before fading. 15 11 Sunny Surprise 15 11 Sunny Surprise B- Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 7 Product 10 Pigmentation 7 Texture 8 Longevity 4.5 Application 81% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It is one of my least favorite brushes, even for a MAC brush, as it scratchy and rough. It only takes a couple of washings before it loses the majority of its softness. It also sheds. The Guo Pei version is no different, unfortunately. It is pretty to look at but painful to use! The shape is perfect for blush application, as it isn‚Äôt too small or too large with a lightly domed edge, moderate density, and some spring/give. MAC x Guo Pei 213 Eyeshadow Brush ($32.00) is a small, fluffy eyeshadow brush beset for applying, packing, and blending out powder products on the eye. It is also a brush shape that is available in the permanent range (which costs $25.00 normally) that has been specially packaged for the collaboration. I like this brush, but I prefer a lot of others (at similar price points) over it as it is somewhat soft and can be a little rough along the edges. The Guo Pei edition seems to have a better edge than some of my standalones, as it is more even. See more photos &amp; swatches!

The full-sized shade is also the only limited edition/exclusive shade, as the other seven are part of the permanent range. Each Studded Kiss lipstick retails for $21.00 and includes 0.10 oz. or $210.00/oz., which means this set has $79.80 worth of lipstick in it. This year‚Äôs kit seemed to hold up better during application as none of the miniature-sized lipsticks broke while applying. I‚Äôm still testing each shade for wear and the like, but the application and consistency was different in these compared to their full-sized versions (notably, Halo and Nayeon, which had much more glitter and slip).

MAC‚Äôs Powder Blush formula is supposed to be easy to apply, long-wearing, and have ‚Äúfantastic colour.‚Äù It‚Äôs hard to generalize for MAC‚Äôs blush formula, because it varies a lot from shade to shade, even within different types of finishes! Some of them are very good, others are so-so, and a few are complete misses. The more frosted/shimmery shades tend to have the softest and smoothest textures and are easier to apply and blend out on the skin, while more satin and matte shades can sometimes be powdery, firm, or stiff, which makes blending more challenging. The wear is typically between six and nine hours but closer to seven to eight hours on average. Pink Swoon had good color payoff with a soft, blendable texture that wasn‚Äôt too dry or too powdery. It had more of a matte finish, and it was the kind of matte that seemed to darken slightly when applied to skin (if you have very dry skin, it may not darken at all, and if you have very oily skin, it may darken more noticeably). The blush started to fade after eight hours on me. 35 14 Pink Swoon 35 14 Pink Swoon A- Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links MAC Cosmetics Nordstrom Ulta Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges MAC (Canada) Macy's John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil LookFantastic Bloomingdale's Dillard's 9 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 8.5 Longevity 5 Application 91% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

This is such a welcome addition to MAC‚Äôs permanent range; a vibrant coral that isn‚Äôt too orange too pink. I don‚Äôt think it is truly matte, which is the only downside I experienced with the formula. It will wear down to a more matte-like finish after a couple of hours, but it has a more satin-like appearance and consistency. It had rich, opaque color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly, while the consistency was lightly creamy and velvety and never tugged on the lips. This shade lasted for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.

It‚Äôs one of three shades available in the Saks-exclusive Voyage Transatlantique collection, and with my luck, it just sold out online. You may be able to track it down in store if you happen to be near a Saks (or know of one to call‚ÄìI‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll ship it to you as well). There are two other shades‚ÄìCaptain and Yacht‚Äìbut I didn‚Äôt purchase either, so I won‚Äôt have any insight into them. Each shade is paired with nail stickers that can be applied to the nail. Sailor applied beautifully with mostly opaque color coverage (just enough translucency so that it had that squishy, jelly look) in two coats. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with the consistency, as the polish flowed evenly and smoothly across the surface of the nail without bubbling, streaking, or pooling along the edges. It dried down at an average speed but finished with a glossy shine. I typically get a week of wear out of Dior‚Äôs formula with no chipping, just minor tip wear. 68 26 Sailor 68 26 Sailor A Limited Edition Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Neiman Marcus Saks The Bay (CA) Selfridges Bergdorf Goodman Dior Macy's Harrods Harvey Nichols (UK) House of Fraser (UK) John Lewis (UK) Sephora Brazil Bloomingdale's Dillard's 10 Product 9.5 Pigmentation 9 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The blush formula is supposed to ‚Äústay vibrant for a full 24 hours of wear‚Äù with ‚Äúsilky powders‚Äù that ‚Äúblend effortlessly into skin for a flawless, buildable finish.‚Äù The texture of both shades left something to be desired as they were thin, chalky, and difficult to blend. The pigmentation is sheer and only buildable to semi-sheer after three to six layers of product. The marketing makes it unclear what level of pigmentation these should be on Sephora, but per the brand‚Äôs Instagram , they are ‚Äúhighly pigmented.‚Äù These are some of the worst powders I‚Äôve have ever tested from Kat Von D, and it‚Äôs a real disappointment‚Äìand a surprise‚Äìafter the success of the Shade + Light palettes as well as her recent eyeshadows. Both shades lasted no longer than seven hours; not even in the realm of ‚Äúfull 24 hours of wear.‚Äù Oh, and if being a spectacular miss of a product wasn‚Äôt enough frustration, the packaging had issues (across all seven): 1) two of seven compacts had pans that fell out of the plastic compact; 2) the remaining five had loose pans that wobbled and moved (some more than others) within the compact; and 3) all seven were covered in blush residue (not sure why, nothing was broken). Bonnie (Shade) is described as an ‚Äúultra violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a soft, medium-dark raspberry pink with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. The texture was thin, chalky, and difficult to blend out on the skin as the consistency of the blush would stick in one place but not the other (and wouldn‚Äôt want to budge). Trying to build it up at all was extremely difficult; I was almost scraping the product off of the top in order to get enough color to show up on my skin tone. Please note, I am wearing FIVE layers of this product to get it to show up on my face. It was faded and even patchier in appearance after seven hours of wear.

Clyde (Light) is described as a ‚Äúlilac.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light lavender with pink tones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer color payoff with a thin, powdery consistency that wasn‚Äôt quite as dry or as chalky as the darker shade (this is true of most of the duos). It was easier to blend as well, though it wasn‚Äôt foolproof. The matte finish and light color seems to make it the kind of blush that does darken slightly on the skin compared to how light it appears in the pan. It was noticeably faded after seven hours.

FORMULA OVERVIEW | Makeup Geek Eyeshadow ($6.00 for 0.064 oz.) is supposed to be a ‚Äúhighly-pigmented‚Äù powder eyeshadows. They come in a variety of finishes and shades, and the range has some winners but more than a few misses, too, so your mileage may vary from shade to shade. The formula tends to be softer and a little more powdery/dusty as they are not as firmly pressed into their pans, but they aren‚Äôt typically crumbly or so loose that they are prone to breakage. I find the more shimmery shades to be the most consistent in pigmentation, blendability, and wear, while the more neutral-hued matte shades are often finely-milled, blendable, and easy to use. The brighter pops of color, both shimmer and more matte, can run the gamut on quality. Some shades are better built-up than immediately opaque, which can suit some application styles better. The wear tends to fall between seven and eight hours as some shades are more prone to fading as a result of the dustier texture.

The texture was interesting; it was soft, yet there was a slight difference between the light beige (‚ÄúDim‚Äù) and the more coral-hued shade, as the latter felt a little stiffer, but together, I didn‚Äôt really notice a difference in texture. It had true-to-pan color payoff, which could be applied at true intensity or more softly, and then blended out to whatever desired sheerness one wanted. The color is on the lighter end of the spectrum, so it is a shade better suited for lighter complexions. It just barely shows up on my medium complexion, and I‚Äôm about NC25/NC30 for reference. I get just a little warmth and color, which can work, but it‚Äôll depend on what you‚Äôre after in terms of blush colors. The texture didn‚Äôt emphasize pores and had a fair amount of sheen.

They‚Äôre supposed to be a lip-and-cheek multi-tasking product with a ‚Äúcreamy, lightweight formula that delivers buildable, long-lasting, hydrating color for lips and cheeks.‚Äù Application makes a difference: if you want sheerer color from the get-go, apply wet, and if you want color truest to what you see in the tube, use dry. I preferred to use a stippling brush to grab color from the tube and then to apply on the face (so not directly from the tube). I‚Äôve worked my way through four of them (reviews for all to come) so far, and Altai was the first one I tried. Three of the shades in the range can be thought of as closer to traditional bronzers or cream contour sticks‚ÄìAltai is the lightest, followed by Vientiane and Cappadoce. All seven shades have a satin-matte finish‚Äìa very tiny amount of sheen to keep it the finish from being a really flat matte, but it‚Äôs not shimmery or a true satin finish either. The other four shades are the more traditional blush shades, but as always, ‚Äúrules‚Äù (or even ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù) are made to be broken, so any shades can be used on cheeks or lips. I don‚Äôt like these on lips at all; I find them uncomfortable, a little clingy, and just drying from start to finish. For me, they‚Äôre really hard to even wear and test on lips, because I can feel them sitting on the lips in a way that‚Äôs bothersome. Like the regular Multiples, it‚Äôs not a product I would wear on lips, as the product clings and dries out lips. On cheeks, they work a lot better, and I felt like the biggest takeaway was really how blendable the textures were. They remain blendable for a couple of minutes, so you don‚Äôt have to feel too rushed, but they won‚Äôt move around a lot. The texture feels silicone-like, almost velvety, light to medium weight, and smooth. So far, the wear has ranged from seven to nine hours. They wear well over as well as under liquid foundation, and of course, do well over bare skin. I noticed that if you need to blend a lot (e.g. Siam is very, very intense in color and pigmentation), it will be problematic applied over foundation, but if you only do light to moderate blending, it is fine. The original Multiples were one of the more expensive NARS products in the range, and the original range is $39.00 and contain 0.50 oz. The Matte Multiples still cost $39 a pop, but they contain a mere 0.26 oz. The tube is the same length, but it is noticeably skinnier. It‚Äôs such a drastic difference in size, so it‚Äôs disappointing to see the price remain the same despite a size reduction of nearly 50%. Will one tube last awhile? Absolutely. Does a tube of intensely pigmented lipstick last longer than a sheer tube of lipstick? Absolutely‚Äìbut you don‚Äôt usually see a drastic size reduction/price difference in the same formula just because one is more pigmented than the other. I definitely think that there have been improvements in the formula‚Äìit feels smoother, less dry overall‚Äìcompared to the original formula, but whether it‚Äôs worth it is for you to decide. They‚Äôre online at narscosmetics.com as well as Sephora (but will be available wherever NARS is sold soon). Altai Matte Multiple ($39.00 for 0.26 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúrose bronze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, warm-toned peach-brown with orange undertones and a satin-matte finish. It was intensely pigmented, though it was easily softened and sheered out (even with a dry application) if desired. The texture is creamy, smooth, and very blendable, and this particular shade seemed to wear well for about seven hours on the cheeks and three hours on the lips. Guerlain Moyen Brunettes (05) (LE, $75.00) is darker. Clarins Splendours (LE, $35.00) is more orange. NARS Silvana (P, $29.00) is more shimmery. NARS Madly (P, $29.00) is browner, more shimmery. MAC Harmony (P, $21.00) is browner. MAC Refined Golden (P, $25.00) is darker.

They‚Äôve since released twelve shades, though they say online exclusive at the moment. The official release date is later on in April. I‚Äôll be reviewing both shades I bought, and this is the first one up! YSL Fuchsia Desinvolte (01) Baby Doll Kiss and Blush ($40.00 for 0.33 fl. oz.) is a bright, medium fuchsia with cool, blue undertones. Milani Love Potion (07) (LE, $7.99) is a powder, lighter. Clinique Berry Pop (03) (P, $21.00) is a powder, slightly warmer. NARS Coeur Battant (LE, $29.00) is a powder, brighter. Tom Ford Beauty Narcissist (LE, $55.00) is a powder, more shimmery. See comparison swatches . ( Here are some possible dupes for this shade as a lip color. The new formula is supposed to work on cheeks and lips, and the texture is described as an ‚Äúair whipped mousse‚Äù and has a ‚Äúsoft matte finish.‚Äù The color is supposed to be buildable. Now, I‚Äôm often unimpressed by two-in-one products, because it usually doesn‚Äôt excel in both areas, just one (or worst case scenario, neither), but YSL has something special here. It‚Äôs packaged in a square, glass bottle with a long, cylindrical cap, so it looks nail polish-esque, but when you twist and open, it is a little reminiscent of the Glossy Stains . The applicator is tapered and spongy with a fair amount of give without being floppy. The texture was very, very different from Glossy Stains as it never turns thick. Instead, the consistency is thin and felt like a cross between velvet and gel, and it turns into a creamy powder as it blends with the skin and dries to a satin-matte finish. On lips, it stayed rather glossy before eventually wearing down, but I waited before shooting the lip swatch photos, expecting it to dry fairly matte, yet it didn‚Äôt. I felt like I had a workable amount of time to apply and blend the color as a blush, and once it‚Äôs on, it stayed on for nine hours. It was easy to pat and blend on the skin, whether bare or over foundation, and though it‚Äôs quite pigmented and a little goes a long way, it was very forgiving. This shade seemed to stain my cheeks slightly, as there was some pinkness even after I removed the color, and it did the same on lips (but a little more staining). When I wore it as a lip color, it lasted well for six and a half hours. More surprising was that my lips weren‚Äôt dried out‚ÄìI wouldn‚Äôt describe this as hydrating really, but it kept my lips feeling about the same over time. It does have a sweet, mango and grape scent (reminds me of Glossy Stains ), though it seemed subtler than some of their other lipstick formulas (like Rouge Volupte ).

Depending on the lighting, it looked pinker and less pink/more true coral. I could walk into one room and see the pink tones, and then walk into another room and lose them almost entirely. I think if you have stronger pink undertones (compared to my yellow), it may stay pinker-toned on you, but the undertone is definitely warm. Clinique Peach Pop (02) (P, $21.00) is darker. Tarina Tarantino Feather (P, $25.00) is lighter. Tarte Crave (LE, $26.00) is darker, pinker. NARS Day Dream (LE, $29.00) is slightly darker. Too Faced Melt Into Spring (LE) is darker, less shimmery.

This shade seems to fall in-between Diffused Heat and Radiant Magenta ; they‚Äôre not dupes when swatched, but on, they look more similar than dissimilar. The powder had a soft, smooth texture that wasn‚Äôt too powdery (and less powdery than others in the range). It blended effortlessly on the skin, so it was easy to apply and nearly impossible to overdo! The color coverage seemed true-to-pan, and the color could be built up in thin layers or applied more intensely from the get-go. I didn‚Äôt see any visible sparkle, just a satiny sheen that gave a glow and sheen to the skin without emphasizing pores. The color wore well for eight and a half hours before beginning to decline in intensity. 167 38 Luminous Flush 167 38 Luminous Flush A Permanent Where to Buy Affiliate Links Nordstrom Sephora Hourglass Space NK Bergdorf Goodman Net-A-Porter Barneys Sephora Brazil Space NK (UK) 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 9.5 Texture 9 Longevity 5 Application 96% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

The texture was rather stiff in the pan; the kind of texture where little powder comes off the surface, so I had to use a denser brush and really jab at the surface to get enough color to show up on my skin tone.

In May, the brand added twenty new shades to its range for a total of forty-two. The formula is rose-scented but has no discernible taste for me. The consistency is creamy, light-to-medium in weight, comfortable to wear, and moderately moisturizing. Dolce &amp; Gabbana Mandorla (125) Classic Cream Lipstick ($33.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúbeige pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, muted peach with a creamy, natural finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, and the consistency applied easily over the lips without tugging or dragging. It didn‚Äôt have too much slip, though, so the color stayed in place well. This shade lasted for four hours on me, which is average and not particularly long-wearing for me. Too Faced Country Star (P, $22.00) is glossier, slightly darker. Chanel Satisfaction (89) (P, $34.00) is pinker, sheerer. Chanel Charmeuse (142) (LE, $34.00) is more shimmery. MAC Close Contact (LE, $16.00) is a touch darker. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Dolce &amp; Gabbana Petal (135) Classic Cream Lipstick ($33.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúneutral lilac rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, warm-toned rose with a natural sheen. It had nearly full color coverage, but you could see a shadow of my lip freckle. It glided on across the lips without dragging and felt comfortable to wear without being too slick. It wore well for four and a half hours on me. Givenchy Nude Guipure (106) (P, $36.00) is similar. Estee Lauder Dynamic (P, $30.00) is brighter. Marc Jacobs Beauty Flirt (144) (LE, $30.00) is lighter. NARS Descanso (LE, $25.00) is warmer. NARS Sex Machine (P, $25.00) is pinker, more matte. MAC Shy Shine (P, $16.00) is lighter. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Dolce &amp; Gabbana Dahlia (320) Classic Cream Lipstick ($33.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúred wine.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, dark berry-red with subtle cool undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, intense color payoff that applied well without settling into lip lines or feathering over time. The consistency was lightly creamy, so it had good glide, but it didn‚Äôt slip around once applied. This shade lasted for seven hours and left a stain behind, though neither are surprising given how rich and dark this shade is. MAC Primrose (LE, $16.00) is sheerer. Inglot #293 Lipstick Cream (P, $12.00) is glossier. Laura Mercier Myth (P, $24.00) is lighter, warmer. Givenchy Violine Precieux (312) (LE, $36.00) is lighter. Illamasqua Shard (P, $24.00) is more matte. MAC Sweet Succulence (LE, $16.00) is warmer. NARS Palais Royal (P, $25.00) is more matte, redder.

As always, thank you for your support! Dupes by Palette You can know get all dupes for shades within a single palette, like Viseart Boheme Dream , all at once instead of searching shade-by-shade; you can also refine the results to specific price points or by brand to compare to your stash more ‚Äúat a glance‚Äù for a palette. Palette vs. Palette You can now compare any two palettes that we have in the database to see if any shades from Palette A are known dupes from Palette B (or vice versa), so you can see how much overlap, if any, there might be. (Note: if the exact same shade, like MAC Carbon, actually repeats in both palettes, that will not come up as a dupe.) You can compare duos, quads, palettes, and even sets (like an eyeliner set). If you just want to compare any two specific shades, you can already do that through our compare any two swatches tool here .</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2016-05-10 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>22ba-4292-bd9f</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>f4987b334a3d4dc380d7cee04876648d8cd4bda0</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Sneak Peek: ColourPop Monochromatic Collections Photos &amp; Swatches</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://www.temptalia.com/sneak-peek-colourpop-monochromatic-collections-photos-swatches/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Sneak Peek: ColourPop Monochromatic Collections Photos &amp; Swatches Sample Features Mar 27, 2017 March 27, 2017 ColourPop's Latest Sand, Pink, Nectar Collections ColourPop recently released three Monochromatic-themed collections in Sand, Pink, and Nectar!

I think for someone who likes a bluish, smoky eye, this might be an interesting palette. I love a silver/gray-shot blue, because it‚Äôs a nice variation on blue that is noticeable but never feels over-the-top. The quality is good overall, though the blue shade was the worst-performing (but not a miss). The entire quad, though visually they don‚Äôt seem particularly small, contains less product than most palettes/quads (including the regular U.S. version of quads). Baked formulations often weigh less than more traditional powder formulas do, but it‚Äôs hard to say if it contains as many uses as the regular quads. Tisse Riviera #1 is described as a ‚Äúmetallic blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, almost gray-tinted, medium-dark blue with a soft, frosted finish. It had fairly good color payoff, though the texture was a touch powdery. The color wore well for nine hours before fading. Divergent Erudite Sapphire (LE) is darker. MAC A Sprinkle of Blues #2 (P, $21.00) is less shimmery. MAC Bleuluxe #2 (P) is more shimmery. Disney by Sephora Friend Like Me (LE) is warmer, brighter. Clinique Big Blue (P, $17.00) is a cream product. Tom Ford Beauty Cobalt Rush #2 (P) is darker. theBalm Matt Horowitz (LE, $16.00) is darker, less shimmery. Urban Decay Strip (DC, $18.00) is more metallic, lighter. MAC Bright Moon (LE, $21.00) is lighter. MAC Showgirl (LE, $21.00) Chanel Destination (LE, $36.00) is a cream product. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Tisse Riviera #2 is described as a ‚Äúlight pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light pink with very subtle golden shimmer that makes it appear almost warm-toned. It had mostly opaque color coverage, but it did apply very smoothly and blended beautifully on the skin. On me, the color stayed on well for eight and a half hours. MAC Rose Blend #1 (LE) is less shimmery, darker. MAC Eggplant Blend #1 (LE) is darker. Ulta Pink (P, $10.00) is more shimmery. bareMinerals Strawberry Mousse (LE, $14.00) is more matte. Tom Ford Beauty Seductive Rose #1 (P) is more shimmery. MAC Fair Sex (LE, $15.00) is similar. Kat Von D Instaglam (LE) is more metallic. Marc Jacobs Beauty The Tease #3 (P) is lighter. Chanel Variation #1 (P) is more matte. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Tisse Riviera #3 is described as a ‚Äúshimmering grey.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, silvery taupe with subtle cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had fairly good pigmentation, but it could have been just slightly more pigmented right off the bat, though it is buildable on the lid. The color didn‚Äôt show signs of creasing until after nine hours of wear. MAC Stormy Sunset (LE, $15.00) is darker. Disney by Sephora Kill Joy (LE) is darker. Urban Decay Verve (LE, $18.00) is brighter, warmer. Chanel Variation #2 (P) is browner. Bobbi Brown Rockstar (LE, $22.00) is browner. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Tisse Riviera #4 is described as a ‚Äúdeep navy blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark black with subtle warm undertones. (I think the description got messed up for this one, because it‚Äôs not blue at all.) It had good color payoff, and the texture was really soft, blendable, and not at all powdery. On me, it wore well for nine and a half hours before starting to fade. LORAC Navy #7 (LE) is lighter. MAC Cool Companions #3 (LE) is warmer. NARS Sycorax (P, $29.00) is cooler-toned. Sleek MakeUP Acid #12 (P, $9.99) is darker. Chanel Jardin Zen #4 (LE) is warmer.

Formula Overview $19.00/0.12 oz. - $158.33 Per Ounce Per the brand, the new formula is supposed to be "the creamiest, most cushiony and unbelievably pigmented lipstick to ever cross your lips" that is "comfortable" to wear. I don't know if the brand has actually tried the plethora of other lipsticks on the market, because I can tell you that after swatching all 40 shades back-to-back, these are nowhere near "the creamiest" or "most cushiony" or even "unbelievably pigmented." They were, on average, much creamier than the original formula, but a fair number of shades were firm and dense enough that short strokes was better for application otherwise there was noticeable tugging. Some shades were pigmented, some shades were uneven or sheer. The mid-tone shades seemed to be the best overall in terms of application, pigmentation, and how they looked on the lips, whereas the shimmery shades were often sheerer, gritty, and drying while the deeper, vampy shades were lacking pigmentation and could apply streakily. They seemed to have longer wear than most lipsticks (five to eight hours) but have been lightly to intensely drying, depending on the shade, and I found that wearing them back-to-back made the drying aspect more pronounced. They had a strong, sweet, burnt sugar kind of scent that was noticeable when initially applied, but I didn't detect during wear. I did not review all shades in the original Studded Kiss formula as it wasn't feasible for me to purchase all of those at the time, and after trying what I did purchase, they weren't promising (often very dry, stiff, and painful to use with a drying formula). From what I can tell, some are better (see: LUV (Original) vs. LUV (New) ; Coven (Original) vs. Coven (New) ), some are worse (see: Gold Blooded (Original) vs. Gold Blooded (New) ; Poe (Original) vs. Poe (New) ). The shimmery shades seemed worse for the reformulation, and the glittery shades are like the grittiest sandpaper across one's lips; I felt like I was ripping my lips off when applying both Gold Blooded and Piaf with Poe not being far behind.

It was one of the most matte shades in the range, and while the color can be worn alone, it was also included in the range to be mixed with other shades. It was a terrible mixing shade, as it was just so dry that it did not blend and merge with other colors well. It had a tendency to cake up on the lips when I used it as a base, and it just stuck to my finger if I tried patting it on top of something else. When I tried to use a lip brush, it was a bit better, but it was still difficult to get the shade to go on evenly and blend with whatever I wanted to layer it with. On its own, it lasted for four hours but settled into my lip lines quite a bit and was drying. Frankly, it was easier to wear it alone than it was to mix with anything else as the texture was just so stiff.

The texture was drier, firmer, and dense, which made it difficult to apply to the lips as it tugged a lot and did not lay down color evenly. I had issues with getting product to adhere well to the center of my lips (where it can be wetter), which only made the end result worse.

They‚Äôre easily combined with other eyeshadows in your stash, but they worked well together as a duo. Both shades were easy to use, good quality, and long-wearing. As a heads up, Presto was featured in a limited edition holiday gift set last year (see my post here ); Flicker was featured in a holiday palette from 2012 (which I don‚Äôt recall reviewing). Presto is described as a ‚Äúcool champagne sheen.‚Äù It‚Äôs a golden champagne with subtle warm undertones and a pearly sheen. I kind of get what they mean by ‚Äúcool champagne,‚Äù but it‚Äôs still a warmer shade. It had good color payoff with a soft, smooth texture that was blendable and lasted for eleven hours before creasing slightly. YSL Saharienne #1 (P) is lighter. Chanel Quadrille #2 (LE) is more beige. MAC Greenluxe #1 (P) is lighter. MAC Shroom (P, $15.00) is more beige, darker. MAC Ricepaper (P, $15.00) is similar. MAC Femme-Fi (LE, $15.00) is lighter. Estee Lauder Halo (P, $24.00) is a cream product. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Flicker is described as an ‚Äúantique bronze.‚Äù It‚Äôs an earthy, olive brown with a subtle green sheen. It had good pigmentation, and the texture was soft and dense, though it was just a bit powdery. It wore well for almost twelve hours before fading. MAC Olive Blend #3 (LE) is cooler-toned. Too Faced Buche de Noel (LE, $16.00) is darker. Urban Decay Stash (LE, $18.00) is greener. Dior Bonne Etoile (384) #3 (LE) is darker. MAC Sumptuous Olive (P, $15.00) is slightly greener.

It had a denser, creamier consistency with less slip and shine compared to most of the Liptensity range. It had nearly full color payoff in a single layer, and the color did not appear streaky, though there was slight color that settled into my lip lines. The lipstick wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating. Top Dupes Formula Overview Ingredients Top Dupes View Swatches View All Dupes Colour Pop Choker (LE, $5.00) is darker (95% similar).

The formula didn‚Äùt have a lot of slip, and it was actually lightly tacky, which helped it stay in place better.

It had semi-opaque color coverage, so the natural lip color came through but it was visible. The shimmer is on the lighter side, so it is more in the background with this particular shade. Applied, the color didn‚Äôt settle too much into lip lines, but the sheerer nature of such a dark shade made it so it didn‚Äôt look that even on, either. The gloss felt lightweight, non-sticky, and was lightly hydrating, while it lasted for three and a half hours on me.

It seems to darken and even out my natural lip color slightly while adding a touch of shine. I don‚Äôt know of a really worthwhile dupe (something that is more in the ‚Äútinted lip balm‚Äù family), given that this is an ultra-hydrating formula with such subtle color. If you like the idea of the color but want a true gloss: see comparison swatches . Generally speaking, it‚Äôs a shimmery version of the brand‚Äôs original‚Äìand top selling‚ÄìAgave Lip Mask. The original was designed as a treatment that could be applied at night, but many used it during the day, as well, so I suspect this was a way of adding a little oomph to a day time version. You can read my review on the original formula here . Bite also repackaged the Agave Lip Mask, both the original and Champagne, with a softer plastic tube, so it is easier to squeeze out the product. The lip balm itself is quite thick, so it never oozes out easily, but hopefully those who experienced cracking tubes will not experience that with the new packaging (my original, old packaging tube still hasn‚Äôt had any issues, on my end). I found the shimmery version to perform very similarly to the original. The consistency is thick, tacky, and long-wearing (there‚Äôs a thin layer still noticeably there after eight to ten hours of wear), though it goes on smoothly and keeps lips feeling comfortable. It has a sweet scent and taste. It‚Äôs hydrating and helps improve the health of my lips if they‚Äôve taken a beating (err, swatching). I was surprised that it didn‚Äôt add a lot of genuine shine to the lips‚Äìit was a very natural-looking shine, and overall, very subtle. 70 25 Champagne 70 25 Champagne A Where to Buy Affiliate Links Sephora Sephora (Australia) 9.5 Product 10 Pigmentation 8.5 Texture 10 Longevity 4.5 Application 94% Total We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

It had semi-opaque color payoff but is prone to sheering ouot, so it seems to apply mostly as a wash. To build it up, you really have to wait between layers.

Dior Reveuse (271) Diorshow Fusion Mono Eyeshadow ($30.00 for 0.22 oz.) is a medium-dark, navy blue with a sparkly, frosted finish. It seemed pigmented, but it had a rather chunky/gritty texture that made the color/sparkle flake away. As it dried down, flakes of blue came off the lid and landed underneath my eye (this was in the first five minutes or less). It continued throughout the nine hours I wore it, and though it didn‚Äôt crease, it progressively faded as the color flaked away. It was a very odd experience, as I can‚Äôt remember many eyeshadows flaking away. MAC A Sprinkle of Blues #3 (P, $21.00)is lighter, powder.

It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently but could have been a little more even‚Äìthere were areas where the color seemed almost grainy and a little patchy to my eye along with a minor amount of color that sank into my lip lines. The crayon had a moderately emollient, creamy texture that was easy to glide across the lips but a lip liner or lip brush would be recommended for crisper edges. On me, the color lasted for five and a half hours, left a subtle stain behind, and was hydrating.

It had good color payoff in a single layer, though it was not quite opaque. The more emollient texture made it more of a challenge to apply along my inner portion of my lips, where I felt the lipstick just did not adhere as evenly or as nicely as to other areas of my lips. It was, of course, comfortable to use and felt hydrating while worn. This shade stayed on well for five hours but feathered along the edges (which is not something I tend to experience often).

The new pressed eyeshadow formula has a SeaNutritive Mineral Complex that gives the shadow a ‚Äúcreamy, silky smooth‚Äù texture with ‚Äúseamless blendability‚Äù and ‚Äústay-true color.‚Äù It‚Äôs supposed to be long-wearing whether worn alone or with primer‚Äìyou shouldn‚Äôt see any creasing or fading. I‚Äôve tested various combinations of shades from the duos and quads, and I‚Äôve happily achieved ten hours of solid wear without a primer underneath. For a review of the packaging, please read my original review . Mixologist is a really pale, orange-peach with a metallic sheen. It has a silky smooth texture, but it doesn‚Äôt translate as well when worn‚Äìit does go on uneven in places. I‚Äôm being nitpicky, because it‚Äôs not a big deal at all, but I wanted to point it out. The level of shimmer and sheen makes this look a lot lighter on than it does in the pan (where it retains more of its peachy color). Inglot #393 is yellower, while Inglot #353 is matte. Cognac is bronzy brown with a metallic-frost finish that has a bright sheen. There is a subtle red-brown undertone. The texture is phenomenal‚Äìsuper smooth, buttery, and dense‚Äìand the color payoff is even better, with really rich, opaque color. It is similar to MAC Woodwinked and Inglot #406 . bareMinerals The Top Shelf Eyeshadow Duo Review, Photos, Swatches - Recommended We hope you'll consider supporting Temptalia by shopping through our links below.

Formula Overview $37.00/0.12 oz. - $308.33 Per Ounce The Rouge Coco formula is supposed to have "full coverage with a creamy yet lightweight finish" that is also hydrating. The coverage was semi-sheer to semi-opaque with the occasional shade being closer to full coverage, but it would not be a formula I'd recommend to someone looking for truly opaque pigmentation out of their lip color. Where the formula excels is in the more luminous finish--a soft sheen without the slipperiness of a gloss--that often is forgiving on the lips. The texture is lightweight, smooth, and comfortable to wear and to apply. The formula ranged from lightly hydrating to lightly drying with most somewhere between non-drying and lightly hydrating. The lipstick lasted two to four hours on me but reapplies well. They have a rosy scent but no discernible taste. Browse all of our Chanel Rouge Coco Lipstick (2015) swatches .

I‚Äôm a regular (online) window shopper of all the usual suspects‚Äô ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs new‚Äù sections. Has anyone tried these? Would love your thoughts! Laura Mercier Moisture Supreme Foundation ($42.00) seems like it would make for a good fall/winter foundation for those with drier skin. I‚Äôm curious on whether it moisturizes without feeling heavy. Tom Ford Jasmin Rouge and Santal Blush ($195.00 each) are new scents from the Private Blend collection, which I‚Äôve enjoyed several scents from. Both sound interesting enough and will definitely have to take a sniff next time I‚Äôm at Nordstrom. Giorgio Armani Jacquard Face Palette ($55.00) has an interesting pattern, but I‚Äôm wondering how practical it is as an actual face palette‚Äìwill that strip of color be too small to be of use? Or will it yield a barely-there rosy flush? Dior Graphic Berry Le Vernis ($22.00) looks so vibrant and decadent in the bottle, and I just want to know if it comes anywhere near that in real life. Bobbi Brown Hydrating Rich Cream Cleanser ($26.00) sounds just like the kind of texture I like in a cleanser‚ÄìI‚Äôm all about a rich, thicker cream cleanser that doesn‚Äôt leave the skin feeling tight or stripped.

It appeared a lot darker and more peach-toned in the pan but all I could see swatched and applied to my cheeks was gold. The texture had a smooth, moderately firm feel to it, and it took a heavier hand to get product onto my brush (or alternatively, use a denser brush). I had no trouble diffusing or blending out the edges of the highlighter on my skin, though, and there was no excess product kicked up in the pan as it was denser. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer but easily worn at sheerer coverage if desired.

Formula Overview $8.00/0.23 oz. - $34.78 Per Ounce The powder highlighter is supposed to have a "high-shine" finish with "high colour intensity." In general, ColourPop's pressed highlighter powders have a smooth, moderately dense texture that was soft enough to be picked up easily by a brush but not kick up any powder in the pan. The formula was semi-opaque to opaque but easily sheered out for less shine and coverage if desired. There were a few shades within the range that emphasized my skin's natural texture slightly but most did not. The wear ranged from seven and a half hours to nine hours.

It gave my lips a slightly darker, pinker look but did not add a lot of color or coverage. It had sheer coverage, which wasn‚Äôt buildable, that lasted for two hours. The consistency was smooth, jelly-like, and comfortable to wear. The formula was hydrating over time. The Crystal Glaze Gloss formula is supposed to be an ‚Äúultra-moisturizing gloss‚Äù that has ‚Äúan intense, glossy shine.‚Äù The texture was soft, smooth, and almost jelly-like‚Äìbut denser and not quite as slippery. It felt balm-like on the lips and had no tackiness at all (completely unlike most of their gloss formulas) and had a very light vanilla scent. MAC recently released this formula in their Makeup Art Cosmetics collection, and it‚Äôs part of the upcoming Work It Out launch that debuts on Thursday. However, only one of the six new, limited shades for Work It Out is described as sheer, and the formula runs sheer, which is where it falls the shortest. This formula is best for someone who likes tinted gloss that‚Äôs hydrating and non-sticky but not someone who wants noticeable coverage. I‚Äôll definitely check back on the official description (to see if it changes) when these officially launch, though.

The consistency was lightly creamy with enough slip that it glided over lips without tugging or dragging, and it was comfortable to both wear and apply. I didn‚Äôt have any issues getting a smoother, even edge when applying directly from the tube either. It wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.

ColourPop Fetch Lippie Stix ($5.00 for 0.0357 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúperfect mid-tone warm pink [with a satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium pink with very subtle warm tones. It almost looks cool-toned on me at times. It had full color coverage and went on evenly, though the texture was drier than Brills so I found it a little drying at the end of wear. The texture of the product doesn‚Äôt feel dry or stiff, so there‚Äôs no dragging during application. All in all, the color wore well for four and a half hours. NARS Marisa (P, $32.00) is cooler-toned. Givenchy Hibiscus Exclusif (302) (P, $36.00) is darker, warmer. Bite Beauty Damask (LE, $28.00) is warmer, glossier.

Get comparison swatches / compare dupes side-by-side . The Super Shock Cheek formula is a cream-based blush that will have the most intense pigmentation when applied with fingertips and lesser, more buildable coverage when used with a brush (the more feathery or less dense the brush, the sheerer the coverage). A little goes a ridiculously long way when it comes to this shade, as it is intensely pigmented: a mere pat of the fingertip on the surface is enough for semi-sheer coverage. The shimmer is a lot more visible on the skin than it has been in other shimmery blushes I‚Äôve seen from ColourPop, so it‚Äôs nice to see the finish actually show up on the skin. It had a wetter, more emollient and cream-like consistency compared to other Super Shock Cheek shades I‚Äôve tried, which made it easier to apply and very, very blendable on the skin, but it didn‚Äôt slide all over the place. This shade wore well for almost ten hours on me. P.S. ‚Äî ColourPop just tweeted that they‚Äôre doing a 24-hour flash sale on their foursomes (now $16, regularly $20) and the Not a Box of Chocolates (now $24, regularly $30).

Lipstick ($36.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as an ‚Äúapricot nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peach with a hint of pink and warm undertones. It had a very fine pearly sheen that gave it a more luminous finish that wasn‚Äôt too glossy. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightly creamy consistency that glided on well and wore comfortably for three hours on me. Colour Pop Button (P, $5.00) is more matte. Bite Beauty Leche (P, $24.00) is similar. Bite Beauty Amaretto (P, $24.00) is more matte, lighter. NARS Raquel (P, $32.00) is lighter. NARS Barbara (P, $32.00) is pinker.

Chanel Antoinette (406) Rouge Coco Lipstick ($36.00 for 0.12 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúshimmering tawny brown.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rich, copper-red with warm, rusty red tones and a fine golden shimmer. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered evenly and applied smoothly. The texture of the lipstick is lightly creamy with enough slip to glide on without tugging on the lips but doesn‚Äôt slide around. On me, it wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time. NARS Femme Fleur (LE, $26.00) is browner. NARS Leslie (P, $32.00) is less shimmery. Kat Von D Thin Lizzy (P, $21.00) is more matte. MAC Rusty (LE, $20.00) is redder. MAC Sheer Plum (P, $16.00) is sheerer, browner. Dior Belle de Nuit (LE, $32.00) is similar.

It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied fairly evenly and didn‚Äôt feather or bleed over the four and a half hours it lasted. Bite Beauty #001 (Reformulation) (LE, $36.00) is darker. NARS Bette (P, $32.00) is darker, cooler-toned. NARS Jeanne (P, $32.00) is very similar (it is funny that they share the same name). NARS Olivia (P, $32.00) is brighter, lighter.

It‚Äôs an incredibly warm-toned, orange-copper palette with a lot of metallic finishes. There were three mattes in the palette and one satin, while the rest were pearly to metallic. First Impressions The formula used in this palette felt comparable to the Pressed Powder Shadow formula I‚Äôm familiar with‚Äìsoft, blendable, pigmented, and long-wearing. There were a couple of shades, like Level Up and Rule Breaker that had some larger sparkles that seemed to migrate more than ideal when blended but didn‚Äôt have tons of fallout. I think that the inclusion of the black eyeshadow (Let‚Äôs Do It) throws the palette off visually‚Äìit‚Äôs just so deep, dark, and ‚Äúcool‚Äù in comparison to the rest of the palette. I think a really deep brown or plum might have given contrast and more versatility. The black eyeshadow tended to overwhelm the other shades from my experience using the palette.
