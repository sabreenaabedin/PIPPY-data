She tells her audience of her desire to progress in her career, and the sense of entitlement that her boss felt that he had to her, as he responded to her concerns by asking for sexual favors. Before continuing, Carlson makes sure to clarify that sexual harassment does't discriminate, stating that a person can be young or old, wearing a short skirt or hospital scrubs, married or single, or anything else. In part, she says this is because sexual harassment is more about a control of power than it is about sex. In 2016, Carlson came forward with her own allegations, unsure of what the response would be, and what exactly her future would hold. After she did so, a number of women came forward to share their experiences with her as well, many of whom were blacklisted from the industries they worked in for seeking help. It's these stories that pushed Carlson to do more about it, in hopes that women will one day be able to come forward without facing unjust repercussions. By recounting her own experiences, as well as those from the women who reached out to her, Carlson shows the prevalence of sexual harassment in the workplace, and how myths surrounding the women who come forward continue to hold progression back. After pointing this out, Carlson highlights three steps that would help to prevent it. The first is to turn bystanders into allies, as it's rare that witnesses to these crimes ever come forward. The second is to change the laws, to give victims and witnesses the backing that they need to appropriately defend themselves. Finally, the third is to stand up and speak out, despite how scary it might be, so that sexual harassment in the workplace isn't left unchecked."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/rileyvonn"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Nov 10, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"d9aa3b9b1b3bdfa44209f3bb8f2e59b6e9c517c1"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["'Chatbooks' Allows Users to Easily Print Digitally Captured Memories"],"Title":["Printed Memory Books"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/chatbooks","Text":["'Chatbooks' is designed for scrapbook lovers who want to easily create printed books filled with the photos and memories captured on their phones.

Elaine Robinson, Innovation Programme Manager at Electric Ireland, spoke to Trend Hunter about pushing innovation in such an environment. TH: Tell us about yourself and your role. ER: I actually spent the last 20 years in telecoms, and I just moved in the last couple months to the incumbent utility provider in Ireland. But before that, I started off my career with Ericsson, and I traveled the world with them. Then I moved to a startup mobile company in Ireland where I was one of the first employees, and we built that up to over a million customers, so that was really exciting. My background was in technical, so I was very much on the engineering and network management side of the business. But then I did an MBA and realized that the world doesn’t revolve around technology; it revolves around sales, marketing, and — most importantly — the customer. So then I moved into product development, where I’ve spent the last ten years. Then a few months ago I decided to get out of telco, and I moved into the energy industry. So I’m now in the innovation business unit, working with a range of organizations here in Ireland. Driving decarbonization is a huge part of our strategy — essentially encouraging customers to use less of our product — but on the plus side, we’re working towards saving the planet! [laughs] How do you and your team generate great ideas? Do you have certain rituals to make creativity happen? For a company to be truly innovative, there must be a way to capture ideas from everywhere — not only from within the innovation department. Anyone within the company should feel they have the opportunity to bring their ideas to the table and have them suitably assessed by the right people. And then a company must have their finger on the pulse with respect to what’s happening in the wider environment. Innovation might happen in that you’re taking someone else’s idea and adapting it for your own business model, process, or product. So I think innovation has to come both internally and externally. We don’t have explicit rituals to capture innovation per se; it’s more about creating a culture where people are given a voice and encouraged to share their ideas. What are some barriers to innovation? How do you get around them? For innovation to really work, the senior management has to buy into it. Unless you have that top table support, it’s not going to work: \"business as usual\" and all the technical priorities will always get done first, before innovation. Without this support, it is almost impossible to be truly innovative. After that, it’s culture. It’s about having an appetite for risk, a culture within the organization that’s open to new ideas, and people doing things that aren’t necessarily related to the bottom line or their day jobs. I’m lucky to work for a company that believes in and encourages innovation. How do you identify trends? What resources do you and your team use to spot trends and insights? The challenge for some of the large companies that I’ve worked for is that we tend to look within our own industry, and in the new world, we need to be more open to what’s happening in adjacent industries or even completely unrelated industries. That takes time, and it’s not easy. It’s important that time is made for innovation and for looking at what’s happening in other industries. Within the innovation team, it’s our role to lead that. There needs to be the wider innovation focus in the company as a whole, but the innovation team needs to be responsible for gathering those ideas, prioritizing, filtering, and then channeling the black art of picking out the ideas that you think might actually go somewhere. Has there ever been an instance where another industry has influenced an innovation at your company? Absolutely! And I think it’s important to recruit people from other industries so you can steal really good ideas [laughs]. In my personal experience, I’m coming from a telco environment, and I’ve moved into the utility and energy environment. I don’t think I’m being too controversial when I say the telco industry is maybe five years ahead of the utility companies with regards to the pace of change and the customer focus. So I’ve been able to bring some of the thinking from the telco world into my current role. What are some examples of things you can do to create a culture of innovation? When people have come up with ideas, we’ve empowered them to go ahead and pursue them. In the wider organization, there are opportunities to take time out of their day job and go down to an incubation center for a while and work on their project in a hyper-innovative environment, and funding is provided for that. We’ve run hackathons where we invite people to work on a number of business challenges for us. Those are just a couple examples. What do you think your industry will look like in 10 years? As I said before, I think the energy industry is a couple years behind the telco industry, and I think the telco industry is going through fundamental changes at the moment. It’s moving very rapidly; we’re seeing complete disintermediation of the traditional value chain, we have a growing number of disruptive players, and I think it’s becoming less about technology. Technology now is just an enabler, and it’s so much more about customer experience, the brand, etc. I heard someone say something recently that really resonated with me, \"Customers don’t buy products anymore, they buy from brands.\" And I really think that’s so true. In the energy industry we have a bunch of challenges. Aside from the mega-challenge of decarbonization, I think the biggest challenge for us is remaining relevant to our customers. Energy is a commodity item, so it’s very hard to differentiate on electricity and power supply. In ten years’ time, unless we crack that challenge of remaining relevant to our customers, there’s a very big risk for the industry, which is primarily around the supply of energy. But there are a number of scenarios. There’s an extreme scenario, where we’ve become completely irrelevant, and customers are generating their own electricity through solar and wind, and then peer-to-peer sharing of energy. In that kind of extreme scenario, we’re completely disintermediated. And then there’s the other end of the scale where we do remain relevant, and customers continue to buy their energy from us and trust us. Where we’re giving them premium service with tariffs that suit their energy usage, they’re using less of our product and we’re contributing to decarbonization objectives, and we’re rolling out new technology and products that help customers in their daily lives."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/joeyisa"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Mar 27, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"ca2347046203fedda97d49ceda58896d3a1e9ab3"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["In Her Talk on Mothers, Andrea Dibben Considers the Pressures They Face"],"Title":["The Rules of Motherhood"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/keynote/talk-on-mothers","Text":["Andrea Dibben, a civil rights activist and lawyer, begins her talk on mothers by acknowledging a statement made by Kate Middleton regarding her struggles with the adjustments that having a baby brought.

Wapnick herself is a multipotentialite, explaining that when she was younger she would get incredibly interested in a certain subject, dive into it and gain skills, but then become bored and eventually drop it. This cycle would continually repeat itself, and it led to anxiety for her, as she worried that she had trouble committing or wouldn't be able to make a career.

Other brands opted for a more humorous approach, such as the New York coffee shop that filled its interior with motorized chairs and surprised its guests with an impromptu race to promote Amazon's motoring series, 'The Grand Tour.' Personalization played a key factor in these stunts, which was exemplified through Heineken's creative attempt to compete with microbreweries, by offering young tourists a personal beer, branded with their name on it. While most of the stunts had a small-scale impact, others aimed to gain global attention, like Samsung's promotion of its Galaxy 8 phone, in which it transformed Ireland's Samuel Beckett Bridge into a real, functional harp.

While not yet changing enough to halt the constant progression of climate change, industries are becoming increasingly aware of their impact on the environment and the need to adopt ideas and innovations that will reduce this impact. Some of the more prominent themes associated with this trend exist in the form of sustainable architecture and the slow but progressing transformations of industries that have a particularly strong negative impact on the environment. 'Passive House' is a voluntary standard for energy efficiency in buildings, and an increasing number of architects are using this measure when creating homes to be more friendly to the environment. The company BC Passive House takes this one step further – it not only provides prefabricated panels for houses built using this standard, it also employs the standards in its own factory. As consumers become more focused on lessening their personal environmental impact, the term \"fast fashion\" is slowly becoming a bad word among those who understand its consequences on the environment. Fast fashion companies are taking note of this fact and are slowly beginning to incorporate more eco-friendly practices into their business models. An example of this exists in Urban Outfitters' limited edition 'Rework' collection – which features clothes made from scrap fabrics. While the fast fashion industry will never be truly environmentally friendly due to its very definition, its attempts at becoming so indicate a significant shift in consumers' priorities and values. There are many ways in which eco-friendly practices can be incorporated into brands' and companies' business models, whether it is in their production processes or in the causes they financially support. Trend Hunter's annual conference Future Festival offers insights in how to harness ideas that can range across industries, a tool that could be particularly useful in companies' goals to lessen their environmental impact."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/MishalO"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Jan 30, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"09873ae741974d93d30c21442ecd420e2ce773bb"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["These Framed LEGO Characters Match the Owner's Appearance"],"Title":["Personalized LEGO Figurines"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/personalized-lego","Text":["These personalized LEGO figurines take after the person that orders them.

Japanese tea houses have long been exemplars of modern design and minimalism – since long before those styles came into the sudden rush of popularity that they see now. Even so, the traditional designs have been made even more contemporary by people like Mimi Jung, who recreated the architecture in cylindrical form. The private space functions as a sanctuary for those who use it, and fuses the Japanese tea house concept with a reinterpreted modern style. Although modernity and the safekeeping of the environment tend to be directly opposed to one another, this is slowly becoming a fact that brands are hoping to avoid.

The advent of virtual reality has allowed for more advanced technologies to be developed, which in turn allows toy makers to develop products with virtual components. Integrating readily available technology into tried and tested play formats is the natural trajectory of social advancement. This can be seen with Nerf's dart-deploying drones. By placing a camera into the dart projector and adding a remote controller, kids can feel as though they are exploring Mars while looking for aliens. It is a simple technology, but one with big impact when modified for a toy. As ideas are adapted and translated, more and more people become exposed to an idea and become inspired to take it further. Epson's virtual drone playground is a great example of this. When the Epson Moverio AR glasses were released, there was little function attached to them until the technology was combined with EdgyBees virtual games. As a child, being able to experience something virtually (especially when it can be experienced with others) can encourage imagination and playfulness. These VR toy innovations illustrate, that by combining imagination and virtual reality, learning and play opportunities can be limitless."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/Mary.Puymbroeck"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Jul 12, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"fe277b2e6c432482b344332669d779887eecb50a"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["From Image-Stabilizing Smartphones to Wearable VR Cameras"],"Title":["Top 100 Photography Tech Trends in 2016"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/slideshow/2016-photography-trends","Text":["Shutterbugs have a lot of options these days, as these 2016 photography trends illustrate.

In the field of pure aesthetics, tattoos reigned supreme in 2016. More than any simple design, though, the tattoo trends of 2016 show artists' (and their canvasses') desires to try new things. Chester Lee's blackout tattoo designs, for example, cover huge tracts of his subjects' bodies in pure black ink. On the more functional side of the continuum, architecture trends have centered around eco-friendliness. Whether it's ArchiBlox's house designed with an earthen berm roof or the solar powered ZED Pods, architecture is looking to provide functional and sustainable housing that is still attractively designed."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/joeyisa"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Jan 29, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"2ce48dcc30e21016eb8f98b3b85cf70472214c3f"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["From Personalized Backyard Pods to Conscientious Wooden Furniture"],"Title":["Top 100 Eco Trends in 2015"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/slideshow/2015-eco-trends","Text":["The top 2015 eco trends reveal emerging innovations in transportation, entertainment and dining that consumers are using to adopt a sustainable lifestyle.

While downsizing to a tiny house is a rather drastic way to adopt a sustainable lifestyle, many consumers are also embracing urban gardening through kits and indoor plant gardens. Features from plant pots and gardens are also being worked into furniture in order to create more harmony between interiors, furniture and the outdoors.

Trend Hunter's 2017 Trend Report features many different media and marketing-related ideas and innovations that are up-and-coming for the new year. Brands are now slowly beginning to cater to the demands of the general population that models should be more representative of different body types, rather than one specific idealized image that most women are unable to achieve. The 'Body Brigade' issue of 'Ebony Magazine' is one example of the growing representation of various body types, with the magazine specifically emphasizing the role of women of color in promoting and spreading positive body self-image in women and girls. For many years, the media was highly stereotypical in the way it represented and targeted different groups – but now brands are using subversive humor and even parodying themselves in order to market to their target audiences. One such example is the parody ad that the marketing company 'Cossette' created, with the self-proclaimed \"super ad\" poking fun of stereotypical commercial formulas and applying the concept into a humorous, universal ad."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/MishalO"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Jan 30, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"f51e32d03a19932e20af270c7f2768dacac7ecde"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["The New Chuck Taylor All Star His Have a Vibrant Summery Design"],"Title":["Classic Rainbow Sneakers"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/rainbow-sneaker","Text":["To celebrate the change of season, Converse released a new adaptation of its classic Chuck Taylor All Star His, resulting in eye-catching rainbow sneakers.

Some of the more apparent trends that could be observed this year were brands that captured attention through aggressive, humorous or subversive messaging, and brands curating identities that promoted their causes and strengthened client relationships. The 'Whiskey River Soap Co.' provides an excellent example of how to effectively market a relatively standard product to Millennials and Gen Z, who do not appreciate the typical marketing techniques that worked on previous generations. Rather than touting and exaggerating the excellence of its soap products, the company instead features labels with dramatic and sarcastic comments – all of which feature a style of humor that younger consumers can relate to. Those looking for more ideas to target these influential demographics can attend Trend Hunter's annual innovation conference Future Festival, which will be taking place in seven cities in 2017 and will discuss how to market to Gen Z and Millennials – among other topics. Brands are increasingly choosing to strengthen their relationships with clients and prospects by providing them with personalized gifts that build connections while simultaneously promoting the brand's purpose or abilities. One such example is the property developer 'Noble Development,' which offers snacks to its clients that all come in unique architectural shapes. This effectively promotes the firm's skills while keeping it at the top of its clients' and prospects' minds."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/MishalO"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Jan 28, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"f3b69b256a70867fd88624ab2301433407fb8e8d"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["This Mind-Blowing House Was Built in Just 10 Days Using a 3D Printer"],"Title":["Inexpensive 3D-Printed Villas"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/3d-printed-villa","Text":["This 3D-printed villa is altering everything we know about home building materials, timelines and most importantly, price tags.

As presentations at our innovation conference show, though, every demographic has its own products and interests. Of all the 2016 life stage trends for children, a few areas are most common. Toys, of course, are always popular with kids, and many new and inventive toys popped up in 2016. Fortunately, many toy makers focused on combining education with fun; the Airblocks drone kit lets kids build a drone to their own specifications, and Osmo's 'Pizza Co.' game teaches about financial responsibility. Other demographics were still represented in the 2016 life stage trends. The Neat app is a financial tool designed for Millennials, and White Hot Hair is a hair coloring product that embraces graying."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/joeyisa"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Jan 28, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"4ca7f8707bd05e336cbeb9ee1f6e8b053f6f9edc"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["This Photo Series Contrasts Negative Images with Cosmic-Colored Overlays"],"Title":["Cosmic-Colored Portraits"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/colored-overlays","Text":["These stunning portraits created by Hungarian artist Dàniel Taylor combine negative film with cosmic-colored overlays.

One of the more prominent trends that could be observed this past year was brands taking advantage of bus shelters to engage and interact with consumers. One such example is the 'Made to Move' campaign by the brand 'Lucozade' – which sells sports drinks. The campaign featured a bus shelter with a 'Wait Training' program that encouraged commuters to exercise along with the video that is featured – with participants receiving a sports drink at the end. The unique campaign worked to engage consumers, improved brand perception and worked towards a good cause – promoting health and fitness. Trend Hunter's 2017 Trend Report is packed with ideas and innovations that are related to engaging modern day consumers in similar ways. As this past year has been one of great change and upheaval, it is unsurprising that brands, charities and individuals would take the time to promote good causes on widely seen marketing platforms such as billboards. An example of this is the anti-homophobia billboard by the non-profit 'Planting Peace,' – which reveals an image of the politicians Donald Trump and Ted Cruz kissing along with the quote \"Love Trumps Hate\" – now a war cry of sorts for anti-Trump protesters and pro-Hillary and Bernie supporters."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/MishalO"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Jan 30, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"005607f47ceee45e1058b668c4f7197305adb0b0"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["This Novelty Playhouse is Built to Resemble a Casual Restaurant"],"Title":["Diner-Inspired Playhouses"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/novelty-playhouse","Text":["Posh Tots is a luxe furniture retailer that specializes in children's furniture and novelty playhouses like this one that draws inspiration from retro diners.

Some of the more prominent patterns that can be observed this year include the fusion of the Internet with more traditional entertainment platforms, as well as brands harnessing their power to exert more influence while marketing. Now more than ever, people take to various online platforms when they're looking to discuss traditional forms of entertainment like books and TV shows. Brands are taking advantage of this fact, with one such example being ABC's recent announcement that its show 'The Bachelor' will have a fantasy league for its upcoming series. The league will allow users to bet on who will win the show, as well as various challenges each episode. With this announcement, ABC has revealed itself to have recognized that much of The Bachelor's popularity in recent years has rested in its virality potential – and the brand is taking advantage of that fact. One of the more expansive ways that brands are harnessing the power of the Internet is by using data-driven platforms that inform their research and work. 'Ivvi' is an example of this, with the predictive marketing platform giving brands the opportunity to identify influencers and viral videos in ways that are quick and strategic – allowing its clients to get ahead of the game in capitalizing on what will soon be popular. Trend Hunter's annual innovation conference Future Festival provides attendees with valuable information on how to harness the power of the Internet and what's popular in a way that allows brands to stay relevant."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/MishalO"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Jan 15, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"86fd0debfddac51f00bbdb19f11271c76d6efb86"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["From Awareness-Raising Photography to DIY Wooden Beehives"],"Title":["Top 100 Social Good Trends in 2016"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/slideshow/2016-social-good-trends","Text":["The 2016 social good trends are vast in their scope, with the power of photography never failing to raise awareness, and brands giving consumers platforms to help the environment themselves. Photography has long been a medium that exposed the many horrific conditions that people around the world have to endure, and the photographer Johnny Miller captured some of the most revealing and poignant imagery of this year. Miller took drone photos of some of South Africa's landscapes, revealing the stark divide between the wealthy and the poor in the country – which is a divide that exists in racial terms as well. With nothing but a series of photos, the photographer was able to capture what political commentators, South African civilians and theorists all conclude – that despite the technical end of apartheid, inequality in the country sadly remains extremely pervasive. With many consumers seeking to lessen their impact on the environment, some brands are offering them a platform to do this from home. An example of this is the 'Bee Project,' which offers homeowners wooden boxes that they can easily construct beehives from. The project is crucial in a time where the bee population is significantly decreasing, with devastating environmental consequences.

Some of the more prominent forms of humor came in response to politics, as well as novelty stores and services. With this year's American election, there were times when only humor could keep people distracted. Brands have decided to take advantage of the election season to promote their own causes, and are using humor to do this. 'Nurx,' is one such example, with the company offering free birth control for women who use the code 'DonaldTrump' on their site. The promotion is in direct response to the president-elect's stances on women's reproductive rights, and the promotional image itself uses an image that features Donald's face over the Grinch as he steals birth control from a stocking. The 'Poop Cafe Dessert Bar' is an excrement-themed restaurant that uses humor in order to capture the attention of consumers. The Toronto-based cafe works to use a controversial, \"shock\" theme that is likely to elicit disgust in some, but laughs in many others.

Trend Hunter's 2017 Trend Report is available for free and explores other distinct and creative trends. One example is the coaster design that Laura Kaesshaefer came up with. The coasters are extremely simple to make, as they only require being cut out of leather sheets and then decorated as the user chooses. The simple concept offers a functional item in the home that people of all ages can create. Another example of simple yet luxurious trends taking over DIY exists in the luxury notebooks created by Teri Muncey.

Toronto’s Fermentations helps amateur brewers get started by equipping them with the tools and knowledge necessary to produce their very own beer, cider or wine. Fermentations is an onsite brewing facility located on the Danforth. The shop is staffed by a highly knowledgeable team that can help customers select ingredients, create custom flavors and even whip up a clone of their drink. The process is completely customizable, meaning customers can create just about any beer or wine imaginable. In fact, Fermentations offers more than 100 different wines and over 35 types of beer so that customers can enjoy everything from their favorite Cabernet Sauvignon to a batch of authentic Czech-style pilsners. However, what makes Fermentations truly unique is that the business is always on the cutting-edge of innovation when it comes to DIY brewing. For instance, Fermentations recently developed its own Grapemasters brand, which consists of real grapes sourced from some of the top vineyards from around the world. The grapes are selected by award-winning vintner and consulting winemaker Charles Fajgenbaum, who has been responsible for sourcing and selecting the grapes that have won top-honors at both American and Canadian competitions. The brand was developed in response to a dissatisfaction with the quality of product available through typical supply channels and has already proven to be a hit among customers in Toronto. In fact, the Grapemasters brand has become so popular that Fermentation’s has begun exporting the product to the United States as well. With the success of its Grapemasters brand and the growth of the make-your-own wine industry, Fermentations is working on launching a Wine School in the near future. The Grapemaster’s Wine School consists of hands-on classes that teach those in attendance how to construct the perfect wine based on an appreciation of grapes and the conditions they are grown in. To truly understand how to control wine from grape to barrel to bottle, attendees will learn about topics such as The Wines of Bordeaux, Chardonnays of the World and Getting a Doctorate in Zinfandel. Unlike other wine-oriented classes, the Grapemasters Wine School is designed to be highly accessible for groups and individuals who are simply looking to know more about wine. The sessions are conducted in conversational English – rather than scientific jargon – and they include hands-on elements that make the classes a truly immersive experience. In the end, attendees will not only be more confident in their wine knowledge, but they will also have the skills to coax exceptional flavors out of high-quality grapes. For those who want to fill their cellar with custom wines and those who are simply looking to experiment with their favorite pint, Fermentations provides a fun and accessible way to explore the world of home-brewing."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/katherine.pendrill"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Oct 1, 2016"],"_cached_page_id":"a653959f9a5dc2ac2a12adede5bec0f037acbd02"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["'The Armor of Light' Could Be Viewed by NRA Members for Free"],"Title":["Complimentary Documentary Incentives"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/the-armor-of-light","Text":["'The Armor of Light' is a documentary that shares the spiritual awakening of evangelical minister Rob Schenck, his transformation and newfound mission to stop gun violence across America.

As well as boasting mess-free designs, these products have the potential to reduce packaging waste and prolong the period for which they are useful. As a leader in package-free, handmade bath and body products, Lush Cosmetics offers a range of unique personal care products.

Indeed, as parents lead increasingly busy lives, these new products help to encourage creativity, while simultaneously taking the hassle out of playtime cleanup. One of the most interesting ways that toy manufacturers are making toys easier to clean-up is by leveraging digital interfaces. For example, Boogie Boards allow children to virtually doodle on a transparent, app-enabled surface. Another example is the JouJou Cube Touch, which uses digital stamps to encourage creative play with different tablet-based games. Beyond digital technology, the shift towards mess-free toys for children has also seen a rise in alternative art supplies. This means that instead of crayons, markers and finger paints, children can now unleash their creativity with materials that are easy to clean. Some examples of synthetic art supplies include a fake snow-like material that won't stick to carpets or surfaces, press-on glitter made with a mess-free adhesive and bath-specific paints that easily wash away with water."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/katherine.pendrill"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Mar 22, 2016"],"_cached_page_id":"bc5681a67063c52f7a4e74d186d270537b93d02f"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["Meridian 105 Architects' Weave Housing is Inspired by the Loom"],"Title":["Plaited Prefab Apartments"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/weave-housing","Text":["Weave Housing is a unique prefabricated apartment complex that is inspired by the idea of a weaving loom.

Many companies have emerged to meet this demand and provide women with underwear that meets their needs. One of the biggest changes in the lingerie industry has been an attempt to accommodate different body types. Several brands have sought to cater to different body types by designing garments for those who cannot purchase standard sizes. For example, there are companies producing ultra-supportive bras for busty women, as well as brands who specialize in making undergarments for women who are on the smaller side. In addition to offering a greater range of sizes, underwear brands have also sought to cater to consumers who are largely ignored by mainstream retailers.

The recent explosion of unicorn-inspired products has taken over the mainstream in a wave of glitter and rainbows. Products from clothing to bagels to gin all have unicorn iterations now on the market. When unpacking why this theme has taken over mainstream culture, it's not difficult to find its roots. Unicorns have long had a presence in mainstream culture. Unicorn folklore had a distinct presence in the Middle Ages, but with very different imagery. Unicorns as they are imaged today held a strong social presence in the 1980s and 90s television show 'My Little Pony.' Having reached peak popularity in the early 1990s, My Little Pony still holds a huge role in the Millennial subconsciousness; unicorn-inspired products remind Millennials of their childhoods and bring them some degree of happiness.

As a result, customers can choose which stage of their pregnancy they are at and a monthly box will arrive with products tailored to their exact needs. With options for women at every stage of the fertility cycle, BINTO is a great choice for new and not-so-new moms alike."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/katherine.pendrill"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Jun 7, 2017"],"_cached_page_id":"fcdbd52453852f73b1f8aeae1538d45f469e921b"},{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["Ubitricity's Car Charging Stations Transform Exiting Lamp Posts"],"Title":["Retrofit Electric Vehicle Chargers"],"url":"https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/car-charging-stations","Text":["Based in Berlin, Germany, startup Ubitricity is retrofitting lamp posts into electric car charging stations.

Rather than creating additional charging stations at a high cost, Ubitricity estimates 2% of Germany's existing lamp posts could accommodate their system, while also still providing light to the area. Their more cost-effective solution is the result of a collaboration with American manufacturer Tyco French utility provider EDF and German provider Grundgun.

This not only refers to fans who attend concerts and festivals, but also those at home who are looking for a way to enjoy the experience remotely. When it comes to live music, one of the ways musicians are connecting with fans is through social media. For example, Ed Sheeran asked fans to take live video of his concert and then share it online to create fan-produced music videos. In contrast, Air Miles offered reserved ticket access and special surprises for members who follow specific artists on social media. In addition to helping artists connect with fans at events, technology is also being used to create interactive concert experiences for those at home. For instance, Icona Pop used Samsung's new technology to provide fans at home with a 360-degree digital concert.

One approach that several brands have opted for is minimalist, gallery-style displays. Particularly popular among millennials, these scaled-back retail displays allow each product to speak for itself. One excellent example of this approach is the Ölmühle an der Havel store in Berlin, which displays curated products such as tea and coffee in a showroom-style space. However, the minimalist approach is not the only way that brands are reconceptualizing modern coffee merchandising. Another popular approach is to combine coffee with other lifestyle products such as dishware, art and even clothing.
